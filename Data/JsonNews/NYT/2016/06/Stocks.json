{"Headline": "Turbulence and Uncertainty for the Market After \u2018Brexit\u2019", "Date": "2016-06-23", "News": "Supported byLONDON \u2014 No one really knows what happens now. The collective imagination leads to dark places.Of most immediate consequence, Britain\u2019s vote to leave Europe sent global markets on a wild descent. Investors gaped at this major refashioning of the global landscape and decided it looked perilous \u2014 or at least so pockmarked with uncertainty that they preferred to pull their money out of riskier corners like stock markets.But no one knows enough to rule that out, either. The world has never been here before.The pound plummeted, reaching depths not seen since 1985 \u2014 well below the value at the worst of the 2008 financial crisis. The euro dropped.Investors, policy makers and countries face a messy breakup with vast financial, economic and political implications.From Tokyo to London to New York, stocks tumbled sharply on Friday, as markets digested the changing world order. American shares were down 3.6 percent. The Dow Jones industrial average sank 611 points, its biggest drop since August.British stocks were off 3.2 percent, while broader European shares dropped 8.6 percent.Investors took refuge in the safest investments, bolstering the value of American government debt and the Japanese currency.Less than an hour after the markets opened in London, Mark J. Carney, the governor of the Bank of England, stood in front of television cameras to announce that the central bank had earmarked 250 billion pounds, about $344 billion, to unleash as needed for stability. Stock markets took some solace, paring back their losses for the day.Whatever happens, a long, confusing period now unfolding seems certain to yank Europe back into acute anxiety just as it seemed to be finally recovering from a punishing economic downturn, one that had thrust Greece and Spain into veritable depressions while erasing years of wealth across the Continent.The vote to leave, a so-called Brexit, raised the prospect of sustained anxiety in the global economy as investors struggle to surmise what is happening.China, the world\u2019s second-largest economy, behind that of the United States, is slowing significantly, and the markets have little faith in the data provided by its Communist Party government. Brazil, once a darling among emerging markets, is in full-blown crisis. Europe and its common market, home to 500 million people, have been plunged into turmoil, their prospects difficult to divine.Markets crave known facts and fret about variables, seeing potential risks in all unknowns. An enormous portion of the map is now draped in uncertainty, effectively impervious to calculation.The vote appears likely to prompt multinational banks to shift significant numbers of jobs from Britain to competing financial centers in the European Union, led by Paris, Frankfurt, Dublin and Amsterdam. Many experts assume Brussels will move quickly to restrict trading of euro-denominated assets \u2014 a major business for Britain. Prominent banks including JPMorgan Chase and Citigroup warned during the campaign that an exit would cause them to transfer some operations elsewhere.As investors pulled back in fear on Friday, entrusting their money only to the safest places like United States Treasuries, the moves appeared to foreshadow a tightening of credit for many. Emerging markets may find it difficult to secure investment, limiting economic growth. Borrowing costs are likely to rise in heavily indebted nations, including Greece, Italy and Portugal, as investors demand extra inducements to put their money in riskier locales.The Bank of England may have to raise interest rates to halt a plunge in the pound, the opposite from the usual playbook when an economy suffers a shock.Most broadly, the vote is likely to resonate as a sign that major democracies are increasingly vulnerable to the influence of populist political movements that curry favor by demonizing immigrants and external forces such as officials in Brussels and Washington, low-wage workers in China and Mexico.The noisy and acrimonious campaign over leaving the bloc played on inchoate fears in Europe and much of the developed world: dismay over globalization at a time of intensified competition for jobs, and angst over immigration as it refashions conceptions of national identity. Those sentiments will surely find additional avenues for expression, challenging trade arrangements, reinvigorating existential questions about the shared euro currency and sowing uncertainty throughout the financial realm.Economists and political analysts have been watching the campaign as a gauge of the potency of anti-immigrant sentiments far beyond Britain. The success of the movement to leave the bloc is likely to resonate in financial markets as cause to assume a higher probability that Donald J. Trump will be elected president of the United States, riding his pledges to bar Muslim immigrants and erect a wall along the Mexican border.Given Mr. Trump\u2019s talk of renouncing trade agreements and renegotiating the terms of American debt, investors are likely to take rising odds of his election as impetus to limit their exposure to risk, eschewing stock markets and plowing funds into the safest forms of government debt.The vote in Britain was \u201cessentially against economic rationality and driven by identity concerns and unease about globalization and trade,\u201d said Nicolas V\u00e9ron, a senior fellow at Bruegel, an independent research institution in Brussels. \u201cIf such a vote can win in the U.K., that fosters among investors a sense of the likelihood that Trump can also win, and that will have an adverse effect on capital markets.\u201dNot least, the vote unleashes considerable forces of uncertainty.Though the vote changes nothing for at least two years, it kicks off what are certain to be complex and politically fraught negotiations between Britain and the 27 remaining members of the European Union over their future dealings.Central to these talks is the future of Europe\u2019s common market, which allows goods and services to be traded freely throughout its vast territory. Given that Britain sells almost half of its exports in the common market, and given that many multinational companies have forged bases in Britain as a means of serving customers across the Continent, any impediment is likely to be expensive.Disruption to trade was a major assumption in many academic studies released during the campaign that almost universally forecast substantial and potentially lasting damage to the British economy should Britain opt to leave Europe.The British government formally notified the European Union on March 29 that it intends to withdraw from the bloc.During the campaign, those supporting an exit emphasized that Britain would remain in the common market during the negotiating period. They assured voters that Britain would strike a more beneficial trade deal.But prominent leaders \u2014 not least, Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany \u2014 warned that a jilted European Union would be in no mood to extend Britain a rewarding deal, lest other malcontent members take encouragement to go for the exits.If no deal is struck, the rules of the World Trade Organization could apply. They give member nations the rights to impose potentially steep tariffs on imports, raising the possibility of a tit-for-tat trade skirmish between Britain and the Continent.In the meantime, the lack of clarity is likely to damage economic growth in Britain and beyond.\u201cYou get a rabbit-in-the-headlights phenomenon where businesses don\u2019t want to make new decisions, or new investments, because they are uncertain about the future,\u201d said John Van Reenen, director of the Center for Economic Performance at the London School of Economics. \u201cThe immediate effect will be a lowering of investment activity, a lowering of hiring. There will an immediate slowdown of growth.\u201dThe success of the campaign to leave deals a formidable blow to an already weakened European Union and heightens the likelihood that fresh separatist movements will emerge. Scotland will almost certainly seek to separate itself from Britain after a failed referendum two years ago. In the Netherlands, France, Hungary and Italy, the success of the campaign could increase the intensity of so-called euroskeptic parties.\u201cFor Europe, it raises the market\u2019s perception of breakup risk,\u201d said Adam S. Posen, a former member of the rate-setting committee at the Bank of England and now president of the Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington.If another euro crisis emerges, Europe may lack the political cohesion to address it. Further separatism could fragment the common market, bringing the demise of the six-decade-old project of European integration. Few now expect that to occur. But whatever the risks were before, Britain just increased them.\u201cAt some point, you wonder how many blows a body can take,\u201d Mr. Van Reenen said. \u201cI don\u2019t think this will happen, but there\u2019s this risk that everything will fall apart.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Five Illuminating Takeaways From Your Family Money Letters", "Date": "2016-06-24", "News": "Supported byYour MoneyI found the submissions insightful, hilarious and touching. The letters that arrived contained several illuminating one-liners about money\u2019s relationship to everything from sex to gambling that you may find useful as you try to impart insight to your own loved ones.But like Mr. Olivier, other letter writers also asked something of their recipients: To recognize and own the strong feelings we all have about money. To be patient, careful, fair and generous. To want more but not be greedy. To revel in doing things and care less about having things.Feel free to borrow liberally from the following writers when it comes time to write your own letter:Mr. Olivier, 55, acknowledged that he did get serious rather quickly when writing to his niece, who will attend the University of Louisiana at Lafayette. \u201cMoney and finances typically are wrapped up in a lot of emotions for everyone, and your views on these subjects have been shaped since you were born,\u201d he wrote.And they do so long before they have much technical knowledge of how to manage money responsibly. Schooled in feelings before finance, is it any wonder they sometimes make emotional decisions about how much to borrow for college or what to spend once they get there and get out?So what links these two powerful forces, exactly? \u201cMaybe because, like having sex, money represents success to a whole lot of people,\u201d Mr. Bohmfalk, who is now 68, said in an interview. \u201cAnd money has become a medium of measuring one\u2019s worth, like sex appeal.\u201dRoughly two decades later, both of his sons have had no problems that he knows of with sex or money, and they never had to move back home.Mr. Bohmfalk also mentioned some related words to live by that a physician friend passed on to him many years ago: One spouse, one house. \u201cSo many of our friends had a beach house or a lake house or an airplane and a divorce or two,\u201d he said. \u201cSuddenly, they were having to work until they dropped.\u201dMr. Bohmfalk, a former neurosurgeon who lives in Charlotte, N.C., retired from the practice of medicine on his 50th birthday.His family has successfully taken on real estate risk over the years, whether it was his relatives who were developers outside of Washington or the bet he and his wife made on a Manhattan apartment and then a Brooklyn house.They\u2019ve also bet on stocks. But they prefer the index funds that feel less like a spin of a roulette wheel than individual stocks do. Hannah Berman, Mr. Berman\u2019s elder daughter, says he\u2019s fond of telling a story about buying stock in Marvel, the comics company, as a young man. \u201cHe immediately lost everything,\u201d she said.Parent and other relatives pass on hard-won financial wisdom.Why put it that way? In an interview, he talked about all of the books and movies his daughters take in that make the case that money doesn\u2019t matter. Money is the root of all evil! Marry for love! Chase your dreams!But then much of the rest of the culture sends the exact opposite message. \u201cI was trying to find the sweet spot that acknowledges the wisdom of both of those perspectives,\u201d he said.Wanting a bit more prestige or a bigger office has been a positive in many situations he had witnessed. \u201cWe want our kids to be ambitious and do stuff,\u201d he told me.She turned to the letter format for a couple of reasons. When she was younger, no one talked to her much about money or wrote anything down, so she wanted to do better as a mother. Plus, the personal budgeting talks with her daughter, who lives with her in Bethalto, Ill., have not quite hit home yet.A written letter, however, has a chance of lasting. That is something that she values after her health scares over the years.\u201cI will probably frame it, because I want her to know that it is a keepsake,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I\u2019m probably not going to be there when she has kids of her own.\u201dTwitter: @ronlieberAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Cinnamon-Scented Soup to Break the Ramadan Fast", "Date": "2016-06-24", "News": "Supported byCity KitchenHarira is what happens to dried legumes \u2014 lentils, chickpeas, fava beans \u2014 when they are simmered slowly with onion, tomato and saffron, until the various components collapse into a delightfully spiced, velvet-textured whole. The soup is traditionally the first thing one eats to break the fast, every night, along with a few dates and beghrir ( sweet semolina pancakes). A large dinner follows, and then a large morning meal is eaten before sunrise, when fasting begins again.I have been making versions of that soup at home for years now. It is endlessly appealing, and variations, even in Morocco, are the norm, from house to house and region to region.Harira has a lot of things going for it: the soup tastes best a few hours, or even a day, after it is made, so cooking it in advance is ideal, and it\u2019s perfect for a crowd, so making a big pot of it makes sense. Last but not least, everyone loves it.Recipes for harira typically call for lamb (in some cases, chicken) but usually in rather minuscule quantities, say, a half pound for an entire pot, cut into small pieces. It is added more as a flavoring than to have meat in the soup. Some cooks add a lamb shank to the simmering pot, or a meaty lamb bone, or some use broth instead of water. .This, however, is a vegetarian harira, and no less satisfying.A combination of dried legumes gives this humble soup complexity. I used two types of lentil, red and brown. I sometimes use chickpeas as well, but because my spice man always stocks peeled dried fava beans, which disintegrate beautifully, I chose those.The whole point of harira is a creamy smoothness, so you want the lentils and favas completely soft. You can pur\u00e9e a jarful in a blender and add it back to the pot to help achieve the proper consistency: thick enough to eat with a spoon, yet thin enough to sip. (If you refrigerate the soup overnight, it may thicken significantly; thin it with a bit of water when reheating, and don\u2019t forget to adjust the salt.)But Moroccan cooks make harira throughout the year as well, often as a handy one pot meal. Consider yourself free to do so, too.cookingcookingAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Hedge Fund Managers Work to Stanch Loss of Investors", "Date": "2016-06-12", "News": "Supported byHedge fund titans once ran their firms like elite private clubs, picking who made it past the velvet rope and how much they would pay for access to supercharged performance.Some big-name investors \u2014 MetLife, American International Group and the New York City pension plan, among them \u2014 have recently begun to withdraw their money from hedge funds in larger numbers. And the investors who stay are getting a chance to sit at the negotiating table and dictate lower fees and better terms for sharing in the returns that managers make.It\u2019s an unusual position for many hedge fund managers, who as a group are not known for sharing well with others.Now, in a bid to persuade investors to stay, some managers are sweetening the deal by lowering fees in return for locking up investor money for a longer period of time and setting certain performance targets that if exceeded, investors would pay a fee. For newcomers, managers are even offering the favorable terms once exclusively offered to longtime loyal clients.\u201cManagers are having to negotiate, and investors are demanding much more than they used to in the absence of value,\u201d said Adam I. Taback, head of global alternative investments at Wells Fargo Investment Institute. \u201cHigh fees are like an expensive car,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is fine as long as you\u2019re getting performance out of it.\u201dIn recent years, investor criticism of hedge fund underperformance against a roaring stock market was met with frustration by managers who complained that investors couldn\u2019t have their cake and eat it, too. A hedge fund manager\u2019s job was to protect in down years but not outperform in good years, the industry argued. But when markets began to fall last summer, so did hedge fund returns, rendering the point moot for many investors.Over the last 18 months some of the best-known managers \u2014 including William A. Ackman of Pershing Square Capital Management and Larry Robbins of Glenview Capital Management \u2014 have consistently lost money. Others that made bets on macroeconomic trends were caught off guard by wrong-footed bets and had to shutter their firms.Valeant Pharmaceuticals International, for example, was one of the most popular stocks held by hedge funds in 2015, and its stock price soared to more than $260 a share at one point. But when news of a government investigation came to light and issues with the company\u2019s pricing strategy became apparent, the stock came crashing down. On Friday, Valeant\u2019s share closed at a low of $24.Mr. Ackman, who has been Valeant\u2019s biggest cheerleader, has lost billions of dollars so far on his bet on the company. His Pershing Square Holdings is down 17.5 percent so far this year through June 7, in large part because of the Valeant position.Other hedge fund titans including Paulson & Company and Viking Global Investors have collectively lost billions of dollars on the Valeant trade.\u201cI see the herd mentality among hedge funds every day,\u201d Roslyn Zhang, a managing director at China Investment Corporation, China\u2019s sovereign wealth fund, said at the SkyBridge Alternatives, or SALT, hedge fund conference in Las Vegas last month. Describing how some funds spend \u201ctwo seconds\u201d on one theme before deciding to put investor money behind the idea, she added: \u201cWe pay 2 and 20 for treatment like this. I am reflecting that maybe we are not making the right decision.\u201dAll of this has prompted some self-reflection within the industry.\u201cWe are in the first innings of a washout in hedge funds,\u201d Daniel S. Loeb, the founder of the hedge fund Third Point, wrote to investors in a recent letter, describing a \u201ccatastrophic period\u201d for the industry.Some insurance companies have shown their displeasure, too.\u201cWe had a very negative experience in hedge funds,\u201d Peter D. Hancock, the chief executive of A.I.G., told investors earlier this year. The insurance group plans to pull about half of its $11 billion in hedge fund holdings.MetLife, another insurance giant that has roughly $1.8 billion invested in hedge funds, has been sending out redemption requests to those managers. Steven Goulart, its chief investment officer, recently told shareholders that the exit was prompted by inconsistent performance. The market environment will \u201ccontinue to be challenging for hedge funds,\u201d he added.Investors pulled $15.1 billion from the industry in the first quarter of the year. But these exits are a drop in the ocean compared with the $2.9 trillion the industry manages. Other institutional investors, meanwhile, continue to pump money in.Still, the pressure is mounting.\u201cNow the fact that people are willing to cut, you\u2019re going to see pressure on managers who are not at the top of the pyramid are going to have to cut,\u201d said Mark W. Yusko, the chief investment officer of Morgan Creek Capital.In a move that is largely unheard-of in the industry, Mr. Robbins recently apologized to investors in an attempt to stem the outflow of investor money from his firm. He pledged to \u201cright the ship as quickly as possible\u201d and even offered investors the opportunity to put more money into a new fund that would waive fees.Mr. Robbins has continued to lose money this year. Investors in his flagship fund have lost 6.5 percent as of the end of May. So Mr. Robbins is now offering more favorable redemption terms, allowing existing investors that add more money into the fund to step into the shoes of investors that have left, according to three people briefed on the firm\u2019s plans who were not authorized to speak publicly about them.As long as performance continues to lag, hedge funds will be scrutinized and hedge fund giants will be at a disadvantage.David Rubenstein the billionaire co-founder of the private equity firm Carlyle Group, perhaps summed up the sentiment best when he told an audience of money managers at the SALT conference in May, \u201cPlease don\u2019t be embarrassed about the industry.\u201dIn case there was any hesitation, Mr. Rubenstein added: \u201cWe shouldn\u2019t be upset about what we do. We should be proud.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Sungevity, a Solar Panel Provider, to Go Public in Merger", "Date": "2016-06-29", "News": "Supported bySungevity, one of the leading national providers of rooftop solar panels, plans to merge with an asset management firm to become a publicly traded company, executives said Wednesday.The merger with Easterly Acquisition, which is expected to be approved later this year, would give Sungevity easier access to financing to help expand its business, with a goal of bringing solar panels to every house, said Andrew Birch, the solar company\u2019s co-founder and chief executive.Since its founding in 2007, the company has rapidly expanded, but its market share has lagged behind publicly traded competitors like SolarCity and Sunrun, according to data compiled by GTM Research, which tracks the solar industry. The deal with Easterly, which is putting about $200 million into Sungevity, is intended to bring more mutual funds and global institutional investors into the mix.\u201cSolar\u2019s now an economic proposition for tens of millions of homes across the markets that we serve, so the challenge for the industry now is, how do we scale?\u201d Mr. Birch said. The Easterly plan, he added, \u201cgives us access to the public market, and it gives us access to investors who are looking for exposure to that adoption curve.\u201dBut Sungevity\u2019s business model is simpler, requires less capital and should prove more appealing, said Darrell Crate, chairman of Easterly, which, in a similar transaction, created a publicly traded real estate investment trust that acquires, develops and manages government-leased properties.Sungevity \u2014 which operates in 13 states, Washington D.C. and Europe \u2014 focuses on using software to assess sites for solar and then to design, monitor and manage the systems and customer relationships. It relies on a network of partners to handle financing and installation, rather than using its own employees and equipment.\u201cPublic shareholders appreciate simplicity, transparency and clarity,\u201d Mr. Crate said. \u201cThe wisdom of making this a software-based, technology-enabled company allows them to scale and capture the revenue growth without having to grow head count at an equal rate.\u201dExecutives said they expected the merger to go through by the end of the year, when Mr. Birch said he anticipated his company would break even. On approval, Sungevity\u2019s outstanding equity and convertible debt will become shares of Easterly common stock, and Easterly will change its name to Sungevity Holdings.An earlier version of this article misstated the number of states in which the solar panel provider Sungevity operates.

Immigration may turn out to be that issue for the Brexit vote.Britain will hold a referendum on Thursday on whether to leave the European Union, a decision nicknamed \u201cBrexit.\u201dThe big question now is whether concerns about immigration will be strong enough for the \u201cout\u201d camp to win.Immigration may have more pull as an issue of sovereignty. Those who support Brexit believe that the European Union has taken too many powers from the British government. Britain must now abide by European Union rules that allow the union\u2019s citizens freedom of movement across the region. This generally prevents Britain from placing restrictions on legal immigration from nations in the European Union.By coming out of the union, it would regain that power. And taking that back might seem particularly important to those voters who fear that Britain will have to take in large numbers of refugees from the Middle East and North Africa who have fled to Europe.That is hardly the most reassuring prediction for those who want Britain to stay in the European Union.

{"Headline": "Uncertainty Over \u2018Brexit\u2019 Vote Damps I.P.O.s in London", "Date": "2016-06-20", "News": "Supported byLONDON \u2014 Britain has been one of the most active markets for initial public offerings in Europe in recent years as a flurry of companies have sought to list their shares in London \u2014 far outpacing the level of activity in Paris, Frankfurt and other European financial capitals.A vote by Britain to exit the European Union, however, could change all that, at least for the short term.Investors have been reluctant to invest in new London listings, and several companies have delayed announcing their intention to file until after the vote on Thursday.Uncertainty over the outcome of the vote has kept many in the market on the sidelines as the margins in the polls have seesawed between the \u201cleave\u201d and the \u201cremain\u201d camps in recent weeks.The most recent polls, however, pointed to growing support to stay in the European Union. On Monday, global stock markets rallied and the British pound strengthened against the dollar.Still, Edward Sankey, the co-head of equity capital markets for Europe, the Middle East and Africa at Deutsche Bank, said he expected little activity in new stocks for a while.British citizens will vote on whether their country should remain a member of the European Union. While a vote to leave would give Britain more autonomy, it could also create great economic uncertainty.\u201cIf there is an exit, a number of issuers will take time to figure out the market reaction before deciding to press ahead,\u201d he said.Bankers here say that several companies that had privately planned to go public have delayed their plans to list until after the outcome of the referendum, to avoid the uncertainty that can lead to wild swings in the financial markets and stock prices.Although the London market has had relative success \u2014 Jimmy Choo, WorldPay and Pets at Home are among its most notable listings in recent years \u2014 it has already been a challenging year for initial public offerings globally.Turbulent markets in the first quarter, driven in part by uncertainty about the Chinese economy, have weighed on I.P.O.s in Europe and around the world.\u201cBetween now and end of July, the pipeline is not huge,\u201d Tom Johnson, the co-head of Barclays\u2019 equity capital markets business for Europe, the Middle East and Africa, said. \u201cThere will be quite a few in the second half potentially. I think the second half will be materially larger.\u201dThe number of new listings in Europe this year is at its lowest level since 2013. There were 77 initial public offerings that generated $15.7 billion in proceeds in Europe through June 17, according to data from Thomson Reuters.That compared with 113 offerings that generated $32.7 billion in proceeds in Europe in the period last year and 113 offerings that generated $33.1 billion in proceeds in the region through June 17 in 2014, according to Thomson Reuters.London accounted for 34 percent of all listings and has been home to two of the top 10 biggest deals in Europe this year, in terms of proceeds.The five largest offerings this year, however, have all come in Continental Europe.The biggest listing this year, by far, was Dong Energy, the Danish utility and the world\u2019s largest offshore wind power operator.It generated about $2.6 billion in proceeds as the signature transaction in what has been a down year for initial public offerings in Europe and could stand as the biggest listing in the region this year.The offering on Nasdaq in Copenhagen valued Dong Energy at about $15 billion.The next three largest deals, in terms of proceeds, were the Dutch government\u2019s sale of a stake in the insurer ASR Nederland, the sale of the lighting business of the Dutch electronics giant Philips and GE Capital\u2019s sale of Moneta Money Bank, its former banking business in the Czech Republic.Moneta listed in Prague, while ASR and Philips Lighting had their offerings in Amsterdam.The biggest deal in Britain this year has been the spinoff of National Australia Bank\u2019s British unit, Clydesdale Bank. That transaction generated about $570 million in proceeds.Globally, the I.P.O. market remains well above the level where it was during the financial crisis as private equity firms exit investments they made in the years before the crisis.And privatizations by European governments and companies seeking to separate noncore businesses are expected to drive initial public offerings this year, but an uptick in activity might not come until the fall, no matter how Britain votes, financial industry experts say.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "After \u2018Brexit\u2019 Vote, Investors Are Gripped by a Panic Last Seen in 2008", "Date": "2016-06-24", "News": "Supported byLONDON \u2014 First came the shock. Then fear seized world markets. As frenzied selling accelerated in Tokyo, Hong Kong and London, unfathomable amounts of wealth vanished in a matter of hours.As economists pored over the rout like accident investigators dispatched to the scene of a crash, most offered assurances that a Lehman-style financial panic was not unfolding. In that debacle, investors indiscriminately fled all assets connected to the disastrous American housing bubble. Mortgages had been carved into exotic investments and peddled around the globe, meaning they lurked everywhere. Distrust spread like a virus.This time, the source of the trouble is both identifiable and relatively confined. Britain and the 27 remaining members of the European Union face significant uncertainty in their economic and financial dealings as they embark on complex divorce proceedings.Fears that drawn-out negotiations could disrupt trade prompted investors to push their money toward safety. As night fell in London, the British pound was down more than 7 percent. Stock markets plummeted around the globe; the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index closed down 3.6 percent in New York. London closed down a similar margin, and Tokyo surrendered more than 4 percent. Investors poured money into government bonds, seeking refuge.\u201cAs of now, this doesn\u2019t look like an end-of-the-world event,\u201d said Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, an independent research organization. \u201cIt looks bad, but it\u2019s not a cataclysmic game-changer similar to Lehman.\u201d Then he paused. \u201cYet.\u201dIn the best case, the plunge in markets represents an abrupt adjustment to the changing geography of global commerce. Britain has been diminished as a place for banking and business, and so the pound has lost some luster.In the worst case, investors have begun a fearful march away from risk, potentially starving emerging markets and stripping European countries of needed capital. It could last as long as the uncertainties dogging Europe \u2014 perhaps years.If recent traumas have clarified anything, it is the tendency for trouble to emerge unexpectedly. The global financial system is so intertwined that links can remain opaque.One key factor undergirds confidence that the so-called Brexit will not deliver Lehman-like troubles. In 2008, central banks on both sides of the Atlantic failed to recognize the mounting disaster. They failed to prepare adequate relief. While people may argue over the degree to which regulators have tamed the speculative excesses of finance, few dispute that improvements have been delivered.\u201cThe financial systems in the U.S. and Europe, including the U.K., are far more capitalized and less leveraged than they were in 2008,\u201d said Adam S. Posen, a former member of the rate-setting committee at the Bank of England and now president of the Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington. \u201cThe proclivity to panic in ways that create financial instability are much more limited.\u201dThe Bank of England and the European Central Bank have tools they can wield to defuse threats to banks. They can simply print money and lend it out as needed.Less than an hour after markets opened in London on Friday, Britain\u2019s central bank governor, Mark J. Carney, stood before television cameras and struck a resolute pose as he promised to do what it took to stabilize markets. He announced that he was prepared to unleash another \u00a3250 billion (about $370 billion) in pursuit of financial tranquillity.\u201cWe expect institutions to draw on this funding if and when appropriate,\u201d Mr. Carney said. \u201cThe bank will assess economic conditions and will consider any additional policy responses.\u201dThose words appeared to assuage fears, as the pound and stock prices both pared their losses.In recent years, the Federal Reserve in the United States, the Bank of England and the European Central Bank have subjected financial institutions to so-called stress tests. They regularly scrutinize banks\u2019 portfolios and the money they hold in reserve to make sure they can hold up in various outbreaks of trouble.Yet, these are academic exercises.\u201cThis is the real stress test,\u201d said Simon Johnson, a former chief economist at the International Monetary Fund and a professor at the MIT Sloan School of Management.The immediate run on stocks and currencies might yet grow into something worse, shaking consumer confidence and prompting households to limit their spending. As businesses lose profit opportunities, they are likely to put off investing and hiring.If that happens, it could create a spiral ending in recession, both in Britain and across Europe, adding to pressure on banks. The markets seemed to be warning of this possibility as they savaged the value of banking stocks on Friday.The greater the odds that the European Union will splinter, the more investors are likely to demand extra payouts for fresh loans to debt-saturated countries like Greece, Italy and Portugal. That could squeeze businesses there, making it harder for them to borrow, further crimping their economies.\u201cThat could then spread to the banks and go global, and that could smell like a Lehman,\u201d said Markus Schomer, chief economist for PineBridge Investments, a global asset management firm. He put very low odds on this \u201creferendum contagion\u201d case.If history is a guide, hedge funds, private equity and other realms of finance will also suffer. There, aggressive players borrow enormous sums of money to place outsize bets. Crises have previously revealed those taking on outsize risk. Long Term Capital Management, which borrowed heavily, appeared robust before losses in the Asian financial crisis of the late 1990s brought it to the verge of a collapse that threatened the broader financial system and required a private bailout.As the prominent investor Warren E. Buffett once put it, \u201cOnly when the tide goes out do you discover who\u2019s been swimming naked.\u201dThose who had been paying attention to the American housing crisis were hardly surprised when Lehman\u2019s afflictions burst into public view. Lenders had been writing mortgages to seemingly anyone in possession of a signature. Lehman had been repackaging these loans and selling them for vast profits.The surprise was that Lehman actually went bankrupt, exposing its trading partners to losses. By contrast, polls had suggested that Britain might really walk. This is a source of hope, given that central banks, governments and investors had more time to prepare.\u201cLehman came out of the blue,\u201d said John Van Reenen, director of the Center for Economic Performance at the London School of Economics. \u201cThis is like a train wreck where you can see the trains coming together for a long distance and you\u2019re hoping the trains will swerve away.\u201dBut any comfort in that is sapped by the fact that Britain, one of the oldest democracies on earth, put itself in this spot through an exercise of free will. Now, the world waits to see how far the pain spreads.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Pension Holders Need a New Retirement Plan, Not Stock Tips", "Date": "2016-06-21", "News": "Supported byHats off to the Obama administration for forcefully addressing the very real conflict between commission-based financial advisers and their clients. But the country\u2019s retirement problems are vast and require much more reform. In fact, we need a complete revamping of our pension arrangements.Once upon a time, many Americans enjoyed an employer-based, defined-benefit system in which they could depend on a no-hassle pension of a specified amount.But about two decades ago, faced with mounting costs and increased regulatory burdens, employers began replacing traditional plans with \u201cdefined contribution\u201d plans like 401(k)\u2019s.That created two immense problems. First, only about 10 percent of participants have been contributing the maximum amount allowable.More important, the move to defined-contribution plans turned every American with a retirement account into an investment manager \u2014 a tough business for even the savviest professionals.Last November, Goldman Sachs \u2014 an exceptional firm \u2014 issued six investment recommendations for 2016: buy stocks in large banks, sell yen and so forth. In early February, Goldman abandoned five of them, after huge losses in just a few short weeks.Nor are the Wall Street firms\u2019 records with individual stocks anything to brag about. In this year\u2019s first quarter, the stocks rated highest by analysts fell and the stocks rated lowest rose.If highly paid professionals often fail to deliver, the notion of amateurs trying to play the game is nuts. What sane person would try to rewire his house or take out her own appendix? And yet under our supposedly improved retirement system, Americans are encouraged to allocate their assets, evaluate mutual funds and even select individual stocks.It ain\u2019t working. In the first quarter of 2016, domestic mutual funds \u2014 a favorite investment vehicle for these retirement accounts despite their chronic underperformance \u2014 had their poorest showing in nearly two decades. Through June 15, the 20 most popular funds for 401(k) assets were up 0.6 percent so far in 2016, compared with 2.4 percent for the Standard & Poor\u2019s index.Then there\u2019s the folly of trying to time markets, a practice that smart investors like Warren Buffett eschew. Back in early February, when markets were plummeting, a friend told me she had moved a large account from stocks to a money-market fund. Sure enough, just a few days later, the market turned upward and recovered all its losses \u2014 while she recouped none of hers.Finally, even with reforms like the new Labor Department rule, the system is rigged against most individuals: As small investors, they pay higher fees and don\u2019t have access to the smartest advisers. As a professional investment manager, I\u2019m appalled at what I see happening to many friends.While we can\u2019t simply blow up the current system, we should take the smaller step of requiring companies (other than small businesses) to offer revamped 401(k)\u2019s, including mandatory contributions from employers and employees totaling at least 10 percent of wages annually.Those funds should be professionally managed by independent, multiemployer entities created for this purpose and structured to avoid the conflicts of interest inherent in our current system. (To minimize the burden on Americans who are already struggling, the program would be phased in.)Until we fix the broader mess, individuals should follow a few simple rules:\u2022 Try to save as much as possible of your income, ideally 10 percent to 15 percent.\u2022 Never, ever pick a stock or an actively managed mutual fund. Use only low-cost index funds.\u2022 Emphasize equities when you are young; fixed income as you get older. Better yet, consider target-date funds, which do this rebalancing for you.\u2022 If you have a good 401(k) plan and you change jobs, either leave it where it is or move it to your new employer; I.R.A.s should be your last choice. They often come with higher fees and at least until the new rule takes effect, bad advice.\u2022 Don\u2019t cash out early.As a nation, we indisputably face a retirement crisis. The one advantage of our current system is that we each have the ability not to make it worse.Steven Rattner is a Wall Street executive and a contributing opinion writer.Advertisement"}

Any winners and losers will be determined in the days and weeks after the vote.\u201cThere was a ton of cash on the sidelines,\u201d he added.Britain\u2019s vote to leave the European Union poses difficult questions for investment firms like Greylock, which made big bets on Greece as it teetered on the brink of economic collapse.

The last major episode of market turmoil, when Chinese stocks tumbled last summer, sent many hedge funds reeling.

A day after the referendum, he warned of the consequences of the Brexit vote.Mr. Cooperman, who cited optimistic figures about the \u201cremain\u201d vote, also sounded a cautious note when he spoke at a Youth INC charity event at the Metropolitan Club in Manhattan on Wednesday.\u201cI think Brexit is going to have a very negative impact on Europe if it happens,\u201d Mr. Cooperman told an audience of investment professionals.By Friday, he had adopted a darker view.\u201cMy friend at Microsoft was dead wrong, as was I,\u201d Mr. Cooperman said, referring to the source of his optimistic probability of Britain\u2019s voting to remain.\u201cThis, too, shall pass.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Are Financial Markets Too Complacent About the Global Economy?", "Date": "2016-06-15", "News": "Supported byEconomic TrendsThe latest polling suggests the British are inclined to drop out of the European Union, throwing the future of the world\u2019s largest trading bloc into doubt.The United States in November may elect a president who promises to abandon many norms of governance, and a horrendous terrorist attack has opened up new talk in the presidential race of upending the nation\u2019s longstanding economic and diplomatic relationships with the rest of the world.Oh, and last month the United States experienced its weakest job growth in six years.If there was a good time for financial markets to show signs of fear for global economic and political stability, this would seem to be it.In the last several days there has been some evidence, if you look carefully enough, of the risk that some big, disruptive events will become priced into markets. The British pound has fallen steeply on currency markets, reflecting the risk of \u201cBrexit,\u201d and government bond prices in advanced nations have soared (and their yields have fallen) as investors have plowed money into safe assets.But many other financial market conditions are more consistent with what you expect to see when everything is basically going fine \u2014 not indicative of a major risk of financial, economic or geopolitical upheaval.The American stock market, as measured by the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 index, is hovering just below record highs. A measure of expected market volatility, the Vix, has spiked in the last few days but remains well below its level of just a few months ago. Oil prices have been rising steadily since February and haven\u2019t moved much in the last week, let alone shown the drop you might expect if a collapse in global demand seemed imminent.There are two possibilities of what is going on. At best, the markets are telling us something important that excitable journalists and pundits aren\u2019t. Call this the markets-are-smart theory.At worst, markets are complacent, and deep-seated flaws in how financial markets work mean that current stock and commodity prices aren\u2019t reflecting the major risks that lie ahead.And even if any of those forecasts turns out to be wrong, the consequences for the economy and corporate profits won\u2019t be as severe as fearful headlines suggest. The British economy will remain basically sound as the nation renegotiates its trade relationships; Mr. Trump will govern more like a conventional president than his words now suggest; and any economic slump in the United States will be short and mild.In this story, stock, bond and currency traders have the wisdom to look past the noise that the aforementioned excitable journalists and pundits don\u2019t.The other argument is scarier.Markets are very good at incorporating news into asset prices when it\u2019s clear and straightforward how one should affect the other. When a company releases an earnings report, analysts can quickly figure out what it should mean for the stock price, and the stock moves accordingly. When data comes out that makes a Federal Reserve rate increase 10 percent more likely, it\u2019s fairly straightforward to translate that into the proper pricing of Treasury bonds and the dollar. A disruption to an oil pipeline has a relatively clear-cut impact on the price of crude.So traders are efficient at pricing in pieces of news that affect asset prices in predictable ways over the short and medium term. They\u2019re a lot worse at predicting which major threats to the global economy will spiral out of control and which will turn out to hardly matter.Consider two examples from recent years.In the summer and fall of 2011, investors were panicked that the eurozone would unravel because of the fiscal crisis that started in Greece. Global stock markets, commodities and risky forms of debt plummeted; volatility skyrocketed.But things turned out to be more or less fine. More aggressive action by the European Central Bank and European political leaders starting late that year helped calm everyone. And while the European economy is not in great shape, the Continent experienced no epic financial crisis. If you had the nerve to buy eurozone stocks in September 2011, you have enjoyed a 51 percent return on your money.Other times, instead of being too fearful of cataclysmic events, financial markets are too complacent. What we now call the global financial crisis got its start in mid-2007, as losses on mortgage-related securities mounted and global money markets froze up.But after some initial efforts by the Federal Reserve and other government officials to contain the damage, financial markets rallied 11 percent from mid-August through mid-October, pushing the stock market to new highs and suggesting all was well. Of course, as it turned out, a severe recession and catastrophic financial crisis were just around the corner. People who bought into any risky assets, whether stocks or mortgage-backed securities, at the October highs lost their shirts.Even if that\u2019s so, the next few months will be a great test of just how much markets really know about the future. And given the precarious headlines of the last few months, anyone who wants to make sure they don\u2019t lose their shirts again should hope that they\u2019ve got it right.Advertisement"}

To chasten defendants through means other than jail terms, modern judges have resorted to actions like forcing shoplifters to announce their crimes in newspaper advertisements, or making deadbeat fathers carry signs proclaiming their child-support delinquency.Ms. Connell\u2019s perceived sin was suing a boy who was a close relative, and who simply wanted to hug her. Among those in the Twitterati for whom nuance is a scarce commodity, she was cast as a woman who deserved nothing short of flogging.Reality was more complex. In 2011, Ms. Connell went to a birthday party in Connecticut for an 8-year-old cousin, Sean Tarala, who regarded her as an aunt. Excited to see her, the boy leapt into her arms. She was caught off balance and fell backward. With the boy\u2019s full weight on her, she landed badly, breaking her wrist so severely that she needed three operations and ran up $120,000 in medical bills.Ms. Connell\u2019s troubles were only beginning. When her relatives\u2019 homeowners insurance would not cover the bills, her lawyers felt her only recourse was to go to court and let a jury determine liability. Under Connecticut law, someone had to be named as a defendant. So she sued the person whose actions had led to the injury: Sean.Plainly, this was just a legal formality. The real target was the insurance company, not the boy. But that was too subtle a notion for many on social media. Vituperation poured down on Ms. Connell, including a suggestion that her other wrist should be broken \u2014 and maybe her legs, too. Tabloid headline writers labeled her \u201cthe Auntie-Christ.\u201d The fact that the woman and the boy had close bonds \u2014 Sean understood the tactical nature of the lawsuit \u2014 was ignored.In cyberspace, rage turned to glee when a jury rejected Ms. Connell\u2019s claim in October. By then, the hounding had hurt her professionally. A human resources consultant, she had difficulty finding work. \u201cPeople reached out and then canceled interviews, or then said, \u2018Oh, we\u2019ve changed our direction,\u2019 or you know, \u2018Mmm, we\u2019ve decided not to move forward,\u2019\u201d she told Retro Report.She had to \u201ctake certain measures,\u201d she said, \u201cin order to re-establish myself.\u201d They included altering her appearance in the hope that she might not be instantly recognized.So was Lindsey Stone, who lost her job helping people with learning disabilities. This was after Ms. Stone posed in 2012 for a photograph by a sign at Arlington National Cemetery. The photo, intended as a visual joke to be shared with friends, was in questionable taste, but was not born of malice. Nonetheless, after its posting on Facebook, the calls for her head were unforgiving.Once upon a time, miscreants subjected to public ridicule were pilloried for perhaps a few hours. In internet life, that can last forever. \u201cYou never escape it,\u201d Danielle Keats Citron said. She is a law professor at the University of Maryland and author of \u201cHate Crimes in Cyberspace\u201d (2014).\u201cWhen you post something really damaging, reputationally damaging, about someone online, it\u2019s searchable and seeable,\u201d she told Retro Report. \u201cAnd you can\u2019t erase it.\u201dDoes shame have a legitimate place in our lives? Mark Twain seemed to think so. \u201cMan is the only animal that blushes,\u201d Twain wrote in 1897.\u201cOr needs to,\u201d he added.She is not opposed to chastising individuals publicly, as long as the tactics are not abusive, but her preference is to call out governments and large organizations that behave badly. \u201cShaming is better used for the collective well-being,\u201d she said in an interview.Other modes of shaming keep arising. New York, for instance, is one of several cities requiring restaurants to post letter grades issued by the health department, and to display the ratings prominently in their front windows. This is intended as a guide for consumers. But what self-respecting restaurant owner wants to live with the disgrace of a poor grade in full view?Although Professor Jacquet sees benefits accruing from certain forms of finger-pointing, she also feels they can do only so much to improve bad behavior. \u201cIf shaming was the most efficient method, we wouldn\u2019t have harsher forms of punishment,\u201d she said.For one thing, the targets would have to be capable of feeling shame. All it takes is a glance at current politics to realize that some people are absolutely shameless.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "MSCI Delays Adding China Stock to Emerging Markets Benchmark", "Date": "2016-06-14", "News": "Supported bySHANGHAI \u2014 Chinese stocks had seemed poised to join an important global benchmark, paving the way for overseas money to pour into the country\u2019s markets.But the provider of the index, MSCI, decided that China was not yet ready, again holding off on adding mainland stocks to its influential emerging-markets benchmark.The decision, announced on Tuesday, was a blow not only to despondent local investors but for the Chinese government more broadly. For several years, China had been pushing hard to increase its sway in global financial markets, an effort that recently resulted in having its currency, the renminbi, included in the exclusive club of currencies at the International Monetary Fund.A year ago, China seemed close to having won over MSCI, whose remaining major concern was the difficulty for foreigners to buy and sell stocks in China, where the government has significant influence over markets.One stock market crash later, however, the government\u2019s grip has grown tighter.The extra money flowing into mainland stocks, or A shares, would have provided a much-needed boost. Despite the government intervention, Chinese stocks have been in a deep slump, off about 40 percent in the last 12 months.\u201cInternational institutional investors clearly indicated that they would like to see further improvements in the accessibility of the China A shares market before its inclusion in the MSCI Emerging Markets Index,\u201d Remy Briand, the global head of research at MSCI, said in a statement on Tuesday.MSCI said it would reconsider A shares for inclusion in 2017.The index provider\u2019s decision to delay for another year highlights persistent concerns among global investors about government meddling in local markets as well as the quality of regulation and company accounts.\u201cAccounting in China is a state secret,\u201d said Hugh Young, who oversees investments in Asia for Aberdeen, one of the world\u2019s largest emerging markets investors. \u201cOur money goes into companies, and we have had trouble finding the right ones to invest in.\u201dMost large investors get their China equity exposure by investing in large companies listed in Hong Kong or other overseas markets \u2014 like the internet giants Tencent and Alibaba \u2014 where companies must adhere to globally accepted financial rules and regulations. MSCI\u2019s weighing toward China was already 25 percent, the largest of all the countries it tracks; analysts were guessing that China\u2019s inclusion would add another 1 percent of Chinese exposure.MSCI said investors were also bothered by the stiff limits imposed on foreign investors withdrawing their funds from China.The verdict will do little to lift the mood in China\u2019s once bustling brokerage halls.On a recent afternoon inside a poorly lit trading hall near People\u2019s Park in Shanghai, a dozen or so elderly investors were chatting among themselves as the final minutes of another trading day ticked away.As the stock prices flashing on a bank of 21 LCD screens attested, the main Shanghai share index had staged a modest rally to recover from its earlier losses. But once again, the index had slumped back down into negative turf by the 3 p.m. close.\u201cIt\u2019s not about waiting it out, because if you try you will probably get wiped out,\u201d said Mr. Ye, a 62-year-old retiree who declined to give his full name when speaking critically about the government\u2019s stock market rescue efforts.\u201cIt is really painful,\u201d he added, estimating that most of the investors at the Shanghai trading hall had lost money over the past year. \u201cThis market isn\u2019t really regulated.\u201dThe MSCI decision speaks to the caution signs in the market.When the index company delayed its decision a year ago, mainland stocks were at their frothiest. They had more than doubled over the previous 12 months.At the time, the company said it was concerned about a number of restrictions in China. Certain rules made it challenging for global investors to move money in and out of the country, or even to prove with certainty their ownership of shares.Global investors also fretted about the curious ability of Chinese companies to stop trading in their stock whenever it seemed to suit their own needs. The practice stopped shares under pressure from falling further, but it did so by preventing investors from cashing out.With an eye on making the cut at MSCI, China sought to address these concerns in recent months.Last week, China said it would grant an initial renminbi-denominated investment quota to the United States, allowing American funds to purchase stocks worth as much as 250 billion renminbi, or $38 billion. American investors could previously buy into Chinese stocks through other methods, but the new quota provided significant direct access and ranked as the second-biggest of its kind under the renminbi program, after Hong Kong\u2019s.Still, efforts to improve market regulations may be cold comfort for ordinary Chinese investors who are still nursing losses from last year\u2019s stock market fallout.Mr. Tao, a 63-year-old retiree at the Shanghai brokerage who declined to give his first name because he spoke critically of the government\u2019s actions, said he used a bit of his monthly pension of 1,600 renminbi, or $243, to dabble in the stock market.Taking a break outside the brokerage to chat over a red Double Happiness cigarette, Mr. Tao said he was sitting on tidy profits until the market turned downward last June.Since then, his investments have given back more than 70 percent of those gains.\u201cIn investing, one misstep and you\u2019re nabbed,\u201d Mr. Tao said.He added that it could take years to recover his lost profits. \u201cNow I just want to wait it out,\u201d he said.Neil Gough reported from Shanghai and Landon Thomas Jr. from New York.Advertisement"}

Mr. Macri took office six months ago after a period of market isolation under the previous administration. Argentina had been cut off from global markets after a $100 billion debt default in 2001 and a long legal battle with hedge fund creditors that was resolved this year.Argentina\u2019s government returned to global bond markets in April, after a 15-year hiatus, with an issuance of $16.5 billion. Several of the nation\u2019s provinces have been raising money on these bond markets in recent weeks.Havanna, which makes alfajores, a sweet biscuit snack, and runs more than 300 coffee shops in Argentina and across Latin America, sold 4.27 million shares \u2014 10 percent of the company \u2014 at 37 pesos per share, valuing it at around $114.7 million.Demand doubled the number of shares offered, so they were priced at the top of the marketed range.\u201cThere was so much demand for this stock,\u201d said Emilio Ilac, chief executive of Puente, a brokerage firm in Buenos Aires that managed Havanna\u2019s sale. \u201cThis is very encouraging not only for Havanna, but for other companies who want to go public.\u201dDespite the small size of the offering, 17 percent of orders came from abroad, Mr. Ilac said.While initial price offerings from Argentina have been sporadic in recent years, Havanna is predicted to lead a fresh wave in the Buenos Aires Stock Exchange.Already, Grupo Supervielle \u2014 the holding company for Banco Supervielle, a bank \u2014 raised $280 million last month in an initial public offering in both New York and Buenos Aires. But Havanna\u2019s offering was the first entirely local equity offering since the oil company Petrolera Pampa\u2019s in 2013.Mr. Macri\u2019s government is dealing with an overhaul of the economy, including efforts to bolster growth, rein in inflation and narrow the fiscal deficit. But if policy makers face serious setbacks, analysts say, this would suppress investor demand in Argentina.\u201cSustaining this incipient interest in Argentine assets from financial markets depends on how the macro-economy evolves,\u201d said Gast\u00f3n Rossi, an economist at a consulting firm in Buenos Aires.An article on Tuesday about the initial public offering of Havanna, an Argentine confectioner and coffee shop chain, misstated the number of years ago that the last local initial public offering came to market in Argentina. It was nearly six years ago, not three. The error was repeated in the headline.Advertisement"}

Warm ocean waters suddenly teem with trillions of eggs and sperm that swirl in the currents and merge to form new life, a profligate frenzy that can leave the ocean\u2019s surface awash in pink flotsam.Globally, hundreds of species of coral engage in primordial rites of mass spawning tied to seasonally warming waters and the lunar cycle.Corals are giant colonies of tiny creatures. Each small animal has a central mouth and feeding tentacles, and secretes a stony substance around its base that binds the colony together. The reefs nurture a riot of marine species and fish stocks that feed millions of people.\u201cA big concern is the ability to recover from the severe bleaching events,\u201d said Emily Howells, a coral researcher at New York University who studies the reproductive cycle.The spectacular nature of the rite can make the research seem all the more urgent.

Surprisingly, given the diminished light and cooler temperatures, they have discovered that deep corals can also spawn as a group, at times in synchrony with their shallow kin.\u201cMany people thought mass spawns did not occur in many places,\u201d said Sally A. Keith, a coral ecologist at the University of Copenhagen. \u201cIt\u2019s amazing how little is known about such a large-scale phenomenon.\u201dAs often in romance, timing is everything. If corals shed their sex cells just minutes out of sync with neighbors, the odds of reproductive success are greatly reduced.David Doubilet/National Geographic CreativeSome researchers, divers and spectators have waited patiently for coral mingling that, at least during their visits, never materialized.For centuries, scientists thought that stony corals reproduced mainly by brooding offspring and bringing forth live young.Scientists speculated that the moon\u2019s phase was important in the ritual because it controlled the tides. But the tides during spawning events turned out to be low in some places and high in others, and scientists now say the moon most likely acts as a visual stimulus to the choreographed sex.How do eyeless creatures monitor the moon\u2019s phases and determine when the time is right to start mingling?David Doubilet/National Geographic CreativeThe breakthrough came after Oren Levy, a young Israeli scientist, traveled to Australia to study at the University of Queensland. Dr. Levy was fascinated by a class of photoreceptors known as cryptochromes. Originally found in plants, they had also been identified among insects and mammals. Dr. Levy wondered if corals might possess the complex molecules as well.Increasingly, scientists track how environmental changes can disturb the procreative dance. In papers in December and February, a team of Swiss and Australian scientists reported that sediment particles from dredging and other ocean disturbances can adhere to eggs and sperm, blocking their journey to the surface and reducing the odds of successful fertilization.Another recent finding concerns the central role of rising seasonal temperatures. Scientists tracking the rite globally have found that, in the Northern Hemisphere, the reproductive frenzy moves northward in a wave as springtime warmth starts to raise the temperature of normally cool ocean waters.With notable exceptions, the peak season of mass coral spawning seems to run from January to March in low latitudes, March to May in middle latitudes, and June to October in high latitudes.David Doubilet/National Geographic CreativeThe team focused its own research on the Gulf of Oman, a northern arm of the Arabian Sea. During 2013, the reproductive whirl began in April. But the next year, it started in May.Why the monthlong delay? The team reported that the average sea temperature at the study site before the 2014 event was cooler by 1.5 degrees Celsius, or 2.7 degrees Fahrenheit. The reproductive lag, the scientists reported, most likely arose from coral responding to \u201cthe optimal temperature window.\u201dIn the Florida Keys, at relatively high latitudes, the reefs tend to go into their reproductive phase in late summer.The prospective full moon this year is Aug. 18, and tentative forecasts for Key Largo point to late that month for the reproductive frenzy.\u201cI always breathe a sigh of relief when I make a prediction and the corals actually spawn,\u201d she said.It was roughly two decades ago when Ms. Hickerson first dived beneath the waves at Flower Garden Banks to witness a mass spawning. Despite seeing it many times, she said, she still finds herself getting caught up in the primal thrill.\u201cTo this day, I find myself screaming,\u201d she said. \u201cYou can\u2019t help it.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": null, "Date": "2016-06-27", "News": "Their concerns over the uncertain outlook are shared across the world.Moves like bond buying and lowering interest rates used to be seen as easy policy substitutes when governments did not take action themselves. But the recent sell-off is not the result of an event like the Lehman Brothers bankruptcy. When finance is hit by social and political crises, it becomes more awkward for central bankers to defend intervention. It is an acute concern for Britain, where, thanks to aggressive central bank policies, house prices have soared in London even as the inflation-adjusted average wage is still lower than it was before the financial crisis. It will take some time to determine the winners, but George Soros, known as the man who broke the Bank of England with a bet against the British pound in 1992, looked smart after taking long positions in gold through an exchange-traded fund. Whether he took any positions to profit from a vote for so-called Brexit is unclear. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAt this point in time, policy makers both in the U.K. and in Europe are holding that level of uncertainty in their hands, and how they come out in the next few days is really going to drive the direction in which risk will go,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said on Sunday.

{"Headline": "Andrew Caspersen, Charged in $40 Million Fraud, Had Gambling Addiction, Lawyer Says", "Date": "2016-06-14", "News": "Supported byFederal prosecutors claim that Andrew Caspersen ran a Ponzi-like scheme to defraud friends, family and a hedge fund foundation of nearly $40 million over an 18-month period.But on Tuesday, Mr. Caspersen\u2019s lawyer contended that his client, a former Wall Street executive with an Ivy League pedigree, was the victim of an uncontrollable gambling addiction that drove him for more than a decade. So gripping was Mr. Caspersen\u2019s addiction, the lawyer said, that he checked his phone throughout the day for updates on the stock market\u2019s direction and his \u201call in\u201d bearish bets that ran into tens of millions of dollars.Dressed in a black suit and pink tie at his arraignment in a Manhattan federal courtroom Tuesday afternoon, Mr. Caspersen, 39, told a judge that he had been treated for \u201ccompulsive gambling and mental health illness\u201d issues since his arrest in March.Mr. Caspersen appeared on Tuesday before Judge Jed S. Rakoff of Federal District Court and pleaded not guilty to a criminal document that included one count of securities fraud and one count of wire fraud. However, negotiations have been taking place for several weeks, and he is expected to plead guilty at a July 7 hearing.After the short proceeding, Mr. Caspersen\u2019s lawyer, Paul Shechtman, described him as \u201cremorseful and relieved.\u201d Mr. Caspersen has been cast as a man of privilege who took advantage of his social standing and professional position to fuel his trading addiction.\u201cHe had every intention of paying everyone back,\u201d Mr. Shechtman said. \u201cThis is a pathological gambling addiction.\u201dBefore his arrest, Mr. Caspersen was seen as a successful Wall Street executive with the right credentials and pedigree. He had attended the Groton School, Princeton and Harvard Law School, and had gone on to become an executive at the Park Hill Group, a division of PJT Partners.On Tuesday, Mr. Shechtman described Mr. Caspersen\u2019s addiction as having started with casino gambling and sports betting, and quickly turning into betting on the stock market while he was a student at Harvard Law. Mr. Caspersen\u2019s father and brothers all attended Harvard, where a student center at the law school is named for the family.Over the last decade, Mr. Caspersen squandered more than $20 million of his own money, including a family inheritance, Mr. Shechtman said, adding that Mr. Caspersen and his wife, Christina, were essentially broke and were selling their multimillion-dollar Bronxville, N.Y., home.Mr. Caspersen\u2019s trading strategy was not particularly sophisticated. He almost exclusively traded one-week put options betting on a decline in the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index. What was remarkable was the bold nature of the bets, in which Mr. Caspersen would instruct his broker to trade all the cash available in his account each week, his lawyer said.As recently as Feb. 11, Mr. Caspersen had $112.8 million in a brokerage account and could have easily paid back the $38.5 million he had owed family and friends. Instead, the very next trading day he ordered his broker, at an unnamed Wall Street firm, to place a new round of all-in bets that the market would fall that week.Mr. Caspersen even took about $1 million from the family of a longtime girlfriend, Catherine F. MacRae, who died on Sept. 11, 2001, during the terrorist attack on the World Trade Center, his lawyer said on Tuesday. Together with Ms. MacRae\u2019s family, Mr. Caspersen had created a memorial fund to benefit education programs for children from low-income families. The lawyer said the money in the scheme was not from that fund.Prosecutors working for Preet Bharara, the Manhattan United States attorney, added more details on Tuesday to the criminal complaint they filed in March.The authorities now say that Mr. Caspersen had sought to defraud investors out of $150 million, up from the $95 million cited in the criminal complaint. The new criminal filing said he used some of the money he raised to \u201cmake periodic interest payments to earlier investors.\u201dMr. Caspersen promised investors an annual return of 15 to 20 percent by putting up money that he said would be used to \u201cmake secured loans to private equity firms,\u201d the authorities said.In all, prosecutors said he used five fictitious investment vehicles to raise money to carry out the scheme. They said he also doctored documents and made up an employee at one firm as part of his bluff when he was questioned by investors.An internal investigation by PJT Partners concluded that the amount of money Mr. Caspersen actually took in from investors in the last two years was about $40 million, of which $14 million came from friends and relatives, including his mother, Barbara Caspersen.The Securities and Exchange Commission has filed a related civil fraud complaint against him.Mr. Shechtman said news media reports have wrongly characterized his client as a man driven by greed and self-interest.\u201cThis is not about Wall Street greed,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is about addiction and mental illness.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Fraud Charges Against Jail Officers\u2019 Union Chief With a Taste for Luxury", "Date": "2016-06-08", "News": "Supported byAs federal agents tell it, the kickback scheme that led to the arrest on Wednesday of Norman Seabrook, the powerful leader of the New York City correction officers\u2019 union, was hatched one night in late 2013 in a hotel room in the Dominican Republic.The union president had been drinking and was delivering an earful to a well-connected New York real estate developer, according to the agents. For too long, Mr. Seabrook complained, he had been working hard to invest the union\u2019s money and had not received anything in return.It was time, he said, that \u201cNorman Seabrook got paid.\u201dWithin months Mr. Seabrook made an investment deal that made even union lawyers uneasy, putting $20 million of union funds in a high-risk hedge fund, according to a criminal complaint filed by the office of Preet Bharara, the United States attorney for the Southern District of New York. In exchange, prosecutors said, he was given $60,000, delivered in a Salvatore Ferragamo bag \u2014 one of his favorite luxury brands.Over the course of two decades as union president, Mr. Seabrook has gone from a jail guard patrolling the cellblocks of Rikers Island to an influential power broker, forming alliances across the political spectrum including with Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, a Democrat; former Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, an independent; and former Gov. George E. Pataki, a Republican.Just looking at him, it is clear Mr. Seabrook enjoys life\u2019s finer things. He is driven around town in luxury S.U.V.s, dines at upscale restaurants, smokes fine cigars and wears expensive tailored suits, often with a pocket square.Indeed, after Mr. Seabrook was arrested, agents from the Federal Bureau of Investigation recovered a Ferragamo bag that matched the description of the one stuffed with cash, along with 10 pairs of Ferragamo shoes.At least some of Mr. Seabrook\u2019s luxuries were paid for by people seeking favors from him and the union, according to investigators. Plane trips to Las Vegas, California, Israel and at least two to the Dominican Republic were underwritten by Jona Rechnitz, the developer at the hotel that night in 2013. After that meeting, Mr. Rechnitz introduced Mr. Seabrook to a hedge fund financier named Murray Huberfeld, and helped arrange for the kickback, according to federal investigators.Mr. Rechnitz, who has pleaded guilty and is cooperating in the Seabrook case, is also a central target in one of the investigations that are focused on the campaign fund-raising of Mayor Bill de Blasio, a Democrat. He is not named in the complaint and is referred to instead as Cooperating Witness 1 or CW-1.Both Mr. Seabrook and Mr. Huberfeld, an associate at the hedge fund, Platinum Partners, have been charged with one count of honest services fraud and one count of conspiracy to commit honest services wire fraud. Mr. Seabrook was released on $250,000 bond and Mr. Huberfeld on $1 million bond. Both have been ordered to remain in the New York City region.After the meeting at the hotel, according to prosecutors, Mr. Rechnitz went to Platinum promising to arrange a deal with the union to become a major investor. The catch, he said, was that Mr. Seabrook would have to be compensated. Mr. Huberfeld agreed to the arrangement and was willing to pay Mr. Seabrook 10 percent of all profits that the hedge fund made on the union\u2019s investment.Mr. Seabrook, whose salary is $300,000 a year with his union stipend, had one overarching concern, according to the complaint: how big his cut would be.Mr. Huberfeld told him it could be as much as $150,000 a year.In return, Mr. Seabrook would direct money intended to cover correction officers\u2019 pensions into a high-risk fund. Up to that point the union had maintained a traditional investment portfolio made up of conventional stocks and bond funds, government obligations and a real estate trust fund.The union\u2019s lawyers reviewed the proposal and pointed out that the union had never invested in a hedge fund before, nor had any other New York City retirement fund that they were aware of been involved in such a risky venture. Even so, they did not stand in the way of the deal.\u201cThe annuity fund, however, is not averse to being a trendsetter,\u201d the lawyers wrote to Platinum in February 2014.There were other red flags particular to Platinum. Mr. Huberfeld had been convicted of fraud in 1993 for arranging for another person to take a brokerage licensing exam on his behalf. He was fined $5,000 and sentenced to two years of probation. In a separate case, in 1998, he and a partner paid $4.6 million to settle a civil action brought by the Securities and Exchange Commission that alleged bank fraud.At a news conference on Wednesday, Mr. Bharara said that Mr. Seabrook made his investment decisions \u201cbased not what was good for his union members but based on what was good for Norman Seabrook.\u201d\u201cFor a Ferragamo bag filled with cash, Seabrook allegedly sold himself and his duty to safeguard the retirement funds of his fellow correction officers,\u201d Mr. Bharara said.In the end, it was Mr. Seabrook who made the final decision on where the union money went. Over the years, he had consolidated absolute control over the operations of the union, often bypassing his executive board on even the most significant financial decisions.According to the authorities, he ultimately invested $15 million from the union\u2019s annuity fund, which is financed almost completely through annual contributions from the city, as well as another $5 million from the union\u2019s $12 million in assets at the time. \u201cThe investment decision was made by Seabrook alone,\u201d the union\u2019s treasurer, Michael Maiello, told investigators.By the end of 2014, according to the complaint, Mr. Seabrook began demanding a payout for his services. The hedge fund, however, was performing worse than expected, and Mr. Huberfeld could not immediately get his hands on the money. Instead, Mr. Rechnitz fronted his own money to pay off Mr. Seabrook with a promise from Platinum that he would be reimbursed. For accounting purposes, Mr. Rechnitz disguised the kickback as a $60,000 payment for a block of New York Knicks tickets.On Dec. 11, 2014, Mr. Rechnitz bought the bag from a Ferragamo store in Manhattan for $820. The handoff was made a few blocks away in Mr. Seabrook\u2019s Chevrolet Suburban, which is registered to the union.When Mr. Rechnitz \u201ctold Seabrook how much money was in the bag, Seabrook was angry that it was not as much money as he was initially promised,\u201d the complaint said.After the handoff, the men went out to dinner and attended a Torah dedication ceremony at a local synagogue.As the months went on, Platinum representatives kept pressing Mr. Seabrook to invest more union funds. According to investigators, the hedge fund was having cash flow problems and needed $44 million for investors seeking to pull out their money.On Jan. 27, 2015, Mr. Huberfeld, speaking on a phone that federal agents had wiretapped, told an associate to press Mr. Seabrook for more money during a lunch meeting.\u201cI\u2019m under some pressure,\u201d he said, according to the complaint.On May 19, 2015, the marketing director of Platinum sent an email to other executives noting that the meeting with Seabrook went great and that he \u201csaid he will send us more money shortly.\u201dBut before Mr. Seabrook could transfer more money, federal agents served subpoenas on the union and Platinum. \u201cNo further investments were made,\u201d the complaint said.The complaint does not make clear what happened to the $20 million the union invested.In a filing for a lawsuit brought last year by a former union official over alleged financial improprieties, he boasted that the investment had returned $475,000 in a recent three-month period. A union financial statement listed a return of just $47,529 for the same time.The union recently mailed out ballots for an election this summer listing Mr. Seabrook as running unopposed for president. But his future is unclear.On Wednesday, he was suspended as a correction officer, relieved of his shield and gun. He sat in a packed courtroom looking relaxed. He was dressed more modestly than usual: jeans, a collared shirt and sandals.When asked by a reporter at the courthouse how he felt, Mr. Seabrook replied, \u201cI feel like a million dollars.\u201dJ.

{"Headline": "The Macroeconomics of Brexit: Motivated Reasoning?", "Date": "2016-06-30", "News": "I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m still on vacation, but had some time to catch up today, and felt an urge to scratch an itch I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been feeling. You see, much of the discussion of Brexit and its impacts bothers me. I believe that Brexit is a tragic development, which will do substantial long-run economic harm. But what we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re hearing overwhelmingly from economists is the claim that it will also have severe short-run adverse impacts. And that claim seems dubious.Or maybe more to the point, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a claim that doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t follow in any clear way from standard macroeconomics \u00e2\u0080\u0093 but it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s being presented as if it does. And I worry that what we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re seeing is a case of motivated reasoning, which could end up damaging economists\u00e2\u0080\u0099 credibility.OK, let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s start at the beginning. Brexit will almost certainly have an adverse effect on British trade; even if the UK ends up with a Norway-type agreement with the EU, the loss of guaranteed access to the EU market will affect firms\u00e2\u0080\u0099 decisions about investments, and inhibit trade flows.This reduction in trade relative to what would otherwise happen will, in turn, make the British economy less productive and poorer than it would otherwise have been. It takes fairly heroic assumptions to make this into a specific number, but 2-3 percent lower income in perpetuity seems plausible.So far, so good, or rather so bad: this is standard economics, basically Ricardo with a dash of new trade theory. But what about warnings that Brexit will precipitate a British recession, or at least a drastic slowdown in the short run? Where are those coming from?The trade arguments are about the economy\u00e2\u0080\u0099s supply side: less trade means lower productivity and hence lower productive capacity. But the kind of recession we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re talking about here is a demand-side phenomenon \u00e2\u0080\u0093 a slump brought on by inadequate spending. And why, exactly, is that supposed to happen?As best I can tell, the case for a UK recession or at least slowdown rests on two not entirely distinct propositions: the idea that uncertainty will deter investment and possibly consumption, and the idea that an increase in perceived risks will worsen financial conditions. Let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s take these on in turn.But in that case we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re saying that bad things will happen because firms will perceive an increased probability of bad things happening. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s either circular reasoning, assuming one\u00e2\u0080\u0099s conclusion, or both.I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d also note that any major policy change creates uncertainty, because nobody knows how it will work out. So why don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t we hear recession warnings when countries are contemplating major trade liberalization, or privatization schemes, or labor market reforms? The \u00e2\u0080\u009cuncertainty depresses investment\u00e2\u0080\u009d argument seems to be rolled out selectively, only deployed against policies economists dislike for other reasons.Meanwhile, what about the argument that Brexit will worsen financial conditions, increasing risk spreads? Well, this seems to me to be another circular argument \u00e2\u0080\u0093 it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s claiming that bad things will happen because investors will expect bad things to happen.In other words, the arguments for big short-run damage from Brexit look quite weak. An economist who tried to make similar arguments for or against most policies would face a lot of criticism. But in this case we have a near-consensus accepting these weak arguments. Why?My suspicion is that the same thing is happening here. Economists have very good reasons to believe that Brexit will do bad things in the long run, but are strongly tempted to sex up their arguments by making very dubious claims about the short run. And the fact that so many respectable people are making these dubious claims makes them seem well-reasoned when they aren\u2019t.Unfortunately, that sort of thing, aside from being inherently a bad practice, can all too easily backfire. Indeed, the rebound in British stocks, which are now above pre-Brexit levels, is already causing some backlash against conventional economists and their Chicken Little warnings.Sorry, people, sloppy thinking is always a vice, no matter what cause it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s used for.Paul Krugman is an Op-Ed columnist for The New York Times.Advertisement"}

Barring a severe global recession, which doesn\u2019t seem imminent, stock market drops of this magnitude generally reverse themselves within three or four months. That\u2019s because big, quick declines embody reflexive panic \u2014 urgent desires to cut losses before the larger meaning of a market shock has been digested. Sometimes there are quick recoveries \u2014 as we saw after the initial declines after the so-called Brexit vote \u2014 which are followed by further losses until the markets find equilibrium.In the United States, on Aug. 1, 2011, when Congress could not reach a deal to raise the debt ceiling, the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index dropped 3 percent, partly rebounded, then fell 14 percent by Oct. 3. It recovered within three months.Finally, on March 27, 2012, the European debt crisis forced Spain into budget austerity, setting off labor strikes and driving the Stoxx Europe 600 index down 3 percent in one day, and a total of 11 percent. The recovery time? Again, a mere three months.\u201cIt is important for long-term investors to note that in each of these instances, stocks rebounded to their pre-shock level in three or four months,\u201d Mr. Kleintop said, \u201ceven when a recession took place.\u201dThat said, neither Japan nor Europe nor the United States is in wonderful economic shape right now. Japan and Europe have endured severe market and economic downturns after these market shocks. The United States economy has grown very slowly and could be threatened by the shock waves emanating from Europe.It is also worth noting that the post-2009 period is too brief to conclude much about the long-term performance of the markets. There has been a tenacious bull market in stocks in the United States since then, fueled in part by central bank policy that has engineered ultralow interest rates. The market has been running out of steam.That is why a deeper dive provides a useful perspective.First, from a market standpoint, the Brexit crisis so far hasn\u2019t caused much damage. In the history of the S.&P. 500, for example, the decline on June 24, which came to 3.6 percent, was inconsequential when measured as a percentage of the index\u2019s total value. Using that measure, the decline ranked as only the 180th-largest since 1928, according to data compiled by Howard Silverblatt, senior index analyst at S.&P. Dow Jones Indices.What distinguished the early phase of this crisis, statistically, is that the markets were so poorly positioned in advance of the British vote. It was almost as though they were moving full speed in one direction and had to turn around and sprint the other way.Paul T. Hickey, co-founder of the Bespoke Investment Group, brought this to my attention. Using a technical indicator \u2014 the 50-day moving average of the S.&P. 500 \u2014 he found that stocks were \u201coverbought\u201d before the vote, meaning that traders had pushed prices well above recent levels. That would probably have been fine if a majority of voters had called for Britain to stay in the European Union.But that upward momentum before the Brexit vote set up a nasty market downturn. The combination of an overbought market immediately before an extremely oversold one was so unusual, he said, that \u201cextraordinary may be an understatement. Using that overbought-oversold measure, the two-day price reversal was the biggest since 1928.\u201dOnly two episodes came close.One was in October 1989, when the failure of a leveraged buyout of United Airlines devastated the junk bond market. The S.&P. 500 fell 6.5 percent over two days. (That compares with a 5.3 percent decline in the two days after the Brexit vote.) There was a partial recovery and another downturn, but in less than three months the market returned to its old level.That example is comforting; the second is not: It occurred during World War II, when Germany invaded Belgium and the Netherlands and began to overrun France. On May 10, 1940, Neville Chamberlain resigned as prime minister of Britain, and Winston Churchill replaced him.Worldwide markets were grossly unprepared for what came next. Over two days, the S.&P. 500 in the United States declined 8.3 percent. And over the next two years, the war deepened, millions died and as an incidental casualty, the stock market declined another 33 percent. It took more than three years for the S.&P. 500 to return to its former level.In early 1940, historical stock data would not have helped much in forecasting market returns for the rest of the year. Much bigger factors than 50-day moving averages determined the course of events.If only by comparison, today\u2019s problems seem manageable and easily understood. Events in Europe are still unfolding. But the preponderance of data strongly suggests that the markets will settle down in days, weeks or months, not years.Other crises are sure to follow in this election year. We don\u2019t know what lurks beneath the surface of moving events and won\u2019t find out until the smoke clears.

{"Headline": "Dear Conservatives, You Can Go Green Again", "Date": "2016-06-11", "News": "Supported byThis is a shame, because conservatives used to be almost by definition conservationists, focused on preserving our shared heritage from destructive influences. You can, in fact, date the rise of the conservation movement as a political force in this country to a December 1887 dinner party of wealthy big game hunters, largely Republicans, hosted in a Madison Avenue house by Theodore Roosevelt (still a hero to many modern conservatives, despite certain progressive leanings). He and his guests that night formed the Boone and Crockett Club, dedicated to preservation and management of game.So what does it take to bring conservatives back, after a quarter-century of their reflexively treating even the mention of environmental issues as a treasonous attack on business and the nation? It\u2019s possible they are already returning, with the House of Representatives last month approving a major environmental reform by an astonishingly bipartisan 403 to 12 margin, and the Senate almost certain to follow.It\u2019s also arguably a model for further cooperation on environmental issues. But how to make progress on other vital environmental issues? It will help for environmentalists to acknowledge past contributions by conservatives and also the potential value of conservative approaches for the future.On the other hand, if conservatives genuinely oppose big government, Mr. Adler adds, they should start by opposing costly government programs that are a leading cause of environmental damage \u2014 including fossil fuel subsidies, ethanol subsidies, agricultural subsidies and many of the ill-conceived dam and irrigation projects of the Army Corps of Engineers and the Bureau of Reclamation.Mr. Adler doesn\u2019t draw the line at turning federal lands over to private ownership, under the right circumstances \u2014 for instance, with groups like the Nature Conservancy among the potential private owners. I think that would be a betrayal of Teddy Roosevelt\u2019s considerable bequest to the nation, with Cliven Bundy clones more likely to be among the owners. But Mr. Adler and I could certainly talk about market-based alternatives to the current federal mismanagement.With recent polls suggesting that climate change has begun to loom ominously for many Republicans as it does for the majority of Democrats, it may be time for big, bold, even alarmingly bipartisan thoughts. In the end, our need for clean air to breathe, safe water to drink, a climate that does not change too drastically and forests, oceans and wildlife that remain healthy and resilient has almost nothing to do with whether we are Republicans or Democrats, conservatives or liberals, and everything to do with being fellow residents of Planet Earth, with no place else to call home.

{"Headline": "Jeff Gennette to Succeed Terry Lundgren as Macy\u2019s Chief", "Date": "2016-06-23", "News": "Supported byMacy\u2019s longtime chief executive, Terry J. Lundgren, will step down next year, the company announced on Thursday, as the retailer grapples with sagging sales and broader changes in the ways people shop.Jeff Gennette, 55, who is the company\u2019s president, will take the top spot, while Mr. Lundgren will stay as executive chairman.\u201cI have been honored to lead this enterprise through a period of unprecedented reinvention,\u201d Mr. Lundgren said in a statement. \u201cWhile our company is larger, stronger and more resourceful than we were 13 years ago, now is the time to reset our business model to thrive in a future that is being driven by rapid evolution in consumer preferences and shopping habits.\u201dThe company said the leadership transition was part of its board\u2019s succession plan. But the moves come in the face of widespread turmoil at the nation\u2019s department stores, including Macy\u2019s, which have struggled to recover from the recession as quickly as the rest of the retail industry. Shoppers are spending more, but they are also hunting for bargains, online and at so-called off-price stores known foremost for their discounts.Amazon, the online shopping giant, as well as discount chains like T. J. Maxx and Marshalls, have added to the pressure. Macy\u2019s and other department stores have offered aggressive promotions to entice shoppers, a move that some retail experts say has led to a race to the bottom.\u201cWe\u2019re a promotional department store, and we will continue to be a promotional department store,\u201d Mr. Gennette said in an interview. \u201cWe offer values every day to our customer.\u201dMacy\u2019s, J. C. Penney, Nordstrom and Kohl\u2019s all reported surprisingly lackluster sales last quarter that sent their stocks tumbling. Macy\u2019s was particularly hard-hit, reporting that sales at comparable stores, a measure often used by the industry, fell 5.6 percent over the previous year, the weakest showing since the recession.The new chief has a \u201cvery daunting task\u201d ahead of him, said Craig Johnson, president of Customer Growth Partners, a retail consulting and research firm.\u201cMacy\u2019s is facing some very difficult challenges,\u201d Mr. Johnson said. \u201cI think it\u2019s the right move at the right time.\u201dStill, the selection of Mr. Gennette does not seem to suggest a swift resetting of strategy. He said he expected to continue several of the initiatives begun under his predecessor. To better compete with discount stores, Macy\u2019s is opening outlet stores under the Macy\u2019s Backstage name and plans to have 15 of those stores open by the end of the fourth quarter.Mr. Gennette said he also wanted to continue building collaborations with other brands. In some stores, Macy\u2019s leases space to Men\u2019s Wearhouse to run a tuxedo rental business. It also has similar arrangements with Finish Line, the athletic shoe brand, and Sunglass Hut. These brands lease the space and operate separate shops within Macy\u2019s stores.He is also continuing what he calls Macy\u2019s \u201cI do\u201d strategy, upgrading fine jewelry departments within the department stores.\u201cWe believe we can be the wedding destination,\u201d he said. \u201cIt starts with the ring and goes all the way to your first house and kid. We believe we can be a one-stop shop for that.\u201dWhat\u2019s not clear is how Mr. Gennette will differ from his predecessor, said Neil Saunders, a retail analyst for Conlumino.Mr. Gennette began his career at Macy\u2019s in 1983, starting as an executive trainee and working his way into management roles in the men\u2019s and children\u2019s divisions. Before his promotion to Macy\u2019s president in 2014, he worked as the company\u2019s chief merchandising officer since 2009.\u201cHe\u2019s very much a Macy\u2019s insider,\u201d Mr. Saunders said. \u201cHe knows the business inside and out, and he\u2019s worked very closely with Lundgren for many years. In a way, they\u2019re just swapping seats.\u201dAside from its retail business, Macy\u2019s is also exploring ways to raise money from its many real estate holdings. Last year, the company sold part of its building in Downtown Brooklyn to Tishman Speyer, a developer. The retailer will continue to occupy the first four floors of the nine-story building, while the upper floors will be reconfigured into office space for other tenants.Mr. Gennette said Macy\u2019s was also pursuing other sales or joint ventures at its flagship stores in New York, Chicago and Minneapolis, as well as some of its mall properties.Macy\u2019s now operates 870 stores in 45 states, up from just 240 stores in 2005. Those stores include the upscale department store chain Bloomingdale\u2019s and the makeup retailer Bluemercury. Macy\u2019s shares rose about 2 percent in midday trading.\u201cUnder Lundgren, lots of different initiatives were going on. What Macy\u2019s needs is a finisher of those things,\u201d said Mr. Saunders, the retail analyst. \u201cWe have to see what Jeff Gennette can do.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "How China Fell Off the Miracle Path", "Date": "2016-06-03", "News": "Supported byOpinionFOR years now, Donald J. Trump has been sounding the alarm on China, calling it an economic bully that has been \u201ceating our lunch.\u201d The crux of Mr. Trump\u2019s attack is that Beijing manipulates its currency to keep it cheap and give Chinese exports an unfair advantage. But that narrative is so last decade. China is now a threat to the United States not because it is strong but because it is fragile.Four key forces have been shaping the rise and fall of nations since the 2008 financial crisis, and none of them bode well for China. Debts have risen dangerously fast in the emerging world, especially in China. Trade growth has collapsed everywhere, a sharp blow to leading exporters, again led by China. Many countries are reverting to autocratic rule in an effort to fight the global slowdown, none more self-destructively than China. And, for reasons unrelated to the 2008 collapse, growth in the world\u2019s working-age population is slowing, and turned negative last year in China, depleting the work force.It will be difficult for any country to grow as rapidly as 6 percent, and all but impossible for China. Nevertheless, in an effort to exceed that target, Beijing is pumping debt into wasteful projects, and digging itself into a hole. The economy is now slowing and will decelerate further when the country is forced to reduce its debt burden, as inevitably it will be. The next step could be a deeper slowdown or even a financial crisis, which will have global repercussions because seven years of heavy stimulus have turned the world\u2019s second largest economy into a bloated giant.In Beijing, confidence has given way to a case of nerves. Local residents often sense trouble coming before foreign investors and are the first to flee before a crisis. Chinese moved a record $675 billion out of the country in 2015, some of it for purchases of foreign real estate. If China were eating America\u2019s lunch, its people would not be rushing to buy safe-haven apartments in New York or San Francisco. Far from conspiring to cheapen its currency, as Mr. Trump charges, Beijing is struggling to keep the weakening renminbi from falling more, which would further erode local confidence and make a crisis more likely.The seeds of China\u2019s current problems were planted in the months after the global economic crisis of 2008. When I visited Beijing in September of that year, just before the Wall Street implosion, the country\u2019s economy was slowing, but the city was calm. Beijing had hosted the Summer Olympics, and in preparation had temporarily shuttered smokestack industries and eased censorship. The skies were clear, the conversation much more candid than it is today.The nation had good reason to feel confident. Like Japan, South Korea and other Asian \u201cmiracle\u201d economies, China had generated a long run of double-digit growth by investing in export industries. But Wen Jiabao, then prime minister, was not complacent. He was warning that after three decades of heavy industrialization, China was \u201cunstable\u201d and \u201cunbalanced,\u201d with too many factories belching too much smog. Many prominent Chinese recognized that with per-capita income rising above $8,000, their nation would face a natural slowdown, as Japan and South Korea had when they reached a similar middle-income level. Meanwhile, among outsiders, there was hopeful talk of how China would evolve into a democracy as it grew richer \u2014 again following the path of earlier Asian miracles.Then, two weeks after I left, Lehman Brothers filed for bankruptcy in the United States, tipping the global economy into recession. Demand collapsed across the world, crushing export growth in China. The leadership in Beijing panicked, apparently fearing that if the recession reached its shores, social unrest would follow. Mr. Wen reversed course and doubled down on the old industrial model \u2014 fueling investment in factories with trillions in state lending and spending.At first, the bet appeared to work. In 2009, China managed once again to beat its longstanding growth target of 8 percent, as the West struggled to recover from its deep recession. The rapid spending unleashed by Beijing contrasted sharply with the relative gridlock in Washington and the global elite, gathering for their annual confab in Davos, Switzerland, in 2011, marveled at the benefits of state capitalism. China, they said, was proving that unchecked autocracies had an advantage in managing the economy, particularly in a crisis.But looking back, we can see that this was the moment China began to fall off the miracle path.As its debt mania progressed, more of the lending was diverted into wasteful speculation. Normally, frenzied borrowing occurs amid excitement about a new innovation like the internet. But this spree spread on conviction that Beijing, obsessed with hitting its growth target, would not let lenders or borrowers fail. More and more unqualified players got in the game. The state banks soon had to compete with \u201cshadow banks,\u201d including crowdfunding websites that offered ordinary people a chance to invest in debt for as little as one renminbi (15 cents), promising fantastic returns.Try as the Chinese authorities might to steer the money into industry, they could never fully commit to stopping shadow banks from financing an increasingly questionable array of borrowers speculating in real estate. When I visited Shanghai in August 2010, I was stunned to see apartment blocks rising two to three rows deep all along the 110-mile route to Hangzhou. Many of the biggest debtors are front companies set up by local governments to evade national regulators. Small cities are borrowing to build futuristic museums, aquatic centers and apartment blocks that exceed local demand and are often as empty as ghost towns.My research shows that during the 30 worst debt manias of the past 50 years, private debt \u2014 which in China is often held by local governments \u2014 rose over five years by at least 40 percentage points as a share of gross domestic product. In all 30 cases, the economy slowed sharply, typically by more than half, in the next five years.China\u2019s mania is now the largest ever in the postwar emerging world. After holding steady at around 150 percent of G.D.P. for much of the boom, China\u2019s public and private debts surged after Mr. Wen\u2019s about face in 2008, rising to 230 percent of G.D.P. by 2014. That 80-percentage-point increase is also more than three times the increase in the United States before its bubble collapsed in 2008. Since then, United States debt has held steady as a share of its economy. Though many Americans still think the nation is drowning in debt, its burden is much less worrisome than China\u2019s because it is not growing.Paradoxically, the authoritarian form of government that helped guide China to those years of economic growth may now be undermining its economic stability. My research suggests that compared with democracies, autocracies generate far more unstable growth, and that\u2019s the risk in China now. Looking at the available records going back to 1950 shows that extreme swings between fast and slow growth are much more common under autocratic regimes. On a list of 36 countries that have been whipsawed between rapid growth and recession throughout the postwar era, three out of four were autocracies.Because these governments face no check on their powers, they can force feed periods of strong growth. But they can also veer off in the wrong direction with no one to set them straight. In the early stages of China\u2019s boom under Deng Xiaoping, Beijing did what authoritarian governments do best, suppressing opposition to breakneck development, steering the people\u2019s savings toward building export factories and commandeering land to build the roads and bridges to bring the manufactured goods to market. But the same decision-making process, centralized in a small circle in Beijing, allowed the government to impulsively shift course in 2008 and push through the lending campaign that put China on the increasingly unstable path of more debt, and less growth.ON my recent trips to China, I keep looking for Beijing to snap back to reality, but in vain. As the economy grows more unstable, the authorities have tried to control the business cycle with an increasingly heavy hand that extends into its financial markets. In late 2014, hoping to give its struggling companies a new lift, Beijing began to praise buying stocks as a patriotic act. Millions of ordinary Chinese signed up to play the market for the first time, many unaided by a high school degree, and started borrowing to buy shares as prices rose. When the bubble burst last June, Beijing did not let it implode, as it had in 2008. It ordered people not to sell or even to speak critically of stocks. The market collapsed anyway.Afterward the Davos crowd finally started to question whether Beijing could simply command its economy to grow. It looked as if the lesson might be learned in China, too, but when I visited this April, authorities had begun a new stimulus campaign, and debt was still growing three times faster than the economy. Against this backdrop, residents spoke of dizzying price rises in Shanghai and Beijing real estate and in obscure markets like steel rebar futures. Their intention was to keep dancing until the borrowed money stopped flowing.The sputtering global economy is one shock away from slipping into recession. In the postwar period, every previous global recession started with a downturn in the United States, but the next one is likely to begin with a shock in China. Through heavy stimulus, China was the largest contributor to global growth this decade, but it is fragile. China\u2019s miracle growth period is over, and it now faces the curse of debt.Ruchir Sharma is the chief global strategist at Morgan Stanley Investment Management.

{"Headline": "Obama Tells Air Force Cadets to Embrace Diplomacy", "Date": "2016-06-02", "News": "Supported byCOLORADO SPRINGS \u2014 President Obama on Thursday used his final commencement address to a United States military academy to urge Air Force cadets to find the right balance between force and diplomacy as they join the ranks of the country\u2019s armed forces.Facing 812 cadets in blue-and-white dress uniforms, Mr. Obama told the Air Force Academy\u2019s class of 2016 that they must not allow the United States to turn away from the world, calling the isolationist rhetoric of some politicians a \u201cfalse comfort\u201d that undermines the country\u2019s leadership in the world.Instead, he said, the Air Force and other branches of the military must be willing to engage the country\u2019s arsenal in defense of America and on behalf of its allies. Mr. Obama recounted the many terrorists, including Osama bin Laden, who have been killed or captured because of his willingness to deploy force.\u201cThe list goes on because if you target Americans, we will find you and justice will be done and we will defend our nation,\u201d Mr. Obama said, prompting some applause from the cadets and a stadium filled with their friends and family.But Mr. Obama drew only tepid applause when he cautioned that the United States must \u201cnever celebrate war itself\u201d and urged the soon-to-be second lieutenants to embrace the use of diplomacy and other nonlethal tools to resolve disputes around the world.Mr. Obama said the cadets must find the way in their military careers to be both \u201cstrongheaded and bighearted,\u201d facing a dangerous world with the realism to make compromises when necessary but to fight with idealism when needed.The president cited his decision to negotiate with Iran to block that country\u2019s development of nuclear weapons as an example of the progress that can be made without weapons. He acknowledged the controversy surrounding his decision not to strike in Syria after President Bashar al-Assad and his forces used chemical weapons. But he repeated his belief that the decision was the right one, and led to a more complete destruction of Syria\u2019s chemical weapon stocks.\u201cMany of the threats to our security cannot be solved by military force alone,\u201d Mr. Obama said. \u201cWe have to draw on every tool, all elements of our national power.\u201dAs he nears the end of his time in office, Mr. Obama said he is proud of having brought most of America\u2019s troops home from fighting in Iraq and Afghanistan. He said calls from some for a deeper engagement in those countries must be fully thought through.\u201cHow will it alter the conflict? What comes next? When we ask those questions, we prevent the kind of mission creep that history teaches us to avoid,\u201d the president told the graduates.Mr. Obama hailed the military\u2019s inclusion of gays, lesbians, women, religious minorities and others into the armed forces, saying that \u201cwe are stronger\u201d because of the diversity. He praised the hard work and perseverance of the graduates and commended to them a life of service and happiness.\u201cWhen I\u2019m no longer president,\u201d he said, \u201cI will sleep well at night because I know that men and women like you serve to keep us free.\u201dAfter the ceremony, Air Force officials said that an F-16 Thunderbird aircraft that had been part of the flyover at the graduation crashed shortly afterward. The pilot was able to safely eject, the officials said, adding that he was being examined by doctors as a precaution.Shortly after Mr. Obama arrived at the airport to fly home, he met briefly with the pilot, thanking him \u201cfor his service to the country and expressed his relief that the pilot was not seriously injured,\u201d according to the White House spokesman, Josh Earnest. \u201cThe president also thanked the first responders who acted quickly to tend to the pilot.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "This Is Just the Start of the Brexit\u2019s Economic Disaster", "Date": "2016-06-26", "News": "Supported byOp-Ed ContributorLONDON \u2014 A few weeks before Britons voted on whether to remain part of the European Union, Michael Gove, one of the leaders of the Leave campaign, was asked why he should be trusted over the overwhelming number of economists and international authorities who opposed Brexit. \u201cPeople in this country have had enough of experts,\u201d he replied.Experts are, of course, known to make mistakes. But in this case, the people who voted for Brexit will pay a big price for ignoring economic expertise. The harmful effects of this vote are both immediate and lasting.Britons are already worse off. The pound has \u2014 so far \u2014 plunged by nearly 9 percent against the dollar, slashing the value of British assets, with higher import prices likely to follow. The stock market has also taken a hit. The prices of property, most British people\u2019s main asset, are almost certain to fall, too. While Mark Carney, the governor of the Bank of England, has already pledged 250 billion pounds (about $345 billion) to support the financial system and has said he could offer more if necessary, central bankers cannot protect against an enduring economic shock.Rarely have businesses faced such uncertainty. Britain\u2019s economy had already slowed as they put investment decisions on hold ahead of the referendum. Now, a country renowned for its political and legal stability is descending into chaos. The future prime minister is unknown, as is the direction his or her policies will take. The favorite to replace David Cameron, Boris Johnson, the former mayor of London who opportunistically campaigned for Brexit, styles himself as pro-market and pro-globalization, but in the lead-up to the vote he said he supports curbs on European Union migration, tariffs on Chinese steel and higher public spending. The future terms on which Britain will trade with both the European Union and all the countries with which it has negotiated trade deals on Britain\u2019s behalf are uncertain. Domestic regulations on everything from finance to environmental protection may change.All that uncertainty is amplified by the prospect of a second referendum on Scottish independence, which may this time be won. In Northern Ireland, the political party Sinn Fein has already called for a referendum on a united Ireland.Faced with such uncertainty, businesses are likely to continue to put investments on hold. Consumers may pull back, too. The resulting downturn will cause the government\u2019s budget deficit, already large, to swell. The pound\u2019s depreciation, which might have been expected to boost exports, is unlikely to do much to cushion the blow. Its huge decline in 2008 failed to boost exports and Brexit will dent them.This unpredictable situation will not be brief. Once triggered, the formal process of leaving the European Union is supposed to take two years. But extricating the union\u2019s second-biggest economy from 43 years of European Union legislation is a daunting task.Negotiating a new trade relationship with the European Union is equally tricky. Britain seems certain to lose access to the single market \u2014 with which it does nearly half its trade \u2014 because this is conditional on accepting the free movement of people and contributing to the European Union\u2019s budget. (These were key issues for pro-Brexit voters.) That will jeopardize the foreign investment and good jobs predicated on single-market membership. Britain-based financial institutions will lose their rights to operate freely across the European Union.Brexit\u2019s supporters are deluded when they argue that Britain could cherry pick what it likes about the European Union and discard the rest. Since exports to the European Union (13 percent of G.D.P. in 2014) matter much more to Britain than exports to Britain (3 percent of G.D.P. in 2014) do to the European Union, the European Union will call the shots. Other governments have every incentive to be tough, both to steal a competitive advantage and to deter others from following Britain out the door.A fallback position is trading with Europe on the basis of World Trade Organization rules, as the United States does. But that entails tariffs on good exports \u2014 up to 10 percent on car exports, for example, most of which go to the European Union \u2014 as well as non-tariff barriers that gum up trade. It offers little access to Europe\u2019s markets in services, in which Britain specializes. Less open markets will stunt competition, crimping productivity growth and living standards.Brexit\u2019s supporters claim that a deregulated Britain that trades with the rest of the world would prosper once unshackled from Brussels\u2019s overregulation and protectionism. But Britain has the least regulated labor markets in the European Union and the second-least regulated product markets, so any potential benefits from deregulation are likely to be meager. Moreover, Britain is likely to end up with worse access to markets in the rest of the world. While it won\u2019t be hamstrung by protectionist interests in the European Union, its relatively smaller economy, largely open markets and desperation for new deals will weaken its clout in trade negotiations.The young, the higher educated and city dwellers, the most dynamic members of Britain\u2019s economy, voted to Remain. They were outvoted by the old, the less educated and non-urban English, who often rely on taxpayer largess. With economic opportunities stunted, everyone will suffer for Leave voters wrongly blaming hard-working, taxpaying European migrants for everything they dislike about modern Britain and wrongly trusting economic charlatans like Mr. Gove.Philippe Legrain is the author of \u201cEuropean Spring: Why Our Economies and Politics Are in a Mess and How to Put Them Right.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Money Letter That Every Parent Should Write", "Date": "2016-06-17", "News": "Supported byYour MoneyThe Money Talk, capital \u201cM\u201d and capital \u201cT,\u201d is overrated. As with the Sex Talk, children can sense that one is coming. And if they get antsy, your words will go in one ear and out the other.So in this season of transitions, consider the old-fashioned letter. It\u2019s long enough to tell some tales to bolster your advice, and if it\u2019s written with enough soul, there\u2019s a good chance the recipient will keep it for a long time. Plus, it\u2019s a literal conversation piece, since the good letters will inspire more curiosity about how the writers oversee their own financial affairs.A good letter, according to Ms. Palmer, should include at least one story about a large financial challenge and another one about a big money triumph. Then, include a list of crucial habits and the tangible things they have helped the family achieve.Then, there was some variable life insurance. And an annuity. And an adviser who promoted a \u201cblack box\u201d investment strategy, as if that were a good thing.So better that their daughters avoid any such blunders from the beginning.In it, Mr. Spooner takes to its logical conclusion Ms. Shearer\u2019s advice about not understanding something: Don\u2019t trust the person who claims to be omniscient either.Kimberly Palmer, author of \u201cSmart Mom, Rich Mom: How to Build Wealth While Raising a Family,\u201d offers a template that parents or grandparents can use to pass on financial advice.In a chapter titled \u201cBeware of Genius,\u201d Mr. Spooner tells the story of an impenetrable Alan Greenspan speech he once heard. He instructs his grandchildren to consider the following hypothetical: \u201cIf someone cannot explain his economic concepts to you in several simple paragraphs, then you should view those concepts as probably being dangerous to your financial health.\u201dAs an investment adviser with the firm, he thought he knew it well enough. He had made plans to sell after any change in leadership. But the new chief executive liked him. \u201cWe can be blinded by flattery from the seats of power,\u201d he wrote to his grandchildren. \u201cBe aware of this in your business lives.\u201dSelling something that is still valuable is the hardest part of any trade, he added. So if you can\u2019t name three good reasons to continue owning something, he warned his grandchildren, then it\u2019s time to sell. In retrospect, he did not have three good ones, but he kept the stock anyway as it fell to $1 a share. (It had been above $55.) He held on to it as the stock rebounded and made some money buying shares of other blue-chip companies during the downturn.Another idea that I\u2019ll include in my own letter someday: You could just follow Ms. Shearer\u2019s lead and invest in a variety of index funds that own every stock in a particular market, thus avoiding this sort of concentrated stock risk.\u201cWhen Daddy and I first got married, we kept the roughest of notebooks and would sit down once a month and try to figure out what happened to our finances,\u201d she wrote. \u201cCommunication, and shared values/goals about money, are really important.\u201dWith the publication of their daughter\u2019s book, written correspondence may be among their biggest legacies. Mr. Palmer would leave a letter for the girls for each night he was away from home when they were growing up. The family eventually collected them in a bound volume.Ms. Shearer\u2019s money letter is now a public document, thanks to her daughter\u2019s own writing. If any of you have written or received your own money letters (or plan to write one now), I\u2019d love to see them and perhaps include them in a future article. You can upload them via a tool on our website.As part of Lesson No. 6, Ms. Shearer encouraged her daughters to read good personal advice books. What she did not anticipate, however, was that she would help inspire her eldest to write her own.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The American Way of Drinking", "Date": "2016-06-09", "News": "Supported byDrinkIt\u2019s an entertaining, eccentric, engagingly written account of American drinking preferences and customs since the colonial era, but much is embellished; although it is a work of nonfiction, Field was not the sort of writer who let the facts stand in the way of a good story. It contains significant measures of whimsy and wonder \u2014 qualities that might normally conspire to put me off drink altogether \u2014 yet I find Field\u2019s book irresistible. We do not learn from the author how the God-fearing Puritans came to be besotted with demon drink. But we are told, \u201cIt was in the tavern over Flip, Toddy, Bounce and Sling \u2014 over Shrub, Sour Julep and Punch,\u201d all venerable drinks, that Americans \u201ccame to grips with the moral issues of witch burning, religious persecution, the dignity of the individual, freedom of speech, civil liberties, political independence and human slavery.\u201dThis all may sound pretty grand, and also pretty speculative, but there\u2019s no denying the importance of the tavern in early America. By law, \u201cordinaries\u201d \u2014 the precursors to taverns \u2014 had been widely established in New England after 1634, \u201cusually sited in the center of each settlement, alongside the meetinghouse and the stocks,\u201d writes Iain Gately in \u201cDrink: A Cultural History of Alcohol.\u201d And taverns and rum went together. \u201cRum was one of the few civilized benefits of the New World,\u201d Field writes, \u201cand its temple was the tavern.\u201dTo say that rum was one of the few \u201ccivilized benefits\u201d of the New World is to sugarcoat its entanglement with the slave trade, which Field mentions quickly, then drops. But it is always worth considering how our food arrives on our plates, and our drinks in our glasses, even if it creates discomfort. It should. In his poem \u201cPity for Poor Africans,\u201d the 18th-century English poet William Cowper tartly illustrated the hypocrisy of many of his peers, who claimed to abhor the slave trade but couldn\u2019t do without the rum produced by its horrors: \u201cI OWN I am shock\u2019d at the purchase of slaves,/And fear those who buy them and sell them are knaves;/What I hear of their hardships, their tortures, and groans,/Is almost enough to draw pity from stones./I pity them greatly, but I must be mum,/For how could we do without sugar and rum?\u201d\u201cSugar gets taken for granted, but it is very much a part of who we are in the Americas, and its presence explains why some of us are here at all,\u201d the culinary historian Jessica B. Harris writes pointedly in her book \u201cRum Drinks.\u201dAmong rum\u2019s first uses in a mixed drink is the flip, in which it was combined with egg and sugar. If you don\u2019t think this cousin of eggnog sounds refreshing on a summer day, I assure you that it is. The flip, Field says, \u201cunquestionably has had the greatest per-capita consumption and spiritual influence of any mixed drink ever made ... about which was once written in a faded, 18th-century hand, \u2018It is both food and drink \u2014 and if you have enough, it is also lodging for the night.\u2019\u2009\u201d I\u2019ve tried to tease out exactly what the unnamed 18th-century source meant by that \u2014 whether it was an allusion to the sleeping quarters that were offered by taverns, a tribute to its warming qualities or just a hint that too many flips are likely to make you very, very sleepy.Although Field surveys the major historic drink categories \u2014 flips, juleps, punches, shrubs and such \u2014 \u201cThe American Drink Book\u201d isn\u2019t limited to the long-ago past, nor is rum the only spirit subjected to his scrutiny. He turns his attention to whiskey and to the drink most Americans love best: beer. In 1953, Field claims, per-capita consumption stood at 16.9 gallons per year; today it is closer to 27 gallons, and the United States has more breweries than any other country.There\u2019s a fascinating list of \u201cthe 100 Greatest American Drinks,\u201d too. It includes obvious candidates like the Manhattan, the martini, the Old-Fashioned and the Sazerac, but there are also surprises like the Between the Sheets \u2014 lemon juice, rum, brandy and Cointreau \u2014 which, Field reports, \u201cwhen properly shaken makes a \u2018ha-cha\u2019 sound that goes well with the rhythm section in Charleston music.\u201d There\u2019s the Blinker: whiskey, grapefruit juice and grenadine, obscure even in Field\u2019s day (\u201cif you call for this one by name and the bartender doesn\u2019t blink, bow respectfully to that gentleman. He is of the old school\u201d). And the Mary Pickford (named for the actress known in the 1920s as \u201cAmerica\u2019s sweetheart,\u201d never mind that she was Canadian by birth) \u2014 pineapple juice, a tiny amount of grenadine and rum.Can a book about our national drinking customs deliver a sense of clarity about being American during a political moment that feels especially fraught, divisive and anxious? Of course not. \u201cThere is a reasonable and disappointing certainty that these pages on the subject of drinking will bring about something less than the absolute eradication of human ridiculousness and the resulting transformation of the world overnight into a completely delightful place,\u201d Field concedes. But the buoyant, hopeful enthusiasm of his prose \u2014 and the drinks he serves with it \u2014 are pleasures in themselves. And his list of the great American cocktails may come in handy during the months leading up to the election: We\u2019ll surely be needing a few good, stiff drinks.cookingcookingAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "\u2018Brexit\u2019 Doesn\u2019t Mean Game Over, but It May Be Just the First Domino", "Date": "2016-06-27", "News": "Supported byDealBookThis isn\u2019t meant to scare you, but let\u2019s consider the absolute worst-case scenarios of \u201cBrexit.\u201dAll over the world, political scientists and financial professionals have been hunkered down trying to game out the economic implications of Britain\u2019s surprise decision to leave the European Union. Many of them had already done various calculations, but now that the decision is real, a surfeit of new scenarios has emerged.Most of the war-gaming has been focused on the direct economic blow to Britain. But the catastrophe-shouting there has almost certainly been overly loud: Yes, Britain\u2019s economy is likely to suffer in the near term as the government reconstitutes and tries to negotiate its divorce with Europe. And yes, the pound will probably continue to lose value, and the uncertainty of Britain\u2019s relationship with Europe will paralyze investment until new rules of engagement are put in place.All of which will makes markets around the world shudder, shrug and generally behave like petulant teenagers. \u201cStocks have entered a new realm of volatility, unlikely to abate anytime soon,\u201d according to a Wells Fargo research note issued on Monday. It warned, \u201cGet used to it.\u201dBut it would be wrong to focus exclusively on Britain when considering the possible financial ramifications and permutations. In a truly dire scenario, Britain is just the leading domino. It\u2019s the next dominoes \u2014 most likely across the Channel \u2014 that matter more.\u201cWe see Brexit as just one step in a process that is unavoidable of further referendums by other nations to exit the E.U.,\u201d Felix Zulauf, an investor who operates a hedge fund in Switzerland, wrote in a note on Monday, contending that \u201cthe damage\u201d of Brexit \u201cwill therefore be far worse for the E.U. than for the U.K.\u201dOf far greater concern will be if other European Union countries attempt their own exits \u2014 even if their efforts are unsuccessful. More glimmers of no-confidence among nations in the consortium could ultimately lead to a crisis that would be felt far beyond Europe.Consider this: Italy\u2019s government is considering pumping as much as $45 billion into its banking system after the Brexit vote. Shares of the biggest Italian banks have fallen more than 20 percent since the results of the vote were announced. And Italian banks are considered particularly vulnerable because they hold hundreds of billions of euros in bad loans. If Brexit forces a material economic slowdown across the Continent, Italy\u2019s banks \u2014 without a rescue plan \u2014 could significantly suffer.Remember: There\u2019s no need to panic now, at least not yet. But if, down the line, Italy\u2019s economy were to falter and help from the European Union was not forthcoming without tough conditions \u2014 remember Greece and the possibility of Grexit? \u2014 we could witness the seceding of Italy, which will be the third-largest member of the consortium after Germany and France (assuming that Britain does officially leave).That, in turn, could lead to a true catastrophe: Italy would probably be forced to return to the lira, which would most likely be tremendously devalued. An unstable lira would cause huge problems for investors and banks across the globe that have interests in Italy, as well as a massive credit crunch within the country. (By the way, you could replace \u201cItaly\u201d with \u201cSpain\u201d or \u201cPortugal\u201d in this scenario and end up in much the same place.)Long before then, however, there is a decent chance that we will see another country \u2014 probably the Netherlands \u2014 try to make a run for it. After Britain voted to break away from the European Union, Geert Wilders, the populist leader of the Netherlands\u2019 surging anti-immigrant Party for Freedom, posted on Twitter, \u201cHurray for the British.\u201d He added: \u201cNow it\u2019s our turn. It\u2019s time for a Dutch referendum.\u201d He used this hashtag: #ByeByeEU.The Netherlands is a relatively healthy country, so \u2014 as a matter of pure economics \u2014 the repercussions of its leaving the European Union would most likely be muted. But if Brexit wasn\u2019t enough of an inspiration for other fiercely nationalistic and economically healthy countries to seek an exit, watching a place like the Netherlands that actually uses the euro (unlike Britain, which never switched from the pound) could prove to be a convincing model.Richard N. Haass, president of the Council on Foreign Relations, has already predicted that several countries will leave the European Union within the next five years, which is increasingly becoming the conventional wisdom. Given the low growth of so many countries in the union, it is hard to imagine that a populistic revolt won\u2019t emerge.\u201cThe global economy remains stuck in a deflationary expansion of minimal growth and minimal rates,\u201d Merrill Lynch wrote in a note to investors on Monday. \u201cAnd electorates are increasingly voting in the developed world against wage deflation, high unemployment, immigration and inequality.\u201dJames Pethokoukis, a commentator at the American Enterprise Institute, recently found a memorandum written in 2011 during the euro crisis by Willem Buiter, the global chief economist at Citigroup, that imagined the destruction of the European Union. \u201cA breakup of the Euro Area would be rather like the movie \u2018War of the Roses\u2019 version of a divorce: disruptive, destructive and without any winners,\u201d he wrote, describing how \u201ceven a partial one involving the exit of one or more fiscally and competitively weak countries, would be chaotic.\u201dHere\u2019s what would happen: \u201cExit, partial or full, would likely be precipitated by disorderly sovereign defaults in the fiscally weak and uncompetitive member states, whose currencies would weaken dramatically and whose banks would fail,\u201d Mr. Buiter wrote at the time. \u201cIf Spain and Italy were to exit, there would be a collapse of systemically important financial institutions throughout the European Union and North America and years of global depression.\u201dFor now, let\u2019s hope these worst-case scenarios are just that.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "In American Markets, Panic Begins to Subside", "Date": "2016-06-26", "News": "Supported byThe market panic that initially met Britain\u2019s vote to leave the European Union showed signs of subsiding on Monday.While stocks continued to slide for a second trading day, by the close of business Monday a measure of calm appeared to be returning to certain significant corners of the market.The benchmark Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index was stable for most of the day after dropping around 2 percent in the first minutes of trading. It ended the day down 1.8 percent. Markets in Japan and China finished Monday in positive territory.A gauge of expected future volatility in the markets, the so-called VIX, fell on Monday after spiking on Friday, and remained far below the level it reached last summer when problems in the Chinese economy came to the fore.\u201cI\u2019m not expecting contagion here,\u201d said Jack A. Ablin, the chief investment officer at BMO Private Bank, based in Chicago. \u201cWe\u2019re pretty well insulated,\u201d he said of the American economy.The outlook was less sanguine in Europe.Investors continued dumping European stocks and seeking out the safety of gold and bonds on Monday, despite comments from British and European officials intended to calm markets.George Osborne, the British chancellor of the Exchequer, spoke for the first time since the so-called Brexit vote, before markets opened on Monday. He said that while Britain\u2019s public finances would be affected by an exit from the bloc, the broader economy was still in good shape.\u201cOur economy is about as strong as it could be to confront the challenge our country now faces,\u201d Mr. Osborne said. \u201cIt is inevitable, after Thursday\u2019s vote, that Britain\u2019s economy is going to have to adjust to the new situation we find ourselves in.\u201d\u201cWe were prepared for the unexpected,\u201d he added. \u201cWe are equipped for whatever happens.\u201dBut Mr. Osborne\u2019s comments appeared to do little to shore up the nation\u2019s currency. The British pound fell on Monday to its lowest level against the dollar since the 1980s.In another blow to the British economy, the Standard & Poor\u2019s rating agency announced on Monday that it was stripping Great Britain of its AAA rating. The country\u2019s rating was dropped two notches, to AA.Standard & Poor\u2019s analysts said in their report that the vote last week \u201cwill weaken the predictability, stability, and effectiveness of policy making in the U.K. and affect its economy, G.D.P. growth and fiscal and external balances.\u201dThere is still enormous uncertainty about how exactly Britain\u2019s exit will play out, and how it will ripple through the economy. The most obvious victims are likely to be the big European banks, which have relied on an ability to operate easily across borders.Trading in financial stocks like Barclays and Royal Bank of Scotland was briefly suspended on Monday because of precipitous declines.Barclays fell 17 percent on Monday on top of its 17 percent decline on Friday. That brought the bank\u2019s stock below the bottom it reached during the 2011 eurozone crisis, though it remained far above the trough reached during the financial crisis.\u201cBanks are one of the most exposed sectors to Brexit,\u201d Andrew Coombs, a Citigroup analyst, said in a research note distributed on Monday.He noted that British banks were particularly vulnerable \u201cgiven the likely headwinds of a deteriorating domestic economy, and higher risk premia associated with a less predictable political and economic landscape.\u201dBut, he warned, \u201cthe European investment banks are also not immune, with sizable operations in London, which may now need to be reviewed.\u201dItalian officials said on Monday that they were looking at creating what amounted to a bailout fund to help struggling banks in the country.Throughout Europe, however, investors have not been assuming the worst \u2014 they seem to have reserved their harshest punishment so far for bank stocks. By contrast, a broad index of European shares, the Euro Stoxx, fell 2.8 percent on Monday but was still above the lows it reached earlier this year.In the United States, the S.&P. 500-stock index finished down 1.8 percent, or 36.87 points, at 2,000.54 on Monday. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 1.5 percent, or 260.51 points, to 17,140.24. The Nasdaq composite was down 2.4 percent, or 113.54 points, to 4,594.44.Some economists said that the turmoil in Europe could slightly stunt American growth. Goldman Sachs economists said on Monday that they had reduced their estimates for American economic growth in the second half of 2016, to 2 percent from 2.25 percent.But other analysts were far more optimistic. Pantheon Macroeconomics said on Monday that it still anticipated American economic growth to gain steam this year, driven by improving consumer confidence.For American investors, the biggest fallout from the British vote may be the influence that it has on the Federal Reserve and its plans for raising interest rates in the economy.Traders were betting on Monday that the Fed would have to keep rates lower for longer, which could help stimulate the economy. Janet L. Yellen, the Fed chairwoman, was supposed to attend a meeting of central bank chiefs this week in Portugal, but she called that off after the British vote last week.In Japan, Prime Minister Shinzo Abe held an emergency meeting on Monday with officials from the nation\u2019s central bank and Finance Ministry to discuss how to contain the fallout from the vote in Britain, which pummeled markets in Japan and elsewhere on Friday.Japan was hit especially hard. The Nikkei suffered its biggest one-day point drop in 16 years and the yen jumped about 5 percent against the dollar.On Monday, Japanese authorities issued their strongest warning yet that they were prepared to intervene in the market to curb the rise of the yen. Markets elsewhere in the region were mostly little changed. Japan, however, generally fears an excessively strong currency, which can hurt the country\u2019s economy by making its exports more expensive and consequently less competitive.\u201cThere is still uncertainty and risk in the financial markets, and it\u2019s important that we continue to work for stability,\u201d Mr. Abe told reporters after a meeting at the prime minister\u2019s office.He added that he had instructed the finance minister, Taro Aso, to \u201ccoordinate with the Bank of Japan and be even more mindful of movements in the markets, including the currency market.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated how much Japan\u2019s Nikkei 225 index rose on Monday. It rose 2.4 percent, not 2.9 percent.David Jolly, Prashant S. Rao and Jonathan Soble contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

Blue Coat had filed plans to go public and did not formally put itself up for sale, but it received interest from potential buyers and held talks primarily with Symantec.

It still has formidable competition from Didi, the market leader in China, which just raised $7 billion. And some of the same investors that have backed Uber are also backing Didi, including BlackRock and Tiger Global. (Some may be hoping that Uber might one day merge its Chinese operation with Didi.)The question between now and the probable initial public offering in a few years is whether it will have starved all of its competitors along the way.Shares in Credit Suisse have sunk by more than 50 percent since Mr. Thiam took over last summer. Last week, its stock touched a new low of 11.8 Swiss francs, or about $12.25, but recovered a little and closed at 12.83 Swiss francs on Monday. Mr. Thiam has been blunt about how the bank needed to shift from its model of riskier, capital-intensive trading and banking business toward providing financial services to wealthy clients in fast-growing emerging markets. But his brusque manner and the perception that he is not making the same sacrifices that he asks of the bankers have created tension. Mr. Herro also said that he saw no need for Credit Suisse to raise new funds.Stan Miranda, the chief executive at Partners Capital in London, said his fund had put on smaller trades and  expected sterling to fall as much as 15 percent on an exit vote. Banks have also scaled back risk limits, partly because of postcrisis regulations, and market makers have been scarred by the sharp moves that came after the Swiss National Bank\u00e2\u0080\u0099s decision to ditch its currency cap in 2015.

He didn\u2019t sleep long.Mr. Hickmore, 46, helps oversee $13.7 billion for Aberdeen Asset Management, a global investment firm. He switched on his TV at 3:30 a.m., and said he thought, \u201cHang on a sec, this doesn\u2019t look like it\u2019s going to go the way the market priced in.\u201dThe financial district stretches from the stately offices of hedge funds in Mayfair to Canary Wharf, where glass-and-steel bank headquarters have replaced abandoned docks. But its heart, Britain\u2019s version of Wall Street, is known as the City of London or simply \u201cthe City,\u201d referring to roughly a square mile where you can find the old walls of Londinium, the city built by the Romans.Brexit is on everyone\u2019s mind, as bankers absorb a second Big Bang as profound as the one three decades ago \u2014 though one without a road map forward.After the tumult of Friday, bankers, traders and other finance types could be found at the Pavilion End, a City pub in the shadow of St. Paul\u2019s Cathedral. A group stood outside the pub, as is the custom in London when the weather allows. Some had their jackets off, white dress shirts and suit trousers with ties, and held pints of beer as they pondered where the City\u2019s jobs might move. Paris. Amsterdam. Frankfurt seemed the most likely. But few seemed excited about the prospect of living there.\u201cThere\u2019s no confidence; it\u2019s been shredded,\u201d said Andrew Towill, 28, one of four employees of a multinational real estate consultancy who were also standing outside the Pavilion End.Anna Benjamin, 50, said not much was different on Friday in their business \u201cbecause we\u2019re dealing with projects that are ongoing. But there is a definite feeling that once they start coming to an end, where is the next one coming from?\u201dJohn Lowes, 35, said there was a general \u201cfeeling of real concern.\u201d\u201cNow what happens? We just don\u2019t know,\u201d he added.The group worried about returning to the kind of conditions they faced during the financial crisis.\u201cWe don\u2019t want to go back to that,\u201d Robert Harper, 37, said. \u201cThere were times when I had nothing to do.\u201dAs with every financial shock, there are winners and losers.Many of the less well-to-do will suffer. While older voters led the charge for Brexit, the value of their pensions took a hit along with the British stock market and economy.Executives described a tense night on trading floors. At Goldman Sachs, there was activity on the London floor throughout the night, with TVs blaring referendum returns. In a note to JPMorgan Chase employees, Jamie Dimon, the chief executive, said the firm \u201cprocessed 1,000 trading tickets per second at one point,\u201d many times the typical trading volume. The chief executive at Citigroup in New York, Michael Corbat, personally walked the trading floor, a relatively rare move for a Wall Street chief these days.It will take days and months to sift through the ramifications for the markets and the City, as Britain negotiates its post-Brexit relationships and global financial firms figure out their next steps. The aftermath of a Leave vote was predictable in many ways, unforeseen in others.Earlier this week, at a conference, Andrew Jackson, chief investment officer at Cairn Capital, a London-based firm, was asked about the best way to prepare for a possible Brexit vote.Much further, it turned out. RBS fell 18 percent on Friday, Barclays 17.9 percent and Lloyds Banking Group 21 percent.Many hedge funds stayed on the sidelines heading into the referendum, looking to pounce in the aftermath.\u201cIt is early to tell, but there will be very few that have done exceedingly well or exceedingly badly,\u201d said Anthony Lawler, an executive at GAM, an investment management firm that oversees portfolios of hedge funds for institutional clients.Many investors, he said, preferred voting on probabilities, not binary yes-or-no outcomes. \u201cWhen there\u2019s a massive sudden move, that\u2019s very difficult to trade.\u201dMr. Hickmore said he had already reduced risk by moving away from bets that bond yields would go higher.\u201cYou can\u2019t hold that choice through a U.K. referendum vote like this, because the risk of you being wrong is so high,\u201d he said.Bets were being made, however. The pound rallied sharply Thursday as polls indicated a vote to remain in the European Union, only to collapse starting late Thursday night, well before the official results were announced.Mr. Odey, who declined to comment, has long supported a Brexit vote. After suffering losses in his portfolio earlier this year, his faith in Brexit paid off.\u201cI would rather we were out of Europe,\u201d Mr. Odey said in an interview in 2014, adding then that it was a \u201cprobably a protest vote.\u201dBack in the City, some less-celebrated finance types, cramped outside a dark pub called Ye Olde Watling, contemplated an uncertain future. One wondered aloud whether he could still build a career in London. With the prospect of Frankfurt in the air, another joked that he was giving German lessons now.Advertisement"}

Her husband, Brendan Cox, her children, 3 and 5, her sister and her parents were in the gallery to listen to the tributes.Mr. Cameron called Ms. Cox \u201ca loving, determined, passionate and progressive politician who epitomized the best of humanity and who proved so often the power of politics to make our world a better place.\u201dThe prime minister said he had first met Ms. Cox in 2006 in the Darfur region of Sudan. He was the relatively new leader of the Conservative Party, which was then in opposition, and she was a relief worker for Oxfam, a British-based charity. Her decision to receive him \u201chad not been entirely welcome,\u201d Mr. Cameron said to gentle laughter, but \u201cit was typical of her determination to reach across party lines on issues that she felt were so much more important than party politics.\u201dMr. Cameron added: \u201cWe express our anger at the sickening and despicable attack that killed her as she did her job, serving her constituents on the streets of Birstall.\u201dEchoing the sentiment of others, he said her legacy must be a politics of \u201chope not fear, respect not hate, unity not division.\u201dMr. Kinnock hit out at a poster calling for Britain to leave the European Union that showed a line of refugees under the headline \u201cBreaking Point.\u201d Ms. Cox, who favored remaining in the bloc, \u201cwould have responded with outrage and with robust rejection of the calculated narrative of cynicism, division and despair that it represents,\u201d he said.Markets have been jittery as polls have fluctuated, but, on Monday, the pound surged against the dollar, and stocks in Europe rose, as traders took note of new polls suggesting a shift in momentum toward remaining in the union.Also on Monday, the man accused of killing Ms. Cox confirmed to a London court by video link from Belmarsh prison, in southeastern London, that he was Thomas Mair, 52. Wearing a gray tracksuit, he sat with his arms folded. On Saturday, when charged and asked his name, he had answered: \u201cMy name is death to traitors, freedom for Britain.\u201dMr. Mair did not apply for bail and has not yet entered a plea, his lawyer said, and he will remain in custody.

{"Headline": "Is \u2018Brexit\u2019 Europe\u2019s Lehman Brothers Moment?", "Date": "2016-06-28", "News": "Supported byAftershocksIs this another Lehman Brothers moment?The short answer is \u201cno.\u201dThe long answer is \u201cno, but.\u201dLehman was a financial event with long-lasting geopolitical consequences. \u201cBrexit\u201d is a geopolitical event that may or may not turn out to have long-lasting financial consequences.The most fundamental similarity between Britain\u2019s vote and the Lehman failure is that both were deep shocks to markets and upended the understanding that investors, banks and policy makers had about the way the world worked.In 2008, the widespread view was that the United States government would not allow a large, interconnected financial firm to go bankrupt, and that Lehman would be bailed out just as Bear Stearns and Fannie Mae were. In 2016, the assumption was that while Britain might threaten to leave the European Union, its voters would never actually choose such a disruptive path.So in both cases, an event prompted a reordering of what we thought was plausible. In 2008 it went like this: If the United States would let Lehman fail, could Goldman Sachs and Citigroup be the next dominoes to fall? If an investment bank like Lehman could default, could any financial firm really be trusted?And Lehman Brothers had $619 billion in liabilities, which by definition were somebody else\u2019s assets. Who knew for sure what other banks were sitting on huge losses from Lehman\u2019s bankruptcy that would make them insolvent?Against that backdrop, banks globally hoarded cash and became highly reluctant to lend to anyone. It was a modern version of a bank run.There are few signs any of that is happening in response to Brexit. European bank stocks have fallen sharply since the June 23 vote. They\u2019ve actually fallen by a larger percentage than during the first three trading days after the Lehman declaration. But nothing in the bank lending markets suggests widespread panic.In the three trading days after the Lehman bankruptcy announcement, the premium banks charged to lend to one another in dollars rose by about half a percentage point. A comparable measure of the health of the British banking system has risen only 0.08 percent since Brexit, and actually was down Tuesday. The spread has risen even less in euro-denominated bank lending.That\u2019s good news. It suggests investors think that profits by banks will get hammered by Brexit \u2014 but not that this will endanger their very solvency.Banks may be facing huge costs as they weigh whether to relocate operations from London to continental Europe. Investors will find uncertainty around their businesses and leaner profits as central banks potentially cut interest rates further. But collectively, it appears that investors believe that banks will weather the storm, or at least that governments won\u2019t let them fail.So the mechanisms of financial contagion that turned the collapse of the fourth-largest American investment bank into a global crisis just don\u2019t seem to be gearing up. And that is reflected even in the most widely followed markets. Yes, the British pound is down sharply on currency markets. But the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 stock index is down only 4.5 percent, and is still above its levels from as recently as March.But if financial contagion doesn\u2019t appear to be a grave threat, political contagion does.The modern global economy is built on the notion of a free flow of trade, capital and people among the major advanced nations of Europe, North America and Asia. The European Union has been a key vehicle through which that modern order has evolved.Britain\u2019s E.U. exit won\u2019t by itself change that, and even British advocates of leaving the trading bloc say that they want continued good relations, trade and otherwise, with Europe. Things might work out just fine, with perhaps a more inward-focused Britain but no other major changes to this global financial and economic order.But if this is just a first step toward raising much higher walls between the major powers of Europe \u2014 if countries like France, Spain, Italy and even Germany retreat inward and build distrust that rips at that order?It will make Lehman seem like a historical asterisk.In September 2008, no one predicted that the Lehman bankruptcy could lead to a Greek sovereign debt crisis that would halt half a century of progress toward European unity. The risk with Brexit is, similarly, not in the consequences we know, but in the ones that we don\u2019t know.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Four Not-So-Obvious Things to Consider When Deciding to Buy or Rent", "Date": "2016-06-02", "News": "Supported byReal EstateWhether to buy or rent a home is among the biggest financial decisions most of us make. It is basically a complex math problem in which the reward for getting it right can be tens or hundreds of thousands of dollars \u2014 and the punishment for getting it wrong similarly enormous.These dimensions have inherent but hard-to-calculate value. They have to do with how owning a home lets you stop worrying about rent increases, forces you to save money and gives you certain tax benefits, and on the flip side, how renting means you don\u2019t have to worry about the unpredictable costs of maintaining a home. Anyone trying to make a housing decision should at least think about them a bit before taking, or not taking, the plunge.Suppose you live in a city that you find desirable and could envision living in for a very long time. Suppose you work in a field in which you can\u2019t plausibly expect your income to rise significantly in the decades ahead.That makes a case for buying over renting.The choice between buying a home and renting one is among the biggest financial decisions that many adults make.Buying a home is a way of locking in an affordable place to live, essentially an insurance policy against escalating rents. If you rent, you are forever at risk of your region\u2019s becoming newly popular, attracting an influx of people and high-paying jobs that drives up your cost of living beyond what your income can support.Of course, your region may not be one of those new boom areas, in which case this insurance policy would prove unnecessary; you could even end up in a place with falling rents and home values, like Detroit in the last couple of decades. But that\u2019s the nature of insurance: You may pay for it but turn out not to need it.Oh, and some places have rent control laws that might protect a long-term renter. But keep in mind, those laws can always be changed \u2014 and they can create inflexibility, making it impossible to move to a more suitable home in the same location without seeing a steep rise in rent.How much is this insurance policy worth? If taken to an extreme, it could lead you to make bad decisions. During the housing boom at the middle of the last decade, people used \u201cIf I don\u2019t buy now, I won\u2019t be able to afford to buy tomorrow\u201d as a rationale to overpay for homes.Two factors that might help shape your decision:How disruptive would it be for you to move somewhere else? The more disruptive, the more you should value this insurance against higher rents.How freely does your city allow new home building? Rents are less likely to increase sharply if the housing supply can rise to meet new demand.Sometimes people say that renting is \u201cjust throwing money away,\u201d which is a little misleading. You could just as easily say that when you buy a home, the mortgage interest and property taxes you pay are throwing money away.But that line of thinking does get one dimension of home buying right: When you buy a home with a standard mortgage, you gradually pay off the balance \u2014 slowly at first, faster as time goes on. Someone who takes out a $500,000, 30-year fixed-rate mortgage at 4 percent has paid down about $8,000 of debt after one year, and $47,000 after five years.In terms of a personal balance sheet, less debt is equivalent to more savings \u2014 assuming the value of the home is stable or rising. People who buy houses while in their early 30s with a 30-year mortgage and stay in it will own a valuable asset free and clear when they hit retirement age. They could either live rent- or mortgage-payment free during retirement, or sell the house, move somewhere cheaper and have a nice pile of cash savings.Theoretically, one could construct the same strategy while renting, putting money away into a savings or investment account while paying a landlord for a place to live. The beauty of owning is that it happens automatically, by virtue of paying your mortgage. That means less temptation to spend the money instead of saving in a given month; you can get access to it through a home-equity loan, but that requires making the active effort of going to a bank.So if, psychologically, you find it hard to save and are always tempted to take a vacation rather than plow money into a brokerage account, buying a house with borrowed money is a way to trick yourself into doing so and help ensure you have a meaningful net worth when retirement rolls around.Suppose you had plenty of cash and were trying to decide whether to buy a home outright, or invest most of the money in stocks and bonds and use some of it to pay rent on a home.At first glance, renting might make sense. The stock market, for example, has a higher return than real estate historically, so in theory that portfolio could pay the rent and keep growing rapidly.But a quirk of the tax code tends to obliterate that advantage. When you invest money in financial assets, you have to pay taxes on the returns they offer \u2014 the interest paid by corporate bonds, for example, or the dividends from stocks, or the capital gains when you sell either for a profit.When you buy a home for your own use, the return it pays you \u2014 namely, giving you a place to live, not interest or dividend payments \u2014 is tax free. This is what economists call \u201cimputed rent,\u201d and it is one of the subtle advantages to buying that is hard to account for in standard buy versus rent analysis.It\u2019s a little more complicated if you buy a home using a mortgage, but the same dynamic applies. Your down payment could earn a fully taxable return as an investment, but give you a tax-free return \u2014 free rent \u2014 if used to buy a home.That\u2019s not the end of the favorable tax treatment, though. If you buy a portfolio of stocks and then sell them at a profit 10 years later, you pay capital gains tax on every dollar of what you made. But when selling a primary residence at a profit, the first $250,000 in profits for a single person and first $500,000 for a married couple is tax free.The home mortgage interest deduction gets a lot of attention as a distortion of the tax code that makes home buying more attractive, but these more subtle dimensions can be just as significant.These have all been quirks of homeownership that tilt the economics in favor of buying. But here\u2019s an important one that points in the other direction.Both renters and homeowners pay costs for maintenance on their properties; they just do so in different ways with very different implications.If you rent and the dishwasher breaks, your landlord is on the hook to repair or replace it. You may ultimately pay the bill in the sense that expected maintenance costs are built into the rent you pay, but you have no risk of that number varying depending on luck.Homeowners, on the other hand, face not a set monthly payment covering the costs of repairs and maintenance, but a great deal of volatility.An urgent $2,000 air-conditioner repair bill, or even a $15,000 roof repair, might arise at any time. Other things, like replacing a shabby carpet or applying a fresh coat of paint, allow the homeowner more control over when the transaction happens, but still, it\u2019s a lumpy pattern of expenditures.Most rent versus buy calculators ask users to put in an estimate of monthly maintenance costs for the home they would purchase. But the issue is not the expected average of those costs but the possibility of their lumpiness and unpredictability. That can be especially problematic for a person who empties savings to buy a home only to need to pay for an expensive repair a few months later.None of these factors alone should be decisive, and the basics that you plug into online calculators \u2014 like the monthly mortgage payment, rent on a comparable place and closing costs \u2014 are more important. But when it\u2019s a close call, weighing these factors carefully \u2014 and how much they apply in your particular case \u2014 can help you make a smarter housing decision.The continuation of a cover article this weekend about deciding whether to buy a home or rent appears twice in some copies, on Pages 12 and 13.

{"Headline": "Microsoft-LinkedIn Deal Ignites Twitter Speculation", "Date": "2016-06-16", "News": "Supported byCommon SenseYouTube and Google.Instagram and Facebook.Tumblr and Yahoo.LinkedIn and Microsoft.Twitter and \u2026 ?In the relentless push toward consolidation in technology and social media, Twitter, the social networking site that allows users to send and receive short messages, or tweets, has been the perennial bridesmaid. But this week\u2019s megadeal between Microsoft and LinkedIn has renewed speculation on Wall Street that Twitter needs to attract a suitor or risk being overtaken by ever-larger competitors.\u201cIf current trends continue, it\u2019s inevitable that Twitter will get acquired,\u201d Robert Peck, managing director and internet equity analyst at SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, told me this week. Mr. Peck has long considered a Twitter deal likely, and he renewed that prediction last week even before the Microsoft-LinkedIn deal was announced. This week numerous analysts piled on to the notion.Investors seem to agree: At one point this week, Twitter shares were up 17 percent on deal speculation, pushing the company\u2019s market capitalization to nearly $11.5 billion.But investors expecting a big deal at a LinkedIn premium in the next few months may want to think twice.Given the similarities between LinkedIn and Twitter, it\u2019s not hard to see why shareholders would be betting on a sudden windfall. Until Monday\u2019s announcement, both companies\u2019 stocks were trading at relative bargain prices, both down about 42 percent in the last six months. (Before this week\u2019s rally, Twitter shares were barely half their $26 initial public offering price.)Both offer global reach and a large number of users: 433 million registered members worldwide for LinkedIn and 310 million active monthly users for Twitter (the numbers aren\u2019t directly comparable because not all LinkedIn members are active users.)Apart from Facebook and several Chinese social networking companies, Twitter has the largest user base among independent social network companies, according to Statista. (Statista estimates LinkedIn\u2019s active monthly users at 100 million.)Twitter solidified its place as a hub of the global news conversation during and after last weekend\u2019s massacre at a gay nightclub in Orlando.That kind of reach is extremely difficult to replicate in an increasingly crowded digital world. \u201cWe continue to believe that Twitter remains a platform with massive opportunity,\u201d said Ken Sena, managing director and consumer internet analyst at Evercore.Mark Mahaney, technology analyst at RBC Capital Markets, agreed: \u201cThey\u2019ve got a great brand, a large platform and a unique value proposition.\u201dA megadeal with a much bigger partner would give Twitter \u201cscale,\u201d which is becoming all-important in a Silicon Valley now dominated by a handful of tech giants.As the LinkedIn chief executive, Jeff Weiner, put it in his memo to employees explaining the deal, \u201cImagine a world where we\u2019re no longer looking up at tech titans such as Apple, Google, Microsoft, Amazon and Facebook and wondering what it would be like to operate at their extraordinary scale \u2014 because we\u2019re one of them. Imagine a world where we\u2019re not reacting to the intensifying competitive landscape \u2014 we\u2019re leading it with advantages most companies can only dream of leveraging.\u201dFor Jack Dorsey, one of Twitter\u2019s founders and its chief executive, the right deal wouldn\u2019t even mean giving up his leadership role or independence. Following the lead of Alphabet and Facebook, which have given considerable autonomy to the large operations they\u2019ve acquired, Microsoft promised Mr. Weiner that he could run LinkedIn as a \u201cfully independent entity.\u201dThe Microsoft chief executive, Satya Nadella, \u201chad me at \u2018independence,\u2019\u201d Mr. Weiner wrote in his memo.But if the reasons for a Twitter deal seem so obvious and compelling, why hasn\u2019t it happened yet? The fact is that Twitter faces some unique challenges, and just because it\u2019s a big social media site and prominent Silicon Valley denizen doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s going to attract a suitor. Yahoo has been openly shopping itself for months, and would-be buyers haven\u2019t exactly been beating down its door.For at least some of the all-important (to advertisers) millennial users, that may well be the case. Jacob Shiansky, 24, who was visiting Manhattan from South Carolina, told me this week that he couldn\u2019t remember his Twitter password and hasn\u2019t visited the site in six months.\u201cIt\u2019s too much business and political promotions rather than a social media site,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you want to see Trump\u2019s ridiculous tweets, you can go on Facebook or CNN. You don\u2019t have to bother with Twitter.\u201dHe said his friends feel the same way. \u201cIt\u2019s all Facebook, Instagram and Snapchat,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re quick and they\u2019re fun. You don\u2019t have to waste your time typing.\u201dI can\u2019t say my own Twitter use has been all that prolific, even though I sometimes use it to comment on my column and to recommend stories by other journalists. But I\u2019ve stopped following some people who spew what seems a constant stream of drivel. Days go by when I don\u2019t look at the site.User engagement has become an increasingly important metric for advertisers, because it enhances ad exposure and gives the site more information about its users, enabling it to target ads better.\u201cWe regularly survey advertisers and ask them to rank internet platforms,\u201d Mr. Mahaney, of RBC Capital Markets, said. \u201cGoogle ranks first, Facebook second and Twitter is somewhere down the list. That\u2019s been true for every survey,\u201d he said.Twitter is increasingly seen as a source of news and information more than user interaction. That makes it a natural fit for a news organization seeking to extend its digital footprint, and rumors that News Corporation was interested briefly buoyed the stock this year. (News Corporation denied the reports and no bid materialized.)Few traditional media companies, though, are big enough to swallow Twitter at its current market value. News Corporation, one of the richest, has a market capitalization of just under $7 billion.Mr. Peck and Mr. Mahaney cited Alphabet as the most likely buyer. The two companies already have many ties: Several Twitter executives used to work at Alphabet\u2019s Google, tweets appear in Google search results and advertisers can buy ads on Twitter through Google\u2019s DoubleClick bid manager.Google\u2019s own social networking effort, Google Plus, hasn\u2019t caught on. Google undoubtedly has the size and scale to absorb Twitter.But Alphabet\u2019s founders have said repeatedly they don\u2019t want to create content. So if Twitter is increasingly seen as a real-time news and content site rather than a social media network, it doesn\u2019t fit into Google\u2019s strategic objectives. Those, of course, could always change.Both Google and Facebook have reportedly looked at Twitter and passed. (Neither company would comment on those reports. Jim Prosser, a Twitter spokesman, also declined to comment for this column.)But Facebook has in many ways emerged as Twitter\u2019s biggest competitor. A deal would raise antitrust issues, and it\u2019s not clear why Facebook would pay a premium for something it could largely build on its own.From a strategic standpoint, the cable media giants Verizon Communications and Comcast might make sense. Both are big enough, both are already content providers and both have shown interest in expanding their digital presence. But it\u2019s not clear either company has the expertise to solve Twitter\u2019s major problems, which are far afield from the cable network business.A lot of this week\u2019s deal talk seems more like wishful thinking among Twitter investors desperate for a LinkedIn-style exit strategy. That may be slow in coming. Even Mr. Peck of SunTrust doesn\u2019t expect a deal before 2017 at the earliest, because it\u2019s still early in Mr. Dorsey\u2019s latest turnaround effort.Others are even more skeptical. \u201cI can see the argument for it, but I\u2019m not betting on a deal,\u201d Mr. Mahaney said. \u201cThere just aren\u2019t many logical buyers.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Buybacks by Companies Like Apple May Signal Danger, Not Growth", "Date": "2016-06-23", "News": "Supported byStrategiesBut Apple and the stock market would probably be in worse shape now if not for an important factor: Companies like Apple have been buying billions of dollars\u2019 worth of their own shares at a record-breaking pace, returning money to shareholders even as earnings lag.At the moment, corporate America is sitting on an enormous cash hoard. Many companies have been using the money in an epic share-buying spree \u2014 one that has increased in intensity even as earnings have declined. In the 12 months through March, operating earnings for the companies in the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index dropped to $854.9 billion from $989 billion, but buybacks increased to $589 billion from $538.1 billion. That is the largest total for buybacks ever in a 12-month period, according to a report from Howard Silverblatt, senior index analyst at S&P Dow Jones Indices.While Apple ranked second in buybacks to Gilead Sciences in the first quarter, it has been the undisputed king of buybacks over some longer periods. Apple spent $36.8 billion on buybacks in the 12 months through March, more than double the $16.6 billion spent by Microsoft, the next-ranking company. And over the five years through March, Apple bought back $116.6 billion worth of its own shares, followed by Microsoft with $45.7 billion, Pfizer with $44.9 billion and Oracle with $43.7 billion.A recent surge in buybacks may have been stimulated by problems in the stock market, which fell sharply at the beginning of the year. In the first quarter, Mr. Silverblatt said, \u201cthe pace of buybacks was partially driven by companies supporting their stock during the opening downturn.\u201d More than three-fifths of the S.&P. 500 companies bought back at least some of their own shares in the quarter, he said, and 139 bought enough over 12 months to reduce their share count by at least 4 percent.As a matter of simple math, reducing the number of shares by 4 percent will increase earnings per share by 4 percent, too, and will tend to bolster short-term prices.Buybacks are a critical part of Goldman\u2019s positive stock market outlook for the remainder of 2016: \u201cWe maintain our forecast that net buybacks will equal $450 billion in 2016 and remain the largest source of U.S. equity demand this year,\u201d the company said.Low and even negative interest rates resulting from the sluggish global economy and from the expansionary monetary policies of the Federal Reserve and other central banks have been enabling big corporations to borrow money cheaply, even when those companies\u2019 earnings have declined, and even when they have had no immediate productive use for the funds.Such maneuvers often produce good results for stocks over the short term. Over longer periods, however, unless earnings grow substantially, financial engineering like this will take you only so far.For now, buyback authorizations by American companies continue to increase, and there is so much cash on hand that the current trend can easily continue for many months. At some point, buybacks won\u2019t be an elixir for share prices. They will be a symptom of an overextended market.Twitter: @jeffsommerAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Workers\u2019 Wages Rebound, While Wall Street Squirms", "Date": "2016-06-04", "News": "Supported byStrategiesWall Street hasn\u2019t had much to cheer about lately. But there are some signs that rank-and-file workers do.Where the economy is heading now isn\u2019t clear. But consider the overall picture since the recession ended in 2009. Until about a year ago, big businesses and investors prospered, despite extremely slow economic growth, while wages for most employees languished.As the Federal Reserve and other central banks pumped out money, corporations racked up handsome profits, and those fortunate enough to hold shares in big companies made fortunes. If you had invested $10,000 in a Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 index fund at the end of February 2009, it would have more than tripled by the end of last year, including dividends.Rising corporate profits provided fuel for the sizzling stock market. By the fourth quarter of 2011, pretax corporate profits reached 14.5 percent of national income, the highest level since 1950, according to the federal Bureau of Economic Analysis data compiled by Edward Yardeni, an independent market researcher.What was good for business wasn\u2019t great for workers, however. By 2012, labor\u2019s share of the corporate income pie had dropped to the lowest level since 1951, the Economic Policy Institute, a progressive research group, found. Companies bolstered profits by cutting costs \u2014 including the cost of labor \u2014 and they got away with it because unemployment was high and jobs were scarce.Almost imperceptibly, the recovery entered a new stage. Over the last year or so, conditions appeared to have changed \u2014 for business, investors and workers.For many rank-and-file workers, the labor market improved significantly, even if the gains have been uneven. The unemployment rate dropped to 4.7 percent from 5 percent in May, the Labor Department reported on Friday, a bright spot in a report filled mainly with grim numbers. For example, job creation slackened sharply, with a net gain of a mere 38,000 jobs. But the report also confirmed that hourly wages have been rising, for a gain of 2.5 percent for the year.On Wednesday, in the survey known as the \u201cbeige book,\u201d the Federal Reserve reported that \u201ctight labor markets were widely noted,\u201d and pay raises were \u201cconcentrated in areas of labor tightness.\u201dPurchasing power for many workers has finally climbed back to prerecession levels. By March, using inflation-adjusted figures, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that median weekly wages had at last surpassed their 2009 peak.Mr. Bivens cautioned that the real-wage improvement last year was at least partly because of unusually low inflation, and not entirely because of monetary wage increases. Oil, gas and other commodity prices plummeted last year, making wage growth, after adjusting for inflation, look relatively high. \u201cIt\u2019s good news, but it\u2019s not clear whether that growth rate for real wages is sustainable,\u201d he said.Still, labor\u2019s share of the corporate income pie has unquestionably been growing, though it hasn\u2019t regained the prerecession levels of 2007. Reaching that modest goal will require further economic growth. \u201cWe\u2019re slowly making headway, but we have a while to go before I\u2019d say conditions were normal,\u201d Mr. Bivens said.On the other hand, from the standpoint of corporate executives and stock market investors, conditions have worsened considerably over the last year. The market has struggled to hold its own. The S.&P. 500 hasn\u2019t reached a new peak since May 2015. Corporate profits, which had supported the long bull market in stocks, have been weak. In the first quarter of 2016, earnings declined 5 percent compared with the same period a year earlier, Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S estimated.On Tuesday, Mr. Yardeni summarized the year this way: \u201cLabor compensation is up 5 percent while profits are down 5.8 percent. Workers finally may be gaining income share as the labor market has tightened, boosting both employment and hourly pay. This development is squeezing profit margins.\u201dRising incomes spurred consumer spending, which grew in April at its fastest rate since 2014. Inflation remains very low but has been rising. Investors are betting that on the heels of the latest jobs report, the Federal Reserve won\u2019t raise interest rates this month.Further wage increases and a sustained uptick in inflation could induce the Fed to act later on. But unless such developments are accompanied by much stronger economic growth, neither workers nor businesses nor investors are likely to celebrate very loudly.An article last Sunday about signs of rising wages as the labor market tightens misspelled the surname of the Economic Policy Institute\u2019s director of research and policy, who tracks wage trends. He is Josh Bivens, not Bevins.Twitter: @jeffsommerAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Credit Suisse Chief Contends With Rising Tensions, and a Sinking Stock", "Date": "2016-06-20", "News": "Supported byAnother downturn in the stock price of Credit Suisse has put Tidjane Thiam, the bank\u2019s embattled chief executive, on the defensive \u2014 again.On Friday, Mr. Thiam sent employees a memorandum that said hedge funds were betting against shares of Credit Suisse \u2014 taking the view that Mr. Thiam would have to raise more capital from investors. Credit Suisse officials say the chief executive regularly sends updates to employees.Mr. Thiam called these concerns unfounded and said they were a reflection of how market conditions have become difficult for Credit Suisse and other European banks.Since he took over last summer as chief executive at Credit Suisse \u2014 which has large operations in New York and London \u2014 its stock has sunk by over 50 percent. Last week, it touched a new low of 11.8 Swiss francs, or about $12.25.Mr. Thiam has been forceful and blunt in describing how the bank\u2019s previous model of relying on riskier, capital-intensive trading and banking businesses needed to be revised. Instead, he has said, the focus should be on providing a range of financial services to wealthy clients in fast-growing emerging markets.But the chief executive\u2019s brusque manner and a perception among bankers that he is not subjecting himself to the same sacrifices that he is asking of them has created tension within the bank \u2014 made worse by the stock\u2019s continuing slump.In his memo, Mr. Thiam said that in the next month he would be embarking on a trip that would include stops in New York, London and Singapore, to meet with clients and investors to talk about his plans for the bank.In that vein, he met last week in Zurich with one of his largest investors, David Herro of Harris Associates, which owns nearly 10 percent of Credit Suisse.Mr. Herro said in an interview that he saw Mr. Thiam as part of a broader tour of the other companies that his mutual fund owns in Europe, but added that they did have a discussion about the new strategy, which Mr. Herro endorsed.\u201cI think he is absolutely right in what he is doing, and you don\u2019t alter it just because people are wailing,\u201d Mr. Herro said. \u201cIf a trader makes money, they get a bonus \u2014 if they lose, the shareholder bites it. These changes have been long overdue.\u201dAs he has done in meetings with investors and clients, Mr. Thiam has blamed upset investment bankers for a negative environment, and he has said repeatedly that he will not backtrack as a result of their complaints.In his memo, though, Mr. Thiam did strive to strike a positive tone in terms of the effort to turn around the global markets division. \u201cSignificant progress with the accelerated restructuring, not only in terms of de-risking and cost reduction but also in reinvigorating our client franchise,\u201d he wrote.Nevertheless, Mr. Herro did say that it is important for Mr. Thiam to do better in terms of getting his message across internally. \u201cIf change is going to happen, it has to be done with good communication and empathy toward employees,\u201d he said.Mr. Herro said in the interview that he saw no need for Credit Suisse to raise new funds. \u201cWith the cash generation they have now, their capital position is fine,\u201d he said.More than most investment banks, Credit Suisse relies on company stock to compensate employees.There are few analysts or investors who think that Mr. Thiam is mistaken in his strategy, which is in line with what other banks in Europe are doing.But even his biggest supporters have started to express some concern that he could be doing a better job communicating his message \u2014 unpleasant as it may be \u2014 to his employees.And while the board has recently said that it supports Mr. Thiam, directors have also been asked numerous questions by shareholders about Mr. Thiam\u2019s ability to push through difficult changes in light of his poor relationship with bankers in the global markets division.A recent report by Switzerland\u2019s central bank found that Credit Suisse and its larger rival, UBS, would each need to raise another 10 billion Swiss francs in capital to meet stringent new bank safety rules being put in place in Switzerland.Mr. Thiam has rejected speculation that the bank\u2019s losses are escalating and that the bank would need to go to investors once again for a fresh round of cash.Last fall, Mr. Thiam raised about $6 billion, or 6 billion Swiss francs, from the market at a price in the low $20s per share. Coming to investors again for cash, so soon after the first effort and with the stock trading at current levels, would be difficult for Mr. Thiam, analysts and investors say.Since hitting a low, the stock has recovered somewhat in recent days, and it closed trading on Monday at 12.83 Swiss francs.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "\u2018Making Monte Carlo,\u2019 by Mark Braude", "Date": "2016-06-01", "News": "Supported byNonfictionWhen you purchase an independently reviewed book through our site, we earn an affiliate commission.Monaco likes to date its birth as a sovereign principality to the seizure of a local fortress by one Francesco Grimaldi on the night of Jan. 8, 1297, but its mutation into an enclave of wealth and privilege was far less heroic: It was a wily Frenchman \u2014 and former cardsharp \u2014 who understood that by giving gambling an aura of class, royalty, millionaires and any number of fools could be persuaded to part with their money.From the moment Fran\u00e7ois Blanc arrived in the rundown Mediterranean city-state in 1863, he set about building a palatial neo-Baroque casino and an \u00adequally elegant Hotel de Paris. And to give some kudos to the rocky oceanfront outside the old town that was chosen for development, he named it after the Grimaldi ruler of the day, Prince Charles III \u2014 or Carlo in the local dialect. With a turn of the wheel, he invented Monte Carlo.\u201cMaking Monte Carlo,\u201d an anecdotal story of how it came about by Mark Braude, a lecturer in history at Stanford, ends rather abruptly in 1930, thus denying us the glamour of Prince Rainier\u2019s marriage to Grace Kelly in 1956, her tragic death in 1982 and the reams of salacious gossip provided by their daughters, Caroline and St\u00e9phanie, and their son, now ruling the place as Prince \u00adAlbert\u202fII. But it is evident that the business model created by Blanc 150 years ago has stood Monaco in good stead.Blanc knew what he was doing because he had done it before. After speculating with stocks and playing the tables across Europe, he and his brother, Louis, set up shop in the German spa of Bad Homburg in 1840. In no time, the town was booming, with the new railroad system bringing gamblers \u2014 Dostoyevsky was among the losers \u2014 from across Europe. For appearance\u2019 sake, they were taking the waters, but the main attraction was roulette.It was no small coup, therefore, when Fran\u00e7ois Blanc \u2014 by then, his brother had died \u2014 was persuaded to apply his formula to Monaco. To do so, he acquired a struggling new company, Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Anonyme des Bains de Mer et du Cercle des \u00c9trangers \u00e0 Monaco (the Company of Sea Bathing and Circle of Foreigners in Monaco), known simply as S.B.M. But with this mouthful of a name came an exclusive 50-year concession to run \u201cgames of chance.\u201dIn practice, S.B.M. also took over running the 499-acre \u00adprincipality, providing successive princes with most of their income along with supplying water and gas to the locals, paving Monaco\u2019s roads, linking the principality by sea to Nice and eventually building its railroad stations. Change came quickly. In 1869, Monaco received nearly 200,000 visitors. That same year, Prince Charles abolished income tax for its residents (which explains why, to this day, Monaco is home to the likes of high-earning tennis stars, Formula One drivers and pop stars).Blanc, who died in 1877, in turn created a dynasty of his own, with S.B.M. run successively by his widow and son. As ever, \u00adsuccess lay in marketing an \u201cillusion of exclusivity\u201d: In the near \u00adpresence of European monarchs, American millionaires and famous \u00adactresses (Sarah Bernhardt performed at the opening of the Monte Carlo Opera in 1879), the middle classes were inveigled to dress, behave and spend above their rank.\u201cBefore entering, one\u2019s outfit first had to pass inspection by the large unsmiling men dressed in blue-and-red uniforms, capped in gold braid, who flanked the building\u2019s heavy doors, and came to be known as the \u2018dress police,\u2019\u200a\u201d Braude writes. Those who won approval then entered a world of luxury. \u201cThe opulent d\u00e9cor hinted at the kind of freedom that could be bought with the wealth that waited at the tables.\u201dKarl Marx, in Monaco on doctor\u2019s orders in 1882, saw through the glitter. Writing to his daughter, he drew a parallel with the mythical principality in Offenbach\u2019s op\u00e9ra bouffe \u201cLa Grande-\u00adDuchesse de G\u00e9rolstein.\u201d \u201cThe economic basis of Monaco-\u00adG\u00e9rolstein is the gambling casino,\u201d he noted. \u201cIf it should close up tomorrow, Monaco-G\u00e9rolstein would go into the grave \u2014 all of it!\u201d But it didn\u2019t.It did, however, have its regular scandals. A bomb exploded in the casino in 1880 and a grenade in 1930, although normality was quickly restored. The sensationalist press also lapped up stories of suicides following catastrophic losses at the tables. \u201cDeath in Monte Carlo was shown as the logical punishment for leaving home, for succumbing to \u00adMammon, for living life at too fast a pace,\u201d Braude notes.And of course no evening was complete without elegantly attired prostitutes and courtesans working the gaming rooms. \u00adTheodore Dreiser seemed fascinated by these \u201cevil, rather glorious and showy spiders spinning nets for none too satisfactory men.\u201d Braude himself adds: \u201cProstitutes were regarded as the ultimate arrivistes, callous social climbers.\u201dWith Monaco reaching the height of its vacuous glory in the 1920s, it was the American publicist Elsa Maxwell who turned a winter resort into a year-round playground. And the Monaco Grand Prix, first held in 1929, became a lasting attraction, one that, as always, gathered the rich and famous around its latest edition on May 29. Clearly, when it comes to Monte Carlo, there is never \u201cno more bets.\u201dAlan Riding is a former European cultural correspondent for The Times.

{"Headline": "Nearly All U.S. Banks Pass Fed\u2019s Stress Test", "Date": "2016-06-29", "News": "Supported byAll but one of the nation\u2019s largest banks earned an unconditional passing grade from federal regulators on their annual stress tests, which measure their preparedness to weather a financial crisis.The one American-based institution that did not pass unconditionally was Morgan Stanley, a Wall Street bank that has been struggling to regain its footing after the financial crisis of 2008. Regulators raised concerns over the company\u2019s internal controls and processes.The Federal Reserve gave failing grades to the American subsidiaries of two European banks, Deutsche Bank and Santander, which both failed in previous years.The banking stress tests \u2014 which measure whether banks have enough capital and liquidity, management controls and other necessary safeguards to survive various worst-case situations \u2014 have been required of banks with more than $50 billion in assets since the passage of the Dodd-Frank Act, which took effect in 2010.The passing grades mean that all of the big banks \u2014 even Morgan Stanley \u2014 will be able to pay dividends and buy back stock from shareholders.On Wednesday, a Fed official said that even with the concerns raised, the stress test results suggest that banks would be able to withstand an event like Britain\u2019s exit from the European Union, which has rocked bank stocks over the last week.Since the financial crisis, banks have been required to create large capital barriers to cushion against losses from a recession or market shock. While the financial system has not encountered any problems close to the mortgage losses of 2008, banks have been able to withstand more recent challenges like the steep drop in oil prices and the turmoil in Europe.While tougher capital requirements may be helping to stabilize the banks, they are hampering profitability. The stock prices of many large banks have languished as investors question whether these companies can increase their profits substantially in such a stringent new regulatory environment.The stress test results announced Wednesday are no doubt a welcome relief, in particular, to Bank of America and Citigroup, which have had difficulty passing the test unconditionally in past years. Both banks have spent tens of millions of dollars and assigned some of their top executives to the task of ensuring that they gain the Fed\u2019s approval.Shortly after the results were made public, Citigroup announced that it would more than triple its dividend, to 16 cents from 5 cents, and buy back as much as $8.6 billion of stock. Bank of America said it would increase its dividend to 7.5 cents from 5 cents and purchase $5 billion in shares.The one American-based bank that did not pass unconditionally was Morgan Stanley. The Fed also gave failing grades to the American subsidiaries of Deutsche Bank and Santander.Even Morgan Stanley came forward to say that it planned to raise its dividend to 20 cents from 15 cents and increase its share buyback program to $3.5 billion for the four quarters beginning July 1, from $2.5 billion in the previous period.The three banks that were called out by the Fed on Wednesday all had big enough financial buffers, the regulators said. Rather, the criticism was with more qualitative aspects of the way the three banks operate internally.At Morgan Stanley, the Fed said, the problems \u201cinclude shortcomings in the firm\u2019s scenario design practices, which do not adequately reflect risks and vulnerabilities specific to the firm, weaknesses in some aspects of the firm\u2019s modeling practices, and weaknesses in governance and controls around both scenario design and modeling practices.\u201dMorgan Stanley will be able to return money to shareholders, as planned, but it will need to improve its internal processes by the end of the year. If the bank does not make those improvements, the Fed could halt the bank\u2019s payouts.The results are an unhappy hiccup for Morgan Stanley, which has been struggling to raise its profits to the level of its competitors\u2019 and is in the middle of a significant cost-cutting campaign.In a statement, the chief executive of Morgan Stanley, James P. Gorman, said, \u201cWe are committed to addressing the Fed\u2019s concerns about our capital planning process and fully expect to meet their requirements within the established time frame.\u201dFor Deutsche Bank and Santander, the failing grades raise bigger concerns about their ability to satisfy American regulators. The Deutsche Bank unit in the United States has failed twice in a row, and Santander three times.In this and previous years, the Fed has applied its tests only to parts of Santander and Deutsche Bank. These two banks, as well as other foreign banks, like Barclays, UBS and Credit Suisse, have large operations in the United States that have not undergone stress tests. But that will soon change. The large foreign banks now have to organize their American operations into a single \u201cintermediate holding company.\u201dNext year, the Fed will do a trial test of these entities and keep the results private. But in 2018, these large holding companies will be subjected to full-fledged tests, and the results will be made public. Failing those stress tests would be much more of a blow to Deutsche Bank and Santander than the hit they took on Wednesday.A Fed official said on Wednesday that all the big banks had been making progress but that Deutsche Bank and Santander still needed to make significant improvements.In a statement, Scott Powell, the chief executive of Santander Holdings USA, said, \u201cWe are financially sound. These results do not affect our ability to serve our customers.\u201dDeutsche Bank also emphasized that even though its American unit had failed the test, it still had adequate capital.\u201cWe appreciate the Federal Reserve\u2019s recognition of our progress, and we will implement the lessons learned this year in order to strengthen our capital planning process,\u201d Bill Woodley, deputy chief executive of Deutsche Bank Americas said in a statement.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "\u2018Brexit\u2019 Plan for the Financial World? Cross Your Fingers", "Date": "2016-06-15", "News": "Supported byAmong those who manage gobs of money, the possibility that Britain might actually disavow the European Union seemed until recently like a remote and even outlandish possibility.But about a week before voters go to the polls to determine their future, masters of finance are suddenly absorbing the prospect that Britain might really walk, unleashing anxiety and uncertainty throughout the global economy.Angst has seeped into the calculations. As investors digest the possibility that the largest marketplace on earth may be days away from a messy alteration, they have been yanking money out of riskier storehouses like stocks and putting it into safer instruments like bonds. The British pound and London stocks have been falling in frenzied trading.The conversation is now focused on managing the risks of Brexit. The trouble is that the worries are so diffuse and rife with unknowns that any attack plan amounts to an exercise in guesswork and hope. Executives, bankers and bureaucrats are grappling with something that could be minor or momentous and has never happened before.Maybe the Brexit \u2014 for British exit \u2014 would merely lop value from the pound before traders turned their attention to a more consequential plot twist elsewhere. Perhaps it would inspire separatist movements from Scotland to Spain, embolden anti-trade populists across the Continent and reinvigorate existential questions gnawing at the common euro currency. That could sow fear across world markets.A Brexit might spook investors into entrusting their money only to the safest repositories like American Treasuries. That could strengthen the American dollar and weaken American exports, while starving riskier emerging markets of investment.Whatever stories policy makers and businesspeople tell themselves, the only certainty is a surplus of uncertainty. Whatever provisional plans they sketch, they will find themselves mostly just wishing that nothing terrible happens.\u201cOn the financial markets, there is nothing they can do; it will just hit them,\u201d said Adam S. Posen, a former member of the rate-setting committee at the Bank of England and now president of the Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington. \u201cIf my house is going to catch on fire, I can plan to have some water on hand, but there\u2019s only so much you can do.\u201d\u201cThat kind of threw the cat among the pigeons and panicked everyone,\u201d said Jeremy Cook, chief economist at World First, a London company that manages foreign exchange for multinationals. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen a pickup in client hedging.\u201dA company that, say, imports goods from China to sell in Britain fears that the pound is about to drop, making those Chinese goods more expensive. So it buys contracts that essentially lock in today\u2019s exchange rate for the future.According to Laurence Wormald, head of research at FIS, which provides technology and market intelligence to financial services companies, British stocks would most likely fall 15 percent after a Brexit, with the pound dropping by a similar proportion.If a Brexit vote hurts the British economy, the central bank might feel compelled to lower rates to motivate businesses and households to borrow and spend. But the bank might well do the opposite, raising rates to stop a currency slide.The most nettlesome variable may be trade. Britain sells nearly half its exports within the European Union. Multinational corporations have set up headquarters in Britain, using those bases to serve customers across the Continent.Those campaigning for a Brexit assure that a vote to leave would change nothing right away. Britain would remain a fully fledged member of Europe\u2019s marketplace for two years as it negotiated a new arrangement with the 27 remaining members of the union.Britain will hold a referendum on Thursday on whether to leave the European Union, a decision nicknamed \u201cBrexit.\u201dBut if Britain failed to secure a deal, commerce with Europe could be governed by the terms of the World Trade Organization, which gives member nations the authority to impose potentially steep tariffs on imports.The debate over the Brexit is full of references to sundry alternative models. Norway enjoys access to the European market although it remains outside the union. Switzerland has achieved similar status through a thicket of treaties. But in both cases, they must accept something supporters of Brexit want to eliminate \u2014 European rules that allow people to move liberally from country to country.Those urging a Brexit insist Britain can negotiate a tailor-made deal. Many economists describe that notion as somewhere between fanciful and delusional. Eager to discourage other members from considering an exit, Europe would seek to ensure that Britain paid a price.If Britain dumps Europe, \u201cthey are not going to say, \u2018Well, O.K., here\u2019s a good deal,\u2019\u201d said Paul Johnson, director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies, an independent research institution in London.Nowhere are preparations more intense than in finance. London has parlayed expertise in banking and inclusion in Europe to secure dominance over large areas of trading. As the referendum approaches, financiers are now consumed by a jigsaw puzzle of diabolical complexity: They are mapping out what assets they hold and where, seeking to anticipate what jurisdictions and rules might apply post-Brexit.\u201cInvestment banks and asset managers are pre-booking law firms, consulting firms and accounting firms for July,\u201d said William Wright, managing director of New Financial, a research institution in London. \u201cIf we do vote to leave on June 23, no one is going to have the faintest idea what impact it will have.\u201dIf the sun rises on June 24 with Britain on its way out, such a shift could happen sooner rather than later. At a time of crippling uncertainty, banks would feel a compulsion to at least eliminate variables by quickly announcing their plans, moving people within the European Union \u2014 to Amsterdam, Dublin, Frankfurt and Paris.In the end, contingency plans may be devised more as salves for frayed nerves than bona fide operational blueprints. Britain may be on the verge of refashioning the world map. If that happens, the vote will set off proceedings so complex that the only guaranteed winners are the lawyers.All plans will be subject to change.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Economic Fears Rising, Britain Hopes to Stay in E.U. Market", "Date": "2016-06-27", "News": "Supported byLONDON \u2014 Four days after a decisive vote to leave the European Union, Britain was consumed on Monday with questions of when and how the country\u2019s departure from the bloc would happen \u2014 and increasingly, of whether it would happen at all.The immediate outcome of Thursday\u2019s referendum was not the promised clarity but an epic political muddle and a policy vacuum that invited more confusion and turmoil throughout the day in Britain, on the Continent and in the financial markets.Leaders on both sides of the Channel said there was no viable option but to move gradually toward the withdrawal process. Yet the day\u2019s developments did little to dispel the possibility that the crisis could drag on for a long time, possibly generating enough economic and political damage to encourage negotiation of a new arrangement between Europe and Britain that would sidestep the need for a formal withdrawal or at least minimize its effects.Prime Minister David Cameron and leaders of the campaign to leave stuck to their positions that they would not move quickly to begin formal talks on withdrawal, even as European leaders turned up the pressure on Britain to get on with it.Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany met in Berlin late Monday with her French and Italian counterparts. She signaled that any decision on how to negotiate a withdrawal would have to await a meeting of all 28 European Union countries on Tuesday and Wednesday in Brussels.The financial markets continued to pummel stocks and the value of the British pound, at one point sending the currency to its lowest level against the dollar in more than three decades. And Standard & Poor\u2019s, the ratings agency, downgraded Britain\u2019s credit rating, reflecting concern about the economic implications of the so-called Brexit vote.Mr. Cameron has announced that he will step down, and both his governing Conservative Party and the opposition Labour Party were consumed by internal warfare on Monday, leaving the country lacking strong leadership as it confronted new demands for a referendum on independence for Scotland.Leaders of the Leave campaign, including Boris Johnson, the former London mayor who is now a leading candidate to succeed Mr. Cameron, notably modulated their tone and some positions on Europe, leaving unclear exactly what issues they want to address through a withdrawal.The state of chaotic paralysis highlighted two fundamental problems that have plagued the European Union for the last decade. One is its difficulty balancing democratic accountability against its institutional drive to further the cause of unity. The other is its inability to act quickly and decisively to address the crises that regularly undercut confidence among voters and in the markets.Monday\u2019s events spoke to the struggle on all sides to define a way forward and restore some sense of unity, both within Britain and throughout Europe.In the first meeting of Parliament since the referendum, Mr. Cameron said he considered the vote binding, though he reiterated that he would leave to his successor the decision to start the formal withdrawal process. \u201cThe decision must be accepted and the process of implementing the decision in the best possible way must now begin,\u201d he said.About three-quarters of lawmakers had supported remaining in the European Union. A senior Conservative lawmaker, Kenneth Clarke, suggested that Parliament could override the referendum \u2014 which is not, in the end, legally binding on the government \u2014 while a Labour legislator, David Lammy, called for a second referendum.Mr. Cameron brushed such ideas aside, but he also made it clear that he would not be the one in charge of Britain\u2019s messy divorce from Europe.The man who might be, Mr. Johnson, sought to calm nerves and markets with his first extensive remarks on the way forward, setting out a position that seemed to de-emphasize elements of what the Leave campaign had promised.He suggested that Britain should take its time before entering separation proceedings with Brussels, and he gave no details about when he would want to start the process. And the vision he sketched out \u2014 of a Britain that is still in a trading bloc with Europe \u2014 seemed at best difficult to achieve, since the price of membership in the single market has always been the two things the Leave movement explicitly campaigned against: free movement of European citizens across borders and contributions to the bloc\u2019s operating budget.Mr. Johnson also played down the central issue of the campaign, immigration, saying it was not really what Britons were voting on, despite considerable evidence that it was.Mr. Cameron also suggested that the best outcome for Britain now would be a deal in which it retained access to the single market.But there were no signs that European leaders would let Britain off the hook so easily. Although Ms. Merkel has signaled a desire not to rush the process of negotiating British withdrawal, most European governments are eager to take a tough line, wanting to make clear to any other nation that might contemplate leaving that there is considerable cost to doing so.The few countries that have been given access to the European free-trade zone without joining the European Union \u2014 notably, Iceland, Norway and Switzerland \u2014 all contribute to the bloc\u2019s budget and accept its bedrock principle of free movement of workers, the very issues that angered so many of the Britons who voted to leave.Meeting in Berlin, Ms. Merkel, President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande of France and Prime Minister Matteo Renzi of Italy said there would be no discussions, formal or informal, over Britain\u2019s withdrawal until it formally invokes Article 50, the provision in the bloc\u2019s governing treaty that sets out the process for a withdrawal.European leaders are troubled by the prospect of a drawn-out exit inducing deeper financial and economic turmoil, a concern increasingly prevalent in London as well. On Monday morning, George Osborne, the chancellor of the Exchequer, tried to calm the markets, citing Britain\u2019s underlying economic strengths, the greater resilience of its financial system after the 2007-8 crisis, and the readiness of the Bank of England to step in.Markets plunged anyway.Alex Salmond, a member of Parliament and a former leader of the Scottish National Party, blamed the British government for the political vacuum, saying that neither Mr. Cameron nor Mr. Johnson had taken ownership of the mess. \u201cIf you break it, you own it,\u201d he said.Mr. Cameron summoned his cabinet and announced the creation of a policy unit of the \u201cbest and brightest\u201d civil servants \u2014 overseen by Oliver Letwin, a Conservative lawmaker \u2014 to orchestrate the withdrawal process. He also said he had spoken with Prime Minister Enda Kenny of Ireland to ensure that a British departure from the European Union, of which Ireland is a member, would not endanger the fragile peace in Northern Ireland.A committee of rank-and-file Conservative lawmakers met on Monday and proposed a timetable to select two candidates for party leader. The party\u2019s roughly 150,000 members would choose between the two, with the goal of selecting a new leader \u2014 and therefore a new prime minister \u2014 by Sept. 2.A decision on the timetable is expected by Wednesday, amid increased speculation that Britain could have a general election this year, after giving the Conservatives a five-year term in May 2015.Mr. Johnson is seen as the front-runner to replace Mr. Cameron as leader of the Conservatives, but he has made many enemies. The home secretary, Theresa May, who is in charge of domestic security and who advocated remaining in the European Union, has emerged as perhaps the most credible alternative.Large numbers of voters in traditional Labour strongholds in Northeast England and Wales \u2014 many of which are economically depressed areas that receive large amounts of European Union aid \u2014 voted to leave the bloc.Mr. Corbyn\u2019s tepid approach to campaigning for the Remain campaign was cited as a reason many traditional Labour supporters threw in their lot with the nationalist, anti-European U.K. Independence Party.Secretary of State John Kerry, visiting Brussels and London to discuss the fallout from the referendum, counseled against harsh actions by either side.\u201cSo I think it is absolutely essential that we stay focused on how, in this transitional period, nobody loses their head, nobody goes off half-cocked, people don\u2019t start ginning up scatterbrained or revengeful premises, but we look for ways to maintain the strength that will serve the interests and the values that brought us together in the first place,\u201d Mr. Kerry said.An article on June 28 about the political muddle and rising economic fears that followed Britain\u2019s vote to leave the European Union referred incorrectly to Prime Minister David Cameron\u2019s communication with Enda Kenny, the Irish prime minister, meant to ensure that Britain\u2019s exit would not endanger the fragile peace in Northern Ireland. Mr. Cameron spoke with Mr. Kenny; the two did not meet.Melissa Eddy and Alison Smale contributed reporting from Berlin, and James Kanter from Brussels.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "What to Watch for in Trading After Shock of \u2018Brexit\u2019", "Date": "2016-06-24", "News": "Supported byMarket TurmoilThe global financial system has in recent years managed to absorb rolling debt crises in Greece, military clashes in Ukraine, down-to-the-wire budget fights in Washington and a shock currency devaluation by China.But will it handle Britain\u2019s vote on Thursday to leave the European Union as well?The lesson of the financial crisis of 2008 is that problems in one country can spread around the world through the markets and the banking system. And so far on Friday, there have been some gut-wrenching moves in global markets.The British pound plunged to a level not seen in decades. The decline briefly meant that the British economy was smaller than France\u2019s, when measured in dollar terms.Italy\u2019s stock market was down more than 10 percent, and France\u2019s was off over 8 percent.The selling hit Japan, where stocks closed down nearly 8 percent.In the United States, the Dow Jones industrial average was down 459 points, or 2.55 percent, in late morning trading.Investors sought safety in government bonds. The yield on Germany\u2019s 10-year bond dropped into negative territory. (Bond prices and yields move in opposite directions.)The yield on the United States 10-year note also sank, to 1.53 percent, after overnight trading that was eight times its normal volume, according to FTN Financial.The question now is how much more conditions could change in the next days and weeks. At times like this, it makes sense to focus on areas where the global financial system seems most vulnerable.In Europe, that means searching the markets for indications that investors are starting to bet that the European Union will fracture further.Worrying? Sure.Still, it\u2019s important to remember that the European Central Bank has in the past acted boldly to head off adverse movements in bond markets. And on Friday, it said in a news release that it would \u201ccontinue to fulfill its responsibilities to ensure price stability and financial stability in the euro area.\u201dInvestors, policy makers and countries face a messy breakup with vast financial, economic and political implications.Europe\u2019s other weak point is its banking system. Much of the selling involved Britain\u2019s financial giants. Shares in Barclays, which has large trading operations, and which hoovered up much of Lehman Brothers after it crashed, had shed a fifth of its value on Friday. But Deutsche Bank, Germany\u2019s largest lender, also plummeted \u2014 by 14 percent.At times like this, what really matters is whether banks can raise short-term money to finance their operations. The Bank of England said in a statement on Friday that it would make 250 billion pounds available to banks, and said it could provide \u201csubstantial liquidity in foreign currency.\u201dThe financial system overhauls introduced in the United States and Europe since the 2008 crisis, and the willingness to provide emergency support to the banks right now, will most likely stop the financial system from imploding.But a deeper test is whether the overhaul \u2014 which forced banks to have higher levels of capital and retain more liquid cash \u2014 has put the banks in a position in which they can continue lending to the real economy during this period of pervasive uncertainty. The Bank of England on Friday underscored that hope in its statement. \u201cThis substantial capital and huge liquidity gives banks the flexibility they need to continue to lend to U.K. businesses and households, even during challenging times,\u201d it said.One other thing to consider amid this selling and gloom: There is an optimistic scenario. Britain and Europe may work out a peaceful divorce, and Europe\u2019s policy makers may be able to stop the departure from deepening the Continent\u2019s economic problems. The economic pain in Britain may deter other countries from seeking to leave, or they may have votes and decide to stay.People who have bet on the world ending in recent years have lost a lot of money. But be very open to the notion that Brexit could be the event that finally makes them rich.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Libyan Fund Claims Goldman Sachs Exploited Its Financial Na\u00efvet\u00e9", "Date": "2016-06-13", "News": "Supported byLONDON \u2014 After years of international isolation under the rule of Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi, Libya sought to emulate its Middle Eastern neighbors by creating a sovereign wealth fund in 2006 to invest the proceeds from its sale of oil.The North African nation soon turned to Goldman Sachs to help it invest some of the more than $35 billion in funds it had available in late 2007.That relationship soured after the Libyan Investment Authority said it was misled by the Wall Street bank in 2008 about a series of derivatives transactions and ultimately lost $1.2 billion when those contracts came to maturity in 2011.Goldman Sachs, by comparison, earned more than $200 million in \u201ceye-watering\u201d profit on the transactions, the sovereign fund asserted in a trial that began on Monday in London.The Libyan Investment Authority, unlike many sovereign wealth funds, said that it was an unsophisticated investor with a staff that had little experience with investment banking and that Goldman Sachs preyed on the na\u00efvet\u00e9 of its staff to persuade the fund to invest in complex transactions that they didn\u2019t understand or desire.On Monday, Roger Masefield, a lawyer for the Libyan Investment Authority, argued that Goldman used training programs; gifts; trips to Dubai, London and Morocco; and an internship for the younger brother of the fund\u2019s deputy executive officer to win favor and convince the fund to engage in the investments.\u201cThis is a highly unusual case,\u201d Mr. Masefield said.The trial is being heard in the High Court in London before Justice Vivien Rose and is expected to last about seven weeks. The lawsuit was first filed in London two years ago.Goldman has disputed the claims and says that the Libyan Investment Authority had the financial sophistication to understand the disputed transactions and other similarly complicated transactions it engaged in.The dispute revolves around nine derivatives transactions tied to the stocks of Citigroup, the French utility EDF and other companies.The Libyan fund entered into the transactions in 2007 and in 2008 in the months before the financial crisis and ultimately lost its investment as the economic downturn weighed on the stock prices of the companies in the disputed transactions.At the time, Libya was looking to engage with the global markets after years of political isolation and stagnant development.The Libyan Investment Authority soon developed a close relationship with Goldman and by mid-2007 considered it not only a trusted adviser, but as \u201calmost an in-house bank,\u201d according to the Libyan Investment Authority\u2019s assertions.The Libyan Investment Authority, like the sovereign wealth funds of other developing countries, was seeking to purchase strategic stakes in global companies that could be partners for its future development, according to court filings. That included financial companies.In its filings, the Libyan Investment Authority argued that Goldman was aware of the financial na\u00efvet\u00e9 of its staff, citing emails in which one banker said the fund had \u201czero-level sophistication\u201d and another banker who said \u201cyou just delivered a pitch on structured leveraged loans to someone who lives in the middle of the desert with his camels.\u201dMuch of the fund\u2019s arguments centered on the actions of Youssef Kabbaj, a former Goldman Sachs banker.The Libyan Investment Authority said that Mr. Kabbaj wined and dined members of the fund\u2019s staff on \u201ctraining\u201d trips to London, which included accommodations in a stylish hotel and frequent expensive meals out at many of London\u2019s best-known restaurants.In one instance, his expenses for entertaining and hotels exceeded 22,000 pounds, or about $31,000, and he was reminded internally at Goldman that any expenses incurred with respect to the Libyan fund needed prior approval, according to court filings.Mr. Kabbaj also bought staff members of the fund presents and took them on vacation to Morocco, according to the court filings.Mr. Masefield argued that Mr. Kabbaj also worked on both sides of the derivatives transactions, \u201cghost writing\u201d documents for staff members of the fund to be used to convince its board of directors to invest and then separately making presentations to the fund on behalf of Goldman Sachs.The Libyan fund also argued that Goldman tried to win influence by providing an internship to Haitem Zarti, the younger brother of Mustafa Zarti, the fund\u2019s deputy executive officer.\u201cThis very internship has been, and may still be, the subject of investigation\u201d by the Securities and Exchange Commission \u201cand Goldman Sachs appears to be carrying out its own internal investigation into its hiring practices,\u201d the fund said in court filings.According to court filings, Mr. Kabbaj entertained Haitem Zarti in London on his Goldman Sachs expense account and took him on vacations to Morocco. The Libyan fund said that Goldman Sachs paid for Haitem Zarti\u2019s business class flights and 5-star accommodations on a trip to Dubai and Mr. Kabbaj arranged for a \u201cpair of prostitutes to entertain them both one evening\u201d on that trip.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "\u2018Brexit\u2019 Vote Already Has a Winner: The Gambling Industry", "Date": "2016-06-22", "News": "Supported byLONDON \u2014 Ask for his opinion, and David Howe eagerly tells you how he hopes Britain will leave the European Union.\u201cWe need to take control of our borders,\u201d he says.But these sentiments are, at the moment, as valuable to him as his personal views on Her Majesty\u2019s latest hat. He is more keen to know how the rest of the British electorate is inclined so he can win some money.Mr. Howe is standing inside a William Hill gambling shop near Westminster, home to the British Parliament. It is midday Wednesday, less than 24 hours before British voters will go to the polls to determine the political geography of Europe. Video roulette machines flicker behind him. Televisions above him beam in dog races from hither and yon.Far from a curiosity, the gambling markets stand as a rare source of something approximating clarity in the face of Brexit-borne confusion, assuming they turn out to be right.All the while, gamblers held firm, signaling faith that economic concerns would ultimately triumph over the politics of identity. While the margin tightened for a while, the people voting with money concluded that the electorate would stick with Europe.But in one corner of the commercial world \u2014 the gambling industry \u2014 not knowing what will happen amounts to an exploitable asset. To bookmakers, uncertainty is the midwife of all wagers. Brexit presents the perfect swirl of unpredictable forces: a potentially grave geopolitical risk that has provoked fratricide in Britain\u2019s ruling Conservative Party, dominating news coverage. Everyone is paying attention. No one knows how it will end.Britain is voting on whether to remain in the European Union. How many countries are in the bloc? Can the queen vote? Test your knowledge of these and other important questions.On Tuesday and Wednesday alone, the Brexit vote attracted wagers worth more than \u00a33 million ($4.4 million), most of it via online transactions, and three-fourths landing on remain, Mr. Smithson estimated.This is the picture that confronts Mr. Howe, 44, a chef at a nearby pub, as he enters William Hill Wednesday afternoon, aiming to use Britain\u2019s referendum to earn some cash.\u201cI think it will be remain, but the odds are crap,\u201d he says.Hoping for better odds, he resolves to wait before making a bet sometime in the next few hours. He might bet in accord with his heart \u2014 to leave \u2014 given the financial appeal. A bet for Britain to abandon Europe is offering the gratifying returns of the long shot, a profit of \u00a33 (about $4.41) for a \u00a31 bet (about $1.47).\u201cI like to mix it up,\u201d Mr. Howe says, recounting how he just managed to collect on a complex bet involving the European soccer championship: Germany won, Poland won, and Spain and Croatia both scored goals, combining to trigger his payout. \u201cIf there\u2019s no horse I like or football I like, then I\u2019ll put a tenner on leave.\u201dWilliam Hill, the largest bookmaker in Britain, assumes the industry will collectively count wagers reaching \u00a320 million (more than $29 million) before the Brexit results are in, according to a spokesman, Graham Sharpe. The company is hopeful its own tally will eclipse the \u00a33.25 million in wagers ($4.8 million) it saw during the last giant political referendum, the 2014 vote on whether Scotland should leave the United Kingdom. In that case, the polls had the race too close to call while the gambling markets got it right: Scotland stayed.Britain will hold a referendum on Thursday on whether to leave the European Union, a decision nicknamed \u201cBrexit.\u201dLest one get the impression that Las Vegas ought to reserve dedicated space for the workings of British democracy, it is worth noting that these numbers are paltry compared to the behemoths of British gambling: soccer and horse-racing.William Hill estimates that the bookmaking industry will rack up wagers of \u00a3500 million ($735 million) on the European Championships. A World Cup final alone tends to attract \u00a3200 million ($294 million) in wagers to William Hill\u2019s books.Part of the reason betting on politics is so tiny compared to sports stems from a fact that may shock in this age of Trump-Clinton-Brexit-yakety-yak-saturation: There isn\u2019t enough politics to sate the bookmakers.\u201cIn betting terms, there are relatively few events,\u201d Mr. Sharpe says.While political betting may be a mere niche, it goes back centuries. As far back as 1503, Roman banking houses offered trades predicting who would emerge as the next pope from the papal conclave, according to Leighton Vaughan Williams, director of the betting research unit at Nottingham Business School in England. From the United States Civil War through 1940, Americans were placing bets on the presidential election on stock exchanges, a practice that consistently favored the eventual winner.\u201cPeople trading in the betting markets are looking at all the information that\u2019s available,\u201d Mr. Vaughan Williams says. \u201cThe polls are only one thing. The people who trade in the betting markets are looking at all the information.\u201dIronically, the glimpse of certainty emanating from the betting markets may be limiting the appeal of wagering on Brexit.As Ingrid Sambade arrives at the William Hill shop Wednesday morning, she is eager to put her money where her heart is \u2014 with Europe. A Spaniard by birth, she makes her living cleaning homes.\u201cI\u2019m in!\u201d she says. \u201cIf they go out, they can\u2019t come back in, so the best thing is to stay in and everyone will be happy.\u201dBut Ms. Sambade, 69, is less happy when she calculates the skimpy winnings she will claim from a successful remain bet.\u201cIt has terrible value for you,\u201d the man behind the counter tells her. He suggests she focus on more speculative questions, like the margin of victory and the size of turnout.\u201cI don\u2019t bet nothing,\u201d Ms. Sambade says. \u201cIt don\u2019t give you much.\u201dColin Hammond takes one look at the board and concurs.\u201cI think they\u2019ll stay, and there\u2019s no value in that bet,\u201d he says, before turning his attention to his traditional area for wagering. \u201cI know more about football.\u201dAdvertisement"}

They started to reduce \u2014 on their own \u2014 the number of screeners.\u201d\u201cI think that if you follow politics closely, you know that what has happened in recent decades is that a constellation of conservative media forces \u2014 talk radio, the internet (notably Drudge) and a few other sorts of media outlets \u2014 have effectively become a wing of the Republican Party and have been very powerful in pushing negative information into mainstream media. There is a sort of food chain \u2026 an ecosystem where party operatives would feed information to right-wing media outlets, and then once it was posted on the web somewhere, or on talk radio or on FOX News, then those same operatives would get it in the [mainstream] media.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s across the board, but it\u2019s clearly a bigger problem in jobs for unskilled or low-skilled people.

{"Headline": "The Stock Market Is Optimistic, So What\u2019s Your Excuse?", "Date": "2016-06-09", "News": "Supported byEconomic TrendsHas the election made you anxious about the future of the United States? Do you feel as if your job is not secure in this lukewarm economy? Are you just generally in the dumps?If so, take a look at the stock market. After a couple of steep sell-offs since last summer, the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index has risen to within a whisker of the record high it hit in May 2015.The Dow Jones industrial average closed above 18,000 on Wednesday, putting that benchmark up 3 percent for the year.Still, when stocks have moved higher for several years, notching the second-longest bull run in Standard & Poor\u2019s records, the market\u2019s optimism should be taken seriously.The latest rally, which has lifted the market more than 16 percent from the low point it hit in February, suggests that investors do not believe that the bad jobs numbers are an early signal of a slowdown. They are also probably betting that the Federal Reserve will not be in such a hurry to raise interest rates.Investors may also be seeing less political risk in the United States. The Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump favors combative trade policies that, if put into place, might disrupt global commerce, unsettle the markets and unnerve investors. A trade war could harm the earnings of American exporters if other countries retaliated. After watching a difficult few days in Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign, investors may have bought more stock this week in the belief that his chances of becoming president have weakened.But there is good reason to believe that investors have become too optimistic. This turbulent presidential campaign will no doubt disquiet investors in other ways.All politics aside, the stock market\u2019s rise has made stock prices look expensive when compared with corporate earnings. In aggregate, the companies in the S.&P. 500 were trading at 22 times their earnings for the 12 months through the end of March. That is considerably higher than the average of 16 times earnings for the five years through the end of 2015.Stocks are also expensive when their prices are compared against expected future earnings. The S.&P. 500 is trading at 18 times projected 2016 operating earnings, above the average of the last five years.That high level of optimism can also be seen in how much profit growth analysts are expecting. They project 14 percent this year, and a scorching 17 percent in 2017.Here\u2019s the problem: When investors are this sanguine, they are prone to dash for the exits at small signs of trouble. The impetus might come from a hawkish remark about interest rates from an influential Federal Reserve policy maker or a vote from Britain on June 23 to exit the European Union. Or something else that catches most investors by surprise.But this is not necessarily a reason to feel gloomy. When an expensive stock market sells off, it\u2019s not a given that the economy will also dive. In the last 10 months, stocks sold off heavily on two occasions. The United States economy kept chugging along.It\u2019s when the economy stops chugging that it will really be time to avoid the stock market.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Fed\u2019s Policies Have Gotten It in a Tangle", "Date": "2016-06-16", "News": "Supported byStrategiesBut the Fed faces difficult choices. A look at its own data suggests that its policies have led to financial imbalances that place it under pressure to raise rates, as it has repeatedly said it will do.One problem is that the purchases of trillions of dollars of bonds by the Federal Reserve and other central banks in a strategy known as quantitative easing have contributed to the extraordinarily low yields in much of the bond market.\u201cThe Fed\u2019s policies are largely responsible for creating a wealth cycle,\u201d said Joseph G. Carson, director of global economic research at AllianceBernstein. \u201cIt\u2019s past time that the Fed took some action.\u201dYet the case for holding rates steady, and not touching the Fed funds rate (the central bank\u2019s crucial short-term rate) is easy to make, and the Fed made it on Wednesday. In a statement, it warned of risks facing the still fragile domestic economy. And in a news conference, Janet L. Yellen, the Fed chairwoman, said that next Thursday\u2019s British referendum could \u201chave consequences\u201d for global markets. She said: \u201cIt could have consequences in turn for the U.S. economic outlook that would be a factor in deciding on the appropriate path of policy. \u201dPolls indicate it is quite possible that British voters will decide that their country should leave the European Union. The British pound, Britain\u2019s global trade, the status of the City of London as a world financial capital \u2014 all could be threatened, and so could the stability of the rest of the European Union. In merely two days, Monday and Tuesday, the VIX index, a measure of expected volatility in the stock market, leapt 20 percent. Yields of bonds of troubled countries on the eurozone periphery, like Greece and Spain, rose to levels not reached in months, as investors demanded more rewards for the risks of holding them.What\u2019s more, the yields of sovereign bonds in core countries like Germany and France plummeted as global investors sought a semblance of safety. This has produced some strange results: For the first time in history, the yield on the 10-year German bond moved into negative territory on Tuesday.Yields on numerous sovereign notes of shorter maturities of, say, five years have been negative for some time. The list includes Switzerland, Germany, Austria, Sweden, Finland, Japan, Denmark, the Netherlands, Belgium and France. A saving grace, for investors in such bonds, is that if yields keep dropping, prices, which move in the opposite direction, will rise, and handsome profits can be made when the securities are sold.The United States Treasury is not selling bonds with negative interest rates, but yields on 10-year Treasuries have plummeted as well, dropping close to 1.5 percent on Thursday. Since 1981, such securities have yielded more than 6.3 percent, on average, a staggeringly large gap. The current ultralow Treasury yields make sense only when compared with the even lower yields available elsewhere around the world.While the Fed influences the entire fixed-income market, it directly controls only short-term yields through the Fed funds rate, which it raised to 0.25 percent, from nearly zero, in December. The Fed has repeatedly said it would increase that rate further, only to backpedal. On Wednesday, it did so again, forecasting that the rate would reach only 1.6 percent next year, down from a projection of 1.9 percent made in March; and only 2.4 percent in 2018, down from a March projection of 3 percent.While wage inflation appears to be on the increase, and the unemployment rate is quite low at 4.7 percent, some recent data on the labor market and on inflation has been disappointing, gross domestic product has been growing slowly, and the Fed has decided to be extremely cautious in setting rates.Yet from the perspective of household wealth and asset prices, the dangers of Fed inaction are readily apparent. By keeping interest rates low for so many years, the Fed has not merely reduced fixed-income yields. It has increased the value of other assets, to spectacular effect.Growth of household wealth has outstripped income, enriching those lucky enough to have houses and financial investments and leaving those who rely solely on wage income far behind. Asset prices may not be high enough to call them a bubble, but they are high enough for ordinary people to exercise caution. That wasn\u2019t the case in 2009, when the Fed embarked on its loose monetary policy, deliberately encouraging people to buy riskier assets.In Mr. Carson\u2019s view, it\u2019s past time to raise rates, both to stay ahead of inflation and rein in speculative excess.Higher interest rates would even have a stimulative effect for a while, he says, because people with savings would benefit from higher interest payments.Yet with the threat of disruptions abroad, and economic growth tepid at best in the United States, arguments for waiting longer prevail. Central banks are in a tough spot, dealing with economic problems for which quick remedies are not readily apparent.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Palantir Buyback Plan Shows Need for New Silicon Valley Pay System", "Date": "2016-06-28", "News": "Supported byDeal ProfessorPalantir Technologies\u2019 $225 million offer to repurchase its employees\u2019 privately held shares hints that Silicon Valley is starting to make some fundamental changes in the way it compensates its workers.Palantir, a data analytics firm, is one of the largest start-ups around, with a valuation reaching more than $20 billion last year. It is offering $7.40 a share to buy back up to 12.5 percent of an employee\u2019s shares (and in some cases, those of former employees), or $500,000 worth of shares, whichever is lower.The offer has some interesting characteristics, to say the least. Palantir\u2019s worth, measured by the price at which its stock trades in the private share market, has been deflated. The price Palantir is offering is above the private market price and the value assigned to the stock by some prominent mutual funds.Palantir\u2019s offer, though, is at least a cheap way to tell the market that Palantir thinks it is still worth a lot.Palantir has said the offer is intended to increase the morale of employees by offering them \u201cliquidity.\u201d Some employees have been with the company since its founding 11 years ago and are still waiting for that pinnacle event in the life of a hot tech start-up: the initial public offering of stock.Unlike them, the former employees can already sell their shares in the private market. They might take this offer because it is a higher amount. Palantir\u2019s motives for including them in the buyback are unclear. Palantir gets all of the benefits of the nondisclosure and other agreements, but any employee who takes the offer is not likely to be doing those things anyway. Perhaps Palantir is doing this out of the goodness of its heart.Whatever the reason, Palantir\u2019s offer comes at a time of great debate in Silicon Valley over employee compensation. Traditionally, workers received options on a four-year vesting schedule. When they left a company, they would have 90 days to exercise those options or forfeit them.Palantir did not impose restrictions on employees or stockholders selling shares in the private market. Perhaps as a way to get current and former employees to participate, Palantir\u2019s repurchase offer threatened to make it harder to resell the company\u2019s stock in the private market.Employees need to consider another headache \u2013 taxes. Not only must employees put up cash to exercise their options, they must pay taxes, which can be an extraordinary amount if the private company has a high valuation. But because the company is not public yet, one cannot even be sure that valuations will materialize, particularly in the era of the overvalued start-up. This was a problem in the day of the tech bubble. Employees exercised options worth millions of dollars but found that when taxes were due, their companies and stock were worthless.Mr. Kupor notes that extending the exercise time for former employees makes their options more valuable at the expense of employees and investors. (It does so because former employees have a longer time to exercise their options and dilute the other shareholders.) Mr. Kupor has no solution other than to allow companies to extend the time at their discretion. But as we see in the Palantir case, companies can pick and choose favorites, or even refuse to accommodate former employees.The Palantir repurchase and Andreessen Horowitz\u2019s ruminations highlight a more fundamental point: Compensation at venture-backed companies needs to be rethought in an age when many of these companies are staying private longer.In this new world, employees face sale restrictions that only their companies can lift. This forces these companies to provide periodic liquidity events. For instance, Airbnb, the short-term rental site, is making annual stock repurchases. In the public realm where companies are steadily profitable, stock buybacks are a familiar occurrence. More than half a trillion dollars was spent on stock buybacks in the public markets in 2015. But as the value of private, venture-backed companies deflates, they will struggle to give liquidity to their employees.There may be other ways to change compensation. Although options are the lifeblood of Silicon Valley, Palantir raised salaries 20 percent to stem employee attrition. But cash will not solve the problem, either.And so we await the great revamping. In the meantime, former employees of hot start-ups will be faced with choices like the one Palantir is offering: Take our money, whatever we offer, or be stuck.Advertisement"}

LinkedIn\u2019s share value rose nearly 50 percent on the news.Mr. Weiner \u2014 who took over as LinkedIn\u2019s chief in 2009, succeeding Reid Hoffman, the founder \u2014 has done a tremendous job in the past years building the company\u2019s business, which is primarily about helping people connect to one another for employment and conduct business-oriented social networking. But despite all the headlines about growth and profits, LinkedIn has been a money-losing operation for the last two years.You wouldn\u2019t know that if you only glanced at LinkedIn\u2019s news releases. That\u2019s because LinkedIn steers investors to focus on what\u2019s known as its adjusted Ebitda, or non-GAAP earnings. The company purposely strips out the cost of stock-based compensation, which has the effect of turning losses into gains. LinkedIn paid out $510 million in stock-based compensation last year; over the last two years, that stock-based compensation represented a whopping 96 percent of operating income, or 16 percent of revenue, according to Mr. Mahaney. Companies like Google, Amazon and Facebook paid out about 15 percent of operating income, or well under 10 percent of revenue.LinkedIn justifies the practice by saying that stock-based compensation \u201cis noncash in nature\u201d and that excluding it from its earnings calculation provides \u201cmeaningful supplemental information regarding operational performance and liquidity.\u201dBut investors like Warren E. Buffett have been highly critical of the practice. \u201cIt has become common for managers to tell their owners to ignore certain expense items that are all too real,\u201d Mr. Buffett wrote in his annual report published this year. Stock-based compensation, he said, \u201cis the most egregious example. The very name says it all: \u2018compensation.\u2019 If compensation isn\u2019t an expense, what is it? And, if real and recurring expenses don\u2019t belong in the calculation of earnings, where in the world do they belong?\u201dMr. Buffett also criticized analysts who \u201cplay their part in this charade, too, parroting the phony, compensation-ignoring \u2018earnings\u2019 figures fed them by managements.\u201dIn April, Facebook, which also used to steer investors to use adjusted-Ebitda earnings numbers that also excluded the cost of stock-based compensation, announced that it was changing its policy. \u201cStock-based compensation plays an important role in how we compensate our employees, and therefore we view it as a real expense for the business,\u201d David Wehner, Facebook\u2019s chief financial officer, said in an earnings call.Facebook\u2019s decision to change its practice was seen as a shot across the bow at companies like LinkedIn. Other companies, like Amazon and Intel, also account for stock compensation as an expense.It is not hard to believe that LinkedIn, barring this deal with Microsoft, would have soon been using the more realistic version of its earnings \u2014 and, in so doing, reporting more losses. The company certainly deserves credit for building a global network with 430 million users and becoming a household name. But absent this accounting method, uglier headlines would have dragged down the stock price even further, along with the morale of all those employees whose incomes were dependent on it.Mr. Mahaney, the RBC analyst, said the use of so much stock-based compensation was a negative signal. \u201cThere are a variety of ways to look at this issue, but our general bias is that the lower the dependence on stock-based compensation, the higher the quality of the P&L,\u201d he wrote in a report in April, using shorthand for the income statement.LinkedIn, Twitter, Yahoo and Alibaba, which \u201chave the most dependence on stock-based compensation,\u201d also have results \u201cof relatively lower quality,\u201d Mr. Mahaney said.Other stock analysts took note that Microsoft, which includes stock-based compensation in its non-GAAP earnings calculation, made a point on Monday of saying that the combined company would follow Microsoft\u2019s practice. In other words, from now on, LinkedIn employees will no longer enjoy results that looked rosier because their stock-based compensation was not figured in. (Though as a unit of Microsoft, it is unclear whether their results will even be broken out for investors to see).A spokeswoman for LinkedIn declined to comment, pointing to comments Mr. Weiner made in a memo he sent to employees.In that memo and in conversations with employees on Monday, Mr. Weiner said that the impetus for the deal was not about the stock, but was more about a larger trend that he and LinkedIn\u2019s founder, Mr. Hoffman, had noticed late last year: The biggest companies in the Valley \u2014 Facebook, Google and a few others \u2014 had pulled way ahead of the pack by increasing and earning the largest valuations, making it harder for smaller tech companies to attract top talent. Ultimately, they decided that LinkedIn was in a better competitive position if it, ahem, linked in with Microsoft.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Central Banks Worry About Engaging World Markets After \u2018Brexit\u2019", "Date": "2016-06-26", "News": "Supported byAs global markets reel after an establishment-rattling vote by Britain to sever ties with Europe, investors are again expecting central banks to ride to the rescue.And that may be the problem.Or so believe a number of investors and economists who worry that another round of central bank intervention in the markets will compound the sense of alienation, frustration and anger at global elites that encouraged a majority of Britons to opt for leaving the European Union.Traditionally, market participants have tended to cheer central bank activism.In times of financial panic, wholesale bond buying, negative interest rates and disbursing cash directly to consumers (the yet-to-be-deployed weapon in the central banker\u2019s armory) have been seen as easy policy substitutes for governments unwilling or incapable of taking action themselves.But, as the world\u2019s leading central bankers finished a weekend of brainstorming in Basel, Switzerland, as to what their next move might be, some feared that this time around they might do more harm than good.\u201cPeople say that central bankers have not done enough, but they have done too much already,\u201d said Stephen Jen, a former official at the International Monetary Fund who now manages a hedge fund in London.But the British referendum results and the sharp fall in the markets that followed brought an extra urgency to the two-day meeting.On Saturday, Agust\u00edn Carstens, the head of Mexico\u2019s central bank and chairman of the bank\u2019s policy group that monitors the global financial system, said that committee members had \u201cendorsed the contingency measures put in place by the Bank of England and emphasized the preparedness of central banks to support the proper functioning of financial markets.\u201dAdding to global political tensions were parliamentary elections on Sunday in Spain, where the anti-austerity left-wing party Podemos was expected to continue its recent run of electoral success.While the sell-off in stocks on Friday was very sharp, market participants said over the weekend that they were heartened that major market makers were able to absorb the selling fairly well.Playing a central role were exchange-traded funds, which at one point on Friday accounted for close to 50 percent of overall trading volume in stocks. That is an extraordinary statistic, given that the funds were largely unknown a decade ago as an investment option for investors.The ability for investors to quickly and successfully buy and sell stocks and bonds, the crucial advantage that exchange-traded funds have over mutual funds, is seen by regulators as critical in times of acute financial stress.Part of the conundrum for central bankers is that the recent sell-off is not the result of an event like Lehman Brothers going bankrupt in September 2008, which provided authorities with an unassailable excuse to intervene. Lehman\u2019s failure caused markets to seize up and financial institutions to stop dealing with each other.But when the crises that rock global finance are social and political, it becomes more awkward for central bankers to defend any form of extraordinary intervention.And that is what worries analysts, who for some time now have been concerned that interventions by central banks were distorting markets by making them less liquid and creating anomalies such as what currently exists in Japan.There, the nation\u2019s central bank owns 34 percent of the country\u2019s government bonds and is one of the top 10 shareholders in 90 percent of the companies listed on the stock exchange, according to data from Bloomberg.\u201cCentral banks have done everything to jury-rig markets,\u201d said Julian Brigden of Macro Intelligence 2 Partners, an independent research company based in Vail, Colo., that advises large money management firms on global investment themes. \u201cWhat makes you think they won\u2019t want to do more?\u201dMr. Jen, the hedge fund manager, scoffed at the notion that the extraordinary central bank interventions of recent years were designed to stamp out deflationary threats and spark an increase in prices and economic activity in stagnant economies in Europe and Japan.\u201cWe have plenty of inflation, it\u2019s just asset price inflation,\u201d he argued, referring to elevated equity, bond and housing markets that have been one consequence of these policies. \u201cPeople can\u2019t live in cities anymore, and they are grumpy about their jobs.\u201dInterestingly, one of the most vocal critics of central bank overreach has been the Bank for International Settlements itself.For years now, two senior economists at its research arm, Claudio Borio and Hyun Song Shin, have been arguing via speeches and papers that artificially low interest rates have created pernicious asset bubbles in equity and housing markets in the developed world and debt frenzies in emerging markets like China and Brazil.These views were highlighted again on Sunday in Basel with the presentation of the bank\u2019s annual report.In a speech, Jaime Caruana, the bank\u2019s managing director, said that extremely low interest rates were a threat to global financial stability as they \u201cdepress risk premia and stretch asset valuations.\u201dThe result, Mr. Caruana contended, was the threat of a \u201closs of confidence in policy making\u201d and \u201cunrealistic expectations about growth and the ability of present policies to lift global growth.\u201dWhile couched in platitudes, Mr. Caruana\u2019s message was clear enough. Persistent central bank interventions have not only created dangerous distortions, they have added to a sense of worldwide cynicism that these measures have not accomplished their central aims: lifting economic growth and increasing wages.But, Mr. Brigden said, central bankers will have a harder time justifying an intervention when the markets are going haywire because of an election upset somewhere.Of course, bashing central bankers is always a popular and easy pastime for politicians, economists and investors alike.It is also true that central bankers in Britain, Europe, Japan and the United States have consistently said that their actions have been forced by the unwillingness of politicians and governments to act themselves.\u201cMonetary policy cannot do it alone,\u201d said Daniel C. Dektar, a bond investor at Amundi Smith Breeden, a global asset manager. \u201cPeople have been left behind, which is creating anti-establishment sentiment in just about every democracy in the world. You would think that at some point governments would get the message.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "\u2018Brexit\u2019 Hits U.S. Stock Market Harder Than an Election", "Date": "2016-06-24", "News": "Supported byAftershockIn response to the British vote to leave the European Union, the American stock markets have moved more than they have in response to any presidential election over the past 60 years.In part, this reflects the fact that Thursday\u2019s referendum result was quite unexpected. Election-eve prediction markets had suggested around a one-in-six chance that Britain would leave.Even sharp and unexpected electoral shifts in the United States don\u2019t produce swings this large. Take the 2000 election, when markets rose and fell by only a percentage point or two, as the networks went back and forth on whether George W. Bush or Al Gore had the edge in Florida and in the Electoral College. Stocks moved by less than a percentage point in response to the subsequent Supreme Court decision certifying Mr. Bush as the winner.Likewise, stocks moved by only a percentage point or two on Election Day 2004, when early exit polls led many to believe that John Kerry had won the election, only to reverse course when it became clear the early numbers were wrong.Think of Friday morning\u2019s re-evaluation of the price of stocks as the market\u2019s judgment that the British referendum has more profound economic implications for the United States than the difference between a Democratic and Republican president. (Perhaps the contrast this November will prove to be larger.)Economists focus on stock market reactions because they provide a useful real-time barometer of a nation\u2019s broader economic prospects.After all, when traders buy a stock index, they\u2019re buying the future earnings of a broad swath of American corporations. The theory is that the price they\u2019re paying should be tied to expectations of future earnings. This morning\u2019s lower stock prices suggests they\u2019re much more pessimistic.While market reactions are surely neither as rational nor as carefully calibrated as the theory suggests, at least they provide a useful quantification of the conventional wisdom. And that conventional wisdom seems to be that Britain\u2019s exit from the European Union will lead to economic disruption that will echo across the Atlantic.Advertisement"}

These are not materials that were designed to last indefinitely, and the investment to keep making them would be huge, multimillions.\u201dNews of the wind down has been spreading for several months through the art world, where it has been met more often with disbelief than disappointment.\u201cI haven\u2019t given up,\u201d said Mr. Close, one of the first artists to begin using the camera in the late 1970s to make photographs as both the basis for painted portraits and as works themselves. \u201cHere\u2019s yet another medium that will be lost to history, and it just shouldn\u2019t be allowed to happen. If it does, I don\u2019t know what I\u2019m going to do, to tell you the truth. It\u2019s so integrated into everything I do. I can always imagine what making a painting from one of those pictures will look like.\u201dLike other artists he knows who have used the camera, he said, its attraction is not just in its size and endearingly oddball personality, like a creature from an obsessive hobbyist\u2019s garage. The immediacy of making the picture, Mr. Close said, changes the relationship between the subject and the artist, who together witness the image come into being after the photograph is pulled from the camera and the chemicals perform their function. \u201cYou both work together to get something that you want out of it. Your subject knows what you\u2019re trying to do.\u201d (He described a 2012 session with President Obama in a hotel room so tiny that the camera and Mr. Close\u2019s wheelchair \u2014 a spinal-artery collapse more than two decades ago left him partially paralyzed \u2014 crowded out the Secret Service.)Mr. Reuter said maintaining that magic has exhausted him and the two people who work with him, Nafis Azad and Ted McLelland. Together, they help operate the cameras, store the photographic paper and assemble the chemical pods, a highly complicated process accomplished with a 60-year-old machine. With no real publicity operation, the initial financial challenges of the Great Recession and prices he probably set too high, Mr. Reuter said, \u201cthe demand for the cameras really just never materialized at the levels that it did during the Polaroid years; I think a lot of people had no idea the process was still in existence.\u201d (The camera costs $1,750 a day to rent and each exposure costs $125, down from $200 at the company\u2019s beginning.)\u201cMy goal is for people to use the rest of the material we have before all of it is really past its prime,\u201d Mr. Reuter said. \u201cIt would be a shame to end that way. \u201d As for the cameras themselves, he said with resignation, \u201cI hope that they go to some place like the Smithsonian or the George Eastman collection in Rochester.\u201dMr. Morris, known for his own love of rapidly rarefying film stocks like 35 millimeter and Super 8, said he continued to believe that the cameras would not end up as museum pieces. \u201cMaybe there won\u2019t be many \u2014 and maybe there will be a time when the process goes out of existence for a while \u2014 but I think there will be people who won\u2019t let it go away forever.\u201dAn earlier version of a picture caption misstated the location of Chuck Close\u2019s home.

Popularized in the last five years by digital platforms like Betterment and Wealthfront and initially aimed at young professionals, the concept has shaken the traditional wealth management industry and forced nearly every major bank, fund company and brokerage firm to develop its own offering.On Tuesday, E-Trade will introduce Adaptive Portfolio, a product line that uses a combination of stock and bond exchange-traded funds and actively managed mutual funds to create baskets that are weighted according to an investor\u2019s risk preferences and investment goals. People entering through E-Trade\u2019s website answer a series of questions and are sorted into one of six risk categories and corresponding model portfolios based on their answers.It is a bit of a twist on the offerings of rival firms, which only offer exchange-traded funds. E-Trade customers can pick whether they want pure E.T.F. portfolios or those with a mix of E.T.F.s and mutual funds. \u201cWe aim to kick-start a new phase in the automated investing evolution by offering investors access to more strategies to help them meet their goals,\u201d said Lena Haas, E-Trade\u2019s senior vice president of retirement, investing and savings.Fidelity Investments is testing a digital product, Fidelity Go, and Charles Schwab introduced a robo product last year.

{"Headline": "IEX Group, Critical of Wall St., Gains Approval for Stock Exchange", "Date": "2016-06-17", "News": "Supported byAmerica is getting a new stock exchange from the most prominent critics of high-frequency trading.After months of delays and a brutal lobbying battle that divided Wall Street, the IEX Group won approval on Friday from the Securities and Exchange Commission to become the nation\u2019s 13th official stock exchange.IEX is run by the people at the center of the Michael Lewis book, \u201cFlash Boys: A Wall Street Revolt,\u201d which profiles the early efforts of the IEX team to create a trading exchange that would be somewhat shielded from high-frequency traders.Other exchanges and trading firms had urged the S.E.C. to reject the IEX application to become an exchange.Opponents of IEX, including the other stock exchanges, have argued that the structure of the new exchange will add unnecessary new complexities into an already complex stock market, and potentially end up hurting small investors.But the three S.E.C. commissioners all voted on Friday to approve the IEX exchange, with one commissioner, Michael S. Piwowar, a Republican, dissenting on a few points.\u201cToday\u2019s actions promote competition and innovation, which our equity markets depend on to continue to deliver robust, efficient service to both retail and institutional investors,\u201d Mary Jo White, the S.E.C. chairwoman, said in a statement.The most novel and controversial feature of the IEX exchange is a so-called speed bump that would slow down trading slightly to throw off traders that rely only on speed.The speed bump slows trades down by only 350 microseconds \u2014 or millionths of a second \u2014 but that is an eternity in a stock exchange universe in which computers can buy and sell stocks in nanoseconds \u2014 or billionths of a second.The Nasdaq, and other existing exchanges, have said that the IEX\u2019s speed bump will violate rules mandating that exchanges make their prices available to all parties at the same time.IEX\u2019s critics have also said that the speed bump could add new complications into a stock market infrastructure that is already criticized for its complexity.In a statement, the S.E.C. said that the commissioners \u201cdetermined that a small delay will not prevent investors from accessing stock prices in a fair and efficient manner.\u201dThe S.E.C. did say, though, that within two years it will do a study to examine whether the delays lead to problems in the markets.If nothing else, the approval of the exchange will provide an opportunity to test the many competing theories about what impact the IEX\u2019s speed bump will have on the pattern of trading.The IEX has been a flash point in the broader debate over technological changes that have altered the basic functioning of the American stock markets over the last two decades.IEX won support \u2014 and financial backing \u2014 from several large mutual fund companies, which said that the exchange would help them trade more cheaply and efficiently, as well as from hundreds of small investors, many of whom read \u201cFlash Boys\u201d and wrote in to the S.E.C.Brad Katsuyama, the chief executive of IEX, said on Friday night that the company was \u201cgrateful and humbled by the support we\u2019ve received from the investor community, without it, we may have faced a different result.\u201dIn addition to the speed bump, the IEX has said it will not offer the same fees or rebates that other exchanges do to attract traders, a common practice at other exchanges that has been criticized for distorting trading incentives. The IEX also offers fewer complicated ways to enter trades than other exchanges, in an effort to simplify trading.Mr. Katsuyama has argued throughout the application process that IEX would provide a market-based solution to the problems created by high-frequency trading rather than requiring the S.E.C. to change the rules governing the markets.The other exchanges have complained that the IEX was essentially asking to be exempt from rules that governed them.In a letter written in May, Nasdaq\u2019s lawyers suggested that the S.E.C. could face a lawsuit if it approved the IEX application. A spokesman for Nasdaq said on Friday that the exchange company had no comment on the S.E.C.\u2019s decision.Larry Tabb, a market analyst with the Tabb Group, said the IEX speed bump could end up benefiting more sophisticated traders, like high-frequency traders, who can find ways to take advantage of the small delays.\u201cIt hurts the broad middle who may not have access to the best tools,\u201d Mr. Tabb said.The hedge fund and trading firm Citadel has been one of the most outspoken critics of the IEX application. On Friday, a spokeswoman for Citadel said that the S.E.C.\u2019s decision \u201cwill test and potentially reverse the gains in fairness, efficiency and transparency that have been made to our markets over the last decade. We must be vigilant to identify unintended consequences.\u201dAnother relatively new American stock exchange company, BATS Global Markets, initially supported the IEX application, but earlier this year withdrew its support, pointing to \u201cgross omissions of fact\u201d by IEX. BATS wrote that the problems \u201ccall into question the applicant\u2019s professional judgment.\u201dOn Friday, a BATS spokesman, Randy Williams, said that the company \u201ccongratulates IEX and appreciates the significant changes they made to their application to address industry concerns.\u201dIEX has already been operating as a private trading pool and has recently been attracting about 1.6 percent of all daily trading volume.Advertisement"}

Diamond at Barclays were based in London, while Brady Dougan at Credit Suisse made constant trips to the firm\u2019s office there from New York and Zurich.As regulators forced banks worldwide to cut back on risky businesses in recent years, worried boardrooms unceremoniously replaced the old guard with new leaders who were ordered to exit chancy areas that consumed the cash needed to fund new strategies in areas like wealth management.By any measure, it has not been an easy job.In a global financial environment that is both risk-averse and lacking enough ready buyers and sellers, offloading billions of dollars of mortgage securities, interest rate derivatives and leveraged loans has been a herculean task.Making the job harder is that the traders and investment bankers at these large banks are highly compensated, have big egos and are generally resistant to change.Perhaps the best way to assess a bank\u2019s broad risk profile is to look at its exposure to Level 3 securities, which it is required to disclose regularly. Level 3 assets are securities that because they are so opaque and complex trade very rarely, if at all.So instead of seeing where a stock, bond or more complicated item is trading now, or even a few weeks ago, and then using this information to determine how much the investment is worth, valuing a Level 3 asset requires risk managers to, quite literally, make a guess.The process has come to be known on trading desks as \u201cmark to myth\u201d as opposed to the official vernacular of mark to model.According to their 2015 annual reports, Barclays, Deutsche Bank and Credit Suisse are sitting on the largest piles of Level 3 assets: 36 billion pounds for Barclays, 32 billion euros for Deutsche Bank and 31.5 billion Swiss francs for Credit Suisse.At Credit Suisse, for example, Berenberg said that Level 3 assets were 133 percent of the firm\u2019s core capital cushion. The percentage for Deutsche Bank was 96 percent and for Barclays, 49 percent.The bank\u2019s advice to investors? Sell.Since then, Deutsche Bank\u2019s shares have fallen by 64 percent, Credit Suisse\u2019s by 65 percent and Barclays\u2019 by 53 percent. Reflecting concerns among investors with regard to the risky assets they own, the three banks trade at steep discounts to their book value; Deutsche Bank leads the way at 70 percent.And there are few signs that the selling will let up soon, as a growing number of hedge funds have increased their bets against European banks.George Soros, who became known as the man who broke the Bank of England with a bet against the British pound in 1992, made a multimillion-dollar wager against Deutsche Bank after the British vote to leave the European Union.His Soros Fund Management took a short position of 0.51 percent of the bank\u2019s stock on Friday, when the referendum results were announced.Marshall Wace, a London-based hedge fund, took a similar position that day.Both moves were disclosed in regulatory filings in Germany, where investors are required to disclose their short positions once they hit a threshold.In an interview on Tuesday, one of the paper\u2019s three authors, Jan Riepe, a finance professor at the University of T\u00fcbingen, argued that the uncertainty surrounding Britain\u2019s future in Europe made these banks an even riskier bet, as it will be all the harder to get rid of these securities in such an environment.\u201cAll this Brexit uncertainty is drying up the markets,\u201d Mr. Riepe said. \u201cAnd because many of these assets are traded over the counter in London, it is even more difficult to value them. It\u2019s very dangerous for the banks.\u201dAlexandra Stevenson contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How to Gauge a C.E.O.\u2019s Value? Hint: It\u2019s Not the Share Price", "Date": "2016-06-17", "News": "Supported byFair GameLess discernible, though, is who actually earned their pay the most by increasing the value of the companies they run by a commensurate amount. Such performers are not to be confused with executives who work to propel their company\u2019s stock price. This pursuit can have fleeting benefits and disastrous consequences, as Valeant International, the beleaguered drug company, has shown.One reason it\u2019s so hard for shareholders to determine a chief executive\u2019s value is that companies\u2019 descriptions of their pay packages are complex. For example, the discussion of General Electric\u2019s compensation practices took up more than 20 pages of its 65-page proxy this year.Any investor who plows through these pay documents will recognize a common corporate theme: The amounts awarded to the chief executive are aligned with shareholders\u2019 interests because the pay is grounded in the company\u2019s performance.But companies use a bewildering array of benchmarks in their compensation decisions. These gauges often vary, even within the same industry, making apples-to-apples comparisons difficult and hampering an investor\u2019s ability to determine when an executive is overpaid.Companies love total shareholder return in part because it is easy to calculate. But a company\u2019s stock can rocket even when its operations are being run into the ground. So basing pay on total shareholder return can encourage an executive to manage more for a company\u2019s share price than for its overall health.A better way to measure whether a C.E.O. has created value at a company is to look at its return on capital over a period of years. This reveals how effectively a company is using its own money to generate profit in its operations.When you compare these returns to an executive\u2019s compensation, you see where pay is justified and where it isn\u2019t.I asked Mr. O\u2019Byrne and Mr. Van Clieaf to analyze returns on capital among the top 200 companies whose compensation was reported by The New York Times three weeks ago. The goal was to see how the executive pay at each company stacks up against its corporate performance and highlight which companies are giving away the store to their chief executives and which are getting their money\u2019s worth.Mr. O\u2019Byrne and Mr. Van Clieaf began by examining each company\u2019s return on capital over the last five years and then comparing it with companies in the same industry. This resulted in a relative return on capital for each corporation.The experts then compared each company\u2019s C.E.O. pay last year with that of its peers. This produced a relative pay figure that could be set against its relative return on capital over five years. The calculations were adjusted for company size.Here are 200 of the highest-paid chief executives in American business.Industries with the greatest outsize pay were energy, technology, media, health care and consumer products, the study said.Companies high on the overpayment list included Salesforce.com, a software company; Vertex Pharmaceuticals; and the Vector Group, a tobacco concern.All three companies had a return on capital below that of their peers over the last five years, the analysis showed. Nevertheless, the pay received by these company\u2019s chief executives was lush.For example, at Salesforce.com, return on capital fell 23 percent over the last five years. As a result, Marc Benioff, its chief executive, received almost $31 million more last year than was warranted by the company\u2019s performance against its peers.Jeffrey M. Leiden of Vertex Pharmaceuticals received $27 million in excess pay based on the company\u2019s negative 35 percent return on capital over the period. And Howard M. Lorber, the head of the Vector Group, was overpaid by $35 million last year when judged on the company\u2019s 4.5 percent decline in return on capital during the previous five years.Representatives for all of the companies challenged the idea that return on capital was the best way to measure their operations.Chi Hea Cho, a spokeswoman for Salesforce.com, said that because its business model was based on recurring revenue, return on invested capital was not the right way to measure performance. \u201cWe have created a thoughtful executive compensation structure based on total shareholder return, which aligns executives\u2019 interests directly with those of our stockholders, and over the last five years, Salesforce has delivered returns of 111 percent, more than double the S.&P. 500 index.\u201dPaul Caminiti, a spokesman for the Vector Group, said in a statement: \u201cFrom 2010 to 2015, Vector\u2019s common stock produced total annualized returns of 21.6 percent, as compared to 12.6 percent for the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 over the same five-year period.\u201dA Vertex spokeswoman, Heather Nichols, said in a statement that successful earlier-stage biotech companies were measured largely on research productivity and shareholder returns. \u201cOver the last five years,\u201d she said, \u201cVertex has delivered three breakthrough medicines to people with serious diseases and a 259 percent total shareholder return.\u201dThe analysis also identified more than 70 companies whose chief executives were delivering outsize returns on capital for fair or even undersize pay.This group included MasterCard, overseen by Ajaypal Banga, which had a 40 percent premium compared with its peers, and the TJX Companies, the retailer run by Carol Meyrowitz, with a 36 percent excess return on capital.Philip Morris International, a tobacco company headed by Andr\u00e9 Calantzopoulos, generated excess return on capital of almost 30 percent compared with its peers.\u201cBoth investors and corporate directors need to measure performance based on the profits a company generates from its competitively successful production of goods and services,\u201d Mr. Lutin said. \u201cThat\u2019s the only real foundation there is for investment value, and for national prosperity.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Investing in an Emotional Trust Fund for Your Children", "Date": "2016-06-24", "News": "Supported byWealth MattersPARENTS think a lot about what their money might one day do for their children. Will it give them options in life to accomplish something meaningful, or rob them of ambition? Or will a lack of family money leave them at a disadvantage?Of course, there are a lot of other outcomes. But fear about the bad things that money can do to children sends some well-to-do parents to lawyers and advisers to create trust documents with rules stating what children need to do to obtain the money. Even parents of modest means are encouraged to own life insurance policies in trusts to inhibit their children from getting all the cash at once should the parents die.These are necessary in certain cases. But long before children are aware of what they might inherit, there are more foundational conversations that parents should have. What if parents thought about the capital \u2014 yes, financial, but also emotional and intellectual \u2014 that they were spending on their young children as assets in an \u201cemotional trust fund\u201d with trustee duties inherent in it?That\u2019s the concept being advanced by Jacalyn S. Burke, a former nanny, a commentator on parenthood issues, and the author of \u201cThe Nanny Time Bomb: Navigating the Crisis in Child Care\u201d (Praeger, 2015). She argues that thinking in financial terms when it comes to parental choices could make a difference in shaping children who grow up to live meaningful lives \u2014 regardless of whether any money comes to them.The essential components of an emotional trust fund are analogous to those of a conventional one \u2014 cash, stocks, bonds and property as the holdings, with trustees directing the investments in each, with an eye toward the recipient\u2019s best interest. How investments in those assets are divided up, though, is what matters.\u201cThat same structure we use for our financial lives could be applied to how we raise our children,\u201d Ms. Burke said. \u201cThe different components could relate to a child\u2019s life. A nanny comes in as a massive part of that portfolio, particularly if they work with them 9 to 5 and sometimes longer.\u201dNannies and child care workers more broadly are the stocks in the emotional trust fund. Their influence on children is a bet on the future, and just like stocks, no one makes a selection thinking it will underperform.Like stocks, some nannies do well from the start. Others pay dividends over time. And then there are the ones that seem like high-flyers but prove to be disappointments.Ms. Burke said this is where her thinking started, largely because she found parents not putting enough time into selecting someone \u2014 or enough money into paying such a crucial person in their children\u2019s development. Cutting corners and hiring a disengaged nanny early on, she said, could hurt a child\u2019s ability to form relationships over the long run.To choose well, she said, parents need to do their due diligence. \u201cFor someone who you\u2019re employing for the majority of the time when you\u2019re out of the home, you should go back and see how that stock has performed in the past,\u201d she said. \u201cDid it perform well for six months or for 10 years? A reliable performer is someone with various credentials who shows up each week \u2014 that\u2019s a solid stock that\u2019s not going to wobble.\u201dKaren Kaufman, a clinical psychologist in Manhattan, who also wrote the preface to Ms. Burke\u2019s book, said distracted nannies can inflict lasting damage on children. (The same goes for parents.)\u201cJust about every nanny I see is on the phone,\u201d Dr. Kaufman said. \u201cThey\u2019re distracted. It\u2019s all these little tiny disruptions that make kids question if they\u2019re enough.\u201dSeparating good from bad nannies is as difficult as trying to select a stock. Ms. Burke recommends detailed background checks but also visiting the nanny at home or where she was last working, to gauge her interaction with that family. This also serves to make sure the nanny is telling the truth.\u201cI was routinely asked by other nannies to pretend I was a parent and be a reference,\u201d she said.For people who have consistently chosen nannies who didn\u2019t work out, Ms. Burke suggested finding a consultant to work with the family on finding the right fit, much as one would go to an adviser to help with selecting securities.And as with stocks, trustees need to be dutiful managers \u2014 in terms of nannies\u2019 work but also their happiness in their jobs. \u201cWhen nannies got together and complained, you\u2019d think the No. 1 complaint would be the awful wages they got paid,\u201d Ms. Burke said. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t. It was the lack of respect.\u201dOf course, it may take time before parents can judge how well their child care money was spent \u2014 or they may have an anchoring bias that keeps them with a mediocre nanny for fear that others will be worse. Enrichment activities are different. They\u2019re the bonds in the portfolio.Just as analysts following the declining prices of municipal bonds knew Detroit and Puerto Rico were headed into trouble long before a crisis hit, parents can measure their children\u2019s responses to enrichment fairly quickly. Ms. Burke said she is not focused on the number or kind of activities for a child, but on how those activities are inspiring or hurting a child.\u201cThere is so much value in doing something outside their school curriculum,\u201d she said. \u201cThere\u2019s a consummate value in enriching your children but not overextending them.\u201dCommunity, broadly defined, is the property component of the emotional trust fund. \u201cA cloistered sense of the world does not do them well,\u201d Ms. Burke said. \u201cAt the weekends, walk the dog around the neighborhood, have pancakes, play ball in your neighborhood, get involved in your church or synagogue. It gives your kid a great grounding in life.\u201dHow parents spend time with their children is the cash in the emotional trust fund. It can be spent wisely to maximum benefits or it can be squandered on things that don\u2019t matter or could do harm.In some ways, spending that cash carelessly dovetails with too much enrichment \u2014 activities scheduled throughout the weekend keep families apart. Instead, Ms. Burke calls for parents to spend their emotional cash on experiences \u2014 sitting, playing, baking, talking \u2014 and not on more things.\u201cCash is switching your phone off and doing things with your children,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat I hear from children is they just want down time with their parents. I can\u2019t tell you how many extremely wealthy children say \u2018I just want to play ball with Dad.\u2019\u201dLike any trust fund, an emotional one needs a balance between what the trustees \u2014 the parents \u2014 are doing and how those actions are received by children \u2014 the beneficiaries.\u201cThe nannies can provide a tremendous amount of education,\u201d Dr. Kaufman said. \u201cBut the main theme is no one is as important as the parents. It\u2019s encouraging parents to be more physically present, not to be on their devices, to make eye contact.\u201dNone of this is to say that parents can substitute an emotional trust fund for talking to their children as they grow up about wealth and the responsibilities that come with it.\u201cFinancial wealth is not a free ride \u2014 it\u2019s a powerful tool,\u201d said Kristen Armstrong, a wealth dynamics coach with U.S. Bank\u2019s Ascent Private Capital Management. \u201cIn high school, having some conversations about being a family with significant wealth and being a family who has some opportunities is important.\u201dGiven the amount of time and money parents spend on their children today, the emotional trust fund is an interesting concept. If nothing else, thinking in these terms might reframe how people spend time and money in their family.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "C.I.A. Arms for Syrian Rebels Supplied Black Market, Officials Say", "Date": "2016-06-26", "News": "Supported byAMMAN, Jordan \u2014 Weapons shipped into Jordan by the Central Intelligence Agency and Saudi Arabia intended for Syrian rebels have been systematically stolen by Jordanian intelligence operatives and sold to arms merchants on the black market, according to American and Jordanian officials.The existence of the weapons theft, which ended only months ago after complaints by the American and Saudi governments, is being reported for the first time after a joint investigation by The New York Times and Al Jazeera. The theft, involving millions of dollars of weapons, highlights the messy, unplanned consequences of programs to arm and train rebels \u2014 the kind of program the C.I.A. and Pentagon have conducted for decades \u2014 even after the Obama administration had hoped to keep the training program in Jordan under tight control.The Jordanian officers who were part of the scheme reaped a windfall from the weapons sales, using the money to buy expensive SUVs, iPhones and other luxury items, Jordanian officials said.The theft and resale of the arms \u2014 including Kalashnikov assault rifles, mortars and rocket-propelled grenades \u2014 have led to a flood of new weapons available on the black arms market. Investigators do not know what became of most of them, but a disparate collection of groups, including criminal networks and rural Jordanian tribes, use the arms bazaars to build their arsenals. Weapons smugglers also buy weapons in the arms bazaars to ship outside the country.The F.B.I. investigation into the Amman shooting, run by the bureau\u2019s Washington field office, is continuing. But American and Jordanian officials said the investigators believed that the weapons a Jordanian police captain, Anwar Abu Zaid, used to gun down two American contractors, two Jordanians and one South African had originally arrived in Jordan intended for the Syrian rebel-training program.The officials said this finding had come from tracing the serial numbers of the weapons.Mohammad H. al-Momani, Jordan\u2019s minister of state for media affairs, said allegations that Jordanian intelligence officers had been involved in any weapons thefts were \u201cabsolutely incorrect.\u201d\u201cWeapons of our security institutions are concretely tracked, with the highest discipline,\u201d he said. He called the powerful Jordanian intelligence service, known as the General Intelligence Directorate, or G.I.D., \u201ca world-class, reputable institution known for its professional conduct and high degree of cooperation among security agencies.\u201d In Jordan, the head of the G.I.D. is considered the second most important man after the king.Representatives of the C.I.A. and F.B.I. declined to comment.The State Department did not address the allegations directly, but a spokesman said America\u2019s relationship with Jordan remained solid.\u201cThe United States deeply values the long history of cooperation and friendship with Jordan,\u201d said John Kirby, the spokesman. \u201cWe are committed to the security of Jordan and to partnering closely with Jordan to meet common security challenges.\u201dThe existence of the program is classified, as are all details about its budget. American officials say that the C.I.A. has trained thousands of rebels in the past three years, and that the fighters made substantial advances on the battlefield against Syrian government forces until Russian military forces \u2014 launched last year in support of Mr. Assad \u2014 compelled them to retreat.The training program is based in Jordan because of the country\u2019s proximity to the Syrian battlefields. From the beginning, the C.I.A. and the Arab intelligence agencies relied on Jordanian security services to transport the weapons, many bought in bulk in the Balkans and elsewhere around Eastern Europe.Jordanian and American officials described the weapons theft and subsequent investigation on the condition of anonymity because the Syrian rebel training is classified in the United States and is a government secret in Jordan.News of the weapons theft and eventual crackdown has been circulating inside Jordan\u2019s government for several months. Husam Abdallat, a senior aide to several past Jordanian prime ministers, said he had heard about the scheme from current Jordanian officials. The G.I.D. has some corrupt officers in its ranks, Mr. Abdallat said, but added that the institution as a whole is not corrupt. \u201cThe majority of its officers are patriotic and proud Jordanians who are the country\u2019s first line of defense,\u201d he said.Jordanian officials who described the operation said it had been run by a group of G.I.D. logistics officers with direct access to the weapons once they reached Jordan. The officers regularly siphoned truckloads of the weapons from the stocks, before delivering the rest of the weapons to designated drop-off points.Then the officers sold the weapons at several large arms markets in Jordan. The main arms bazaars in Jordan are in Ma\u2019an, in the southern part of the country; in Sahab, outside Amman; and in the Jordan Valley.It is unclear whether the current head of the G.I.D., Gen. Faisal al-Shoubaki, had knowledge of the theft of the C.I.A. and Saudi weapons. But several Jordanian intelligence officials said senior officers inside the service had knowledge of the weapons scheme and provided cover for the lower-ranking officers.Word that the weapons intended for the rebels were being bought and sold on the black market leaked into Jordan government circles last year, when arms dealers began bragging to their customers that they had large stocks of American- and Saudi-provided weapons.Jordanian intelligence operatives monitoring the arms market \u2014 operatives not involved in the weapons-diversion scheme \u2014 began sending reports to headquarters about a proliferation of weapons in the market and of the boasts of the arms dealers.After the Americans and Saudis complained about the theft, investigators at the G.I.D. arrested several dozen officers involved in the scheme, among them a lieutenant colonel running the operation. They were ultimately released from detention and fired from the service, but were allowed to keep their pensions and money they gained from the scheme, according to Jordanian officials.Jordan\u2019s decision to host the C.I.A.-led training program is the latest episode in a long partnership.Beginning in the Eisenhower administration, the C.I.A. made large payments to King Hussein, who ruled Jordan from 1952 until his death in 1999, in exchange for permission to run numerous intelligence operations on Jordanian soil.C.I.A. money and expertise also helped the king establish the G.I.D. and put down internal and external threats to his government. Since the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, the United States has flooded Jordan with money for various counterterrorism programs. American and Jordanian spies have run a joint counterterrorism center outside Amman, and a secret prison in Jordan housed prisoners the C.I.A. captured in the region.In his 2006 book, \u201cState of Denial,\u201d the journalist Bob Woodward recounted a 2003 conversation in which George J. Tenet, then the director of central intelligence, told Condoleezza Rice, then the national security adviser, \u201cWe created the Jordanian intelligence service, and now we own it.\u201dIt is a relationship of mutual dependence, but Jordan has particular leverage because of its location in the heart of the Middle East and its general tolerance to be used as a base of American military and intelligence operations. Jordan\u2019s security services also have a long history of trying to infiltrate Islamic militant groups, efforts that have yielded both success and failure.Two recent heads of the service, also known as the Mukhabarat, have been sent to prison on charges including embezzlement, money laundering and bank fraud. One of them, Gen. Samih Battikhi, ran the G.I.D. from 1995 to 2000 and was convicted of being part of a scheme to obtain bank loans of around $600 million for fake government contracts and pocketing about $25 million. He was sentenced to eight years in prison, but the sentence was eventually reduced to four years that were served in his villa in the seaside town of Aqaba.Gen. Mohammad al-Dahabi, who ran the service from 2005 to 2008, was later convicted of stealing millions of dollars that G.I.D. officers had seized from Iraqi citizens crossing into Jordan in the years after the American invasion of Iraq in 2003. His trial showed that he had also arranged for money to be smuggled in private cars from Iraq into Jordan and had been involved in sellingJordanian citizenship to Iraqi businessmen. He was sentenced to 13 years in prison and fined tens of millions of dollars.President Obama authorized the covert arming program in April 2013, after more than a year of debate inside the administration about the wisdom of using the C.I.A. to train rebels trying to oust Mr. Assad.The decision was made in part to try to gain control of a chaotic situation in which Arab countries were funneling arms into Syria for various rebel groups with little coordination. The Qataris had paid to smuggle shipments of Chinese-made FN-6 shoulder-fired weapons over the border from Turkey, and Saudi Arabia sent thousands of Kalashnikovs and millions of rounds of ammunition it had bought, sometimes with the C.I.A.\u2019s help.By late 2013, the C.I.A. was working directly with Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and other nations to arm and train small groups of rebels and send them across the border into Syria.The specific motives behind the November shooting at the Amman police training facility remain uncertain, and it is unclear when the F.B.I. will officially conclude its investigation.This year, the widows of the Americans killed in the attack sued Twitter, alleging that it knowingly permitted the Islamic State to use its social media platform to spread the militant group\u2019s violent message, recruiting and raising funds.Captain Abu Zaid, the gunman, was killed almost immediately. His brother, Fadi Abu Zaid, said in an interview that he still believed his brother was innocent and that he had given no indications he was planning to carry out the shooting.The Jordanian government, he said, has denied him any answers about the shooting, and has refused to release his brother\u2019s autopsy report.Mark Mazzetti reported from Amman and Washington, and Ali Younes from Amman, Washington and Doha, Qatar.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Advice as Markets React to \u2018Brexit\u2019: Take Some Deep Breaths and Don\u2019t Do a Thing", "Date": "2016-06-24", "News": "Supported byYour MoneyThe impulse when the stock market abruptly plunges is to do something. Anything. Our life savings are often on the line, after all.But that\u2019s just the thing: Stocks are most useful for long-term goals. So unless those goals have changed in the last day or two (and they may well have for some people who live and work in Europe), it probably doesn\u2019t make much sense to overhaul an investment strategy based on a blip of market activity.So pour yourself a drink, or sit down with a pint of ice cream, and consider the following eight points, many of which I\u2019ve discussed in previous columns.Chances are, your portfolio and net worth consist of a diverse mix of assets. If you have a home in the United States, its value hasn\u2019t fallen this week. Some bond and commodity funds may have risen.It\u2019s generally a bad idea to look at your investment statements too often, but take a quick peek.Still uneasy? Consider a third point.You knew that stocks involved risk and that the returns they have traditionally delivered, above and beyond what cash and bonds do, was the reward for your persistence.Nobody knows for sure whether we\u2019re in for a decline in the stock market of 10 or 20 percent, or more, even if there is a wholesale breakup of the European Union. Increased volatility is likely. But if all of this does happen and you are a regular, long-term investor putting a bit away each pay period, you\u2019ll be buying more when prices are lower.I know too many 70-year-olds who sold all of their stocks in 2009 and are healthy enough to live to 100. They\u2019d be going on a lot more vacations now and be worrying less about long-term care if they had held firm.Worried about a 529 college savings plan for a 12-year-old? Hopefully, you weren\u2019t 100 percent in stocks with six years to go before needing money for tuition. Still, you have at least nine years for a portion of that portfolio to recover from any sustained downturn. If that 12-year-old is the oldest of at least two children, you could use cash to pay some tuition bills for the oldest and let some of the account ride even longer for the next child.Let\u2019s say you still have trouble sleeping. Then you may be the sort of person who needs to consider a fifth point:You can\u2019t say that nobody told you there\u2019d be days like these. Strange days indeed come with the program. There will be surprises always, often when most talking heads thought something else would happen.So try to give the situation in Europe some time to work itself out, and consider the alternatives. There are few investments that can deliver the kinds of returns that global stocks can without their own accompanying anxiety and uncertainty.Another alternative is to save a lot more in safer investments like cash or certain bonds. Most people don\u2019t have enough income to do that easily, so settling for lower returns will mean a combination of working longer and living modestly, forever. For some people, that is a fine trade-off.Again, there is absolutely nothing abnormal about what is going on here.Most of us have to save somewhere, and history suggests that stocks are the most accessible route to get the returns you\u2019ll need to retire someday. It would take decades of systemic economic and political erosion to prove otherwise, and a day or two of market declines do not suggest that anything like that is upon us.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "How Much Will \u2018Brexit\u2019 Stress Banks? Some Ways to Tell", "Date": "2016-06-28", "News": "Supported byMoment of TruthAmong all the anxieties that Britain\u2019s decision to leave the European Union has provoked, here\u2019s another one: Are big banks going to be in trouble?Taxpayers in Europe and the United State might want to know.The Brexit vote could very well be a test of whether governments have, since the financial crisis of 2008, limited the threat that large banks pose to the wider economy.In 2008, governments around the world decided to spend huge sums bailing out their nations\u2019 banks, underscoring that they were \u201ctoo big to fail.\u201d Brexit will go a long way toward telling us whether they still are.Today, banks are stronger. They have more capital, meaning they borrow less money to finance their loans and trading. Lower borrowing makes them more stable. The banks also have higher reserves of liquid cash they can tap into if it becomes hard to borrow money in the markets.So, how are they doing? Here are some ways to assess the stress in the financial system.The valuations on bank stocks also look awful, particularly a yardstick called the price-to-book ratio. This effectively compares a bank\u2019s market value with its net worth as stated in its balance sheet. If that ratio is below one, it suggests investors are skeptical about the bank. Deutsche Bank is trading at around 30 percent of its net worth, a big discount. In the United States, Bank of America is trading at just under 60 percent of its book value, a ratio even lower than in 2009, when losses from the financial crisis were still piling up.But it can be a mistake to think that a bank is in dire trouble because its stock is slumping or its valuation looks sickly. The declines might reflect investors\u2019 belief that it will be harder for the banks to make profits in the future, particularly if Brexit leads to a recession. Or it may be a signal that the market believes the bank will have to break itself up, or sell operations, to become more streamlined. But this is something a bank can do without help from the taxpayer.Let\u2019s look at the swaps on UniCredit, a large Italian bank. An investor on one side of the credit default swap makes a payment to an investor on the other side of the swap. The investor making the payment stands to receive a big payout if UniCredit defaults. That probably won\u2019t happen, of course. But if the cost of that insurance against default rises because of fears stirred up by an event like the Brexit crisis, the investor who bought the insurance against default before the crisis, when it was cheaper, can now sell the swap for a profit.And what is this swaps market telling us now about the banks? The good news: The costs of insuring against defaults by large banks is still far lower than it was during the financial crisis and when European debt markets were plunging.But if the Brexit crisis pushes European banks to use such loans, it may be hard to track how much they are borrowing. One of the ways in which Greek banks were helped last year during the country\u2019s debt crisis was through a loan facility called the emergency liquidity assistance. But the European Central Bank, and some national central banks, typically do not break out exactly how much each country is borrowing under that loan program, which added to the confusion last year.Why do these loans matter in assessing what the Brexit crisis tells us about too-big-to-fail?So far, those who contend that the post-recession banking overhaul has significantly strengthened the system are winning the debate. Further evidence for their position: The Federal Reserve on Wednesday said that all but one of the United States\u2019 largest banks had unconditionally passed annual stress tests, and were thus allowed to distribute money to their shareholders. But it\u2019s too early to see if the overhaul has succeeded. The real test would be whether a major European country that uses the euro \u2014 Britain does not \u2014 voted to follow Britain out of the European Union.It\u2019s a frightening prospect, but it might take that to really test whether the too-big-to-fail banks can fail.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "One Man\u2019s Quest to Get Americans to Care About Rugby", "Date": "2016-06-17", "News": "FeatureIn the U.S., the sport has long been overshadowed by football. Now a former bond trader is working to bring it back to the mainstream.Supported byLast fall, he was thinking of his late father and the National Football League games they used to attend at the old Giants Stadium in the Meadowlands. On cold days, they sat on copies of the Sunday paper and used phone books to keep their feet from freezing on the frigid concrete. They saw the same people every weekend in the stands. They felt they were part of the game in a way that was hard to put into words. All his life, Schoninger had been going to N.F.L. games \u2014 10 last year with his teenage son, Charlie. Charlie loved football, but to Schoninger it seemed that on the professional level, the ethos of the game, which evolved from rugby more than a century ago, had curdled. Materialism and profiteering had eaten away any nobility the N.F.L. game once possessed, leaving in its place a violent, vainglorious, $13-billion-a-year entertainment spectacle staged by helmeted mercenaries for the enrichment of grasping billionaires. Rugby was different, or seemed so, even in the nature of the game: Players vied for the ball in scrums, bulled it forward in mauls, booted it through goal posts or dashed with it across the try line in the course of 80 nearly continuous minutes of free-flowing improvisation, versus what unfolded in the three-plus hours it took to play a 60-minute N.F.L. game, where the actual amount of action averages only 10 minutes 43 seconds. In football, specialists did the same thing over and over; in rugby, you played offense and defense \u2014 anyone could score.One day in February, Schoninger confided to me that his secret ambition was to supplant the N.F.L. He was kidding. Or not. It was hard to tell.\u201cThe N.F.L. is on top right now, and rugby is at the bottom,\u201d he said. \u201cBut things always look better at the top and worse at the bottom than they really are.\u201dPRO Rugby, his new league for a sport that in America has a fan base that would barely register as an N.F.L. rounding error, was just two months from kicking off its 30-game season in April, with clubs in Denver, Sacramento, San Francisco, San Diego and Obetz, Ohio. Opening day was marked D-Day on a wall calendar.\u201cWhat if nobody comes?\u201d I asked. Rugby-dream stress was showing on Schoninger\u2019s face in a way it hadn\u2019t when I asked the same heartless question in October.\u201cYou mean what happens if I don\u2019t sell a single ticket, or a single hot dog, or a single parking space? If nobody buys any PRO Rugby T-shirts or hats? If I don\u2019t get one sponsor? If nobody wants to broadcast a single game?\u201dHe shuddered.\u201cI\u2019m all in,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve become a rugby believer. If I fail, it\u2019s not the money I\u2019ve spent \u2014 well, it\u2019s the money I\u2019ve spent, but it\u2019s also that I was wrong. Wrong about the support from the rugby community. Wrong about the time being right. That\u2019s what would hurt. It\u2019s like opening a restaurant and then no one comes. That would hurt. But then, if this were easy, it would have been done already.\u201dThe first bona fide rugby in the United States was played in 1874, between Harvard and McGill University. Six years later, at Yale, the future T. rex of American sports was hatched when Walter Camp, the innovative coach and writer known as the father of American football, separated the rugby scrum into football\u2019s \u201cline of scrimmage.\u201d Both rugby and football were popular in American colleges and universities in the early 20th century, and at one point, alarmed by the prevalence of injuries, Stanford and Berkeley gave up football for rugby \u2014 a programming decision that was reversed after New Zealand\u2019s mighty All Blacks, on a tour in 1913, humiliated a squad of all-stars in California, 51-3.New Zealand and other top teams were not represented when the United States won Olympic rugby gold medals in Antwerp in 1920 and Paris in 1924. The 17-3 victory in Paris over a heavily favored French team by a United States squad made up mostly of California collegians was one of the greatest upsets in Olympic history. But the outraged reaction of some 40,000 French fans at the Stade Colombes jeopardized the very principle of the better and more peaceful world through sports on which the modern Olympics were based. David Wallechinsky recounts the scene in \u201cThe Complete Book of the Olympics\u201d: \u201cAfter two French players were injured, the U.S. team was booed and hissed the remainder of the game. Fighting broke out in the stands, and Gideon Nelson, an art teacher from Illinois\u201d \u2014 and a United States reserve player \u2014 \u201cwas knocked unconscious after being hit in the face with a walking stick.\u201d The Americans left the field under a police escort and a barrage of rocks and bottles.Rugby was dropped from subsequent Olympics. In America the game went into a long dormancy from which it did not emerge until the 1960s, when it began to catch on again with colleges and clubs. Ed Hagerty, whose life before rugby included a turn as an altar boy in Grace Kelly\u2019s wedding in 1956, discovered his passion for the game at Holy Cross in 1963. \u201cIt was kind of countercultural,\u201d he recalls. \u201cWe wore discarded football jerseys.\u201d After graduation, Hagerty played for local clubs in New York and was working as the publisher of Popular Science when he quit to eke out a living as editor of Scrumdown, a rugby newspaper started in 1975 by Jon Prusmack. One of the first Scrumdown editorials summed up the state of the American game, suggesting that ruggers from New Zealand, Australia and Britain were to their American counterparts what Rudolf Nureyev was to Zorba the Greek.To close the talent gap, promote and govern the sport at all levels and establish a United States national team, the 115,000-member organization known today as USA Rugby was formed in 1976. This August, rugby is returning to the Olympics after a 92-year hiatus. The United States will defend its gold medal in Rio de Janeiro, playing a shorter, less complex form of the game that features seven players on a side instead of the traditional 15.Reflecting his faith and his cool appraisal of numbers, Schoninger spent a year at Emory University studying theology, then transferred to Tulane, from which he graduated in 1982 with a degree in mechanical engineering. He landed a $13,000-a-year job as a runner on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange and later worked as a construction manager for Morse Diesel, the general contractor for the Marriott Marquis Hotel in Times Square. He returned to Wall Street in 2000 to trade stocks and bonds at Morgan Stanley and Oppenheimer. Bearish by temperament, with a keen feel for risk, he eventually started his own shop, DJS Capital Management, managing a bond portfolio of several hundred million dollars for more than a dozen clients.In 2013 Schoninger bought an inactive company called Stadium Capital Financing Group that Morgan Stanley needed to unload to comply with new banking regulations. Trying to revive the business, he began shopping for undervalued second-tier sports teams (minor-league baseball, lacrosse, D-league basketball) whose revenues might be leveraged to raise capital for new stadiums. He wasn\u2019t having much luck when, in the autumn of 2014, he was introduced to Jason Moore, an Australian sports-marketing impresario who for years had been trying to raise up to $300 million to create an American rugby league drawing on the N.F.L.\u2019s gladiatorial-entertainment template. \u201cWe wanted to showcase rugby the way Americans consume sports, marketing it with American pizazz and style,\u201d Moore told me. He aimed to sell franchises, host games in midsize soccer venues and pay players upward of $100,000, but he had yet to secure the all-important \u201csanction\u201d from USA Rugby, without which it is difficult to hire referees, coaches or players or to get insurance.\u201cThere were 61,500 people at Soldier Field, the largest rugby crowd in American history,\u201d he recalls. \u201cThat was the moment things changed for me. I realized that if great teams wanted to play here, and you could fill Soldier Field, you could do well building a professional league.\u201dSchoninger met with USA Rugby\u2019s chief executive, Nigel Melville, a former scrum-half captain of the English national team, in fall 2014. Using USA Rugby\u2019s demographic and event data, Schoninger spent the winter doing due diligence. He drew up budgets for what he envisioned would be six league-owned franchises. He would start modestly, building around cities with vibrant rugby clubs and prominent teams among the hundreds of college and university rugby programs. Salaries ranging from $20,000 to $35,000 would be on a par with other second-tier professional sports vying for sunlight in the shadow of the N.F.L. Through Facebook, he could reach rugby fans with a precision never before possible. \u201cI couldn\u2019t have built a league on my budget without social media,\u201d he says.The expenses for each team \u2014 salaries, coaches, training facilities, venue costs, marketing, uniforms \u2014 would run to about $1.5 million per year. Schoninger didn\u2019t have, or want, partners, and would be financing everything himself the first year. Revenues \u2014 who knew? Could he get sponsors? Sell broadcast rights? How many people would buy tickets? When professional rugby began in England, the first Harlequins game, at Stoop stadium, drew around 1,400. Fans now routinely fill all 14,800 seats, and games at the national stadium in Twickenham attract capacity crowds of 82,000. A survey by the Sports and Fitness Industry Association found that there were 1.3 million rugby \u201cparticipants\u201d in the United States, some 431,000 of them hard-core devotees who played or watched the game more than eight times a year. (The N.F.L., for comparison\u2019s sake, estimates its fan base at 202 million.)In April 2015, the USA Rugby board, which had considered many proposals over the years, agreed to sanction Schoninger\u2019s plan. Schoninger intended to kick off exactly a year later \u2014 hoping to ride the public interest generated by the Rugby World Cup in the fall of 2015 and the return of rugby to the Olympics in Rio this summer. First, he needed a name and a logo. He couldn\u2019t use the word \u201cleague\u201d because \u201crugby league\u201d signified a much less popular version of the game that developed after the so-called Great Schism of 1895, when working-class players from northern England who wanted to be paid split off from teams adhering to the supposed purity of amateur competition. A branding firm in San Francisco proposed a number of logos and names. Some, like the National Rugby Association, or N.R.A., were red-carded for unwanted connotations. Logos that looked decent on a ball or jersey might look crummy on a trailer or a pitch. He finally settled on a red oval shaped like a rugby ball with the winning name in block letters: PRO, for Professional Rugby Organization. He added the word \u201cRugby\u201d below the acronym lest there be any confusion about what PRO actually stood for.Having never been the public face of an organization, Schoninger found himself in some novel situations. In December he sat down in the Pig \u2019N\u2019 Whistle bar in Manhattan with Matt McCarthy, a host of a webcast called Rugby Wrap Up. McCar\u00adthy reached across the table and palpated Schoninger\u2019s arm.\u201cDoug, I just want to make sure you\u2019re real \u2014 \u201d\u201cI\u2019m as real as you are,\u201d Schoninger said.\u201c\u2014 because you\u2019re like Sasquatch to most American rugby fans.\u201dThe league\u2019s initial website and its Facebook page went up in October, and Sasquatch had been living and dying on the number of \u201clikes.\u201d He was relieved that only one fussbudget had taken issue with the redundancy in the name PRO Rugby. He hired a director of operations, Stephen Lewis, a well-connected Scotsman who was named USA Rugby\u2019s 2014 coach of the year. Dominic DeFalco, a recent Penn State graduate who played rugby there, came aboard over the summer as assistant director. Just before Christmas, Schoninger organized a skills combine in San Diego to assess domestic prospects and shoot footage for video spots.There were setbacks. Schoninger couldn\u2019t find a venue for a team in New York, and his hopes were further hindered by the state\u2019s exorbitant workman\u2019s-compensation insurance rates. Philadelphia\u2019s rugby community was not as vigorous as he\u2019d hoped. Venues in the Boston area didn\u2019t pan out. By January it was clear that the first season would feature no teams on the East Coast. But Sacramento proved fertile ground. Having three teams in California meant that players could travel to some games by bus instead of plane, saving Schoninger $1,500 a game on transportation.When I stopped by the office in February, coaches had been hired, the schedule set, but Schoninger wasn\u2019t sure how many players \u2014 drawn mostly from the U.S., with a sprinkling of international stars \u2014 would sign contracts, and he hadn\u2019t found a national sponsor or settled on a broadcast deal.\u201cI was always the downside guy,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can\u2019t take risks if you don\u2019t understand the downside. But here we are, two months away, and no one can tell me what our revenues are going to be.\u201dCardio training for Sacramento players. The league\u2019s inaugural season \u2014 five teams, 16 weeks, 30 games \u2014 began in April.Lewis, the director of operations, came in to say he\u2019d heard from the San Francisco coach, Paul Keeler, that no one liked the colors of the team\u2019s uniform.\u201cToo much gray,\u201d Lewis said.\u201cThe designer wanted gray \u2014 it\u2019s supposed to be evocative of San Francisco fog,\u201d Schoninger said.\u201cNo one likes it.\u201d\u201cWe can change it.\u201dDeFalco pulled up computer photos of all the proposed league uniforms \u2014 a palette of bold colors meant to evoke the geography of each team\u2019s city.\u201cAre we paying this guy to come up with these designs?\u201d said Lewis, who had already dubbed his boss the Mad Couturier because he insisted on putting a line across the jerseys to mark the upper limit of a legal tackle.\u201cWhat\u2019s our rule?\u201d Schoninger said.\u201cCriticism is only accepted with suggested solutions,\u201d DeFalco said.\u201cIn some ways, the reason you have a Season 1 is so you can fix things in Season 2,\u201d Schoninger said, sighing.\u201cI feel like I\u2019m running for court clerk in one of those elections where there\u2019s only one candidate,\u201d he said as he parked.When he finished explaining why viewers might want to witness the fruition of his rugby dream instead of, say, assess the structural features of Finnish lapphunds at the Sacramento Dog Show, also taking place that day, he headed to Bonney Field. The temperature was climbing to near-record levels. He was frazzled from weeks of cross-country travel and negotiations. The cable channel ONE World Sports would be broadcasting a third of the season. AOL was live-streaming the Sacramento game. Hawk-Eye Innovations, a sports-technology company, was producing the seven-camera video feed. Thanks to a payroll imbroglio, he\u2019d recently spent seven hours manually entering salary information for his 130 new players. Where was the credit-card machine Bank of America had promised? And why, oh why, had he scheduled opening-day games in two cities? The Ohio team\u2019s flight barely got in to Denver in the midst of a blizzard.\u201cMaybe it\u2019ll be like a snow day, and people will show up,\u201d he said.\u201cDouglas wakes up every morning, and the glass is half full,\u201d said his wife, Abigail Asher, a noted art consultant.When the gates of Bonney Field opened, early arrivals huddled in the shade of the press box. In the V.I.P. tent, waitresses were loading tables with dishes of salsa and colored tortilla chips.At 3:30 the players were announced \u2014 Sacramento in green and white; San Francisco in fog-free red and black. It\u2019s a risible misconception that rugby is populated by athletes inferior to high-level American footballers. The \u201cboys,\u201d as they are called by coaches, fans and even the players themselves, are built like a herd of genetically modified water buffalo and seem as inexhaustible as a class of A.D.H.D. preschoolers.For all the finesse and savvy the players need to succeed in a game that they, not the coaches on the sideline, control, rugby still has a brutal heart. Lest there be any doubt, an ambulance was parked behind the bleachers. But it\u2019s a paradox of the sport that helmetless rugby players may actually suffer fewer concussions than their cousins in the N.F.L. The concussion rate at last year\u2019s World Cup, according to USA Rugby, was 11 per 1,000 player-hours, compared with an estimated 54 per 1,000 player-hours last season in the N.F.L. (The N.F.L. calculates concussions per game, not per player-hour.) Credit below-the-shoulder tackling rules and self-preservation \u2014 not having a helmet lessens the temptation to deploy your head as a spear.At 4 o\u2019clock, Dan Power, a loquacious former rugby player with a gift for decoding the chaos on the pitch, leaned into his press-box mike and said, \u201cLadies and gentlemen, the wait is finally over.\u201dPreseason odds had made the talent-laden San Francisco team the heavy favorite, and at first the game unfolded accordingly. It was all a bit bewildering to the untutored eye. The ball would vanish in a clot of bodies and then mysteriously reappear on the grass like a giant egg, and a scrum half would pluck it up and fling it underhand across the field in what might become a series of thrilling laterals that delivered it to a speedster on the wing who would hie down the sideline and fling himself across the try-line, jabbing the ball onto the ground for the proverbial \u201ctouch down.\u201d The heat began to afflict players on both sides with cramps, and occasionally some of the boys were leveled by head-on collisions that left them looking as if the next game they played might in fact be the game they played in heaven.When play resumed, San Francisco lock Nick Grass, evidently having missed the memo about fellowship and respect, was sent off with a yellow card after he appeared to gouge the eyes of Sacramento flanker Kyle Sumsion. \u201cA little bit of \u2018How\u2019s your father\u2019 going on out there,\u201d said the color commentator, Lou Stanfill, framing the fisticuffs in sports-talk fashion as an exchange of pleasantries. (Grass was later suspended for six games.) When San Francisco hooker Tom Coolican was yellow-carded, Sacramento used its two-man advantage to pull ahead. The crowd of just under 3,400 drummed their feet on the aluminum bleachers. The home team closed out the win, 37-25. The fans stood and clapped, and then the players from both teams lined up in front of the stands and applauded the crowd.For the moment, as the heat of a sun-baked afternoon ebbed, he lingered in the afterglow of the day\u2019s success, reviewing the debut with anyone who wanted to talk about it. He fell into conversations with the announcers as they packed up, and the coaches, and one of the stadium managers, who said 800 people had paid for parking. Even the Mad Couturier\u2019s jersey tackle line had gotten good reviews. He chatted with the players who were gathered under the V.I.P. tent swigging beer and carbo-loading plates of lasagna in preparation for their professional responsibilities next week. A few fans who recognized Schoninger waited patiently to thank him, and he fell into conversation with them too. It was getting dark. His wife and son were waiting to go back to the hotel, but he kept getting tangled in talk \u2014 in essence the same conversation he\u2019d been having day after day for the last year and a half, a rolling, jabbering maul of rugby rugby rugby. Sure, it was all in a day\u2019s work, but it was more than that. It was what needed to be done; it was part of what he\u2019d come to think of as his mission, spreading the gospel of the professional game, one convert at a time.\u201cThese,\u201d he said, still a bit amazed, \u201care my people.\u201dAdvertisement"}

(Virginia, though, provided for the death penalty for third offenders.)Dominated by Republican Protestants from upstate, New York\u2019s Legislature fancied itself the enforcer of morality against New York City and its wards overflowing with poor immigrants who were prone to vice and happened to vote Democratic.The state\u2019s Penal Code sternly declared, \u201cThe first day of the week being by general consent set apart for rest and religious uses, the law prohibits the doing on that day of certain acts hereinafter specified, which are serious interruptions of the repose and religious liberty of the community.\u201d Later, bowing to Judaism and other religions, a Sabbath violator was permitted to escape prosecution if he regularly kept \u201canother day of the week as holy time and does not labor on that day.\u201dWhat better way to temper behavior than to deprive the mob of the devil\u2019s brew \u2014 leaving no alternative on hot summer Sundays but \u201cwarm Croton water,\u201d as William Steinway, the piano magnate, complained on behalf of his fellow German-Americans.But from the beginning, blue laws were honored more in the breach than the observance.Even Constantine\u2019s included an exception for countrymen tending to agriculture. If farmers were the first special interests to successfully lobby for an exemption, popular cafes serving brunch and bars broadcasting soccer from abroad on Sunday mornings are merely the latest.In 1907, Assemblyman Alfred E. Smith of Manhattan, seeking to legalize Sunday baseball, argued that it was more ennobling for young men to watch a game at an open-air ballpark than to \u201cbe driven to places where they play \u2018Waltz Me Around Again, Willie.\u2019\u201dBy 1919, baseball was permitted by local option. In 1937, bowling was allowed. In 1949, the Legislature decriminalized football, basketball and soccer after 2 p.m. In 1952, bans on stock car racing, circuses, hunting and golf were lifted. In 1973, Sunday horse racing was legalized.The United States Supreme Court upheld Sunday closing laws in principle, ruling that a common day of rest could be considered in the public interest. But while labor unions and mom-and-pop retail stores opposed Sunday openings, big chain stores and customers seemed amenable. (Bergen County, N.J., remains the sole major holdout in the country.)Absent specific complaints, in 1971 the New York City police stopped enforcing the blue laws altogether. The number of summonses plunged from 25,000 in 1970 to fewer than 2,000 in 1972.With state lawmakers legalizing casino gambling, justifying blue laws as an inducement to churchgoing has become more difficult. Everyone agrees that New Yorkers deserve a rest on Sunday, but, as Mayor Fiorello H. La Guardia said, they could define it for themselves. He advocated that they enjoy the freedom \u201cto attend church if they so desire and to occupy themselves during the remainder of the day in the lawful recreation best suited to afford them the most complete rest possible.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Russian Oil Company Is for Sale \u2014 Again", "Date": "2016-06-23", "News": "Supported byMOSCOW \u2014 For sale in Russia this summer: one repossessed asset, well loved and maintained. Seller is motivated. Everything must go.In this fire sale, the asset is Bashneft, the oil company once owned by Vladimir P. Yevtushenkov, who was prosecuted and put under house arrest. And the seller is the Russian state, in desperate need of cash.At the right price, investors will bite. But the sale, and dozens of others taking place around the country, will reinforce Russia\u2019s reputation in the global markets for uncertainty.Early in his tenure, President Vladimir V. Putin pursued a policy of controlling the so-called commanding heights of the economy with a nationalization push that elbowed Russian and foreign owners out of strategic industries. Now, he is inviting investors back, as Russia faces the economic fallout from a second year of Western sanctions and low commodity prices.The political about-face, part of the seemingly endless cycle in Russia between nationalization and privatization, adds to investors\u2019 worries about being blindsided.In the early post-Soviet period, privatization was viewed as a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. But those opportunities are just happening over and over again under Mr. Putin.Bashneft is coming full circle. Bashneft, Russia\u2019s sixth-largest oil company, was first privatized in a series of sales in the early 2000s. Then it was renationalized in 2014 when Mr. Yevtushenkov was put under house arrest. Now, it is for sale again.\u201cAny buyer today should understand the risks,\u201d Aleksandr Y. Abramov, a professor of finance at the Higher School of Economics in Moscow, said of the latest planned resale of 51 percent of Bashneft. \u201cIn a few years, this deal, too, could be unwound for one reason or another.\u201dSuch uncertainty is a big reason investors remain wary of Russian stocks.Consider the differing perceptions of Brazil and Russia. Both developing countries are big commodity exporters facing serious economic headwinds. But investors are willing to pay only about half as much for a Russian company as they would for a Brazilian business with the same earnings potential, according to Renaissance Capital, a Moscow investment bank.Illustrative of Russia\u2019s stock troubles is Gazprom, the state-controlled oil giant that was once the country\u2019s biggest company. Gazprom\u2019s market value was $52 billion on Tuesday, down from its peak in May 2008 of $367 billion.Russia\u2019s mighty oil, mining and industrial holdings looked like a good deal in the early 1990s during the transition from communism to capitalism. The government tried to create a society of stockholders out of the Soviet ashes by giving everyone vouchers representing shares in state-owned businesses. But the chaotically run effort largely flopped.Hard up for money ahead of an election in 1996, President Boris N. Yeltsin tried a new tack of catering to rich insiders. He sold companies on the cheap to a new class of wealthy Russians.After Mr. Putin assumed power on New Year\u2019s Eve in 1999, he vowed to eliminate these oligarchs \u201cas a class.\u201d Three years later, police arrested Mikhail B. Khodorkovsky, then Russia\u2019s richest man as owner of the Yukos oil company, bought in the sale under Mr. Yeltsin.The primary pumping asset became Rosneft, the state oil company. Rosneft was partly privatized; the state sold 13 percent on the London Stock Exchange in 2006.Foreign investors have been hurt, too.In 2006, Russian regulators forced the Western oil giant Shell to sell a 25 percent share in its valuable Sakhalin Island field after threatening to shut it down for environmental violations. The threat went away after Gazprom, the state gas giant, gained control of the field.It was Shell\u2019s second run-in with the Russian agenda. The company\u2019s oil assets in the country were nationalized in 1918, and Shell was only partly compensated by the Soviet government.Bashneft\u2019s story is perhaps one of the most tangled.In 1993, the Russian government transferred Bashneft to the regional government of Bashkortostan, at a time when Mr. Yeltsin was trying to curry favor with local leaders. In the early 2000s, the regional government sold shares to a company owned by local elites, Ural-Invest. In the years after, Mr. Yevtushenkov steadily picked up shares through a holding company called Sistema, in deals that were certain to have been approved by the Kremlin, according to oil analysts.Then the government changed its mind. In 2014, prosecutors asserted that the company\u2019s original transfer \u2014 21 years before \u2014 to a regional government had been illegal. So all subsequent transactions were voided.Mr. Yevtushenkov was ensnared by the flurry of criminal and civil cases that followed. His shares were handed over to the state.Mr. Yevtushenkov was finally cleared in a ruling late last year. Sistema won $950 million in a lawsuit against the previous owner, Ural-Invest. A spokesman for Sistema declined to comment.Russia\u2019s view of Bashneft has changed, too. Mr. Putin in April removed Bashneft from a list of so-called strategically important companies, despite substantial proven oil reserves of 2.2 billion barrels. The move clears the way for the company\u2019s potential sale to overseas investors.The for-sale signs are broadly up again. Along with Bashneft, the government plans to offer shares in Sovcomflot, a shipping company; Alrosa, a diamond mining company; VTB, a state bank; and Rosneft.Investors are already sniffing around. Russian oil companies, one run by a former chief executive of Rosneft, have announced plans to bid for Bashneft. Executives and government officials in India and China have said the countries\u2019 energy giants are potentially interested in buying shares in Rosneft.The government needs money to cover a portion of Russia\u2019s projected deficit this year of 2.4 trillion rubles ($36 billion), up from 1.95 trillion rubles ($31 billion) last year. And the privatization push is one of the few ways for the government to raise money.Western sanctions over the Ukraine crisis make it difficult for Russia to hold bond sales, a common method for governments to cover budget shortfalls. While the United States Treasury has not specifically outlawed Russian bond deals, it has told American banks not to underwrite them.At a meeting of presidential economic advisers last month, Aleksei L. Kudrin, a former minister of economy, suggested that the Kremlin spur growth by easing international tensions, as another option along with privatization. Mr. Putin responded that Russia would not \u201cbargain with its sovereignty.\u201dRussia insists that the government will do better this time around with the privatization plan. Dmitry Pristanskov, head of the Federal Agency for State Property, who is overseeing the effort, said the early post-Soviet sales were partly rolled back because corruption had tainted the process.\u201cAt the time, 25 years ago, there was no clear criteria for choosing an investor,\u201d Mr. Pristanskov said. He said the state now carefully vetted potential buyers for criminal ties or flaws like weak compliance departments, limiting the risk that deals will fall apart later. \u201cThis is exactly what we do differently today.\u201dAdvertisement"}
