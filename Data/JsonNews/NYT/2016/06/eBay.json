{"Headline": "The Parasite Underground", "Date": "2016-06-16", "News": "FeatureA shadow network of patients are trying to treat their own debilitating diseases \u2014 by infecting themselves with gastrointestinal worms.Supported byThe doctor recommended infusions of cyclosporine, a powerful immune-suppressant drug. Vik looked it up and learned that the drug, often given to transplant recipients, in rare instances can increase the risk of fatal infection and certain cancers. And if cyclosporine didn\u2019t work, the next intervention would probably be the surgical removal of his colon. Vik might have to wear a colostomy bag for the rest of his life.\u201cI had a feeling there had to be a better way,\u201d he told me recently. (Worried about being stigmatized, Vik asked that I identify him only by his first name.) He began researching ulcerative colitis and discovered that the prevalence of inflammatory bowel disease \u2014 an umbrella term that includes both ulcerative colitis and Crohn\u2019s disease \u2014 had increased markedly in the United States over the 20th century. Yet the disease was less common in the developing world. He learned that exposure to dirt and unsanitary conditions early in life seemed to protect against these and other inflammatory diseases later. And then he encountered an explanation for the correlations in the research of a scientist named Joel Weinstock.Weinstock, a gastroenterologist now at Tufts University, thought that parasites were to blame. But it wasn\u2019t their presence in the human digestive system that was causing the rise; it was their absence. To survive for years in another animal, parasitic worms, known as helminths, counter their hosts\u2019 defenses. Because an out-of-control immune response against native bacteria was thought to drive inflammatory bowel disease, Weinstock\u2019s insight was that parasites\u2019 ability to disarm the immune system might prevent the disorder. The broader implication was that the disappearance of parasites \u2014 largely eradicated from American life in the early 20th century through improvements in sanitation \u2014 might have left our immune systems unbalanced, increasing our vulnerability to all types of inflammatory disorders.To Vik, Weinstock\u2019s idea was the first cogent explanation for his disease. It also pointed toward a solution. Weinstock was already experimenting with \u201cre-parasitizing\u201d people with inflammatory bowel disease, using a helminth called Trichuris suis, the pig whipworm. He had chosen the species because, in theory, it can\u2019t reach sexual maturity in humans and spread from one person to another. Early, small studies yielded impressive results, with 43 percent of colitis patients seeing improvement after 12 weeks of whipworm eggs, but Vik thought the use of pig whipworm had a flaw. It required continual dosing, and it could cost tens of thousands of dollars a year (a German company was producing the eggs for human consumption; in the United States, selling them to treat a disease is illegal). And most important, if he expected a parasite to change his immune system, he believed, a species adapted to humans, not pigs, was likely to do a better job.Vik wanted human whipworm. This helminth, which reaches about 1.5 inches in length, fixes itself into the wall of the large intestine and feeds off the organ\u2019s secretions for perhaps two years. The potential results of severe whipworm infection include anemia, clubbed fingers and, in children, stunted growth. But after exhausting his other options, Vik began to think of infecting himself with parasites as the most rational course of action. After all, the parasite had been with people since prehistory; \u00d6tzi the Iceman, the 5,300-year-old mummy found frozen in the Italian Alps, had whipworm. Besides, the worst possible outcome of a whipworm infection was a kind of inflammatory bowel disease. And he already had that.His doctor was dead set against the idea, Vik told me. So was his wife, a doctor in training. (They later divorced.) Vik is a driven, entrepreneurial type, though, and undeterred, he began emailing any expert who \u201cwould listen to my crazy ideas.\u201d In 2004, he flew to Bangkok to meet a parasitologist who agreed to hear him out. He brought along his father, a professor and internist, for \u201cgravitas.\u201d (Vik\u2019s father, who worked in Southeast Asia as a young doctor, told me it was common then to leave light whipworm infections untreated.)The Thai parasitologist later handed him a vial of fluid containing whipworm eggs. Microscopic in size, they had come from an 11-year-old girl in southern Thailand, he was told. Vik flew home.Next began what Vik describes as \u201cthe most difficult part\u201d of his life. He set up a lab in his parents\u2019 Southern California home and stocked it with a microscope, petri dishes, slides and flasks purchased on eBay. But he couldn\u2019t get the eggs to \u201cembryonate.\u201d Just as chicken eggs need to incubate to hatch, helminth eggs require \u201cembryonation\u201d to produce infective larvae. Parasite eggs are excreted in feces, and in their native tropics, that embryonation occurs naturally after the eggs spend time in warm, humid conditions. But reproducing those conditions in his parents\u2019 house proved difficult. He tried various conditions \u2014 warm, wet, cool, dry, light, dark \u2014 to no avail: The eggs remained inert. Swallowed in this state, they would pass right through his gut without hatching.The breakthrough came when, imagining defecation under a tree, Vik abandoned his goal of antiseptic incubation and began using nonsterile tap water in the petri dish. Now the eggs, football-shaped and translucent under the microscope, began to display a knotted, ropy shape within \u2014 developing larvae \u2014 indicating embryonation. Months after returning from Thailand, he finally drank a glass of water containing a few hundred whipworm eggs.Three months later, he swallowed another thousand eggs. Ova began showing up in his stool, indicating that his body now hosted living, breeding parasites. When he tapered off his drugs, his colitis remained quiescent. Instead of triumph, though, Vik felt doubt. Was this real? Or was it a natural ebb in his disease? \u201cI wanted proof,\u201d he told me. That\u2019s when Vik began searching for what he calls \u201cthe Team.\u201dIn his interactions with scientists, Vik had noticed that parasitologists, the scientists most familiar with the dangers of parasitic infection, were the most receptive to the idea that parasites might help with disease. So in 2006, after poring over numerous faculty web pages, he emailed a young parasite immunologist at the University of California, San Francisco, named P\u2019ng Loke.When Loke heard Vik\u2019s story \u2014 his disease, his trip to Thailand, his trouble incubating the parasites \u2014 he found the tale compelling. \u201cHe didn\u2019t seem crazy, just someone who had really done a lot of research, had his back up against the wall and decided to take a plunge,\u201d says Loke, who now has a microbiology lab at New York University.Loke agreed to monitor Vik, a decision that would alter the course of his own research. Over the following four years, Vik relapsed twice. Whenever his whipworms grew old, the colitis flared. Then he drank more eggs, and his disease came back under control. A gastroenterologist periodically examined Vik\u2019s colon, taking tissue samples. And when Loke and his colleagues analyzed which genes were expressed during flares and remission \u2014 an indicator of immune activity \u2014 they discovered a pattern that may change how scientists think about ulcerative colitis.When the disease was quiescent, production of one protein in particular, called interleukin-22, increased. IL-22 encourages intestinal mucus to flow. In inflammatory bowel disease, the protective mucous layer is often eroded. Scientists think this allows native microbes, usually held at a slight remove from the intestinal wall, to get closer to the gut wall, leading to inflammation and further impeding the flow of mucus. Vik\u2019s whipworms apparently interrupted that vicious cycle by restoring the mucus barrier. Parasites, it seemed, could heal the gut.When I first began exploring the movement a few years ago, two self-styled \u201cproviders\u201d supplied most of the parasites. They\u2019d read some of the same research as Vik, found it promising and acquired helminths in the developing world. After treating their own conditions (they claimed), they began advertising helminths online for thousands of dollars. They saw themselves as pioneers.Since then, competition has come to this niche market. New providers offer lower prices. Users read about the science in online forums, share their experiences and learn where to get helminths. Like Vik, a growing contingent of users has learned to cultivate parasites for self-treatment, circumventing the providers altogether. They trade incubation methods in Facebook discussion groups, occasionally arrange for the exchange of \u201cstarter\u201d material, including eggs or fecal material from worm-infested donors, and post photos of their homegrown eggs and larvae.Anecdote fuels the movement, because no large randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled studies have produced evidence that parasites can cure anything. And because parasites aren\u2019t F.D.A.-approved, paranoia is common. Nearly everyone I interviewed requested some measure of anonymity, not only to avoid stigma but also because they worried about losing access to a treatment they said had changed their lives.Scientists I queried tended to emphasize the dangers of helminth use. \u201cI do not advocate self-experimentation when the risks have not been clarified,\u201d Stephen Hanauer, director of the Digestive Health Center at Northwestern Medicine, told me in an email. Joel Weinstock, whose research partly inspired the movement, ticked off more reasons purchasing unregulated parasites is a bad idea: You don\u2019t know that you\u2019re getting the species promised. Even if you are, you don\u2019t know if the specimens are alive, or if you\u2019re getting the appropriate numbers of them, or even what the appropriate numbers are.Still, a few experts also expressed sympathy. \u201cI certainly can\u2019t condone it, but I completely understand,\u201d Alex Loukas, a parasitologist at James Cook University in Australia, told me. \u201cYou\u2019re talking about people with debilitating disease. Modern medicine has just failed them.\u201d This is perhaps the best way to understand helminth use: as one grass-roots response to an epidemic. The prevalence of autoimmune and allergic diseases has increased between two- and threefold in recent decades. Roughly one in five Americans has an allergic disease, ranging from seasonal hay fever to life-threatening food allergies. Roughly one in 13 has an autoimmune disease \u2014 a disorder in which the immune system tasked with our protection instead attacks our own bodies. These disorders often strike in the prime of life or earlier, causing decades of suffering. And current therapies fall short. Continuing research offers reasons for hope, says Daniel Rotrosen, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease\u2019s division of allergy, immunology and transplantation. But currently, he says, \u201cWe are really not where we would like to be in terms of treating many of these diseases.\u201dThere\u2019s an apt historical precedent for the current unregulated experimentation with parasites: the underground pharmacies and smuggling rings dramatized in the movie \u201cDallas Buyers Club.\u201d They sprouted during the 1980s AIDS crisis, serving a demographic, mostly gay men, who were ignored by mainstream medicine and who, in an effort to treat themselves, began importing non-F.D.A.-approved drugs from Mexico. Many of the drugs they used didn\u2019t stand up to later scientific scrutiny, it\u2019s worth noting, but the calculus leading them to take unproven drugs was similar to that driving helminth users today. If you are stricken with a terrible disease for which medicine has little to offer, then what, really, do you have to lose by turning to a parasite?Her neurologist recommended a drug called Copaxone, she says. But the injections killed fat cells, leaving unsightly indentations and bruises along her thighs. And new brain lesions showed up on scans, indicating that the disease continued to advance. Amy tried another drug called beta interferon, but it triggered fevers, and after injections she felt ill for hours. \u201cIt was just this weird nightmare of life,\u201d she says.Then Amy\u2019s thyroid gland, important in regulating metabolism, started failing, stressed by the interferon treatment. Her doctor recommended that she take thyroid replacement hormone. This was the last straw. Each treatment caused new problems, it seemed, and none really helped. She wanted another option.A co-worker recommended a 2011 book called \u201cThe Wild Life of Our Bodies,\u201d by a biologist named Rob Dunn. It discussed therapeutic helminths. The notion that we\u2019d co-evolved with parasites for so long that our immune system needed them appealed to Amy\u2019s holistic mind-set. She joined a Yahoo group dedicated to \u201chelminthic therapy.\u201d That\u2019s where she discovered an extraordinary study from Argentina.In the early 2000s, some multiple-sclerosis patients at a neurology clinic in Buenos Aires began showing up with parasite infections. Aware of the potential for parasites to help inflammatory disease, the presiding neurologists proposed an experiment: Don\u2019t treat the parasites, and see what happens. Twelve patients agreed, and for nearly five years the doctors monitored them. Disease progression, as measured by brain scans, slowed significantly. Blood work showed an elevation of \u201csuppressor\u201d cells that prevent autoimmune diseases. And when, more than five years later, the doctors dewormed four patients who complained of malaise, those suppressor cells disappeared, and the disease started up again.Inspired by these findings, which were published in 2007, small exploratory studies testing the pig whipworm on multiple-sclerosis patients began around that time at the University of Wisconsin, Madison. That helped to reassure Lisy, Amy\u2019s partner, who initially thought the idea reeked of quackery. Amy contacted worm\u00adtherapy.com, a site run by man named Garin Aglietti. Aglietti wasn\u2019t a doctor \u2014 he\u2019d dropped out of medical school \u2014 but he\u2019d treated his own psoriasis, he said, with hookworms acquired in Belize. His breadth of knowledge impressed Amy. \u201cI felt this immediate trust,\u201d Amy told me. Two years\u2019 worth of hookworms cost $2,500.In January 2012, Amy and Lisy flew to San Diego. Aglietti picked them up at the airport in an S.U.V. and drove them across the border to a two-story building in Tijuana, where Amy met a warm doctor named Jorge Llamas. His spare, basic office didn\u2019t have shiny, modern medical equipment, but as Amy says, helminths were pretty \u201clow-tech.\u201dHookworms penetrate the skin and, after a weekslong odyssey through the body, arrive at the small intestine, where they feed on blood and grow to about a centimeter long. Llamas applied gauze to Amy\u2019s arm containing 35 nearly invisible hookworm larvae. There was a remote possibility of a severe, potentially life-threatening allergic reaction as they entered her body, Aglietti explained. He had an adrenaline shot handy should that occur. They waited an hour, chatting, until Aglietti deemed things safe, and then he drove them back to San Diego.About 10 weeks later, Amy\u2019s bone-deadening exhaustion, a symptom of multiple sclerosis, began fading. She told her neurologist what she\u2019d done. To her surprise, he was familiar with the background research, but he was nervous about her decision. Whenever she visits, he offers new drugs. \u201cI have politely declined,\u201d Amy told me.Amy\u2019s neurologist didn\u2019t respond to my queries, but her family-practice doctor corroborated her account, adding, \u201cAs long as a patient is making an informed decision, and understands the risks, then something is worth doing if they decide it\u2019s worth doing.\u201dAs it happens, a company called Coronado Biosciences did test Joel Weinstock\u2019s pig whipworms. It ran the largest trials conducted to date, comprising 250 participants with Crohn\u2019s disease. But in contrast to Weinstock\u2019s earlier, smaller studies, which showed an almost miraculous curative effect in Crohn\u2019s \u2014 72 percent experienced remission \u2014 these studies showed no benefit at all. The company, now called Fortress Biotech, hasn\u2019t released details from the study, but it has dismissed criticism \u2014 Weinstock, for example, thinks the trial should have started over because of an unusually high response among those taking a placebo \u2014 as wishful thinking. \u201cThese \u2018believers\u2019 are being fooled by randomness,\u201d a spokesman for the firm said in an email.Last year, however, Alex Loukas, the parasitologist in Australia, published a small study in which hookworm infection seemingly cured celiac disease, an autoimmune disease of the gut triggered by the gluten protein, found in wheat and other grains. He gave 12 celiac volunteers 20 hookworm larvae each. Once the worms established themselves, he began feeding the volunteers incrementally larger quantities of foods with gluten. At the one-year mark, eight participants who previously couldn\u2019t eat any gluten without diarrhea and worse could now eat a bowl of pasta without problems.Celiac disease occurs when a person\u2019s immune system mistakes wheat protein as dangerous and attacks. This unbridled aggression begins to destroy the gut. How exactly the parasites stopped the disease remains somewhat mysterious. Studies suggest they hijack white blood cells, transforming them into soothing cells that prevent inflammatory disease. But research by P\u2019ng Loke also indicates that they commandeer the microbiota, the community of microbes in the intestinal tract. In animals, parasites increase counts of anti-inflammatory bacteria thought to prevent a range of disorders, including asthma and colitis. And deworming people causes an immediate decline in those same bacteria, Loke has found, perhaps increasing their vulnerability to inflammatory disease. He thinks parasites do this, in part, by increasing the secretion of mucus, which selectively feeds anti-inflammatory bacteria. Loukas and his colleagues have received funding for a larger celiac trial, but he sees the field moving away from the use of live parasites, toward the identification of the molecules they secrete.For helminth users, this push toward worm-\u00adderived pharmaceuticals is cited as justification for the underground\u2019s existence. People are sick and suffering today, they argue. Are they to wait for years or decades that they may not have for a worm-based pill when there\u2019s something that might work now?Was I afraid? I knew that a number of parasitologists, well versed in the terrors of hookworm infection, had intentionally infected themselves. When you learn enough about a parasite\u2019s biology, amazement and curiosity gradually replace fear and revulsion.So one cool early-winter day, I walked across the border to Tijuana, accompanied by Garin Aglietti. In Jorge Llamas\u2019s clinic, I riffled through several months of tests showing that Aglietti, my hookworm donor, didn\u2019t have H.I.V., hepatitis or Strongyloides stercoralis, a particularly unpleasant parasite that, like hookworm, infects through the skin but which, unusually among helminths, can also multiply in the body. Then Llamas pressed a bandage against my arm containing, he said, 30 larvae. I felt the well-known hookworm itch, a slightly tingly, almost stinging sensation as they burrowed into my skin.Over the next few weeks, as the larvae made their way to my small intestine, I felt as if I had a mild flu. Cramps, a little diarrhea, headaches and malaise followed. The symptoms lessened over time, and for a month or so during hay-fever season that spring, my sinuses were remarkably clear. Seemingly overnight, a patch of eczema on my hand also disappeared. Fine peach fuzz sprouted here and there on my body.But those were the extent of the benefits. And late in hay-fever season, I was suddenly stricken by full-blown seasonal allergies. My eczema returned with a vengeance. I thought I\u2019d lost the parasites, but they slowly reasserted control over my sinuses, although never quite as powerfully as during that initial period. I kept the colony going for over a year, during which time the benefits gradually waned while the symptoms \u2014 an occasional ache in the pit of my stomach and sporadic malaise \u2014 never completely dissipated. Ultimately, the benefits were too variable and the side effects too unpleasant to justify continuing.When people have written me over the years asking for advice, I point out that I\u2019m not a doctor, and I urge skepticism. It\u2019s possible, I say, that parasites worsen your condition. I interviewed one young man with Crohn\u2019s who gave himself hookworm, lost weight and became so anemic that he required emergency blood transfusions. I spoke with others who improved for a while but then relapsed.But I don\u2019t think that my warnings have dissuaded many people, for the simple reason that they\u2019re desperate. It\u2019s tempting to dismiss them because of this desperation. And certainly it\u2019s possible that cases of remission are a result of the placebo effect, that parasites don\u2019t help and that the community of helminths users is gripped by a self-reinforcing delusion. It\u2019s also possible, though, that parasites can treat a subset of patients with autoimmune and allergic diseases, and that through self-experimentation, sick people are figuring out who\u2019s in that group.Success stories, when posted, invariably inspire a chorus of congratulations followed by questions \u2014 which species worked the best? Moderators curate up-to-date lists of these successes, some of which link back to their authors, making them somewhat checkable. They also include failures, in an attempt at balance. Documents list substances that users have found may accidentally kill parasites, like oregano oil and nitrous oxide.The operating assumption in this world seems to be that parasites usually work. A moderator once politely asked that I stop referring to helminths as parasites and call them \u201csymbionts\u201d instead. And the social dynamics of these forums can strike some as odd. \u201cThere\u2019s pressure to be positive and cheerful about it all the time,\u201d a 30-something librarian who successfully treated her autoimmune thyroid problems with hookworm told me.At the same time, these groups direct participants to a remarkable amount of scientific information, including numerous peer-reviewed articles. Particularly intriguing are the protocols based on users\u2019 experiences. If you have a terrible reaction to hookworm \u2014 which isn\u2019t uncommon \u2014 you might start over with smaller doses, and gradually introduce larvae over a longer period of time. Different organisms might also work for different disorders. I spoke with one British scientist, a biologist, who found that hookworm helped an inflammatory condition affecting his liver, but not his ulcerative colitis. Only when he introduced whipworm, which lives at the site of the ulcerations, did his colitis diminish.At some point, I learned of a private online group where parents discussed treating their children with helminths. After my own experience, I couldn\u2019t imagine intentionally giving my child a parasite, so I was surprised. Many members were mothers; some had immune disorders themselves. A few incubated their own parasites. Everyone I spoke to had given helminths to themselves before their children. Their children had disorders like eosinophilic esophagitis, which can make swallowing food difficult; severe food allergies; and a neuropsychiatric disorder with O.C.D.-like symptoms called Pandas. In several instances, conventional treatment had failed. The parents viewed the potential side effects of parasite infection as milder than the diseases already afflicting their children, and less dangerous than some of the drugs they had already tried. And they claimed to have seen impressive results with parasites.Some were experimenting with a new organism, a tapeworm native to rats called Hymenolepis diminuta. A British company called Biome Restoration sells it. Depending on the dosage, an order can run just $40. Don Donahue, a radiologist in eastern Tennessee, founded Biome with two other passionate helminths users. He had long suffered from nasal inflammation and obstructive polyps. But just three weeks after acquiring 30 hookworms in Tijuana, he told me, the symptoms improved overnight. \u201cIt was like someone slapped me in the face,\u201d he says. He started cultivating them at home for his own use. Spurred in part by the sick people he saw at work, Donahue then decided to make helminths more widely available.The hookworm Necator americanus (\u201cAmerican murderer\u201d) wasn\u2019t ready for \u201cprime time\u201d in his view. \u201cI really honestly hate hookworm,\u201d he says, because some of the side effects are so bothersome. \u201cBut I\u2019m sick without it.\u201d So Donahue settled on what he considered a \u201cgentler\u201d organism, Hymenolepis diminuta. Yet even as he put most of his life savings into starting Biome Restoration, he has kept giving away parasites freely. Of everyone I spoke with, Donahue perhaps most fully expresses the ethos of enthusiastic sharing so often evident among the community of parasite users. I interviewed one young woman suffering from Crohn\u2019s whom he met running at the park and gave a supply of the rat tapeworm. Her Crohn\u2019s eased, she gained weight and, after years of trying, she became pregnant. I spoke with a former snowboarder in Portland, Ore., stricken with a painful autoimmune disorder of the spine called ankylosing spondylitis. That man, Scotty Wittlake \u2014 he wanted me to use his full name \u2014 told me his condition improved following his self-innoculation with Donahue\u2019s hookworm.\u201cCitizen scientists are pushing this forward,\u201d says Donahue, who acts more like an evangelist than an entrepreneur. He seems to want to share the miracle he\u2019s found, to spread the word and help others. Biome Restoration has no robust safety data nor any evidence that rat tapeworms help with anything. And parasites that find themselves in unfamiliar hosts can, in theory, cause significant disease and, in rare cases, even death. (In March, the F.D.A. extended an import alert, which already applies to hookworm and whipworm, to tapeworm.) But the company, which seeks to make a more affordable helminth available to more people, is trying something few others have: It is engaging with regulatory authorities to legally sell its product in Britain. The underground is pushing its way aboveground.An article on June 19 about patients\u2019 trying to treat their own diseases with parasites misidentified a drug taken by a patient who had ulcerative colitis. It was mesalamine, not sulfasalazine.Moises Velasquez-Manoff is the author of \u201cAn Epidemic of Absence: A New Way of Understanding Allergies and Autoimmune Diseases.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Fashioning Cast-Iron Pans for Today\u2019s Cooks", "Date": "2016-06-28", "News": "Supported byAmerican cooks have frequent affairs with spiralizers, dry fryers and other shiny new toys. But they also have a deep, lasting relationship with one of the oldest cooking tools in the kitchen: the cast-iron skillet.\u201cThere aren\u2019t many things in modern life that are passed down through generations and remain both beautiful and useful,\u201d said Ronni Lundy, a historian of the food and agriculture of Appalachia, where cooking in a well-seasoned heirloom skillet is a touchstone of heritage.It\u2019s true that my grandmother\u2019s china is gathering dust. Your great-grandfather\u2019s gold watch (admit it) lies unused in a drawer. But my parents\u2019 50-year-old cast-iron pans, with their glassine black cooking surfaces, are the inheritance I crave.\u201cI have two that are just coming along now,\u201d Ms. Lundy said in the nurturing tone usually reserved for children, sourdough starters and rosebushes.Well-seasoned cast-iron pans are the new broken-in jeans: proof of both good taste and hard use. In just the last five years, three new companies promising to make improved cast-iron skillets with a combination of traditional handwork and modern technology have begun production.With cast iron\u2019s mystique comes mystery. The responsibility of seasoning a pan can be daunting; the idea of a pan that is never washed with soap can be alarming.But it is worth overcoming these obstacles because a well-used, well-seasoned cast-iron skillet is truly an all-purpose pan: nonstick enough to cook eggs, hot enough to sear anything and completely functional for roasting, stewing, simmering and baking.The nonstick surface of a cast-iron pan is achieved with natural ingredients like flaxseed oil, lard and time, not with synthetic coatings like Teflon or Thermolon.The Field Company, run by Chris and Stephen Muscarella (neither of whom is trained in metallurgy, casting or cooking), raised more than $1.6 million; their first pans will ship soon from a foundry they adapted in the Midwest. Finex is making 200 skillets a day and barely keeping up with demand from the United States and abroad, according to Mike Whitehead, a founder.The Finex 10-inch skillet sells for $165; the Borough Furnace equivalent for $280; the Field skillet for about $100.The answer lies in the craftsmanship of the past. The cast-iron pots \u2014 skillets, spiders (which sit in the embers of a fire) and Dutch ovens \u2014 made in the United States from the 18th century through the first half of the 20th, were different from today\u2019s: lighter, thinner and with a smoother cooking surface.The Muscarella brothers grew up cooking with their mother\u2019s old cast-iron pans \u2014 far from being collectors\u2019 items, rusty skillets used to be offered two for a quarter at barn sales \u2014 and wondered why the pans they bought when they went out on their own were so comparatively unwieldy.To find out why, \u201cwe went down a rabbit hole,\u201d said Chris Muscarella, and came out determined to produce new pans in the old style. Modern all-machine casting, he said, cannot produce pans that are as thin and smooth.Those pans were cast by now-famous makers like Griswold, Wagner, Sidney \u2014 and by dozens of now-anonymous foundries located in every sizable American town that also usually produced farm tools and weapons. Each pan was poured and polished by hand, a process that required hours of human labor but yielded a noticeable difference.\u201cI fell in love with that smoothness,\u201d said Mr. Whitehead of Finex. \u201cBut now that I make them, I realize why it went away. Labor is just so expensive.\u201dMost of the new pans have smooth interiors and are sold preseasoned, which also explains their appeal to modern consumers. (There is a wealth of confusing and often contradictory information about seasoning online.) Each of the new makers has its own preferred system of cleaning and reseasoning, described on its website.But the basic principle is simple: Treat the pan as if you were a 19th-century cook, because the way people back then cooked and cleaned automatically seasoned their pans. Instead of plastic polymers, their skillets had natural coatings formed by cooking with fat and bonding fat molecules to the metal surface.So use the pan often, especially for projects like shallow frying or cooking bacon or browning chicken. Scrape the cooking surface clean with a stiff brush, a bench scraper or salt; rinse with very hot water and, if needed, a drop of soap; put it back on the stove over low heat until completely dry.It is not necessary to make a science project of creating the patina: Under these circumstances, it will simply happen. (If the pan is long unused, however, even the loveliest patina will become sticky, rusty or both.

The ruling is expected before the shareholder vote. It would be easy to cast the troubled merger as yet another result of the collapse in energy prices, but the deal was also driven by hubris \u00e2\u0080\u0094 the ambition of an empire builder who coveted his prize so much he left little or no room for anyone to wiggle free. When Mr. Warren started Energy Transfer, pipeline companies were viewed as more stable than drilling companies. The contracts are typically long term and the business is generally insulated from swings in energy prices. But the company expanded into other activities. \u00e2\u0080\u009cOne cannot live on organic growth alone,\u00e2\u0080\u009d was a favorite phrase of Mr. Warren\u00e2\u0080\u0099s. By early last year, Mr. Warren had cobbled together a 71,000-mile network of pipelines and announced plans to buy Williams in a cash-and-stock deal worth $38 billion. By Christmas, he had buyer\u00e2\u0080\u0099s remorse. The free fall in energy prices and concern among investors over how Energy Transfer would pay for the $6 billion cash portion of the deal caused his own company\u00e2\u0080\u0099s stock to collapse.Goldman, which previously favored tycoons and plutocrats, is hunting for new businesses, just like other marquee banking companies. Regulations have squeezed deal-making activity and the bond trading desks that generated most of Goldman\u00e2\u0080\u0099s precrisis profits now only make a fraction of what they did before. Goldman executives have been debating whether they want to end up to with something resembling a full-service online bank, they could still back off if the initial experiments fail. So far, interest has been strong. Stephen Scherr, the chief of strategy for Goldman, said the bank had opened tens of thousands of new accounts in its first few weeks, in addition to the 150,000 it acquired from GE Capital. Its 50-person call center in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, was unprepared for the surge of interest. And soon after the bank\u00e2\u0080\u0099s debut, a columnist at The Wall Street Journal wrote about the problems he encountered trying to open an account. Both HP and Aruba said the deal was fair.

{"Headline": "Who Would Pay $300,000 for a Handbag?", "Date": "2016-06-03", "News": "Supported byHONG KONG \u2014 In a packed bidding room last Monday, Christie\u2019s Hong Kong hosted its 30th-anniversary auction. The tightly curated catalog featured 30 lots, each chosen for its desirability and origin in categories such as fine art, ancient ceramics, jewelry, watches and rare wines.And handbags.One of the auction\u2019s stars was a 12-inch Herm\u00e8s Birkin matte Himalayan crocodile handbag, with white-gold hardware set with 245 F-color diamonds weighing close to 10 carats. With a presale estimate of $190,000 to $260,000, it was billed as \u201cthe most valuable handbag in the world.\u201dThe standing-room-only crowd, mostly from mainland China, with a smattering of collectors from Taiwan and Japan, watched with barely bated anticipation as Jussi Pylkkanen, the global president for Christie\u2019s, presided from the podium over bidders who drove prices for the Birkin quickly past $128,679 (or about 1 million Hong Kong dollars). In a mere four minutes, the bag was sold (to a private collector), and a record set, at $244,490, before a buyer\u2019s premium (for a total of $300,168, just over the standard retail price of $280,000).\u201cOur London office began auctioning off fashion items as part of estate sales in the 1990s, and in 2000 began including contemporary handbags as collectors\u2019 pieces,\u201d said Matthew Rubinger, the Hong Kong-based international director of handbags and accessories for Asia. After a successful stint selling bags in online auctions, Christie\u2019s opened its handbags and accessories departments in Hong Kong and Paris in 2014. Christie\u2019s now holds twice-yearly handbag and accessory auctions in Hong Kong, alongside its more traditional sales.As to the frenzy over the Himalayan Birkin (aside from the diamonds), \u201cWhite is the hardest color to achieve with crocodile skin, as you have to remove all of its natural pigment,\u201d Mr. Rubinger said of the graduated tone from gray to white, inspired by majestic mountains. \u201cTo find a bag in its unused condition is even more rare.\u201dThe seller was a private collector who had owned the unused Birkin since 2008. It is believed that only one or two of these bags are produced each year by the Herm\u00e8s atelier.Mr. Rubinger\u2019s job is now focused on sourcing the bags for his growing clientele and assessing the quality of the consigned products on a four-grade scale (from a score of one for a brand-new bag to a four for a used one). Many of his customers are clients of Christie\u2019s and collectors of jewelry and art, but Asia\u2019s affluent customers are quickly fueling demand.\u201cChanel has always done well in the secondary market, and we also sell Gucci and Balenciaga, but Herm\u00e8s clearly is the leader,\u201d he said, adding that the client base \u201cis split between Asia and Europe,\u201d with many repeat customers.\u201cOur previous record-holder was a 35-centimeter fuchsia crocodile Birkin with diamond hardware, which sold for 1.4 million, without the premium,\u201d he said, referring to the sale in Hong Kong dollars. \u201cCustom orders and exotic skins are always popular. Lizard skin is having a moment right now.\u201dIt might seem ridiculous to some to treat a handbag as an investment, but for a Birkin collector like Emily Chan, a Hong Kong-based investment banker, it is one worth making. She owns more than 50 of the bags, purchased as a V.I.P. customer from the Paris, Hong Kong and Tokyo boutiques, as well as on secondary markets, via auctions. \u201cBirkins are both an investment and a fashion accessory to me,\u201d she said. \u201cBirkins are like currency: You can cash out any time.\u201dOf all the ways to access the bags, \u201cI like auctions, as you are not shopping alone,\u201d she added.Her favorite Birkin is \u201cunreservedly\u201d the Himalayan. \u201cFor the past 35 years, the Birkin\u2019s price trend has been all the way up, performing even better than gold,\u201d said Ms. Chan, who began collecting in 1993. \u201cArt and jewelry are also good investments, but their barrier to entry is much higher, and those markets, too, have volatility. And they are not as liquid as the Birkin.\u201d\u201cFrom our research, we know that the Asian customer prefers the smaller 30-centimeter,\u201d Mr. Bocher said, \u201cwhile the European customer likes the 35-centimeter. And the most popular colors are beige, black and brown. For new, unused Birkins, we would have a markup of 10 percent to 20 percent above retail. Our customers are always looking for something unique.\u201cWe had a Birkin So Black,\u201d he continued, referring to a limited-edition style with black hardware released during Jean Paul Gaultier\u2019s tenure, \u201cwhich we sold within a few hours of acquisition.\u201dSixty percent of Mr. Berk\u2019s clients are from the United States and 30 percent from the Middle East and Asia, with the remainder from South America, he said. He has a staff of five, and a warehouse of about $1.5 million in handbags. \u201cThere is just something about a Birkin,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s like owning a Mercedes-Benz: When you close the door of a Mercedes, it sounds different than a Toyota. And that\u2019s what Herm\u00e8s customers know and buy into. To many of our customers, to own this bag is to achieve a sense of competence like nothing else.\u201dIn 2014, Robert Smith, a Texas hedge fund titan, and his wife, Hope Dworaczyk, a Playboy Playmate who appeared on \u201cCelebrity Apprentice,\u201d requested that Mr. Berk find them 30 Birkins to give away at a staff Christmas party. (Their budget was $500,000.) \u201cIt took us 30 days, but we did it,\u201d Mr. Berk said.Ms. Dworaczyk, who is an Herm\u00e8s V.I.P., said: \u201cI wasn\u2019t expecting them to succeed on the Christmas party. But when I saw the Brink\u2019s truck pull up, I lost my mind.\u201dAll of which makes the fact that Wednesday\u2019s follow-up auction at Christie\u2019s included 200 handbag lots \u2014 more than half of which were Birkins \u2014 and that handbag sales for the two days totaled $5,044,890 a little more understandable.\u201cAs handbags become more easily traceable, and values continue to increase, more collectors are seeing their handbags as assets,\u201d Mr. Rubinger said. \u201cEven those with no intention to sell want to better understand the lasting value of these pieces.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "When the Lone Ranger and Gracie Allen Pitched Their Sponsors\u2019 Products", "Date": "2016-06-12", "News": "Supported byAdvertisingMINNEAPOLIS \u2014 On a recent episode of his late-night show, Stephen Colbert poured himself a bowl of Lucky Charms cereal and then doused it in Baileys Irish Cream, jokingly referring to the concoction as an Irish continental breakfast.Then Mr. Colbert\u2019s first guest, Tom Hanks, demanded his own bowl, sarcastically noting that it was \u201cnot exactly the \u2018breakfast of champions,\u2019\u201d a reference to the decades-old slogan for Wheaties.The sequence delighted officials and employees at General Mills, which makes both Lucky Charms and Wheaties, among other products.\u201cIt was organic,\u201d said Bridget Christenson, communications manager for General Mills, noting that the company has no commercial arrangement with Mr. Colbert or his show.It also illustrated how deeply many of General Mills\u2019 products \u2014 and even some of its marketing slogans \u2014 have become ingrained in pop culture consciousness.12 Photos\u201cTo me, a great brand is a story told well, and a lot of General Mills\u2019 portfolio has done just that,\u201d said Dean Crutchfield, a branding expert in New York.\u201cTheir products have given a lot of children joy,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re engaged in the product,\u201d he added, and have \u201callowed them to become part of our lives. That\u2019s been the tremendous effect of General Mills, right across its portfolio.\u201dBy 1980, General Mills had accumulated so much brand memorabilia that the company established an archive at its headquarters, in Golden Valley, Minn. The archive grew with the 2001 purchase of Pillsbury, a Minneapolis milling rival with its own rich marketing history. Several years ago, General Mills moved the archive to a former Pillsbury building in Minneapolis near the Mississippi River, not far from the site of its first flour mill.The archive, which is closed to the public, houses thousands of artifacts in about 3,000 square feet of temperature- and humidity-controlled space. In honor of the company\u2019s 150th anniversary, General Mills made selected items from the archive available to members of the news media.Among the photos, packaging and promotional items are an early rendering of the character Betty Crocker, who was created in 1921 to answer consumers\u2019 baking questions; cookbooks from the 1880s, when General Mills was known as the Washburn Crosby Company; some of the first clay animation models of Poppin\u2019 Fresh, the Pillsbury Doughboy; and a box of Cheerioats, the original name of Cheerios. The name was changed in 1945 to settle a trademark lawsuit.\u201cI\u2019ve been here 20 months,\u201d said the corporate archivist, Jessica Faucher. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to memorize 150 years of history.\u201dMs. Faucher said consumers and longtime employees had contributed some items to the collection and archivists had discovered others on eBay. Three shelves contain two copies of virtually every printing of the Betty Crocker cookbook since 1950. The book is known as \u201cbig red\u201d for the original\u2019s color and thickness.One item not in the collection: the gold medal that Gold Medal flour is named for, won at the first Millers International Exhibition in 1880. Washburn Crosby swept all three medals in the contest, but the gold and bronze ones disappeared in the 1890s. The silver medal remains in the archive.\u201cThe legend goes that a couple of executives checked them out, took them to an international exhibition, and they never came back,\u201d said Thomas Forsythe, chief communications officer for General Mills, who also oversees the archive. \u201cI\u2019m convinced the gold medal is in someone\u2019s attic or someone\u2019s jewelry box. Somebody is going to see it, say, \u2018What\u2019s that?\u2019 and contact us.\u201dMany artifacts illustrate how marketing and advertising have evolved. Wheaties made its debut as Washburn\u2019s Gold Medal Whole Wheat Flakes in 1922, only to be renamed two years later in a companywide contest.The Betty Crocker program ran on the radio for 27 years before moving to television, where the actress Adelaide Hawley played Betty. (It was Ms. Hawley who offered Ms. Allen a hand in the kitchen.) General Mills later sponsored cartoons, notably \u201cRocky and His Friends\u201d and \u201cThe Bullwinkle Show\u201d from 1959 to 1964. In a nod to the company\u2019s roots, Rocky and Bullwinkle lived in the fictitious Frostbite Falls, Minn.Decades later, many still endure. Tacked to a bulletin board near Ms. Faucher\u2019s desk is a testament to the lasting impact of the most iconic General Mills character. It is a life insurance solicitation, addressed to Mrs. B. Crocker.Advertisement"}
