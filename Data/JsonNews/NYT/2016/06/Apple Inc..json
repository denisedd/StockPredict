{"Headline": "What You Need to Know About Apple\u2019s Software Upgrades", "Date": "2016-06-13", "News": "Supported byTech FixSAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Apple customers have a lot to digest this summer.Technology enthusiasts and gear heads are usually excited about big upgrades, but for average consumers, the changes can be overwhelming. Will devices get better or worse? Will the software change so much that it will disrupt the tools we use for work?Thankfully, Apple\u2019s four upgraded operating systems \u2014 iOS, tvOS, MacOS and WatchOS \u2014 are due out in the fall, so there is plenty of time to research and prepare.\u201cAt Apple, we believe that technology should lift humanity and should enrich people\u2019s lives in all the ways they want to experience it \u2014 whether it\u2019s on their wrist, in the living room, on the desk, in the palm of their hand,\u201d Timothy D. Cook, Apple\u2019s chief executive, said during Monday\u2019s keynote presentation.Here is a guide to how your devices will change if you install the software upgrades in a few months.Apple\u2019s next version of its mobile operating system, called iOS 10, will have an impact on how you communicate and potentially reduce the amount of time you spend fiddling with the phone.Among them, the Messages app that iPhone and iPad users primarily rely on for sending text messages will get a major overhaul. In the app, you will soon be able to draw sketches and hand-write notes to others, as well as attach animations, like confetti or fireworks. Apple is also letting third-party software developers offer modifications to the Messages app, meaning you might be able to add special messages, like stickers, special emoji or animated GIFs.Another significant change is the evolution of Siri, Apple\u2019s voice assistant. Third-party app developers can take advantage of voice commands, so you should be able to use voice commands to summon an Uber car, send a message through WhatsApp or map a jog with a fitness app, among other tricks.Other changes will not require a significant reset. With iOS 10, the iPhone screen will wake up when you raise it up \u2014 no need to press a button anymore. Apple also redesigned its music app with new colors and navigation features. Its default maps app will let outside developers integrate their services into the mapping app, so you might be able to book a restaurant table by tapping on a restaurant inside the map, for example. Apple is also adding the ability to search for nearby points of interest, like gas stations and coffee shops, similar to Google\u2019s Waze app.Sierra will also have tighter integration with other Apple devices. If you are wearing an Apple Watch, you can log into a Mac computer without typing in a password. When shopping on the web, you can use an iPhone to pay with Apple Pay, the company\u2019s mobile wallet service, by taking out the iPhone and registering your fingerprint to complete the purchase.Apple is now trying to address this problem with WatchOS, the next version of the operating system for Apple Watch. The company says third-party apps will open instantly with the new update.Another important change is coming to the fitness portion of Apple Watch. With the update, you will be able to see the fitness activity of other friends wearing Apple Watch, like the number of hours they have stood up and calories they have burned. Apple also added some new watch faces, letting you tailor the look to your liking.The next version of tvOS, the Apple TV\u2019s software system, caters largely to sports fans. A new feature called Live Tune In will let you immediately access a live broadcast. Speaking a command like \u201cWatch ESPN2\u201d can load a live sports game.Apple also expanded its Apple TV remote-control app that it offers for iPhones. Basically, the remote app will gain the same capabilities as the physical remote for the Apple TV, which includes a button for accessing Siri. So in the event that your remote control vanishes between your couch cushions, you can launch the remote app on your iPhone and use Siri to find something to watch, or swipe around on the phone screen to select an app.When the upgrades are released this fall, consumers would benefit from a somewhat cautious approach. Often with big software upgrades, bugs creep into earlier versions, so it\u2019s wise to wait at least a few weeks to assess whether the coast is clear before jumping in.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Theme Park Dining Beyond Burgers and Turkey Legs", "Date": "2016-06-15", "News": "Supported byThe bad reputation of theme park food has been, let\u2019s face it, pretty well deserved: All the negative aspects you might find at a state fair \u2014 sugary, greasy and overpriced \u2014 minus any of the quirky homespun charm. Mass-produced and joylessly prone to corporate tie-ins, it\u2019s the ultimate iteration of the theme park\u2019s overriding mission: to separate you from every last dollar in your pocket.But there\u2019s good news on theme park menus. While the old standbys are still standing by, there\u2019s been a shift recently toward food that\u2019s actually, well, edible. Your old favorites are still there: funnel cakes, cotton candy, turkey legs. But there are some decent restaurants now, too, some of which border on the downright respectable. I sampled a bit of everything on an impulsive three-park tour that included Knott\u2019s Berry Farm and Universal Studios in Southern California, as well as Dollywood in Pigeon Forge, Tenn. Here are some rides worth sending your taste buds on.Knott\u2019s Berry Farm in Buena Park owes its success directly to the boysenberry, a hybrid berry that would soon become the family\u2019s calling card. Walter Knott began propagating the berry and his wife began selling chicken dinners on the property of their modest farm. By the 1940s the dinners had become so popular that Knott created a small Old West town to entertain waiting diners and voil\u00e0 \u2014 what they call \u201cAmerica\u2019s first theme park\u201d was born.We\u2019ll start with the bad news: Many of the vendors at Knott\u2019s sell rehashed variations of the same combinations \u2014 burger, hot dog, chicken sandwich, fries \u2014 despite having enticing names or being situated in different themed areas in the park. For example: I ordered a Western BBQ bacon burger ($8.79 \u00e0 la carte, $15.99 in a combo with fries and drink) at Sutter\u2019s Fine Family Fare in Ghost Town. It had an unappetizingly stringy texture, and didn\u2019t make up for that in flavor.So I moved on, walking through Camp Snoopy over to the Grizzly Creek Lodge. It was a nice space with a large dining room, and I was excited. But the menu was almost identical: burger, hot dog, chicken sandwich. As was the menu at Coasters Diner. At Boardwalk Barbecue there wasn\u2019t a barbecue item anywhere on the menu. No matter where I went, it was just the same burger, hot dog and chicken sandwich. (To be fair, sometimes there\u2019s a pizza, and sometimes chicken tenders. But it\u2019s all more or less the same menu.)It wasn\u2019t all bad \u2014 I had some good carne asada nachos ($10.59) from Cantina in Fiesta Village. The guacamole that topped them was flavorless, but the meat was great. It was hot and tender and had a peppery quality almost like jerky. I also managed to find some actual barbecue at Fireman\u2019s Brigade Barbecue. Despite the disgruntled employee manning the grill who was cursing sotto voce while cooking the ribs, turkey, corn and garlic toast that I ordered, the food was decent. The giant turkey leg ($10.29), in particular, was the best I sampled at all three parks if only because it was the only example that wasn\u2019t overwhelmingly salty.I had a traditional fried chicken dinner for $21.99 that included four pieces of fried chicken, a small dish of mouth-puckering cherry-flavored rhubarb, cabbage with ham, six buttermilk biscuits, mashed potatoes with gravy, and a slice of boysenberry pie. It\u2019s an absurd amount of food for the price, and most of it was quite good. The chicken was hot and juicy; the biscuits were warm and buttery. There\u2019s also a shop next door called Chicken To-Go where you can get many of the menu items for takeout, as well as large chicken buckets (22 pieces with sides for $50.59) for parties.When I flew into Knoxville, Tenn., and picked up my car from the rental kiosk, Paula behind the desk asked me what I was doing in town. I told her I was there to go to Dollywood. \u201cYou came all the way from Los Angeles to go to \u2026 Dollywood?\u201d she said with a disbelieving stare. I nodded. \u201cWell, you should go see my boyfriend. He works there. He can give you recommendations.\u201dMaybe, as a local, she had become slightly immune to its charms. But I found the 150-acre park pretty delightful. Dollywood, founded in 1961 as Rebel Railroad, has a very light, \u201cUp With People\u201d kind of vibe. The music is bouncy and cheerful, and the employees positively exude classic Southern charm, down to the parking lot tram driver, who called out after us, \u201cI hope you make memories worth repeating, and I hope you love every moment.\u201dI don\u2019t know about memories worth repeating, but I definitely found food worth re-eating. Dollywood excels, as one might expect, in traditional Southern fare. The wonderfully titled Granny Ogle\u2019s Ham & Beans is named after the grandmother of one of Dolly Parton\u2019s close friends. I ordered the Fronie\u2019s Sampler for $15.99, which came with pot roast, pulled ham, mashed potatoes, turnip greens and a blackberry cobbler. The meats were very good \u2014 not overcooked but still very tender in their own juices.I managed to find Paula\u2019s boyfriend, Reid, working at a small gift kiosk and asked where he thought I should eat. \u201cPersonally, I think Backstage has the best food in the park,\u201d he said. \u201cGet the fried green tomatoes.\u201d The Backstage restaurant tries to recreate the look and feel behind the proscenium at a place like the Grand Ole Opry House or Ryman Auditorium. There are lots of old knickknacks, chests, ropes, lights and doors marked \u201cProp Master.\u201d I sat down at a table and ordered the Coca-Cola-infused ribs, along with some fried green tomatoes and a banana pudding for dessert.The ribs ($18.99) were solid but unspectacular \u2014 a bit dry, and the Coca-Cola marinade gave them a confusing sweetness. The fried green tomatoes ($6.99) were better: generous slices perfectly fried in a cornmeal batter (which was a bit thick for my taste, but I picked some of it off). The banana pudding made me feel like an 8-year-old back at my babysitter\u2019s house \u2014 sweet, creamy pudding with big chunks of banana, mixed with crumbled up Nilla wafers and topped with Cool Whip. I noticed the name tag of my nice waitress read \u201cKoke.\u201d \u201cMy mama named me after a Coca-Cola bottle,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd when she went down to the courthouse, she spelled my dang name wrong!\u201dOther areas where Dollywood really shone were with the casual finger foods. The funnel cake ($6.99) was the best of the three parks I visited \u2014 crispy on the outside, hot and moist on the inside, with a generous dusting of powdered sugar. The cinnamon bread ($5.99) from a place called the Grist Mill was a loaf of sloppy decadence. About the size of my two fists together (an incredible bargain, by the way), the loaf, fresh out of the oven, almost burned my hands through the paper bag I received it in. The hot bread, dripping with a syrupy butter mixture, had a nice savory component to it as well, balancing out the sweetness.Three Broomsticks is the main place to get grub, and it\u2019s really the only one worth your time \u2014 and that applies to the entire park. (Exception: There are a couple of decent places in the \u201cSimpsons\u201d-themed area, including some very respectable $8.99 carnitas tacos from the Bumblebee Man\u2019s Taco Truck.) I was again impressed with the d\u00e9cor: old lanterns and caldrons abound. (Members of the staff are all dressed like Dobby the house elf, though \u2014 I wasn\u2019t sure how I felt about that.) My dining companion and I made a couple of friends in line and decided to order the Great Feast for four people ($54.99). It was one of the best dining bargains of any of the three parks I visited, and I would go so far as to say that it\u2019s objectively a good value \u2014 in or out of a theme park.You get an enormous fresh salad with Italian dressing that is easily enough food for six people. That\u2019s followed by the main event, a gargantuan tray of food brought out by one of the cooks. \u201cHere\u2019s the Great Feast,\u201d she said, smiling, \u201cmagically prepared for you guys.\u201d I asked her, \u201cDo they make you say that?\u201d She smiled even bigger. \u201cYes, they do!\u201dOn the tray were four big ears of corn, a mountain of roasted red potatoes with grilled onions, four slabs of ribs, a big roasted chicken and various steamed vegetables. The undercooked veggies were the only thing that was underwhelming. Everything else was excellent. The ribs were moist and juicy, the meat coming effortlessly off the bone. The roasted chicken was also tender, and flavored nicely with pepper, lemon and garlic. The potatoes were soft and savory, dripping with butter.The accompanying drinks were almost as good as the food itself: Butterbeer, the drink made famous in the novels, is creamy and indulgent. It\u2019s essentially cream soda topped with a thick layer of \u201cfoam\u201d that resembles melted ice cream. The pumpkin juice is also tasty \u2014 refreshing and not overly sweet, it\u2018s like a nice spiced apple juice.\u201cWow,\u201d said our new friends, Amy and Kyle, through mouthfuls of chicken and ribs. \u201cThis is pretty impressive.\u201d The kitchen staff may not actually be able to work magic. But with the respectable, decently priced fare they\u2019re churning out, they just might fool you for a second.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Apple to Offer App Developers Access to Siri and iMessage", "Date": "2016-06-13", "News": "Supported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 With sales sluggish and stiffening competition from rivals like Google and Facebook, Apple announced on Monday coming improvements to the software that runs its devices, including a revamped Music app, an easier login process and better information-sharing across devices.More significantly, it also made it easier for app developers to tap the full power of Apple\u2019s technology \u2014 from its Siri voice assistant to instant messaging and Apple Pay \u2014 in their own apps.\u201cWe believe it is crucial that we provide the best tools so you can produce the best apps,\u201d Apple\u2019s chief executive, Tim Cook, told a crowd of about 5,000 assembled here for the company\u2019s annual worldwide developer conference.On Monday, Apple said it was allowing access to two of its crown jewels \u2014 Siri and its messaging app, iMessage \u2014 hoping that the creativity of outside developers will spur a round of innovation to make the iPhone seem as magical as it did when the first apps were introduced eight years ago.Showing off how developers could use messaging, an Apple executive opened the food-delivery app DoorDash from inside Apple iMessage and put together a joint order with friends.Earlier this year, Facebook opened up Messenger to bots, automated software assistants that can accomplish various tasks. Google also announced plans to introduce a messaging service with similar capabilities.\u201cA lot of the messaging apps are moving toward this,\u201d said Brian Blau, a technology analyst with Gartner who attended the event. \u201cIf Apple hadn\u2019t announced developer access to messages, I would have been really surprised.\u201dDevelopers were also pleased to get access to Siri so they could incorporate voice commands into their own apps. Until now, Siri has mostly been limited to Apple services and has been used for tasks like conducting searches, getting directions or asking the virtual assistant to make a call.Faizan Buzdar, chief executive of Convo, a business collaboration software maker, said his company had already been using Siri to a limited extent so that customers could bookmark items that pop up in the Convo app.\u201cBut my vision would be to say, \u2018What\u2019s our revenue this week?\u2019\u201d he said, adding that Siri would then open Convo, which would pull in data from its app and partner apps, and provide the answer. \u201cThat kind of natural language can really push the barriers of business.\u201dInitially, Siri will only be available for certain categories of apps like those providing ride-hailing, messaging and photo-search services.Apple has been a leader on mobile devices since the introduction of the iPhone a decade ago. But in some critical respects, it is now playing catch-up.For example, Google, whose Android smartphone software is more popular than Apple\u2019s globally, uses sophisticated facial recognition technology to organize a user\u2019s photos, and Google\u2019s mapping service works closely with other apps to identify important locations and automatically provide directions to appointments.Apple said on Monday that it would offer similar features in the next version of its iPhone software, iOS 10, which will be released in the fall with a new crop of iPhones.Similarly, Apple\u2019s integration of other services into iMessage mirrors what Facebook has done with Messenger and what Tencent, a major Apple rival in China, has done with WeChat messaging.Unlike Google and Facebook, which rely on uploading a user\u2019s data to the cloud, Apple said the new features will keep data on the phone to protect user privacy.\u201cIn some ways the star of the show wasn\u2019t a particular product but Apple\u2019s refutation of accusations that it can\u2019t compete with Google and Facebook in artificial intelligence and deep learning,\u201d said Jan Dawson, chief analyst of Jackdaw Research, in an email after the presentation.Apple is a clear leader in some areas, particularly the nascent field of smartwatches. Announcing improvements to its year-old Watch platform, Apple said that the new version of the watch\u2019s operating system would start apps instantly. Users will also be able to scribble responses to messages one letter at time, instead of relying on the canned responses that are currently available.The Watch remains tethered to the iPhone for most uses, and the company seems to be repositioning it as a healthy-living accessory, offering improved activity tracking and sharing. There is even a new deep-breathing app.In an attempt to persuade customers to buy more Apple products, the company also introduced a host of planned features to share data between devices. The documents on the desktop of a Mac, for example, will be accessible on iPads and iPhones. Photos taken with the iPhone can be viewed on the Apple TV.Apple signaled its desire to be a player in global e-commerce, where sales are expected to total $2 trillion this year, according to the research firm eMarketer.Apple said that retailers\u2019 websites would soon be able to use Apple Pay as a checkout method, and customers could authorize a purchase with their fingerprint on their iPhone. Currently, the digital payment service is restricted to physical stores and apps, where it has gotten a lukewarm response.A few days before the conference, Apple made two other major announcements affecting developers. It will begin testing paid search ads in the App Store, which will allow developers to buy a slot at the top of the search results when a user looks for an app. Apple also said it would reduce the cut it took from subscriptions in apps to 15 percent, from 30 percent, after the first year.Whether Apple\u2019s improvements will be enough to keep developers happily writing apps for the iPhone and other Apple products remains to be seen.Creating an iPhone app typically costs $50,000 to $200,000, and some cost as much as $1 million, according to an eMarketer report last June. A website is cheaper, and while it lacks some convenience of an app, there are techniques to make a site easy for web users to find.\u201cDevelopers are asking, \u2018What is the additional revenue I can get from an app?\u2019\u201d Ms. Boyle said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Testing the Clean-Energy Logic of a Tesla-SolarCity Merger", "Date": "2016-06-23", "News": "Supported byImagine a world in which every home and building is a miniature power plant, with solar panels on the roofs and electric vehicles and stationary battery banks in the garages.Meters and software would manage the flow of power, allowing homeowners and businesses to seamlessly buy and sell electricity at the best prices, simultaneously lowering their costs and raising the amount of green energy on the grid.That\u2019s the long-term vision behind the plan that Elon Musk described late Tuesday, explaining the rationale for Tesla to acquire SolarCity and create the \u201cworld\u2019s only vertically integrated energy company.\u2019\u2019And it may very well become reality, whether in years or decades, and whether Mr. Musk\u2019s version of the vision is one that proves viable.Still, if Mr. Musk and his cousins, Lyndon and Peter Rive, can trounce the competition and surmount their financial woes \u2014 and those are very big ifs \u2014 the integrated company they are trying to assemble could be in a position to dominate.\u201cThis is an effort to build the Apple of clean energy,\u201d said Daniel M. Kammen, the director of the Renewable and Appropriate Energy Laboratory at the University of California, Berkeley. \u201cThat really is part of the new wave of companies that could make this decarbonization addressing climate change really work.\u201dWall Street, at least for the moment, is not on board.SolarCity\u2019s stock, which has been trading at roughly a quarter of its peak value in recent months, rose after the announcement. But Tesla\u2019s has tumbled. Several analysts and investors have questioned the wisdom of adding to both companies\u2019 financial pressures \u2014 between them the companies lost more than $1.6 billion last year \u2014 and potentially distracting Tesla from building its enormous battery factory in Nevada and bringing its first moderately priced car to market next year.Even some energy analysts say the proposed acquisition is at least as much about helping Mr. Musk\u2019s personal investments as furthering his green agenda. But, some energy experts and investors say, there is logic in combining Tesla, where Mr. Musk is chief executive, and SolarCity, where he is chairman.Describing Tesla automobiles as \u201cbatteries wrapped in a car,\u201d Shawn Kravetz, founder of the solar power investment company Esplanade Capital, said that the energy storage business was likely to become colossal. \u201cAnd so you can see,\u2019\u2019 he said, \u2018\u2018how the electricity to power those batteries can be an essential part of this.\u201dThe two companies have been moving toward a closer partnership for some time. SolarCity began installing Tesla batteries in pilot projects for residential and commercial customers about four years ago. Last year, Tesla announced its move to market rechargeable lithium-ion battery packs that could mount to a home garage wall, as well as battery blocks large enough to power commercial and industrial customers and serve in utility-scale installations to smooth out fluctuations in the grid.At the same time, SolarCity, after years of challenging the utility industry to innovate or die, started acting more like a utility itself. It began a program aimed at cities, remote communities, campuses and military bases to design and operate small, independent power networks called microgrids. At the time, Peter Rive, one of the company\u2019s founders and its chief technical officer, called the system \u201ca template that can be scaled up to basically be the next-generation grid.\u201dAs the leading rooftop solar provider in the country, SolarCity is thought to have the largest collection of data on how solar customers use energy at every minute of the day. With that data \u2014 especially if combined with information from electric cars, chargers and stationary batteries \u2014 the combined company could be well suited to creating products and services based on customer needs.\u201cThey deeply understand what the customer\u2019s usage patterns are,\u201d said Swapnil Shah, chief executive of FirstFuel Software, which provides energy management services to buildings. He compared the potential to Amazon\u2019s ability to adapt and customize online shopping to buyer\u2019s behavior.\u201cThey\u2019re creating unique personalized profiles of your habits,\u2019\u2019 Mr. Shah said, \u201cand they use that to identify what is the next click for the next product.\u201dAnd yet, while SolarCity was building the infrastructure for a new, decentralized approach to power production known as distributed generation, while earning a reputation for aggressive attacks on the old-school utility industry, Mr. Musk was turning Tesla into \u201cthe brand that everyone wants to buy,\u201d Mr. Kammen said. That brand burnishing is something that could benefit SolarCity, he said.But a big challenge for Tesla, said Shayle Kann of GTM Research, which focuses on clean energy industries, is that it is not the only company with such a grand vision. Utility industry stalwarts like Edison International and Con Edison are developing energy services and consulting divisions, while technology giants like General Electric, Oracle, Google and even Apple are getting into the business of providing or managing power.Of course, the merger plan may not go through, if other investors balk and because of the corporate governance and other issues arising from Mr. Musk\u2019s roles in both companies. He also owns more than 20 percent of each. But maybe a merger isn\u2019t necessary to achieve the larger goals.\u201cDo you have to own things in order to leverage or even to a certain extent control them?\u201d Mr. Kravetz of Esplanade Capital asked. \u201cI think the answer is no. You don\u2019t have to own the cow to get the milk.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Why the World Is Drawing Battle Lines Against American Tech Giants", "Date": "2016-06-01", "News": "Supported byState of the ArtAnd now, out of nowhere, come a handful of American technology companies to wash away all your cultural defenses. Suddenly just about everything that a French citizen buys, reads, watches or listens to flows in some way or another through these behemoths.The European efforts are just a taste of a coming global freak-out over the power of the American tech industry. Over the next few years, we are bound to see increasing friction between the tiny group of tech companies that rule much of the industry and the governments that rule the lands those companies are trying to invade. What is happening in Europe is playing out in China, India and Brazil and across much of the rest of the globe, as well.The result is fragmentation. Once, not too long ago, many in the tech industry thought that digital technology would bring about the dawn of a new global order.The internet\u2019s structure was decentralized and nonhierarchical; it therefore seemed immune to control by any single government. Under this dream, the network would bridge vast distances and connect cultures, creating a new system of legal norms that were more uniform around the world.But that is not how it has been playing out.\u201cMy assumption is that this is only the beginning,\u201d said Dongsheng Zang, director of the Asian Law Center at the University of Washington School of Law. \u201cWe\u2019ll be seeing more of these governments make their own demands, and the problem is a fragmentation of the global tech companies.\u201d He added, \u201cThis could be a problem for America in the 21st century.\u201dThis dynamic may not sound very new. Whether it comes to taxes, privacy, free speech or security, national governments have always sought to impose rules on transnational corporations.Until the surveillance revealed by the National Security Agency contractor Edward J. Snowden, many American tech companies were also more deferential to the American government, especially its requests for law enforcement help.In the rest of the world, the Americanness of the Frightful Five is often seen as a reason for fear, not comfort. In part that is because of a worry about American hegemony. The bigger these companies get, the less room they leave for local competition \u2014 and the more room for possible spying by the United States government.But even if that idea sounds hyperbolic (but it doesn\u2019t, right?), there is a deeper fear of usurpation through tech \u2014 a worry that these companies could grow so large and become so deeply entrenched in world economies that they could effectively make their own laws.\u201cWhat\u2019s happening right now is the nation-state is losing its grip,\u201d said Jane K. Winn, also a professor at the University of Washington School of Law, who studies international business transactions. \u201cOne of the hallmarks of modernity is that you have a nation-state that claims they are the exclusive source of a universal legal system that addresses all legal issues. But now people in one jurisdiction are subject to rules that come from outside the government \u2014 and often it\u2019s companies that run these huge networks that are pushing their own rules.\u201dThe same dynamic would apply to other companies\u2019 platforms. Rules imposed by the Apple and Google app stores become a kind of law for developers around the world. YouTube\u2019s guidelines become a cultural arbiter anywhere it operates.And Facebook\u2019s news feed algorithm may matter more to journalists in some countries than any particular legal limit on their operations.How will governments stop the tech companies from expanding their powers? By placing ever higher burdens on them to limit their reach, something we have seen happening more often.Nobody knows yet who will win these fights. The American tech giants are huge, but they need the blessing of national governments, and those blessings aren\u2019t coming easily.\u201cThey\u2019re facing an increasingly self-confident India, Brazil and China,\u201d Mr. Zang said. \u201cIf they don\u2019t back down, they probably have leverage to impose lots of different rules to limit how these companies reach into local markets.\u201dEmail: farhad.manjoo@nytimes.com; Twitter: @fmanjooAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Why Uber Keeps Raising Billions", "Date": "2016-06-20", "News": "Supported byDealBookConsider this: When Amazon went public in 1997, it raised $54 million and was valued at $438 million.So what exactly is Uber doing with all that money? And what does it say about Uber \u2014 and the financial markets \u2014 that the company has turned most recently to selling the equivalent of junk bonds?Every time Uber raises another $1 billion, venture capital investors and others may find it less attractive to back one of Uber\u2019s many rivals: Didi Chuxing, Lyft, Gett, Halo, Juno. In other words, Uber\u2019s fund-raising efforts have seemingly become part of the contest: It\u2019s not just a rivalry over customers and drivers; it\u2019s a war of attrition, a mad scramble to starve the competition of cash.At the moment, Uber\u2019s success has had the opposite effect: It has spawned a long list of rivals, big and little guys who say, \u201cWe can do it too.\u201d But over time, as the smaller competitors run out of cash \u2014 after heavily subsidizing riders in an effort to steal business from Uber \u2014 venture capitalists should be less inclined to put up even more cash to go up against Fortress Uber.Uber\u2019s fund-raising arms race comes against the backdrop of falling valuations for many Silicon Valley unicorns \u2014 private companies worth $1 billion or more. So there\u2019s clearly a rush to take the money while it\u2019s still available.\u201cIt\u2019s not the second inning or even the sixth, it\u2019s the 14th inning in a five-hour baseball game,\u201d Bill Gurley, the famed venture capitalist who has as a stake in Uber and sits on its board, warned on his blog about the state of Silicon Valley. He alerted investors about unicorns that come to them seeking funds: \u201cYou are not being invited to a special dance, you are being approached because you are the lender of last resort.\u201dThe ride-sharing industry has long been seen as a zero-sum game because of the \u201cnetwork effect\u201d: The more customers sign up for Uber, the more drivers sign up, making it tougher for rivals to mount competition. There will most likely be only one or two significant players in any given market. (More on that in a moment, because there might be some cracks emerging in that point of view.)The question is whether the financing game is zero-sum too. And the even larger question is whether Uber\u2019s eye-popping capital investments could ultimately act as a deterrent to investors who might consider supporting Uber\u2019s competitors: Will they look at Uber\u2019s balance sheet \u2014 it has some $6 billion in cash just sitting there \u2014 and throw up a white flag?So far, Uber is clearly winning the valuation game: It is worth more than virtually all of its rivals combined.Perhaps strangely, several of the same investors that have backed Uber are also backing Didi in China, including BlackRock and Tiger Global, so it is hard to say that one service is deterring investment in the other \u2014 at least not yet. (It is worth noting that among the investor class, some may be hoping that Uber might one day merge its Chinese operation with Didi.)Given the remarkably low interest rates, investors looking for yield may buy into Uber.Uber says it is profitable in North America, Europe, the Middle East, Africa and Australia \u2014 if you factor out taxes and interest payments. The challenge for Uber is breaking into China and India, perhaps the two largest markets in the world. Uber is currently on track to lose about $2 billion annually in those markets as it heavily subsidizes customers and drivers to gain market share.That means that Uber will have to pay up for the financing. But if Uber\u2019s valuation continued to grow, it would be a bargain compared with the value of the equity. Uber is hoping to sell debt with a yield of about 4 or 4.5 percent.Uber\u2019s I.P.O. will probably come to pass in the next three to four years. That\u2019s because some of the convertible debt it previously issued provides investors with a special discount if the company has not gone public by then.But by 2018 or 2019, at the rate Uber is going, who knows how much money Uber will have raised. It may need none.The question is whether it will have starved all of its competitors along the way.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Tony Fadell Steps Down Amid Tumult at Nest, a Google Acquisition", "Date": "2016-06-03", "News": "Supported byTime to move on. That is the explanation Tony Fadell, a former star executive at Apple known for his aggressive management style, offers for his departure from Nest, a maker of digital versions of household staples like thermostats and smoke detectors that he helped found and sold to Google.Mr. Fadell, the company said, will become an adviser to Alphabet and to its chief executive, Larry Page.In a recent interview in his Palo Alto office, Mr. Fadell, 47, talked about his career. At Apple, he led the engineering team that created the iPod digital music player and worked on the first three versions of the iPhone. In 2010 he founded Nest with Matt Rogers, a young Apple engineer.\u201cI\u2019m a guy who\u2019s at the beginning of things,\u201d Mr. Fadell said. \u201cI don\u2019t like to do maintenance mode. It\u2019s not what gets me out of bed.\u201dThe sharpest attack came from Greg Duffy, the founder and former chief executive of Dropcam, the home video camera and cloud-computing service that Nest acquired for $555 million in 2014, about six months after Google bought Nest. Mr. Duffy clashed with Mr. Fadell, remained at Nest for eight months and briefly moved to another post at Google before departing last September.In the interview, which Mr. Fadell agreed to on the condition that it not be published before Alphabet announced he was leaving, he had answers for most of the criticisms of his tenure. He described the staff departures as a small fraction of Nest employees and in line with the turnover in Silicon Valley, where switching jobs is common.Mr. Fadell said that Nest had \u201cstrong double-digit\u201d revenue growth from the outset. In a statement on Friday, Mr. Page, citing Nest\u2019s achievements, noted that its revenue growth was \u201cin excess of 50 percent\u201d a year since it began shipping products in 2011.Mr. Fadell characterized Nest as healthy, with 1,100 workers and strong teams in design, software and services around its three product families \u2014 its \u201clearning\u201d thermostat, smoke detector and video camera.Yet the larger issue is not Nest\u2019s past performance but what impact Mr. Fadell\u2019s departure will have on its future. Nest is the linchpin of Alphabet\u2019s bet on the emerging smart home market \u2014 devices and software to automate homes for convenience, energy savings and security.Mr. Fadell will be succeeded by Marwan Fawaz, a former executive vice president of Motorola Mobility, the mobile phone maker Google bought for $12.5 billion in 2011. Google unloaded Motorola three years later to Lenovo for the fire sale price of $2.9 billion, though a sizable share of Motorola\u2019s value was its thousands of patents.In the troubled Motorola acquisition, Mr. Fawaz led a financial bright spot, Motorola Home, a television set-top box business. He pared its product line, cut costs and oversaw its sale in 2013 for $2.35 billion to the Arris Group, a cable television equipment maker.In the Alphabet portfolio, Nest is a leading entry among the parent company\u2019s \u201cother bets,\u201d its effort to build businesses beyond Google\u2019s lucrative franchise in online search and advertising. Google\u2019s record with acquired hardware businesses, notably the Motorola deal, has not inspired confidence.When the Nest thermostat was introduced in 2011, it was an innovative reimagining of a product category, much as the iPod was a reinvention of the MP3 music player and the iPhone was a new take on the cellphone. It was a stylish piece of hardware, a circle of brushed stainless steel, reflective polymer and a crystal-sharp color display.Inside, the Nest thermostat houses sensors for detecting motion in the room and clever software to learn and adjust room temperatures, according to whether people are present or not, to curb electric bills.Priced at $249, the Nest thermostat was far more expensive than traditional models. Rivals scoffed but later offered their own models. Honeywell, for example, now has a $249 model that resembles the Nest oval.The pace of product introductions in the home necessarily will be more gradual, which critics often miss, Mr. Fadell said. A thermostat typically lasts 10 or 12 years.\u201cSome people expect us to be a gadget factory,\u201d he said. \u201cBut you don\u2019t want your thermostat to be like your smartphone, replacing it every two or three years.\u201dMore is done with software, especially updates, sent over the internet and wirelessly connected to Nest devices. Relying on software, of course, opens the door to software bugs. In 2014, the United States Consumer Product Safety Commission ordered a recall of more than 400,000 Nest Protect smoke and gas detectors because a defect could cause users to turn them off unintentionally. Nest halted sales for a while and fixed the problem by updating the software.The software is what allows its devices to communicate with each other. The Nest Protect, for example, can detect a carbon monoxide leak and tell the Nest thermostat to turn off the furnace.Mr. Fadell points to the 18,000 software developers working with Nest software, 12,000 retail stores that sell Nest devices and more than 100 utility companies, many of which offer consumer rebates to buy Nest thermostats, for their energy saving potential.\u201cWe\u2019re not a products company,\u201d Mr. Fadell said. \u201cWe\u2019re a products, services and software company.\u201d And, he added, building up those networks \u201ctakes a long time.\u201dIt will be up to others to do that building now. Yet Mr. Fadell expresses no regrets. Selling to Google, he insists, was the right choice to give Nest the financial ballast it needs for the long term.When Nest started, the technology giants were not in the smart home market. But now, Samsung has SmartThings software and devices, Apple has HomeKit software, and Amazon has the Echo voice command device.Nor does Mr. Fadell apologize for his management style. He described his strength as \u201cholding people to a higher standard than they thought they could achieve and pushing them beyond what they thought they could achieve.\u201dMr. Fadell said he had no immediate plans but he would spend more time looking at technology start-ups.In the last decade, he has quietly invested in and advised many fledgling companies. His current investments include Impossible Foods, which synthesizes beef without cattle; Airwave, an operating system for drones; Mousera, sensor technology to speed insights from preclinical drug trials on lab animals; and Phononic, semiconductor-based heating and cooling.\u201cI\u2019m not a scientist,\u201d Mr. Fadell said. \u201cI\u2019m looking for technology that is about to come out of the lab and has the potential to transform a business. I like to see these technologies raw.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Code is a series of propositions about arranging transistors in a computer.Apple became one of the world\u2019s biggest companies thanks to this paradoxical invention, and now it may also be threatened by where software is headed.But this session was more about catching up to rivals. Apple offered a new way to send sketches and handwriting, new ways of photo-organizing, and a limited incorporation of Siri, Apple\u2019s virtual assistant, with third-party software. The watch loads apps faster, and has some more social functions.Google Maps, more popular than the Apple version, works well by pooling the experiences of millions of users, often in real time, to deliver accurate information on things like traffic jams. Echo, Amazon\u2019s virtual assistant masquerading as a new wave pepper mill, does a great job of playing your songs, buying stuff for you or reading you recipes, because it trawls in lots of people\u2019s data.These are just two examples of a big trend in software, the application of real-time artificial intelligence in ordinary products.A.I., which is fundamentally the recognition and leveraging of all sorts of behavioral patterns, works well by using very large and diverse sets of data. Often, the more personal the better. To make software with A.I. features, you have to be able to access lots of information, obtained by various means.Apple fans, who could see their products have relatively less magical software functionality, may end up experiencing something else: getting their privacy at the expense of the the consumer delight offered by Apple\u2019s competitors.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Farhad\u2019s and Mike\u2019s Week in Tech: That Business of Microsoft Buying LinkedIn", "Date": "2016-06-18", "News": "Supported byBitsAnd, really, in most cases, a good rule of thumb for internet users is: If it\u2019s bad for AT&T and Verizon, it\u2019s probably good for you.Here\u2019s my best guess: Microsoft is buying a social graph. That\u2019s a Valley term for a loose web of interconnected people, essentially a treasure trove of data and interaction. Microsoft has considered buying other so-called graphs in the past, like Twitter, which purports to be the key to our interests, or Facebook, which holds the key to our interpersonal relationships.To my knowledge, Microsoft\u2019s only real ownership over a graph has been through Xbox Live, itself a social network of gamers, but that business is ancillary and not central to what drives its core products, which Microsoft C.E.O. Satya Nadella has made clear are all about the cloud and business and getting things done. (Haha! Business!)So what does Microsoft buy with LinkedIn\u2019s graph? One possibility: Microsoft could use LinkedIn as a giant sales intelligence platform, mining the wealth of data LinkedIn has on how people and companies connect to one another, and use that to sell more of their enterprise products. Perhaps that gives Microsoft\u2019s sales teams far more leads, or a jump on competitors like Google or Amazon\u2019s sales prospects.Is all of that boring? Yes! But, like, we\u2019re talking about Microsoft buying LinkedIn. It\u2019s not going to be an action-packed affair. It\u2019s going to be about \u2014 haha! \u2014 business.There are two problems with that kind of system. First, it\u2019s annoying for users \u2014 unless you\u2019re actively looking for a job, there\u2019s no reason to look at LinkedIn, which means that the site must constantly spam you to keep your interest in it alive. Second, because it has no reason for being other than recruitment, LinkedIn risks getting replaced by all kinds of more useful online networks.For instance, software developers have GitHub, an online resource where people can share and talk about code \u2014 and where, crucially, recruiters can see exactly what programmers have done in their work lives. People in the media, meanwhile, have Twitter \u2014 a place to show our work and engagement in the news, making it far more useful than simply a list of past workplaces. (See, Twitter is good for our careers!)Granted, not every profession has such a place online, and maybe sales and marketing people will always have a special affinity for LinkedIn. But for most people, I think, LinkedIn will grow less significant over time, not more.Oh, and one more thing, Mike. Will you please never join my professional network on LinkedIn?

In a rush to harness the power of the web\u2019s most evocative cultural units \u2014 emoji and their hyperactive cousins, GIFs \u2014 tech companies, corporate brands and entrepreneurial social media stars could risk inadvertently flattening the creative world that\u2019s sprung up around them.If emoji encourage visual puns and whimsical juxtapositions, GIFs inspire a sharp curatorial sensibility. The art lies in detecting the richest slices of popular media \u2014 film, TV or amateur video \u2014 and punctuating their greatness by setting them on infinite repeat. The best \u201creaction\u201d GIFs \u2014 those chosen to inject human expression in online conversation \u2014 feel both emotionally familiar and visually surprising.Buying into these features means giving tech companies the power to shape our creative expressions in ways that further enrich the companies themselves. A limited emotional range helps collect data on users\u2019 states of mind. Twitter advertisers can now target users based on the emoji they tweet.The commodification of digital culture has engendered more explicit corporate branding, too. On Snapchat, where users embellish their selfies with emoji, crayon scribbles, and elaborate \u201clenses\u201d that cover their faces with virtual masks, marketers like McDonalds are seizing the opportunity to write their messages across people\u2019s faces.With Kimoji, and its micro images of breasts and butts, Kim Kardashian isn\u2019t just sexy: She represents sex itself. But as more stars jump on the bandwagon, these apps begin to represent little more than a branding opportunity: Ansel Elgort sticking out his tongue; Ansel Elgort pouting; Ansel Elgort wearing headphones.Meanwhile, as traditional emoji expand beyond their Japanese roots, tech companies like Apple, Microsoft and Google (all are voting members of Unicode) have become responsible for making cultural, and sometimes political, choices in determining which new emoji will make the cut.For the Olympics, Unicode recently considered encoding a rifle emoji alongside other sport-themed glyphs, but members voted it down. \u201cWhen vendors looked at it, they didn\u2019t see a lot of additional value in adding it,\u201d said Mark Davis, a Unicode spokesman. \u201cThere\u2019s already a firearm in Unicode.\u201d\u201cOne of the things that make emoji fun is this quirky weird list that came about through accidents of history,\u201d said Jeremy Burge, the founder of Emojipedia and a member of Unicode\u2019s emoji subcommittee. \u201cThe bomb, the cigarette, the dripping syringe \u2014 it\u2019s crazy to think that all of those would make it in today.\u201dAdvertisement"}

It feels like a longer word that got cut off,\u201d she said, although she added that renaming the company gives it a good platform to help publicize its new strategy \u2014 not to mention media attention.Bob Killian, founder of Killian Branding, had a similar reaction. \u201c\u2018Tronc\u2019 has a few demerits,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a strangled sound, and it creates an ugliness.\u201d But it helps, he said, that the name is short and easy to say.Rob Frankel, a branding expert, was also negative. \u201cThe renaming thing blows up way more often than there\u2019s any benefit,\u201d he said, adding, \u201cThe wrong way is when people confuse brand for identity.\u201dIra Kalb, an assistant professor of clinical marketing at the Marshall School of Business at the University of Southern California, says many companies overlook the role a name plays in their identity. \u201cIn a brand platform, the three big items we have are the name, the logo and the slogan. Those three things work together to help create your brand in the mind of the buyer,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen you change that name, you\u2019re changing the relationship, and most people don\u2019t understand that.\u201dExperts say one of the most common mistakes that companies make is to let employees or customers make suggestions, or to make a contest out of picking a new name. \u201cTo create an effective name, it should not be a democracy,\u201d Ms. Cottineau said. \u201cEverybody feels they\u2019re an expert in naming.\u201dThe reality is that most people are not, Mr. Killian said. \u201cAn internal contest is a disaster about 100 percent of the time. You\u2019re asking people to do something that\u2019s not in their skill set,\u201d he said. A renaming contest also creates a dynamic with winners and losers, which can inject unnecessary tension into a company\u2019s work force, he said.Ms. Cottineau says most companies make a lot of mistakes when it comes to rebranding. \u201cChanging your corporate name is really difficult. This one little word has to overcome so many different hurdles,\u201d she said.Not only should the ideal brand name be easy to pronounce and spell, but, Ms. Cottineau said, a newer concern is making sure that the word does not get automatically corrected \u2014 possibly to something embarrassing \u2014 when typed in an email or text message.\u201cProbably the biggest one is trademark and URL availability,\u201d she said, adding that it\u2019s not unheard-of for naming consultants to cycle through thousands of possibilities before settling on a short list of available ones.Different barriers to starting a business today, with the evolution of the tech start-up industry, and changes to trademark law mean that an entrepreneur can effectively take a name out of circulation even if the business plan never comes to fruition.Ms. Cottineau says another challenge is companies\u2019 growing preference for real words \u2014 a trend driven by the perception that these words represent a more authentic experience \u2014 as opposed to \u201ccoined words,\u201d or made-up monikers.\u201cThere\u2019s definitely a trend towards real-word naming now,\u201d she said. \u201cThey\u2019re really hard to get, though. When you\u2019re trying to secure a trademark for a real word, it has to be relevant but not descriptive of your category.\u201dStarbucks, for instance, is a better name than something more generic that might include the word coffee, she said. Likewise, Apple stands out among its technological brethren with a name that evokes harvests rather than hard drives.Ms. Cottineau praised the name choices of the ride-hailing service Uber and the food delivery service Seamless. Both hint at what their companies aspire to be without pigeonholing them.Although it\u2019s easier to err than to score a victory when renaming a brand, experts say, one effort that earned high marks was by Google, which changed its corporate name from Google, its flagship search engine, to Alphabet last year as it expanded into potentially risky ventures like high-speed broadband, smart-home devices and self-driving cars.\u201cA lot of those things are innovative, and innovation comes with failure,\u201d Mr. Kalb said. \u201dAnd when your brand fails, you don\u2019t want it to spill over to other products.\u201dMr. Frankel, the branding expert, said, \u201cBlackBerry made the same mistake. WordPerfect did in the \u201980s, which is to confuse product with brand.\u201d He added: \u201cIf the product missteps one time, it takes the whole brand down with it.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Apple May Soon Open Retail Stores in India", "Date": "2016-06-20", "News": "Supported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 After months of delays, Apple is likely to open its first retail stores in India, a fast-growing market for smartphones where the American technology giant has little presence.Apple, which makes virtually all of its devices in China, lobbied for months for the loosening, and Timothy D. Cook, the company\u2019s chief executive, discussed it with government officials during his first visit to India last month.An Apple spokesman declined to comment on the issue on Monday. The company has not yet received any formal response from the Indian government on its application to open stores.By themselves, new stores will have little impact on Apple\u2019s small market share in India, beyond serving as a marketing tool. Although Indians will buy an estimated 139 million smartphones this year, Android models that cost less than $120 dominate the market, according to the Gartner research firm.Apple says its sales in India grew 56 percent during its last fiscal quarter, but its cheapest phones typically run $400 or more. Its total annual sales in India were around two million units last year, according to Gartner.The policy changes, which also affect other sectors like the military and aviation, are the latest effort by the government of Prime Minister Narendra Modi to make India more predictable for foreign technology companies \u2014 even if the rules do not always work exactly as planned.Last month, after years of threatening to impose stiff taxes on venture capitalists and other foreign investors in India, the Indian government struck a new treaty with Mauritius, a tax haven used by many foreign companies to move money in and out of India tax-free, to phase out the tax breaks. Foreign investors will soon have to pay a modest tax on capital gains in India, but the uncertainty is over.Kanwal Rekhi, managing director of Inventus Capital Partners, a venture capital firm with a long history of investing in India, said the series of clarifications had been a long time in coming. \u201cThese are not things that require change of law,\u201d he said. \u201cModi is an improvement over what we had, but he is still hesitant.\u201dMr. Rehki said that Monday\u2019s policy announcements would have little impact on the overall technology industry in India, which is already open to start-ups as well as giants like Facebook, Google, Microsoft and Oracle.Opening stores will allow Apple to deliver to Indian customers the full Apple experience \u2014 artful displays staffed by informed sales representatives, \u201cgenius bars\u201d to help solve problems and a carefully curated set of accessories.\u201cPeople feel pride after buying an iPhone, that\u2019s what Apple is all about,\u201d said Anshul Gupta, a personal technology analyst with Gartner in Mumbai. \u201cThat\u2019s how they maintain the premium image.\u201dThe Indian government has not yet acted on Apple\u2019s request to address the low end of the market by importing and selling used phones with a new warranty. The company has indicated it would do some of the refurbishing in India, creating local jobs.Mr. Gupta said that Indian consumers were becoming more affluent, and that if Apple could capture the top 5 to 10 percent of India\u2019s smartphone sales, that would be a large new market. \u201cIt is not an overnight story, but there is a huge potential,\u201d he said.Apple, slow to warm to India, \u201cnow wants to catch up its lost ground, \u201d said Arvind Singhal, chairman of Technopak, a business consulting firm in New Delhi.Ayesha Venkataraman contributed reporting from Mumbai and Paul Mozur from Hong Kong.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Can Apple Think Outside the Device?", "Date": "2016-06-14", "News": "Supported byState of the ArtMore than any other company in tech, Apple prizes physical objects \u2014 expensive, perfectly designed, self-contained nuggets of aluminum and glass that you buy today, use for a couple years and replace.Until recently, that view worked quite well. Over the past decade, through its own products and the many copycats that piled on, Apple\u2019s device-centric aestheticism has made computers easier to use and more accessible to more people around the world \u2014 and raked in eye-popping profits while doing so.Yet Apple\u2019s view increasingly feels like an outdated way of thinking about tech.So the primary question Apple had to answer at its annual developer conference this week was whether it could expand its worldview. Could it break free from the limiting perspective of individual devices?The answer: Yes, but slowly \u2014 and it\u2019s hard to tell if Apple is thinking big enough.But a lot of these features felt small bore. Apple still seems to view online services as add-ons to its devices \u2014 not as products or platforms that rise above them. The best way to see the shortcomings of this position is through Siri, the voice assistant that is Apple\u2019s best chance to create the kind of transcendent, cross-device experience that its competitors are now pushing.Analysts and developers were expecting big improvements to Siri. Apple did show off a way for some apps to integrate with Siri and for Siri to perform a few new functions on Apple TV; Siri also found a new home on Macintosh computers. But the way Apple presented the changes, with each Siri advance positioned as a feature of one of Apple\u2019s devices, left unclear what Apple\u2019s ultimate aims were for the voice assistant.The new features fall short of remaking Siri into something fundamentally different from what it is today. Siri, as Apple is positioning it, is becoming a better app launcher for your phone \u2014 you can use it to call for an Uber ride or to respond to a message. But it\u2019s not clear that it\u2019s becoming a truly intelligent assistant, one that understands you across your devices, that can comprehend complex queries and get things done for you regardless of which apps you happen to have installed on any particular machine.These shortcomings are not terrible. Though many competitors have shown off some interesting demos, at the moment no rival voice assistant approaches the accuracy and ease of use of an actual human assistant. Siri is hardly behind, and there is still room for it to become the leader. Yet the way Apple approaches Siri is a proxy for the way it plans to approach online services generally.Before we get to the limitations, here are the details on what\u2019s new with Siri: First, the voice assistant can now control some third-party apps on your phone. You can send text messages through apps like WhatsApp or Slack using your voice \u2014 in the past, you could do so only with Apple\u2019s own messaging app. Depending on which developers add Siri to their apps, you might also be able to use your voice to call a ride from Uber or Lyft, to pay someone through Venmo or to tell a fitness app to start tracking your workout.Siri\u2019s other new trick is Mac compatibility. You can now ask your desktop or laptop to search through your files or email, for instance.These are all fine improvements. But I am struck by the deliberate way Apple is rolling them out. One problem is that the new Siri will not integrate with all kinds of apps. It will be able to control only a handful of app types, including messaging apps, ride-sharing apps, payment apps and fitness apps. Yet Siri won\u2019t let you control music apps, for example \u2014 you can\u2019t ask Siri to play a song on Spotify, a feature reserved for use with Apple\u2019s own music subscription service.This limitation could be relaxed with time. Apple reps told me the third-party integrations they had outlined so far were the start of a new effort \u2014 one that could be expanded to new app types in the future. Still, the lack of music support was a letdown. It\u2019s hard to shake the suspicion that Apple is using Siri to give its own apps a leg up.Another problem is that Siri is still hopelessly tied to each Apple device. Siri on your iPhone doesn\u2019t really know anything about Siri on your Mac or Apple TV. On each device, Siri has different capabilities: On your iPhone it can call an Uber, if you have the Uber app installed, but Siri on your Mac can\u2019t. Siri on your Apple TV can search YouTube for clips of Stephen Curry, but Siri on your iPhone can\u2019t.For now, this isn\u2019t a big problem \u2014 you will learn what Siri can do on each device and adjust your queries accordingly. But that\u2019s a curious thing to have to do. If Siri is an intelligent assistant, why does she need to be tied to apps you have installed on your device? Why can\u2019t she call Uber from the cloud, regardless of which device you happen to be using?The device-centric view gets particularly limiting when you think about asking your assistant complicated questions. For instance, what if you ask, \u201cCan you see if there\u2019s a room at my favorite Seattle hotel for my wedding anniversary weekend \u2014 and can you book it if it\u2019s less than $200 a night?\u201dTo handle these questions, an assistant would need to pull information from multiple online services. For instance, booking that Seattle hotel would involve knowing your favorite place to stay, your wedding anniversary date and current hotel prices. It wouldn\u2019t make sense if that question worked only on certain devices or only if you had certain apps installed; ideally, it should work on any device.And that would be very useful. One of the frustrations of the era ushered in by the iPhone is app overload \u2014 there are too many apps to download, install and switch between to get anything done. A lot of these apps are of little use: You might tap that hotel-booking app once a year, so why does it have to sit there on your phone?But based on its developer conference, I\u2019m not sure Apple is. It\u2019s taking a more moderate app-based, device-centric path. Many of its voice features will be fine \u2014 useful, even. But it sure isn\u2019t pushing for a revolution.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "\u2018Hamilton\u2019 Inc.: The Path to a Billion-Dollar Broadway Show", "Date": "2016-06-08", "News": "Supported byThe show\u2019s cast members were invited to the White House and have become regular guests on late-night talk shows. Lin-Manuel Miranda, the musical\u2019s creator, was on the cover of Rolling Stone. Fans and enterprising line-sitters camp outside the theater around the clock, hoping to snag last-minute seats. Tickets are almost impossible to come by, except those resold at highly marked-up prices. And celebrities have streamed in: Beyonc\u00e9. Barbra. Bernie.All that enthusiasm means a lot of money for the men and women who brought the show to Broadway. Months ago, \u201cHamilton\u201d recouped the $12.5 million it cost to mount. It is now making an estimated $600,000 a week in profit, and every indication is that its touring productions, which begin in Chicago in September and in San Francisco next March, will be highly profitable, too.Even if \u201cHamilton\u201d isn\u2019t playing in Bangkok decades after its debut (as was the case with \u201cPhantom of the Opera\u201d), it\u2019s not unreasonable to expect that Mr. Miranda\u2019s unlikely hit will ultimately generate upward of $1 billion in sales.Forecasting the future for \u201cHamilton\u201d is risky, but the show\u2019s current fortunes, and the model provided by other shows, are instructive. Here, based on documents filed with government agencies and interviews with people familiar with various aspects of the musical\u2019s finances, is a look at how \u201cHamilton\u201d makes money and where that money goes.\u2018The revolution\u2019s happening in New York.\u2019On Broadway, \u201cHamilton\u201d is consistently selling out all 1,321 seats at the Richard Rodgers Theater and is currently grossing about $1.9 million a week in ticket sales. Simply by maintaining that pace, the show would bring in nearly $100 million a year (that\u2019s grosses, not profits). But there is reason to expect that figure to rise. In a bid to blunt profiteering \u2014 the widespread scalping of tickets at highly marked-up prices \u2014 the show may soon raise prices above the current ceiling of $475 for premium seating.\u2018We create. You just wanna move our money around.\u2019The hottest ticket on Broadway cost, on average, $172 during the week that ended June 5. But that\u2019s just what the initial purchaser paid. Many theatergoers pay considerably more by purchasing resold tickets on sites like StubHub, Craigslist and Ticketmaster. Those tickets are being listed for as much as $5,018 each, but most are sold for considerably less. The average resale of \u201cHamilton\u201d tickets on StubHub is roughly $872, according to a New York Times analysis, a markup of $700 above the current average original ticket sale price.For any given performance, roughly 13 to 22 percent of the seats at the Richard Rodgers \u2014 somewhere between 180 and 300 tickets \u2014 are available on the secondary market, according to The Times\u2019s research and interviews with ticket sellers. So for each performance of \u201cHamilton,\u201d ticket sellers and brokers are reaping roughly $150,000. With the Broadway cast putting on more than 400 shows per year, that means these sellers could reap about $60 million per year, just in New York \u2014 money the producers, investors and Mr. Miranda will never see.\u2018Tomorrow there\u2019ll be more of us.\u2019\u201cHamilton\u201d is moving quickly to take advantage of its moment. The Chicago production will begin just 13 months after the Broadway opening and run indefinitely. The PrivateBank Theater in Chicago, where \u201cHamilton\u201d will play, is much bigger than the show\u2019s Broadway house, meaning that even if ticket prices are somewhat lower, revenues could be strong, and that run could nearly double the show\u2019s weekly profitability.\u201cHamilton\u201d is also planning two separate North American touring productions: one beginning in March in San Francisco, and one beginning in Seattle in 2018. The theaters on the road are likely to price tickets lower than in New York, but many of them hold more people, so these two tours, on top of Chicago, could dramatically increase the show\u2019s current revenues and profits.The show\u2019s producers will soon announce a fifth production, in London, and if \u201cHamilton\u201d follows the path of other monster musicals, it will eventually explore the possibilities of productions in Asia, Australia or Continental Europe. Profits from foreign productions are difficult to forecast, and given that \u201cHamilton\u201d is a lyrically dense musical about American history, its appeal outside the United States, and in languages other than English, is uncertain.\u2018Can I buy you a drink?\u2019From T-shirts to CDs to books, fans cannot get enough \u201cHamilton.\u201dThe cast album has sold over 428,000 copies domestically, according to Nielsen. Track downloads have topped 212,000; on-demand streams from sources like Spotify and Apple Music have eclipsed 365 million. Together, that\u2019s roughly $11 million in gross retail sales.Many of those who manage to get inside the Richard Rodgers Theater visit the gift stand, which sells hats, magnets and mugs. And goodies are available even to those who can\u2019t get inside the theater. Bloomingdale\u2019s is selling \u201cHamilton\u201d apparel in New York, and plans to do the same in other cities as the show tours. Online, there is a thriving market for unlicensed \u201cHamilton\u201d tchotchkes: perfume, dolls and key chains made by enterprising fans.\u2018Who provided those funds?\u2019The vast majority of profits from \u201cHamilton\u201d is going to the producers and investors who put up the $12.5 million to finance the show.The producers are also entitled to 3 percent of the adjusted gross from \u201cHamilton,\u201d which amounts to about $52,000 weekly, or $2.7 million annually, from the Broadway production. (Producers commonly get both a royalty and a share of profits.)For Mr. Seller, it doesn\u2019t end there. His production company, Adventureland, is entitled to another 5 percent of net profits, or about $1.6 million a year, from the current production. Adventureland receives these so-called torchbearer points in recognition of his role in the show\u2019s development.The investors who backed \u201cHamilton\u201d \u2014 a group of about 100 people that includes Robert Greenblatt, the NBC Entertainment chairman, as well as the power publicist Ken Sunshine \u2014 split another 42 percent of the profits, or about $13 million annually, from the Broadway production. (The list of \u201cHamilton\u201d investors has not been made public.)Those are big numbers for the theater world, but they are likely to get much bigger in the coming years, as the show opens productions beyond New York.\u2018Why do you write like you\u2019re running out of time?\u2019Mr. Miranda, the show\u2019s 36-year-old creator, wears an unusual number of hats: He came up with the idea; he wrote the music, book and lyrics; and he is, for now, the star. That means he gets a salary (as an actor), as well as authorship royalties and profits that ordinarily would be split among multiple people. He is expected to leave the cast this summer and will then lose his salary (an undisclosed amount), but he will continue to receive the royalties and profits for as long as the show runs.He is likely to make at least $6.4 million from the Broadway production over the next year; his earnings will grow considerably when the other productions begin.Mr. Miranda is also the ultimate rights holder for \u201cHamilton.\u201d After the show\u2019s commercial life ends, he will own the rights for productions in regional theaters and schools, which can generate considerable revenue over time.\u2018I never had a group of friends before. I promise that I\u2019ll make y\u2019all proud.\u2019Mr. Miranda rewards loyalty. The director, choreographer and orchestrator for \u201cHamilton,\u201d as well as the show\u2019s costume, lighting and sound designers, all worked on \u201cIn the Heights.\u201d All of them \u2014 and the show\u2019s set designer \u2014 are entitled to royalties, and all are likely to make millions of dollars over the life of the show.Thomas Kail, the director, has known Mr. Miranda since the two were introduced after both graduated (a few years apart) from Wesleyan University. Mr. Kail helped develop \u201cIn the Heights\u201d and \u201cHamilton.\u201d He is entitled to 2.5 percent of the adjusted gross revenue from \u201cHamilton,\u201d or about $2.3 million a year just from the New York production. Mr. Kail also receives 1.5 percent of net profits, currently about another $470,000 annually.Andy Blankenbuehler, the show\u2019s choreographer, receives 1.75 percent of gross sales and 0.5 percent of profits \u2014 currently totaling $1.7 million or so annually.Mr. Miranda\u2019s musical partner, Alex Lacamoire, gets just under 1 percent of gross sales, currently about $790,000 annually. And the show\u2019s costume, lighting and sound designers \u2014 Paul Tazewell, Howell Binkley and Nevin Steinberg \u2014 receive between 0.37 and 0.5 percent of gross sales, currently worth about $336,000 to $454,000 per year.As with all of the royalty and profit-sharing arrangements associated with \u201cHamilton,\u201d the value of the creative team\u2019s cut will increase significantly when the productions in Chicago and beyond begin.\u2018We\u2019ll give the world to you, and you\u2019ll blow us all away.\u2019The details are still being ironed out, but probably the opening-night casts at the Public Theater and on Broadway, and perhaps participants in pre-opening workshops at the Public Theater, will share 1 percent of the profits from the Broadway production and will also share a portion of the profits of touring productions.The profit-sharing is likely to affect about 30 people, including not only actors and dancers but also stage managers. It\u2019s not clear how much they would get, but perhaps about $10,000 a year from the Broadway production alone. That is not a lot of money compared with what others are earning, but it is still significant to performers, many of whom work for relatively low salaries and have long periods between roles. (On Broadway, actors make a union-mandated minimum of $1,900 a week; the performers in \u201cHamilton\u201d are making more than that. But many performers spend much of their careers Off or Off Off Broadway, where salaries are considerably lower.)The \u201cHamilton\u201d performers worked hard to get a profit-sharing promise \u2014 after they were unable to negotiate a deal as the Broadway production was opening, they hired a lawyer to represent them. It took them eight months after the Broadway production opened to win an agreement; they had argued that it was not fair, given their contributions to the show, to exclude them from sharing in its success.\u2018Don\u2019t forget from whence you came.\u2019\u201cHamilton\u201d has proved lucrative for three others who helped along the way: Ron Chernow, a historian whose biography of Alexander Hamilton inspired and formed the basis for the musical; the Public Theater, the Off Broadway nonprofit that nurtured the show\u2019s late-stage development and presented its pre-Broadway production; and, most surprisingly, Luis A. Miranda Jr., Lin-Manuel Miranda\u2019s father.Mr. Chernow, who is the musical\u2019s historical consultant and its tireless champion, gets 1 percent of the show\u2019s adjusted grosses as a royalty \u2014 currently about $900,000 a year.The Public Theater, which famously lived for years off the profits from transferring \u201cA Chorus Line\u201d to Broadway, gets 5 percent of the profits and 1 percent of the adjusted gross \u2014 currently totaling about $2.5 million a year. The Public says it is putting most of the money into its cash reserves rather than its operating budget.In each case, the value of their share will increase as the show adds productions.\u2018The art of the trade. How the sausage gets made.\u2019Even before the profits or the royalties for \u201cHamilton\u201d are distributed, there is a more fundamental expense: the cost of putting on the show.Winches and chain motors are $3,200 a week.Dressers are $20,000 a week.And electrics and sound cost $28,000 a week.\u201cHamilton\u201d pays about $295,000 per week for the Richard Rodgers, a fee that covers rent as well as the house staff, musicians, stagehands and more.The show\u2019s cast and crew are paid about $220,000 altogether a week. Advertising costs a relatively low $80,000 per week, thanks to all the free publicity. But things like taxes, pensions, lawyers and equipment rentals add up.On the scale of Broadway musicals, \u201cHamilton,\u201d with its modest set and midsize cast, has moderate running costs. All in all, it costs about $650,000 a week to present the show on Broadway, or about $34 million a year. But it\u2019s proving to be one of the best investments in town.An article last Sunday about the Broadway musical \u201cHamilton\u201d misstated the point at which the show\u2019s performers began collectively pressing for profit-sharing. It was in August 2015, as the Broadway production was opening, not before the Off Broadway production opened.Ben Sisario, Alexandra Alter and Tiff Fehr contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Uber Rival\u2019s $28 Billion Valuation Shows Size of China\u2019s Ride-Sharing Market", "Date": "2016-06-16", "News": "Supported byHONG KONG \u2014 With more internet users than any other country and a fast-rising middle class, China is one of the most sought-after markets in the world.Recent fund-raising rounds in the ride-sharing market show it is also one of the most expensive.The Chinese car-hailing app Didi Chuxing said on Thursday that it had brought in $7.3 billion in its latest round of fund-raising, which included Apple, Alibaba, and SoftBank as investors. The new funds give the company a total of $10.5 billion in disposable funds, and put its valuation at $28 billion, according to a person familiar with the fund-raising.That Didi\u2019s valuation is now almost half that of the $62.5 billion valuation of its main rival in China, Uber, shows how much potential investors see in China. Yet the size of the cash infusions also underscores the market\u2019s difficulties.In part because of China\u2019s widespread blocking of foreign websites, the competition between Uber and Didi marks the first time in recent history a major foreign tech company has vied so intensely with a local Chinese business.In other markets the contest over ride-sharing has focused on regulation and technology, but in China it has been much more about cash, with the two companies spending billions. The most recent round has also pulled in Apple, pitting America\u2019s biggest tech company against America\u2019s best-known start-up, Uber, in a tricky Chinese market. Both see China as critical to growth.The fund-raising comes as executives from Didi and Uber have signaled that they are focusing on profitability in China.Since then both companies have been locked in a spending war. Though it has primarily taken the form of subsidies, both companies have also tried to develop technology specific to China, and have actively wooed both local and national government officials.Didi has focused on technology that better predicts car arrival times, given China\u2019s unruly traffic, while Uber has developed a commute function that links drivers with riders based on where they live and work.Although both companies have said they plan to dial back spending, the new war chests accumulated by each may make that hard. Didi has said it is profitable in half of the 400 cities it operates in, while Uber has said it is spending a quarter what it was spending per ride in China last year and providing four times as many rides.Uber continues to press Didi in smaller cities. Uber said in a recent news release it is now in 60 Chinese cities, and in Zhengzhou, a provincial capital in central China, Uber said it hit a million trips less than a month after it entered in late May.In its statement Didi said it had procured $4.5 billion in equity investment from Apple, China Life, Ant Financial and other existing shareholders like SoftBank, Tencent and Alibaba. China Merchants Bank offered a syndicated loan of up to $2.5 billion as a part of the fund-raising, and China Life offered $300 million as a long-term debt investment.Michael J. de la Merced reported from San Francisco.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Apple Developer Conference: A More Open Siri, and Other Upgrades", "Date": "2016-06-13", "News": "Supported byBrian X. Chen, Farhad Manjoo and Vindu Goel attended Apple\u2019s conference keynote in San Francisco and analyzed what matters about the announcements that Apple made.Apple announced:\u25a0 Improvements in the Apple Watch operating system.\u25a0 Changes in the operating system for Apple TV, called tvOS.\u25a0 A rebranding of its Mac operating system.\u25a0 An expansion of Apple Pay.\u25a0 Opening up Siri to developers.\u25a0 Improvements in photos and maps.\u25a0 Subscriptions through Apple News.\u25a0 Opening up its messaging service to developers\u25a0 A new interface for Apple Music.Here were the main points:That segmentation suggests Apple\u2019s worldview. This is a company that still sees the tech world as defined by separate physical devices. Sure, it will integrate these devices through some cloud-based features (including some new ones it showed today), but fundamentally each Apple device is its own, and the internet is merely the glue between them.That is a startlingly different \u2014 and, really, a kind of old-fashioned \u2014 view of tech, especially compared to the view that Google presented at its recent developer conference. In Google\u2019s view, the internet is the central operating system \u2014 it\u2019s the place where all your data and tech intelligence reside. The next era of the tech industry will be defined by which of these worldviews becomes dominantFollowing the footsteps of Amazon\u2019s Echo smart speaker, Apple expanded Siri, its voice assistant, by allowing third-party app developers to take advantage of voice controls. After Google\u2019s Photos app won fanfare with its automatic organization features, Apple announced that its photos app would have some smarter organization tools, too, like the ability to stitch photos automatically into video montages called Memories. In addition, Apple added some smarts to its Maps service, like the ability to find nearby points of interest such as gas stations \u2014 a feature long supported by Google\u2019s Waze mapping service.Apple executives have repeatedly said the company doesn\u2019t strive to be first: It prides itself on coming up with better solutions later. (The iPhone, for example, came out much later than previous smartphones.) The question is, does it pay for Apple to be late in improving its online services, which only get smarter over time?Apple essentially believes the future of the television screen will be driven by apps. Third-party apps could make the big screen smarter than the interface of standard cable boxes.With its new Mac operating system, called MacOS Sierra, Apple is putting the clout of its Mac operating system behind the Apple Watch. Users wearing the Apple Watch will be able to unlock their Macs without entering a user name or password.Apple also expanded Siri, its voice assistant, to become available in the Mac operating system. The move is a response to Google, which recently said it would expand its voice-powered virtual assistant to many products, including a chat app called Allo and a smart speaker called Home.However, it may not be easy enough to use to succeed in transforming online checkouts, where other services like PayPal have failed. Buying a product using Apple Pay on a Mac still requires you to authenticate the purchase by putting your finger on your iPhone \u2014 an extra step and extra device to pull out.The move helps Apple play catch-up with Amazon, which already lets third-party developers add capabilities to its smart speaker, Echo. Google also has said it plans to allow outside developers to make their apps and services work with its smart speaker, Home, due for release this fall.(It won\u2019t hurt the appeal to users that Apple is making emoji triple their previous size and automatically suggesting emoji replacements for words in messages.)Advertisement"}

Today, there are only six members, and four of them are graduating from high school this month.Though Mr. Balde\u2019s mind is sharp, he said that his physical health reflected his age and that his doctors had advised him to slow down.He still climbs the steep, curving stairs to his second-floor bedroom \u2014 only recently did he let his daughter have handrails added \u2014 and still drives to scout meetings every week.Mr. Balde joined scouting at 15, when pressured by his Portuguese-immigrant parents. His family had moved to the Ironbound, a Portuguese enclave, when he was 2.\u201cDad, I\u2019m 15, I don\u2019t want to wear those little knickers,\u201d Mr. Balde recalled saying in protest.But he quickly fell in love with scouting.So much so that when he proposed to his wife, Joan, he told her that scouting would always be a priority. Mr. Balde recalled Joan cooking spaghetti and meatball dinners on Sundays for his hungry scouts. She died 23 years ago, a few months shy of their 50th anniversary.For about 45 years, Mr. Balde worked for Artley Inc. in Newark, designing and building displays for trade shows until the company closed in 1996. For the next 10 years, he was a consultant. He stopped working at 85.The Boy Scouts could not say if Mr. Balde was its longest-serving scoutmaster, but in an email on Monday the group said he was \u201ccertainly one of our longest tenured scouting volunteers in our organization\u2019s history.\u201dEric Adams, the assistant scoutmaster for Troop 102 and assistant finance director for the City of Newark, praised what Mr. Balde had done for so many boys. \u201cYou would be hard-pressed to find someone who has trained more leaders,\u201d Mr. Adams said. \u201cBut he would never take credit for it.\u201dMr. Balde said he helped 43 young men become Eagle Scouts, the highest rank a Boy Scout can achieve.\u201cI\u2019m proud of all my boys,\u201d he said, then listed some of their accomplishments. \u201cI\u2019ve had dentists, doctors, lawyers and an undertaker.\u201dAnd at least one convict, he added, but there are always a few bad apples.Lucille Krutsick, 80, a Newark resident, has been a troop volunteer for more than four decades and considers the Baldes family.\u201cAs much as I know in his heart he didn\u2019t want to,\u201d Ms. Krutsick said, it was time for Mr. Balde to step down because of his declining health as well as the waning interest in scouting.Her two sons became Eagle Scouts while in Troop 102.One of them, Michael Krutsick Jr., 56, remembered Mr. Balde allowing the boys to learn from their mistakes and also credited the scoutmaster with instilling in him a desire to give back.\u201cInstead of saying, \u2018We need this,\u2019\u201d Mr. Krutsick said, \u201che taught us to say, \u2018We need this and I am here to help.\u2019\u201dBryan Aguilar, 17, who joined Troop 102 seven years ago, said Mr. Balde taught him to respect others and helped him \u201cform the young man I am today.\u201d He graduated from East Side High School in Newark on Monday and will attend Ramapo College of New Jersey in the fall.\u201cBecause of his age and because he has lived through so much,\u201d Bryan said, \u201che teaches us life lessons that my parents couldn\u2019t teach me because they haven\u2019t lived that long yet.\u201dReclining in his armchair, black slippers snug on his feet, Mr. Balde mirrored a picture on the mantel: a younger scoutmaster with a glowing smile and thick glasses. Around his neck was a medallion for the silver beaver, the highest honor an adult volunteer in scouting can receive.Citing the Boy Scout motto, he said, \u201c\u2018Be prepared\u2019 means be prepared with a smile.\u201dAdvertisement"}

But one of China\u2019s low-cost phone makers recently filed a patent complaint against Apple in the city of Beijing \u2014 and for now, it has won.With an appeals process ahead, the ruling is unlikely to have a major impact on Apple. Still, the action spotlights the growing number of cases of municipal patent offices in China backing local companies against larger, international brands.Apple said it had appealed, and a sales clerk at the Apple Store in the Sanlitun area of Beijing said on Friday evening that the store had received no instructions to stop selling the iPhone models and that \u201cit is business as usual.\u201d At the store, a handful of iPhone 6 models stood mostly unused as shoppers tapped on the newer 6s models at a nearby table.\u201cIPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus, as well as iPhone 6s, iPhone 6s Plus and iPhone SE models, are all available for sale today in China,\u201d Apple said in a statement. \u201cWe appealed an administrative order from a regional patent tribunal in Beijing last month, and as a result the order has been stayed pending review by the Beijing I.P. Court.\u201dThe Baili patent case pales in comparison to those troubles, though it underscores the day-to-day annoyances that can come with running a tech business in China.Once a local intellectual property office in China finds an issue of infringement, companies can decide whether to appeal the matter. At that point, the issue typically is litigated or resolved via a settlement of some kind.Vindu Goel contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

But both Mr. Trump and Ms. Clinton seem destined to view tech more skeptically.

{"Headline": "Buybacks by Companies Like Apple May Signal Danger, Not Growth", "Date": "2016-06-23", "News": "Supported byStrategiesBut Apple and the stock market would probably be in worse shape now if not for an important factor: Companies like Apple have been buying billions of dollars\u2019 worth of their own shares at a record-breaking pace, returning money to shareholders even as earnings lag.At the moment, corporate America is sitting on an enormous cash hoard. Many companies have been using the money in an epic share-buying spree \u2014 one that has increased in intensity even as earnings have declined. In the 12 months through March, operating earnings for the companies in the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index dropped to $854.9 billion from $989 billion, but buybacks increased to $589 billion from $538.1 billion. That is the largest total for buybacks ever in a 12-month period, according to a report from Howard Silverblatt, senior index analyst at S&P Dow Jones Indices.While Apple ranked second in buybacks to Gilead Sciences in the first quarter, it has been the undisputed king of buybacks over some longer periods. Apple spent $36.8 billion on buybacks in the 12 months through March, more than double the $16.6 billion spent by Microsoft, the next-ranking company. And over the five years through March, Apple bought back $116.6 billion worth of its own shares, followed by Microsoft with $45.7 billion, Pfizer with $44.9 billion and Oracle with $43.7 billion.A recent surge in buybacks may have been stimulated by problems in the stock market, which fell sharply at the beginning of the year. In the first quarter, Mr. Silverblatt said, \u201cthe pace of buybacks was partially driven by companies supporting their stock during the opening downturn.\u201d More than three-fifths of the S.&P. 500 companies bought back at least some of their own shares in the quarter, he said, and 139 bought enough over 12 months to reduce their share count by at least 4 percent.As a matter of simple math, reducing the number of shares by 4 percent will increase earnings per share by 4 percent, too, and will tend to bolster short-term prices.Buybacks are a critical part of Goldman\u2019s positive stock market outlook for the remainder of 2016: \u201cWe maintain our forecast that net buybacks will equal $450 billion in 2016 and remain the largest source of U.S. equity demand this year,\u201d the company said.Low and even negative interest rates resulting from the sluggish global economy and from the expansionary monetary policies of the Federal Reserve and other central banks have been enabling big corporations to borrow money cheaply, even when those companies\u2019 earnings have declined, and even when they have had no immediate productive use for the funds.Such maneuvers often produce good results for stocks over the short term. Over longer periods, however, unless earnings grow substantially, financial engineering like this will take you only so far.For now, buyback authorizations by American companies continue to increase, and there is so much cash on hand that the current trend can easily continue for many months. At some point, buybacks won\u2019t be an elixir for share prices. They will be a symptom of an overextended market.Twitter: @jeffsommerAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Tekserve, Precursor to the Apple Store, to Close After 29 Years", "Date": "2016-06-29", "News": "Supported byIt was the Apple Store in New York City before there was such a thing as an Apple Store.Before iPods and iPads and iPhones, before Apple started selling and servicing its devices out of a glass cube on Fifth Avenue, the eclectic Tekserve store on West 23rd Street in Manhattan was where customers went for upgrades to their PowerBook laptops or to have their computers fixed.But times have changed, Tekserve\u2019s managers said, and on Wednesday, they announced that the company was closing its retail and customer-service operation. The service center will remain open until July 31, and the retail store will close on Aug. 15. About 70 employees will lose their jobs, the company said.\u201cThis is a cultural shift,\u201d the company\u2019s chief executive, Jerry Gepner, said in an interview in his office above the store. \u201cIt\u2019s not a failure of the business. It\u2019s like this giant wave finally crashed down upon us.\u201dTekserve found its niche in an era when Apple had a much smaller slice of the computer market. Among many of Tekserve\u2019s customers then, Apple computers had a devoted following. \u201cIt was the cult of Mac,\u201d said Mr. Gepner, who, before running Tekserve, was a regular customer.He said that customers had gravitated to Tekserve to buy Apple computers, have them serviced or have questions about them answered at a time when computers were more cumbersome to use and help was not simply a Google search away. \u201cIt was also a gathering place,\u201d Mr. Gepner said, \u201cwhere knowledge was shared.\u201dWhile Apple\u2019s own stores are sleek and modern in appearance, Tekserve had the feel of a throwback, its shelves lined with old-fashioned radios and a soda machine where customers could grab a chilled Coca-Cola in a glass bottle. There was also a \u201cmuseum\u201d of Apple computers, with models dating back more than three decades, including a Macintosh 128K \u2014 the original Apple Macintosh personal computer \u2014 signed by Stephen Wozniak, the company\u2019s co-founder.These days, though, Apple has six stores in Manhattan, including one in Chelsea, not far from Tekserve. There is also a Best Buy store just on the other side of Sixth Avenue from Tekserve. And then there are the options online.Resellers like Tekserve, once among the few places where customers could get Apple products, have been the victims of the technology company\u2019s growth. But also, Tekserve said in a statement, swiftly rising rent has not helped.Mr. Gepner said that when he joined Tekserve in 2014, the owners asked him to see whether the diminishing retail operation could be saved. But, he said, the owners realized that a turnaround seemed unlikely. \u201cFor us,\u201d he said, \u201cthe trend wasn\u2019t going to reverse.\u201dTalk of the store\u2019s closing had circulated for weeks among neighbors and regular customers. Employees were officially told on Wednesday that the end was imminent.\u201cWe love our customers, and we love what we do,\u201d Mr. Gepner said. \u201cBut there comes a point where that doesn\u2019t make sense anymore, as much as we love it.\u201dThe company will continue with its corporate sales and professional services, as well as with an operation focused on small- and medium-size businesses, an area that has experienced growth, Mr. Gepner said.Outside the store on Wednesday afternoon, word had not yet reached many customers, who said they were disappointed. Alan Wolk said he had been coming to Tekserve for about 15 years, including once to repair a keyboard damaged by spilled coffee.\u201cIt\u2019s been here forever,\u201d he said. \u201cThese guys, they know their stuff. You can trust them.\u201dKerry Elson said she first came to Tekserve about a decade ago, when she was still working as an intern and trying to figure out how to use a new computer. She kept coming because she trusted those who worked there.\u201cI feel like this is my go-to,\u201d she said. \u201cIt seemed like they were on your side.\u201dAdvertisement"}

The aphorisms are sometimes lazy, the facts can be sloppy, and the studied cool \u2013 all the while insisting that \u201cI am the uncoolest person you will ever meet\u201d \u2013 can be grating. I also could definitely have done without learning about Mr. Garc\u00eda\u2019s weakness for \u201cstrenuous fornication\u201d and drunken romps in the Facebook broom closet.And yet, somehow, \u201cChaos Monkeys\u201d manages to be an irresistible and indispensable 360-degree guide to the new technology establishment.Hiding underneath the braggadocio and evisceration of professional nemeses lies the beating heart of a formidable teacher. \u201cChaos Monkeys\u201d is likely to attract headlines and interest because of the prominent names and institutions mercilessly described. This is unfortunate. Mr. Garc\u00eda may apologize for his pedagogical asides, but these actually form the true core of what is a remarkably learned book.He schools us in three domains worthy of close study.The first half of \u201cChaos Monkeys\u201d takes us inside the world of venture capital. After leaving \u2013 and litigating with \u2013 one early-stage tech company to start another, Mr. Garc\u00eda sells out to Twitter, only to immediately abandon his co-founders for Facebook. Along the way, we meet the lawyers, angel investors, venture firms and associated institutions \u2013 notably the Y Combinator, which plays an outsize role in securing financing from the most prestigious investors \u2013 that drive this ecosystem.The second half of \u201cChaos Monkeys\u201d takes place at Facebook, and it concerns the handful of dominant companies that have emerged from this start-up culture. These companies (in addition to Facebook, notably Google and Amazon), whose market values start at more than $300 billion, are approaching (or in the case of Apple and Microsoft, managing) middle age. In addition to contrasting their collective ethos with that of the start-up world, \u201cChaos Monkeys\u201d touches on the also-rans like Twitter who failed to break into this rarefied plane.Beyond the author\u2019s personal story, what connects the two distinct halves of the book is his area of actual domain expertise: advertising. Mr. Garc\u00eda was a Ph.D. student in physics at Berkeley before joining Goldman Sachs to model prices for credit derivatives. He moved to Silicon Valley to perform the same magic in valuing the attention of internet users. And it is the explosion of digital advertising that has fed the emergence of the most recent crop of internet giants. In the course of describing his path from ad-tech start-ups to ad-targeting product manager at Facebook, Mr. Garc\u00eda provides fascinating insights into the nature of the online and offline advertising worlds \u2013 both regarding what has changed and what has stayed stubbornly the same.Even where Mr. Garc\u00eda completely mangles the facts \u2013 as he does for instance in describing the mechanics of the Facebook initial public offering \u2013 he manages to draw multiple fresh insights that somehow feel directionally correct. And in contrast to the self-serving verdicts rendered on his allies and enemies, his broader conclusions seem well balanced. The world he inhabited, Mr. Garc\u00eda reflects, \u201cis no worse than traditional industry and politics, but certainly no better either.\u201dWhich brings us to the second reason \u201cChaos Monkeys\u201d is a must-read. It matters. Mr. Garc\u00eda is providing tools to honestly deconstruct a corner of the world that has amassed breathtaking cultural, economic and political influence, and not always for the good. Fully 60 percent of Harvard Business School graduates now go to work at companies with fewer than 500 employees. A fuller conversation is required before we rejoice that the invidious hegemony of Goldman Sachs, McKinsey & Company and hedge funds as the resting place for our best and brightest graduates has been replaced with early-stage tech companies.At the least, readers of \u201cChaos Monkeys\u201d will think twice before taking at face value tech leaders\u2019 high-minded arguments for refusing to assist our national security apparatus in fighting terrorist threats. Even in the area of advertising, important social and public policy questions are implicated.The greatest danger of \u201cChaos Monkeys\u201d is that it could suffer the same fate as many equally prescient cautionary tales: It is appreciated less as trenchant social criticism and more as a how-to manual. Such is the irresistible pull of Silicon Valley that I fear the manuscript will be pored over mainly for clues to getting a job at Facebook or having a venture selected by the Y Combinator. If that is the case, we all may want to join Mr. Garc\u00eda on his boat and just sail away.Jonathan A.

After a series of strikes by the taxi unions and the banning of UberPop in France, Uber eventually suspended its low-cost service in the country last summer.As part of the French judge\u2019s ruling on Thursday, Uber will have to pay a fine of $906,000, though half of that figure was suspended. Pierre-Dimitri Gore-Coty, the company\u2019s head of Europe, the Middle East and Africa, and Thibaud Simphal, Uber\u2019s general manager in France, must pay an additional combined penalty of $28,500.The two executives were convicted of deceptive commercial practices and complicity in operating an illegal transportation service. They were cleared of some related charges linked to privacy complaints.\u201cThe judgment does not impact our service in France today \u2014 which now connects more than 12,000 professional drivers with 1.5 million passengers \u2014 but we will appeal,\u201d Gareth Mead, an Uber spokesman, said in a statement on Thursday.Despite the French court\u2019s penalties, the fines were significantly less than what the judge could have imposed. Uber could have been forced to pay up to $1.7 million, and its executives could have faced up to five years in prison and a $340,000 fine each. French taxi unions had also called for the Uber executives to be barred from working in the transportation industry, pleas that were ignored by the French court.In the wake of Uber\u2019s regulatory troubles in France and elsewhere in Europe, the company has increasingly turned its attention toward new markets, particularly in the Middle East and Asia.Advertisement"}

Third-party antivirus and anti-malware tools can shield your computer to some degree, but inherent vulnerabilities in older software may leave parts of your system open to attacks.Depending on how many versions behind the current system you choose to stay, you may find some applications on your PC or Mac no longer receiving periodic updates from developers because the developers themselves have moved on to newer versions. Hardware manufacturers may also stop creating driver software that allows their peripherals to work on operating systems they deem too old.While newer features, better security and improved performance can come with a successful upgrade, upgrading to the latest version of Windows or OS X can be also a titanic aggravating hassle \u2014 and can lead to weeks of fussing with the computer to get it working as it once did. On the flip side of the compatibility conundrum, your older programs and devices may not function properly on the newer system unless their makers update their own software. You may have older programs that will never work on the newer system, which can be problematic if you depend on those applications in your daily computing life.In addition to breaking your stuff, an operating system update can also move things around on you, based on the new user interface and the way it organizes your files. The new system might even run like a turtle if you have an older computer.The learning curve becomes easier as you become more familiar with the new system. If you do not have any hardware or software incompatibilities in the mix, biting the bullet and upgrading should pay off with better overall security and a longer life cycle of program updates.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Amazon Unveils Online Education Service for Teachers", "Date": "2016-06-27", "News": "Supported byJust ahead of the back-to-school season, Amazon plans to make a major foray into the education technology market for primary and secondary schools, a territory that Apple, Google and Microsoft have heavily staked out.Monday morning, Amazon said that it would introduce an online marketplace with tens of thousands of free lesson plans, worksheets and other instructional materials for teachers in late August or early September.\u201cAmazon is very clearly positioning itself as a disrupter with this move,\u201d Mr. Patterson said.Amazon is joining other tech industry giants in a push to expand the use of technology in the public schools.Last year, primary and secondary schools in the United States spent $4.9 billion on tablet, laptop and desktop computers, according to a report by Linn Huang, a research director at the International Data Corporation, a market research firm known as IDC. Schools bought 10.8 million Apple, Google Chrome and Microsoft Windows devices in 2015, he said.Because its devices tend to cost more, Apple accounted for the largest slice of school computer sales, amounting to $2.2 billion, Mr. Huang said. By volume, however, Chromebooks \u2014 the inexpensive laptops that run on Google\u2019s Chrome operating system \u2014 have taken schools by storm, accounting for more than five million devices bought last year, he said.Even so, ed tech industry analysts said the growing market for digital educational materials, which Amazon is entering, is likely to prove much more valuable over time than the school computer market.Already, nursery through high schools in the United States spend more than $8.3 billion annually on educational software and digital content, according to estimates from the Software and Information Industry Association, a trade group. That spending could grow significantly as school districts that now buy physical textbooks, assessment tests, professional development resources for teachers and administrative materials shift to digital systems.In a phone interview, Rohit Agarwal, general manager of Amazon K-12 Education, said the new site was intended to make it easier and faster for teachers to pinpoint timely and relevant free resources for their classrooms.\u201cEvery teacher should be able to use the platform with zero training,\u201d Mr. Agarwal said. He added: \u201cWe are taking a big step forward to help the educator community make the digital classroom a reality.\u201dThe site for teachers is not Amazon\u2019s first education venture. In 2013, the company acquired TenMarks, a math instruction site. (Mr. Patterson of Owl Ventures is also a partner at Catamount Ventures, a firm that was an investor in TenMarks.)In March, the New York City public schools, the largest school district in the country, awarded Amazon a three-year contract, worth an estimated $30 million, to provide e-books to its 1.1 million students.In the school market, however, Amazon is competing not just with rival tech companies but also with established digital education companies and ed tech start-ups.Mr. Agarwal said the company\u2019s new instructional resources site would be able to differentiate itself by being more intuitive for teachers who are Amazon users and by offering compelling new features.\u201cWith the technology, content and expertise that Amazon has, we believed we could provide value,\u201d he said.On Sunday, Microsoft said that it was working with ISTE to help schools introduce and integrate technology in the classroom. The project includes training programs for school administrators, online leadership courses developed with edX \u2014 a learning platform created by Harvard and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology \u2014 and services to support schools as they adopt digital learning approaches.Google also introduced two new products for schools: Quizzes, an online form that teachers can use to give tests and automatically grade multiple-choice questions, and Cast for Education, a free Chrome app intended to promote class discussion by enabling teachers and students to share what is on their screens with one another.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Tripping Down a Virtual Reality Rabbit Hole", "Date": "2016-06-22", "News": "Supported byState of the ArtThis is going to sound like the tech-nerd version of one of those first-person People magazine essays about surviving adversity: You don\u2019t appreciate how much you need to see your hands until you can\u2019t.Your hands \u2013 they\u2019re always there. Even in the most immersive of media experiences \u2014 an IMAX movie or the hypnotic reverie of a darkened opera house \u2014 your sense of where your hands are is an ever-present comfort. Because you can see your hands, you can reach for the popcorn without knocking it over. Because your eyes aren\u2019t locked on the screen, you can check your phone to make sure your babysitter hasn\u2019t texted with an emergency.But then you don virtual reality goggles, and your hands disappear. So does the rest of the world around you. You are bereft, and it is very, very unsettling.This sounds obvious: The whole point of virtual reality is to create a fantasy divorced from the physical world. You\u2019re escaping the dreary mortal coil for a completely simulated experience: There you are, climbing the side of a mountain, exploring a faraway museum, flying through space or getting in bed with someone way out of your league.Getting completely submerged in a simulation is good for things like games, but for most media total immersion feels like a strangely old-fashioned experience. Because it leaves your body helplessly stuck in the physical world while your mind wanders, V.R. doesn\u2019t fit with the way most people work at a computer, watch TV or encounter many other digital experiences.Virtual reality is the opposite of a smartphone, a device that offers you quick hits of the digital world as you go about in the real world. Instead, V.R. is at this point an experience best left for the privacy of one\u2019s cave \u2014 a lonely, sometimes antisocial affair that does not allow for multitasking, for distraction or for the modern world\u2019s easy interplay of the real and the digital.\u201cI\u2019m a real proponent of being careful how we use it, because immersion is not free,\u201d said Jeremy Bailenson, the director of Stanford\u2019s Virtual Human Interaction Lab, a research center for virtual reality experiences. \u201cImmersion comes at a cost. It takes you out of your environment, it\u2019s perceptually taxing at times, and it\u2019s not something that we can use the way we use other media, for hours and hours and hours a day.\u201dPart of the problem is that the technology still isn\u2019t good enough. People at Oculus, the V.R. start-up that Facebook purchased for $2 billion in 2014, compare their Rift headset to the Apple II personal computer \u2014 one of the earliest incarnations of a device that would change the world. Eventually.The Apple II went on sale in 1977, but a couple of decades would pass before personal computers became ubiquitous. The earliest PCs were also very expensive (the Apple II sold for what would be about $5,000 today) and V.R. is no different. The Rift sells for $599, and the Vive goes for $799; both require a powerful desktop computer that will set you back at least $1,000.Both companies are working to solve some of the issues I had with V.R.In Oculus\u2019s demo room, I threw three-point shots in basketball, repeatedly punched a guy (and took some punches) in an unruly hockey game and passed some digital toys back and forth with an Oculus employee who was also wearing a headset.Compared with the lonelier, hands-free version of Oculus now shipping, the hands-on demo offered less of a split between what my body was doing in the real world and what my eyes were seeing in the virtual one.HTC\u2019s Vive is ahead of Oculus on this score. It comes with hand-sensing controllers that allow for digital manipulation, and its headset has a handy camera that provides an in-goggles map of the room around you, letting you find your chair and your keyboard without having to fumble clumsily for them.But even as the technology improves, V.R. is still something you have to get used to. It\u2019s unusual, in these days of multitasking, to plunge yourself completely into a media experience. You might want to tweet and snap while you watch a presidential debate or the N.B.A. finals. And you\u2019re probably multitasking even when you\u2019re watching something longer and more serious, like a movie.But V.R. doesn\u2019t allow you to easily direct your gaze toward anything beyond the media at hand. Once you\u2019re in it, you\u2019re in it; even handling a snack can be challenging. In a paradoxical way, the intensity of V.R. tends to limit its integration into your daily life.\u201cIn general we never put somebody in a helmet for more than about 20 minutes, and we give them frequent breaks,\u201d said Mr. Bailenson, of Stanford. \u201cBeing perceptually disconnected from the world for much longer may not be something a lot of people want to do.\u201dI\u2019ll take Mr. Wehner\u2019s word for it.But if V.R. isn\u2019t useful for movies and TV shows, and if it\u2019s kind of dodgy for porn, what good is it today? There are some great games on these systems, and there are sure to be many more during the next couple of years. There are also several useful experiences, like designing your Ikea kitchen in V.R.But if you\u2019re not a gamer and you\u2019re not looking for a new kitchen, V.R. is, at this point, just too immersive for most media. A few minutes after donning my goggles, I came to regard my virtual surroundings as a kind of prison. Yes, V.R. is a prison of fantastical sights and sounds and one that is at moments irresistibly exciting, but it\u2019s a prison nevertheless. And before long, it will leave you yearning for escape.Advertisement"}

Trump, two people briefed on the company\u2019s decision said on Saturday.Apple is the latest in a string of companies dropping out as sponsors of the Republican convention. Few have attributed their decisions directly to Mr. Trump, the party\u2019s presumptive presidential nominee, but some have privately expressed worries about having their products associated with the candidate and his ideas.Apple\u2019s chief executive, Tim Cook, has been a frequent target of Mr. Trump\u2019s because of the company\u2019s use of Chinese manufacturing and its fight with the United States government over the encryption of data on its smartphones. One of those briefed on Apple\u2019s decision said the company objected not only to beliefs Mr. Trump has expressed on trade with China and data encryption, but also to his comments about Muslims and immigrants.Mr. Trump has promised to build a wall along the nation\u2019s border with Mexico, has characterized Mexican immigrants as criminals and has vowed to stop immigration from Muslim-dominated countries as a counterterrorism strategy.Asked to comment on Apple\u2019s decision, a spokeswoman for the Republican National Committee said, \u201cWe are working with a variety of major tech partners who are focused on being part of the American political process.\u201dApple\u2019s withdrawal is not by itself a large blow to the convention. It typically donates equipment; its contribution in 2008, for example, was valued at $140,000, according to federal election records. But it adds to the parade of major companies, including HP and Microsoft, curtailing or eliminating their monetary support of the Republican convention.Last week, Bloomberg Politics reported that JPMorgan Chase and Ford Motor would not sponsor the convention.Apple was still expected to provide support for the Democratic convention, though it was unclear Saturday if that decision was final.Some major technology firms, such as Google, are still planning to support the convention in some fashion.Mr. Trump\u2019s presence at the top of the Republican ticket has created a seismic split within his party \u2014 among down-ballot candidates, who do not want to answer to his frequent controversies, and among donors, many of whom do not want to fund the party as heavily as they have in the past. Last week, Speaker Paul D. Ryan said that his endorsement of Mr. Trump was not a \u201cblank check\u201d and that he could rescind it.On Saturday, Mr. Trump cited the lack of support among other Republicans and took an unusual tack, threatening to stop raising money for the party and to self-fund his race.\u201cWe\u2019re going to beat Hillary, and it would helpful if the Republicans could help us a little bit,\u201d Mr. Trump said at a rally in Las Vegas, referring to Hillary Clinton, the presumptive Democratic nominee. He continued to criticize his party: \u201cI am raising a lot of money for the Republican Party, and there are a lot of beneficiaries of that. And I like doing it. But we have to have help.\u201dThe Trump campaign is relying heavily on the Republican Party apparatus to support his candidacy, in particular its field and data programs across the country, since he keeps a lean staff. Self-funding would require Mr. Trump to put up hundreds of millions of dollars, something he resisted for much of the primary race.\u201cIf the Republican Party, and I hope they all come together, because I want them to all come together, but if for any reason, they get a little bit like they don\u2019t want to help out as much, then I\u2019ll fund my own campaign,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019d love to do that.\u201dNick Corasaniti and Jonathan Martin contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Zen and the Art of Managing Smartphone Photos", "Date": "2016-06-01", "News": "Supported byTech FixIf your digital photos are a mirror of your life, they may also serve as a reminder that there is only so much you can control and that at some point you just need to let things go.That was the lesson I learned after trying to create a step-by-step guide to organizing and storing smartphone photos, based on interviews with professional photographers and a week of testing multiple photo-management services and gadgets.I spent days experimenting with neurotic tagging systems, tedious backup processes and album management, and finally turned to Brian Christian, a computer scientist and philosopher, for advice.The healthiest approach to managing photos, it turns out, is a Zen one: to not deal with them much at all.Mr. Christian said photo organization illustrates a computer-science principle known as the search-sort trade-off. If you spend tons of time rummaging for a specific photo, then sorting photos may be worthwhile. But if you hunt for a picture infrequently, sorting may be a waste of time.In other words, people need a photo-organization method that saves time \u2014 and that allows them to essentially throw out the need to sort and tag their enormous photo sprawl. So I tried several photo-management services and devices to determine what that method might be.Over a week, I tested three backup services with my iPhone photo library of about 8,000 images: Apple\u2019s iCloud photo library, Dropbox and Google Photos, which automatically take your photos and store them in the cloud. I also tested two data backup devices from SanDisk and Synology.My conclusion: For smartphone shooters, the secret to photo nirvana is to take a deep breath and let Google back up and organize everything.Google Photos quickly set itself apart with its smarter auto-sorting features. It scans your photos and organizes them in several ways. For one, it can detect the face of a person and group all the photos of that person into an album, which you can name. With photos taken within a short time span, like your trip to a beach over the weekend, Google Photos might create a video montage or an album with a label like \u201cA weekend in San Francisco.\u201d The service also managed to identify pictures of items, like receipts and food, and group them into their own albums with labels.Dropbox and Apple\u2019s photo services had auto-organizing features, but not the smarts of Google\u2019s service. Apple\u2019s app groups photos into collections based on when and where photos were taken; it can also organize photos by faces, similar to Google. Dropbox uploads photos into a folder labeled Camera Uploads and labels each file by the date and time it was taken.Another benefit of Google Photos is its free offering is the most generous \u2014 enough to let you try out the service thoroughly before deciding whether to pay. The service offers to store an unlimited number of compressed images at no cost. For full-resolution images, you get 15 gigabytes of free storage and can pay at least $2 a month for 100 gigs.In contrast, Apple offers five gigabytes free and thereafter charges at least $1 a month for 50 gigs; Dropbox offers two gigabytes of free storage before charging at least $10 a month for a terabyte.Anil Sabharwal, vice president of Google Photos, said the company built Google Photos to make it easy to keep, manage and share photos and videos. Apple and Dropbox did not immediately have comment.The iXpand device was deeply flawed \u2014 it tried to back up all my photos for six hours before the iPhone ran out of battery and the backup failed entirely. Synology\u2019s photo-management software backed up my photos quickly and had some features like face and location tagging, but organizing photo albums still required lots of manual labor.SanDisk said the issue I experienced was a known problem affecting a small number of devices and that an app update would be released next week to fix the bug. A Synology spokeswoman said that with its network-attached storage systems, customers could back up a broad array of media on a private cloud.In the end, Google Photos solves multiple problems: It handles organization, making the search-sort trade-off minimal. It creates a backup of photos, so you can free up space on your smartphone while safeguarding pictures in case the device is lost or stolen.Once all your photos are on Google Photos, they need not live on the phone. Unfortunately, there is no quick way to delete thousands of photos. I plugged my iPhone into a Mac, imported my older photos and checked the box that says \u201cDelete items after import.\u201d Then I deleted them all from the computer. (In the future, it will be easier to delete smaller batches straight off the phone.)What about blurry, unwanted images? The most important lesson of Google Photos is to stop thinking of the digital photo album like a physical scrapbook. With a traditional photo album, you would spend time flipping through pages before landing on the right photo.With Google Photos, you can treat it like a giant searchable junk drawer: You can simply open the Google Photos app or Google Drive, type in a keyword for what you want to see, pull up that photo and ignore everything else. You can make some changes here and there \u2014 like renaming or adding photos to albums \u2014 but otherwise, why bother?One caveat: The Zen approach does not apply to those with professional cameras. For professional photographers, some organization is a plus and Google Photos and cloud services are not ideal because large photos would take too long to upload.\u201cI put tagging up there with flossing and stretching: things you know you\u2019re supposed to do and they\u2019re really a drag to do, but you just get in the habit of it,\u201d he said.For the rest of us, there\u2019s another reason to not bother deleting photos in Google Photos: Google adds creative touches to images that you thought were previously unwanted. If you took multiple shots of a sun setting or your child smiling, for example, it stitches them into an animation.\u201cThe lower the cost is of searching, then the more one should ask the question of, should I be organizing this at all?\u201d Mr. Christian said.After migrating my entire photo library to Google Photos, my answer is a resounding no.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Apple Starts to Woo Its App Developers", "Date": "2016-06-10", "News": "Supported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Apple\u2019s iPhone would be just a well-made phone without the apps that allow people to personalize it with their favorite games, news, business, social and video services. Software makers need Apple, too: They badly want to be on the devices that people carry with them everywhere, especially as traditional websites and desktop computers fade in importance.When Apple\u2019s App Store opened in 2008, there were well under a thousand apps, and the relationship was obviously beneficial for both sides. But now, when there are more than 1.5 million apps fighting for attention in the App Store, the benefits for developers, particularly smaller ones, have become much less apparent.\u201cIs Apple coasting on its relationship and lead with developers? I think the answer is yes,\u201d said Colin Gillis, an analyst with BGC Partners. \u201cTheir app store is considered an unappealing experience by many people. Their rules are arbitrary, and they take a big slice of money from sales.\u201dAs the company prepares to hold its annual developer conference in San Francisco next week, there are signs that it wants to improve its relationship with app makers. Among the announcements expected at the gathering: Apple plans to finally give developers access to its Siri voice assistant so they can incorporate it into their apps.Big outfits like Major League Baseball have always been treated well by Apple. The league had an app ready at the 2008 unveiling of the App Store, and Mr. Bowman said he talked regularly with Mr. Schiller and Eddy Cue, Apple\u2019s senior vice president for internet software and services.Fanify allows musicians to live-stream concerts, with viewers dropping tips into a virtual jar to compensate them \u2014 \u201clike a street artist, but in an app,\u201d as Ms. Schuman put it. She planned a June 1 release and had several artists lined up to promote the app during its first few days. She submitted the app for approval 10 days ahead of time to allow plenty of time for review.Apple\u2019s initial response was quick, but Fanify ended up in an extended back and forth as it tried to address various problems. At one point, Apple raised a fundamental objection, saying that Fanify\u2019s method for tipping artists, which used the online payment services Venmo and PayPal, violated Apple\u2019s requirement that all in-app payments be routed through iTunes so the company could take its 30 percent cut.Ms. Schuman and her developer had to rewrite the app to force users to buy tokens that they could then use to tip musicians. The app was finally approved on Thursday, nine days after the first concerts were supposed to have taken place.\u201cIt ruined our whole launch,\u201d she said.Apple declined requests to interview Mr. Schiller or other executives about its relationship with developers. The company said in January that the App Store had generated nearly $40 billion in revenue for developers since it was created.Getting an app noticed is one of the biggest problems for a small developer. The search function in the App Store follows no apparent logic in displaying results, leaving most apps lost in the pile. Apple\u2019s system for choosing which ones to highlight on the front page of the store is similarly opaque.\u201cIt used to feel like a frontier town where lots of people bought apps and tried new things,\u201d said Phill Ryu, who helped found the software studio Impending. \u201cNow it feels more like a lottery ticket.\u201dWhen an app maker wins that lottery, the benefits are tremendous.Apple asked Dr. Tashman to keep in touch as he developed the app over the next few years, and LiquidText was showcased in the App Store for two weeks when the app was introduced last September. \u201cWe got a banner right on top of the App Store,\u201d he said. \u201cWe got 100,000 downloads in two weeks.\u201d When the iPad Pro was introduced in November, LiquidText received another round of promotion from Apple.The new search ads for the App Store will allow developers to buy attention if they are not lucky enough to get that kind of free publicity from Apple\u2019s editors. Although the ads will be available to everyone, it is unclear whether prime search terms will end up being bought mostly by big marketers. App developers, most notably game makers, spent $3 billion last year in the United States alone to promote downloads of their software inside Facebook, Twitter and other apps, according to eMarketer.Bryan Wiener, executive chairman of 360i, a digital advertising agency, predicted that airlines, retailers and video streaming services would eagerly pay for advertising slots in the App Store. \u201cSearch will be table stakes,\u201d he said.While overall app download trends favor a handful of top developers, Apple has made other moves to improve life for the smaller fry.The company is giving more guidance to developers about ways to market their apps, said Brian Mueller, who has been an Apple developer for three years. He makes the Carrot series of apps, including ones for weather, exercise and to-do lists.Apple is also more actively choosing what appears on the front page of the App Store, where popular, new and interesting apps are prominently featured. \u201cIt signals to users that the App Store is a place to check throughout the week,\u201d Mr. Mueller said. \u201cA lot of developers were asking and hoping for this.\u201dDevelopers say they still hope Apple will make more improvements. They want the company to continue to improve search in the App Store and let developers respond to user comments. They also say that communication with Apple is still largely one-way.\u201cYou can\u2019t fix overnight all of the grievances that piled up,\u201d Mr. Ryu said.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Silicon Valley Finds Trump\u2019s Disruption Unwelcome", "Date": "2016-06-01", "News": "Supported byPALO ALTO, Calif. \u2014 Donald J. Trump would not be Silicon Valley\u2019s first choice as president. Or its second. Or maybe even its third.The presumptive Republican presidential nominee wants to restrict immigration while bringing back manufacturing. He compulsively uses tech products like Twitter but is not in awe of the people who built them. He made his fortune the old-fashioned way, by going into the family business, in the old-fashioned industry of real estate. He\u2019s not the valley\u2019s kind of entrepreneur.Worst of all, Mr. Trump is revealing Silicon Valley\u2019s vulnerability. In recent years, technology companies have extended their enormous reach while becoming ever wealthier and more powerful. Yet Mr. Trump has paid no political price for attacking them, with broadsides in recent months against Jeff Bezos at Amazon, Mark Zuckerberg at Facebook and Timothy D. Cook at Apple.\u201cThere is some surprise among tech executives \u2014 or perhaps just na\u00efvet\u00e9 \u2014 that the tech mainstream is now a target,\u201d said Garrett Johnson, an entrepreneur and one of the founders of the Lincoln Initiative, which connects right-of-center tech workers.Support for Mr. Trump here may deepen. Brian Krzanich, the chief executive of Intel, was planning to hold a fund-raiser for Mr. Trump on Thursday night at his Atherton, Calif., house that included \u201ca full exchange of views,\u201d an Intel spokeswoman said on Tuesday.The Trump campaign just opened an office in Burlingame, Calif., south of San Francisco and on the northern fringes of Silicon Valley. One recent afternoon, two volunteers were running a phone bank. Trump lawn signs were piled up, as were T-shirts. Mr. Trump has no meaningful opposition in the California primary on June 7.\u201cI have great respect for Silicon Valley and all of the people in Silicon Valley,\u201d the candidate said in an email message through an aide.Add that paltry sum to the $16,420 that Mr. Trump raised since last summer from people who work in tech and it is still nowhere near enough to cover the cost of a year at Stanford. Hillary Clinton has raised $2.7 million from tech donors since beginning her campaign, while Bernie Sanders has raised $6 million, according to new Crowdpac research.Mr. Trump was largely self-funding his campaign. Now, however, he requires cash \u2014 and lots of it.\u201cOut of the millions of people who work in technology, from engineers to Uber drivers, just 52 have given to Trump. He\u2019ll need many more if he truly intends to build a world-class finance organization,\u201d said Mason Harrison, a Crowdpac spokesman. \u201cMitt Romney raised over $8 million from the technology sector in 2012. That\u2019s a lot of money to leave on the table.\u201dWhether those tech backers are out there, however, is an unsettled question.Scott Slinker, a 55-year-old entrepreneur in San Jose, Calif., gave the candidate $250 last summer. \u201cI know Trump\u2019s supporters are here,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re just not vocal. They don\u2019t want to be stereotyped and pigeonholed and labeled.\u201dIn at least some cases, this is correct. One employee at a software firm declined to speak on the record, saying it would be a bad career move for a Google search of his name to turn up any Republican connection, let alone one with Mr. Trump.Still, even Mr. Slinker says there is good reason for the lack of enthusiasm. \u201cSilicon Valley is an extremely disruptive place, but the one thing it doesn\u2019t want disrupted is Silicon Valley,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd so it\u2019s pushing back on Trump.\u201dEarlier in the primaries, Mr. Trump suggested boycotting Apple if the company did not help the government crack the iPhone used by one of the attackers in the mass shooting last year in San Bernardino, Calif.; clashed with Mr. Zuckerberg over immigration; and posted on Twitter that if Amazon \u201cever had to pay fair taxes, its stock would crash.\u201dBobby Franklin, the president of the National Venture Capital Association, thinks Mr. Trump will pick up support among tech people as he moderates his views.\u201cThe Trump we have all witnessed for the past several months is probably not the Trump we will all be thinking about as we go into the voting booth,\u201d said Mr. Franklin, whose organization does not endorse presidential candidates. \u201cA general election candidate has always been different than a primary candidate.\u201dYet a few weeks ago, after Mr. Trump\u2019s primary opponents all dropped out and he might have been expected to make conciliatory noises, he unloaded again on Amazon and Mr. Bezos. Mr. Trump said, among other things, that Mr. Bezos has \u201cgot a huge antitrust problem because he\u2019s controlling so much.\u201dMr. Trump\u2019s comments signal a turnabout from Amazon\u2019s experience under President Obama. The retailer helped instigate and was the major beneficiary of an antitrust case the Justice Department brought against Apple and the major book publishers. Jay Carney, a former press secretary for Mr. Obama, is now senior vice president for corporate affairs at Amazon. He declined to comment.The Obama administration was even closer to Google, drawing several staff members from the search giant, including Megan Smith, the chief technology officer of the United States.Mrs. Clinton is a closer fit with Silicon Valley than Mr. Trump, both ideologically and culturally, but she is not campaigning as tech\u2019s champion. Whoever wins in November, the tech community is likely to look back longingly at the last eight years.\u201cThat tech is now a flash point in campaign debates is a reflection of the industry\u2019s power and ubiquity in American life,\u201d said Patrick Ruffini, a Republican strategist who has worked with the tech industry. \u201cSilicon Valley will need to learn to expect that it won\u2019t be seen as a benevolent actor in every quarter, and prepare accordingly.\u201dIn other words, he said, \u201cthe era of Silicon Valley exceptionalism is over.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Trivia questions like this aren\u2019t easy. You\u2019ll need some crossings for this entry. I recommend 38D, 45D, 50D, 51D and 54D. That should be enough to get you going.

So it was a fun feeling to see the puzzle, see the clues, and not know what was going on \u2014 I\u2019m sympathetic to solvers who always feel this way about my puzzles, and excited for everyone who decided to stick with it. This one won\u2019t win over anyone who thinks there\u2019s too much trivia in my work (dear dissenters: 1A! \u2013 kidding), but it\u2019s a good example of how broad cultural knowledge and context clues can get you far.
