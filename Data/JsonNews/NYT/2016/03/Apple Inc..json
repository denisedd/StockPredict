{"Headline": "These Apps Promise to Encrypt Your Smartphone Communications", "Date": "2016-03-23", "News": "Supported byApp SmartThe case has raised questions about what means people might have to protect their mobile data, shining the spotlight on the many apps that promise secure emailing, messaging and more.Signal\u2019s users can send secure messages and make Internet voice calls with their existing phone number, and there\u2019s no need to set up an account. The app is straightforward to use, with large icons and controls and large, easy-to-read text.To talk, both parties must have Signal installed. And for an extra level of protection, which takes a little getting used to, both parties are shown a random pair of words that allows them to double-check that the other user is the right person. The technique brings spy movies to mind, but it\u2019s a strong reminder that you are taking part in a secure call.Threema delivers a similar service with a few more features. It also has end-to-end encryption, which is applied to all communication including text messages and files and images sent via the service. There\u2019s no voice call capability, but users can send voice messages. Both sender and recipient must have Threema installed.Additionally, Threema allows users to hold group chats and to pose a question as a poll to group members. There\u2019s no need to open an account to use the app, because each user is assigned a random ID that isn\u2019t necessarily connected to an email address or phone number.But at its heart, Wickr Me is a secure messaging app. Users can set an expiration time for messages, and it offers encryption for voice, text and video messages. A \u201cshredder\u201d function promises to securely erase all deleted messages and media from your device. Wickr Me also allows for anonymous use, so not even Wickr\u2019s makers know who its users are.The app\u2019s single purpose of delivering secure emails means ProtonMail is not the fanciest app in the world, but it\u2019s easy to use. The app works best when the sender and receiver both have ProtonMail, but there is a way to send encrypted messages from inside the app to more standard email addresses.All of these apps help augment the encryption that may already be built into your device. (It\u2019s worth checking through your phone\u2019s settings to familiarize yourself with its privacy and security features.)Some secure messaging apps may be misused, which is why many of them ask upon sign-up that you won\u2019t use them for illegal purposes. And remember \u2014 there\u2019s no such thing as perfect security, particularly if you lose your phone.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Apple Wins Ruling in New York iPhone Hacking Order", "Date": "2016-02-29", "News": "Supported byA federal magistrate judge on Monday denied the United States government\u2019s request that Apple extract data from an iPhone in a drug case in New York, giving the company\u2019s pro-privacy stance a boost as it battles law enforcement officials over opening up the device in other cases.The ruling, from Judge James Orenstein in New York\u2019s Eastern District, is the first time that the government\u2019s legal argument for opening up devices like the iPhone has been put to the test. The denial could influence other cases where law enforcement officials are trying to compel Apple to help unlock iPhones, including the standoff between Apple and the F.B.I. over the iPhone used by one of the attackers in a mass shooting in San Bernardino, Calif., last year.The government\u2019s view of the All Writs Act is so expansive as to cast doubt on its constitutionality if adopted, Judge Orenstein wrote.\u201cIt\u2019s important that a judge for the first time recognizes the All Writs Act doesn\u2019t provide the lawful authority the government has been claiming in these cases,\u201d said Esha Bhandari, a lawyer with the A.C.L.U., which supports Apple\u2019s position. \u201cIt demonstrates that when the government\u2019s arguments are put to the test, a federal court has decided they were not actually right.\u201dIn a statement on Monday in response to Judge Orenstein\u2019s ruling, the Justice Department said it would ask the judge to review the decision. Apple had previously agreed to help open up the iPhone in the drug case, and has complied with past All Writs Act orders, the Justice Department said.\u201cThis phone may contain evidence that will assist us in an active criminal investigation, and we will continue to use the judicial system in our attempt to obtain it,\u201d the Justice Department said.A federal judge has denied the United States government\u2019s request to open up an Apple iPhone in a drug case in New York.An Apple senior executive said Monday\u2019s ruling makes clear that helping to open an iPhone is a constitutional issue that should be taken up by Congress.Judge Orenstein\u2019s ruling stands out because the courts have largely been absent on the major questions of electronic surveillance and privacy of our day. While judges around the country have signed at least 70 orders at the request of the government compelling Apple to access data on phones, this was the first time that a judge and Apple have pushed back.The legal back and forth between Judge Orenstein, the Justice Department and Apple began last October, when federal prosecutors applied for a court order to force Apple to unlock an iPhone 5s seized by the Drug Enforcement Administration in a 2014 drug case, according to court documents.After federal prosecutors requested the order, Judge Orenstein argued in an 11-page memo last October that prosecutors were misusing the All Writs Act. The judge asked Apple to weigh in, and the company filed a brief that same month. In addition to agreeing with the judge, the company also said the request could create an undue burden and threatened to \u201csubstantially tarnish the Apple brand.\u201d\u201cThis reputational harm could have a longer-term economic impact beyond the mere cost of performing the single extraction at issue,\u201d Apple said in a brief.The government then called Apple\u2019s decision to side with the judge a \u201cstunning reversal.\u201d Saritha Komatireddy, a Brooklyn federal prosecutor, said the government\u2019s application in this case \u201cwas just a simple routine request for assistance in carrying out a valid search warrant issued by a federal court, as Apple has done so many times before.\u201dDuring the case, Judge Orenstein said he found it puzzling that Apple had not previously resisted the use of the All Writs Act, including in other cases where Apple had complied with the order.\u201cYou have had apparently 70 prior instances where you have not taken the steps available to you,\u201d Judge Orenstein said to Apple\u2019s lawyers during a hearing.Ultimately, Judge Orenstein argued that the government couldn\u2019t use the All Writs Act to ask Apple to help extract information from a device just because a different law, the Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act, or Calea, addresses the issue and does not include an \u201cinformation services\u201d company like Apple. Congress has been debating whether to amend Calea to include tech companies such as Apple, Facebook and Alphabet\u2019s Google.Still, the decision is not binding for the San Bernardino case, said Eric A. Berg, a litigation lawyer and special counsel with Foley & Lardner, who is a former Justice Department lawyer.\u201cFrom a technical, legal standpoint, it doesn\u2019t really have much of an effect in the California districts,\u201d Mr. Berg said. But \u201cif you start with public opinion, this is going to be viewed as a victory for the privacy lobby and a defeat for the government in that battle over privacy.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Valeant\u00e2\u0080\u0099s reliance on acquisitions makes the company\u00e2\u0080\u0099s true cash flows much harder to fathom and its preferred measure of cash flow is not based on generally accepted accounting principles, so it is not reliable.

SunEdison controls the yieldcos but does not own a majority interest. Appaloosa Management protested about the acquisition, asserting that SunEdison used its control position to force TerraForm Power into this deal. Then the price of oil collapsed and investors drove down the stocks of solar power companies. After TerraForm Power openly talked of getting out of the deal and a delay in completing SunEdison\u00e2\u0080\u0099s financial statements, a new ironclad merger agreement was written.

Jefferies saw its equities struggle, after problems with fixed-income trading and energy market exposure in previous quarters.

{"Headline": "In the Apple Case, a Debate Over Data Hits Home", "Date": "2016-03-13", "News": "Supported byNews AnalysisBut the national debate touched off this winter by the confrontation between the Justice Department and Apple over smartphone security is not exactly the one Mr. Obama had in mind.Mr. Snowden\u2019s revelations produced modest changes and a heightened suspicion of the government\u2019s activities in cyberspace. Because the issue now centers on a device most Americans carry in their pockets, it is concrete and personal in a way that surveillance by the National Security Agency never was.\u201cDiscussing the case with my friends has become a touchy subject,\u201d said Matthew Montoya, 19, a computer science major at the University of Texas, El Paso. \u201cWe\u2019re a political bunch with views from all across the spectrum.\u201dLike many of her friends, Emi Kane, a community organizer in Oakland, Calif., recently found herself arguing via Facebook with a family friend about the case. Ms. Kane thought Apple was right to refuse to hack the phone; her friend, a waitress in Delaware, said she was disgusted by Apple\u2019s lack of patriotism.After exchanging several terse messages, they agreed to disagree. \u201cIt was a hard conversation,\u201d Ms. Kane said.The novelist Russell Banks, who signed a letter to Attorney General Loretta Lynch on behalf of Apple, said he had spoken with more than a dozen people about the case just in the last week.\u201cIt\u2019s not just people in the tech industry talking about this,\u201d Mr. Banks, the author of \u201cAffliction\u201d and \u201cThe Sweet Hereafter,\u201d said. \u201cIt\u2019s citizens like myself.\u201dThat may be because the Apple case involves a device whose least interesting feature is the phone itself. It is a minicomputer stuffed with every detail of a person\u2019s life: photos of children, credit card purchases, texts with spouses (and nonspouses), and records of physical movements.Mr. Obama warned Friday against \u201cfetishizing our phones above every other value.\u201d After avoiding taking a position for months, he finally came down on the side of law enforcement, saying that using technology to prevent legal searches of smartphones was the equivalent of preventing the police from searching a house for evidence of child pornography.\u201cThat can\u2019t be the right answer,\u201d he said at the South by Southwest festival in Texas, even as he professed deep appreciation for civil liberties and predicted both sides would find a way to cooperate. \u201cI\u2019m confident this is something that we can solve.\u201dThe technology company has been locked in a major legal battle against law enforcement officials over privacy and security.But polls suggest the public is nowhere near as certain as Mr. Obama. In surveys, Americans are deeply divided about the legal struggle between the government and one of the nation\u2019s most iconic companies. The polls show that Americans remain anxious about both the threat of terrorist attacks and the possible theft of personal digital information.But despite the fears about terrorism, the public\u2019s concern about digital privacy is nearly universal. A Pew Research poll in 2014 found more than 90 percent of those surveyed felt that consumers had lost control over how their personal information was collected and used by companies.Now, people are beginning to understand that their smartphones are just the beginning. Smart televisions, Google cars, Nest thermostats and web-enabled Barbie dolls are next. The resolution of the legal fight between Apple and the government may help decide whether the information in those devices is really private, or whether the F.B.I. and the N.S.A. are entering a golden age of surveillance in which they have far more data available than they could have imagined 20 years ago.\u201cIt\u2019s an in-your-face proposition for lots more Americans than the Snowden revelation was,\u201d said Lee Rainie, director of Internet, science and technology research at Pew Research Center.Cindy Cohn, executive director of the Electronic Frontier Foundation, said: \u201cEveryone gets at a really visceral level that you have a lot of really personal stuff on this device and if it gets stolen it\u2019s really bad. They know that the same forces that work at trying to get access to sensitive stuff in the cloud are also at work attacking the phones.\u201dFor the F.B.I. and local law enforcement agencies, the fight has become a high-stakes struggle to prevent what James B. Comey, the bureau\u2019s director, calls \u201cwarrant-free zones\u201d where criminals can hide evidence out of reach of the authorities.Officials had hoped the Apple case involving a terrorist\u2019s iPhone would rally the public behind what they see as the need to have some access to information on smartphones. But many in the administration have begun to suspect that the F.B.I. and the Justice Department may have made a major strategic error by pushing the case into the public consciousness.Many senior officials say an open conflict between Silicon Valley and Washington is exactly what they have been trying to avoid, especially when the Pentagon and intelligence agencies are trying to woo technology companies to come back into the government\u2019s fold, and join the fight against the Islamic State. But it appears it is too late to confine the discussion to the back rooms in Washington or Silicon Valley.The fact that Apple is a major consumer company \u201ctakes the debate out of a very narrow environment \u2014 the universe of technologists and policy wonks \u2014 into the realm of consumers where barriers like the specific language of Washington or the technology industry begins to fall away,\u201d said Malkia Cyril, the executive director of the Center for Media Justice, a grass-roots activist network.That organization and other activist groups like Black Lives Matter have seized on the issue as important for their members. In February the civil liberties group Fight for the Future organized the day of protest against the government order that resulted in rallies in cities nationwide.\u201cWhen we heard the news and made a call for nationwide rallies, one happened in San Francisco that same day,\u201d said Tiffiniy Cheng, co-founder of Fight for the Future. \u201cThings like that almost never happen.\u201dMs. Cyril says the public angst about the iPhone case feels more urgent than did the discussion about government surveillance three years ago.\u201cThis is one of those moments that defines what\u2019s next,\u201d she said. \u201cWill technology companies protect the privacy of their users or will they do work for the U.S. government? You can\u2019t do both.\u201dMichael D. Shear and David E. Sanger reported from Washington, and Katie Benner from San Francisco.Advertisement"}

That should send antennas up. If that is the case, shaking up the executive suite is an odd decision. Maybe it means there is dissension in the ranks about whether to look for a buyer. That could explain the 12 percent fall in the stock price by midafternoon Monday.Either way, the current plan isn\u2019t working. The number of Pandora listeners has stalled at about 80 million, and prospects for expansion are dim. Because streaming is radiolike, the company can use music licensing rates set by Congress. Those only apply domestically, however, and international expansion may be costly.Instead, Pandora must negotiate directly with record labels. A deal with Sony/ATV Music Publishing is a good start. Spotify, however, already has users globally. It also just initiated one of its most comprehensive marketing efforts. Apple, meanwhile, is a deep-pocketed rival trying to build a competing service that caters to its hundreds of millions of device owners.Mr. Westergren, a musician himself who was primarily an evangelist for Pandora\u2019s Music Genome Project, may be able to speak the language of artists and labels more clearly. The company calls him a former band member and composer \u201cpersonally committed to advancing the careers of working musicians.\u201dEven so, starting a new venture and steering a more mature one require different skills. Steve Jobs managed both when he returned to Apple. Jerry Yang, on the other hand, had a troubled second stint at Yahoo that included rejecting a $45 billion takeover bid from Microsoft in 2008 that led the Internet company into years of strategic disarray. The jury is still out for troubled Twitter and co-creator Jack Dorsey, who was recently brought back as chief executive.It\u2019s not obvious how Mr. Westergren can or will turn around Pandora. For shareholders, it may just be the same old song.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Apple Encryption Engineers, if Ordered to Unlock iPhone, Might Resist", "Date": "2016-03-17", "News": "Supported byApple employees are already discussing what they will do if ordered to help law enforcement authorities. Some say they may balk at the work, while others may even quit their high-paying jobs rather than undermine the security of the software they have already created, according to more than a half-dozen current and former Apple employees.Among those interviewed were Apple engineers who are involved in the development of mobile products and security, as well as former security engineers and executives.The potential resistance adds a wrinkle to a very public fight between Apple, the world\u2019s most valuable company, and the authorities over access to an iPhone used by one of the attackers in the December mass killing in San Bernardino, Calif.It also speaks directly to arguments Apple has made in legal documents that the government\u2019s demand curbs free speech by asking the company to order people to do things that they consider offensive.\u201cSuch conscription is fundamentally offensive to Apple\u2019s core principles and would pose a severe threat to the autonomy of Apple and its engineers,\u201d Apple\u2019s lawyers wrote in the company\u2019s final brief to the Federal District Court for the Central District of California.The employees\u2019 concerns also provide insight into a company culture that despite the trappings of Silicon Valley wealth still views the world through the decades-old, anti-establishment prism of its co-founders Steven P. Jobs and Steve Wozniak.The technology company has been locked in a major legal battle against law enforcement officials over privacy and security.\u201cIt\u2019s an independent culture and a rebellious one,\u201d said Jean-Louis Gass\u00e9e, a venture capitalist who was once an engineering manager at Apple. \u201cIf the government tries to compel testimony or action from these engineers, good luck with that.\u201dApple declined to comment.The fear of losing a paycheck may not have much of an impact on security engineers whose skills are in high demand. Indeed, hiring them could be a badge of honor among other tech companies that share Apple\u2019s skepticism of the government\u2019s intentions.\u201cIf someone attempts to force them to work on something that\u2019s outside their personal values, they can expect to find a position that\u2019s a better fit somewhere else,\u201d said Window Snyder, the chief security officer at the start-up Fastly and a former senior product manager in Apple\u2019s security and privacy division.Apple said in court filings last month that it would take from six to 10 engineers up to a month to meet the government\u2019s demands. However, because Apple is so compartmentalized, the challenge of building what the company described as \u201cGovtOS\u201d would be substantially complicated if key employees refused to do the work.Inside Apple, there is little collaboration among teams \u2014 for example, hardware engineers usually work in different offices from software engineers.But when the company comes closer to releasing a product, key members from different teams come together to apply finishing touches like bug fixes, security audits and polishing the way the software looks and behaves.A similar process would have to be created to produce the iPhone software for the Federal Bureau of Investigation. A handful of software engineers with technical expertise in writing highly secure software \u2014 the same people who have designed Apple\u2019s security system over the last decade \u2014 would need to be among the employees the company described in its filing.That team does not exist, and Apple is unlikely to make any moves toward creating it until the company exhausts its legal options. But Apple employees say they already have a good idea who those employees would be.\u201cIn the hierarchy of civil disobedience, a computer scientist asked to place users at risk has the strongest claim that professional obligations prevent compliance,\u201d said Marc Rotenberg, executive director of the Electronic Privacy Information Center. \u201cThis is like asking a doctor to administer a lethal drug.\u201dThere are ways an employee could resist other than quitting, such as work absences. And it is a theoretical discussion. It could be a long time before employees confront such choices as the case moves through the legal system.The security-minded corner of the technology industry is known to draw \u201chealthfully paranoid\u201d people who tend to be more doctrinaire about issues like encryption, said Arian Evans, vice president for product strategy at RiskIQ, an Internet security company. But that resolve can wither when money gets involved, he said.An employee rebellion could throw the F.B.I\u2019s legal fight with Apple into uncharted territory.\u201cIf \u2014 and this is a big if \u2014 every engineer at Apple who could write the code quit and, also a big if, Apple could demonstrate that this happened to the court\u2019s satisfaction, then Apple could not comply and would not have to,\u201d said Joseph DeMarco, a former federal prosecutor. \u201cIt would be like asking my lawn guy to write the code.\u201dMr. DeMarco, who filed a friend of the court brief on behalf of law enforcement groups that supported the Justice Department, also noted that if the engineers refused to write the code, rather than outright quit, \u201cthen I think that the court would be much more likely to find Apple in contempt,\u201d he said.Rather than contempt, Riana Pfefferkorn, a cryptography fellow at the Stanford Center for Internet and Society, said Apple could incur daily penalties if a judge thought it was delaying compliance.The government has cracked down on tech companies in the past. A judge imposed a $10,000-a-day penalty on the email service Lavabit when it did not give its digital encryption keys to investigators pursuing information on Edward J. Snowden, the former intelligence contractor who leaked documents about government surveillance.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Foxconn\u2019s Deal to Buy Sharp Is a Test for Japanese Reform", "Date": "2016-03-30", "News": "Supported byBreakingviewsAnd fixing Sharp, the loss-making Japanese electronics manufacturer, will be a tough slog for Foxconn, the Taiwanese giant led by Terry Gou. But after botched beginnings, this transaction may just make history. It presents Exhibit A that Japan is capable of the sort of corporate reform critical to overhauling its economy.One month ago, Sharp and Foxconn, which is formally called Hon Hai Precision Industry, appeared to be at odds. Hours after Sharp announced a plan to sell control to various arms of Foxconn for 489 billion yen, or $4.4 billion, the Taiwanese company called a time out. It said it was still mulling over the details, including new material information about Sharp\u2019s potential liabilities.That explains the big drop in the headline price since. Foxconn will now pay $900 million less for its 66 percent stake. It will buy Sharp\u2019s shares at 88 yen apiece, a 35 percent discount to their Wednesday close \u2013 the classic definition of a \u201ctake-under.\u201d Moreover, Foxconn is buying new preference shares that will allow it to increase its stake over time.This is painful for Sharp\u2019s backers \u2014 and that is the point. It might have been possible to find an all-Japanese solution for Sharp by cutting a deal with the state-supported Innovation Network Corporation of Japan. But that might have just swept Sharp\u2019s problems under a rug. Instead, Sharp is going to the bidder with the most capabilities, and incentives, to make it a profitable and productive enterprise.It will not be an easy ride for Foxconn. The limited overlap between the two businesses will make it hard to cut costs at the Japanese group, which has forecast an operating loss of some 170 billion yen, or $1.5 billion, for the year through Thursday. Mr. Gou\u2019s bet is that by increasing his company\u2019s position in the supply chain of Apple, which uses Sharp screens on its devices, Foxconn can more effectively revive the ailing group\u2019s fortunes.Either way, the signal sent by that Foxconn\u2019s takeover of a century-old stalwart of Japan Inc. is immediate. Revitalizing Japan\u2019s economy after decades of stagnation, and in the face of a shrinking population, will require firms to become more productive and less protected from competition. In this respect, Sharp is the first major test of Japan\u2019s ability, and willingness, to meet that challenge.Advertisement"}

When Alexa reorders popcorn for you, or calls an Uber car for you, when your children start asking Alexa to add Popsicles to the grocery list, you start to want pretty much everything else in life to be Alexa-enabled, too.In this way, Amazon has found a surreptitious way to bypass Apple and Google \u2014 the reigning monarchs in the smartphone world \u2014 with a gadget that has the potential to become a dominant force in the most intimate of environments: our homes.Scot Wingo, the chairman of ChannelAdvisor, an e-commerce consulting firm, said the early signs suggested that the Echo was on a path to become Amazon\u2019s next $1 billion business.\u201cIt\u2019s one of the most sold-out things that I see on Amazon,\u201d Mr. Wingo said. \u201cIt\u2019s an unusual thing for Amazon to be out of something, but for the Echo, it\u2019s usually in stock just for a couple weeks before it goes out of stock for a few days \u2014 so it feels like they\u2019re having trouble making enough of the devices.\u201d Mr. Wingo noted the Echo, which Amazon sells for $180 only through its own site, was selling for $200 to $300 on eBay.During an interview at a media event last week, Dave Limp, Amazon\u2019s senior vice president for devices, said the company created the Echo because it had seen interesting possibilities arising out of advances in microphone technology, speech recognition and cloud connectivity. Amazon\u2019s engineers spent years perfecting the device\u2019s unusual capabilities. Unlike competing assistants, the Echo can be activated hands-free from far across the room (Siri only works from a couple of feet away), and it can decipher your voice in noisy environments, even when it\u2019s playing music.Amazon also worked to make sure the device responded very quickly. \u201cEarly on in the product, to play music took eight or nine seconds, and it\u2019s just unusable when it\u2019s like that,\u201d Mr. Limp said. \u201cNow it\u2019s often 1,000 milliseconds or 1,200 milliseconds.\u201dThe speed makes a crucial difference. Compared with the trudge of chatting with Siri, speaking to Alexa feels natural, closer to speaking to a human than a machine \u2014 and even when it gets your request wrong, which in your early days with the device will happen often, it doesn\u2019t feel like you have paid a huge penalty for trying.More important, just like the early iPhone, Amazon has managed to turn the Echo into the center of a new ecosystem. Developers are flocking to create voice-controlled apps for the device, or skills, as Amazon calls them. There are now more than 300 skills for the Echo, from the trivial \u2014 there is one to make Alexa produce rude body sounds on command \u2014 to the pretty handy. It can tell you transit schedules, start a seven-minute workout, read recipes, do math and conversions, and walk you through adventure games, among other possibilities.Makers of digital home devices like Nest are also rushing to make their products compatible with the Echo. Alexa can now control your Internet-connected lights, home thermostats and a variety of other devices. Hardware makers can also add Alexa\u2019s brain into their own devices, so soon you won\u2019t need an Echo to consult with Alexa \u2014 you could find it in your toaster, your refrigerator or your car.The Echo also ties in to Amazon\u2019s main business, its retail store. When you tell it to reorder popcorn, it gets your order through Amazon, of course. Still, Mr. Wingo noted that Amazon had so far kept the platform relatively open \u2014 other retailers and product manufacturers are free to build their own apps that will allow for interactions with their stores.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Apple May Be Willing to Risk Contempt Charge", "Date": "2016-03-21", "News": "Supported byWhite Collar WatchParents are known at times to deliver an ultimatum to a recalcitrant child by saying, \u201cDo this, or else!\u201d The question is what that the frequently undelivered punishment may actually be.When a case is in court, the judge can hold a party in contempt as the \u201cor else\u201d for refusing to comply with an order. But how far can a court go in imposing sanctions for contempt?That question may arise for Carl Ferrer, the chief executive of Backpage.com, an advertising website that has been identified for its connections to possible sex trafficking. Mr. Ferrer is in a fight with the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations for not complying with a subpoena.That distinction is crucial because if the contempt is deemed criminal, then the person receives the usual array of constitutional protections afforded in any prosecution, such as a right to a jury trial and the requirement that guilt be proven beyond a reasonable doubt, before any punishment can be imposed.Civil contempt, on the other hand, entails fewer procedural requirements, so that a judge can sanction a person who refuses to comply without undertaking a full-scale trial. That can result in being incarcerated for an extended period, with no finding of guilt.Backpage.com asserts that the First Amendment protects it from having to submit all the documents subpoenaed by the subcommittee because it engages in advertising, which is a category of commercial speech. Mr. Ferrer may be willing to defy a court order to vindicate the principle of free speech, as other journalists have done.Apple is scheduled to be in court on Tuesday to challenge an order that it help unlock the iPhone. If it loses the fight, the question is whether the company will decide to be held in contempt to uphold its position that cooperating would create a dangerous precedent.In its most recent brief filed last week in the Federal District Court for the Central District of California, the company argued that \u201cthe government seeks to commandeer Apple to design, create, test and validate a new operating system that does not exist, and that Apple believes \u2013 with overwhelming support from the technology community and security experts \u2013 is too dangerous to create.\u201d That does not indicate any willingness to do the government\u2019s bidding, even if the judge tells Apple to do so.Whether the company\u2019s engineers, responsible for creating the high level of encryption in its devices, would be willing to design the workaround that would unlock the phone could present an additional hurdle to compliance. If they will not, then the company may have no choice but to defy an order. Then the court would have to decide whether Apple can be held responsible for the conduct of its employees.Unlike an individual who can be sent to jail, if Apple were it to be held in civil contempt, it would face only a fine. Coming up with a monetary penalty large enough to have any real impact on a company as big and profitable as Apple could be difficult to achieve.Whatever the merits of the Justice Department\u2019s argument to unlock the iPhone, there will be an issue about whether the court can effectively coerce Apple into providing the assistance demanded.It may be that there is no effective \u201cor else\u201d when taking on the world\u2019s most valuable company, especially one that is willing to take a defiant position that enhances its popularity.An earlier version of a picture caption with this article misstated the given name of Apple\u2019s chief executive. He is Timothy D. Cook, not Tom Cook.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Rev. Robert Palladino, Scribe Who Shaped Apple\u2019s Fonts, Dies at 83", "Date": "2016-03-04", "News": "Supported byBecause of a Trappist monk, Apple computer displays look the way they do today.As a Trappist brother, Father Palladino learned his art in silence, honed it over years of study and eventually, on leaving his order, taught it to others.Into that world burst a young college dropout named Steve Jobs.It is a coincidence no less exquisite than Father Palladino\u2019s finest calligraphy that \u201cSilicon Valley\u2019s future most famous screamer studied with a monk who spent years taking a vow of silence,\u201d as The Hollywood Reporter wrote shortly after Mr. Jobs\u2019s death in 2011.A character based on Father Palladino, played by the strapping young actor William Mapother, appears in \u201cJobs,\u201d the 2013 Hollywood film starring Ashton Kutcher. To reporters who asked Father Palladino whether he planned to see the film, he replied, characteristically, that he saw few movies of any kind.An authority on the history, structure and aesthetics of scripts from antiquity to the present, Father Palladino taught calligraphy at Reed College in Portland, Ore., from 1969 until his retirement, in 1984.\u201cTen years later, when we were designing the first Macintosh computer, it all came back to me. And we designed it all into the Mac. It was the first computer with beautiful typography. If I had never dropped in on that single course in college, the Mac would have never had multiple typefaces or proportionally spaced fonts. And since Windows just copied the Mac, it\u2019s likely that no personal computer would have them.\u201dAsked about his famous charge in a 2013 interview with The Catholic Sentinel, an Oregon publication, Father Palladino recalled, \u201cHe was most pleasant.\u201dIn Father Palladino\u2019s hands, however, calligraphy was about far more than mere beautiful letters: It was about the ways those letters can be coaxed to nestle companionably together to make words, and how those words in turn can be assembled to form a meaningful text.The work was, for him, the logical culmination of a fascination with the art of the written word that had begun in boyhood.The youngest of eight children, Robert had the opportunity to observe the handwriting of seven siblings before him, and he saw that it was good. He grew fascinated, he later said, by the sublime marriage of form and function that writing embodied, especially when it came to communicating the word of God.In 1950, at 17, he joined a Trappist order in Pecos, N.M. He received his early calligraphic training under the monastery\u2019s scribe.In 1955, after years of farming the unforthcoming New Mexico soil, the monastery moved to the Willamette Valley in Oregon. There, besides tending its orchards, Brother Robert served as the monastery\u2019s choirmaster, ran its book bindery and became its principal scribe.He was ordained a priest in 1958. But the reforms of Vatican II (1962-65) \u2014 including the dissolution of monastic silence, the supplanting of Gregorian chant by vernacular music and the replacement of Latin by modern languages \u2014 discomforted him, and in 1968 he left the monastery.\u201cYou cannot like that way of life unless you are completely enamored of it,\u201d Father Palladino, recalling his Trappist days, said in an unpublished memoir, written \u2014 unsurprisingly \u2014 entirely by hand. \u201cWhen it changed, I could no longer dedicate myself to it. It no longer satisfied my longing for union with God.\u201dDispensed from his priestly vows by Pope Paul VI, Mr. Palladino married Catherine Halverson, the principal clarinetist of the Portland Symphony, in 1969.Their son, Eric, is his only immediate survivor. Father Palladino\u2019s death, at his home in Sandy, Ore., was announced by Reed College.Catherine Palladino died in 1987. In 1995 Father Palladino was readmitted to the priesthood, serving in Oregon parishes. He also taught calligraphy at Portland State University, the Pacific Northwest College of Art and elsewhere.Though Father Palladino demonstrably influenced Mr. Jobs, the converse cannot be said. To the end of his life, Father Palladino never owned, or even once used, a computer.\u201cI have my hand,\u201d he would say, \u201cand I have my pen. That\u2019s it.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Apple Is Rolling Up Backers in iPhone Privacy Fight Against F.B.I.", "Date": "2016-03-03", "News": "Supported byThe extraordinary show of support for Apple from the tech companies, including many rivals, underscores how high the stakes are for the industry with the case, in which the authorities are demanding Apple\u2019s help to break into an iPhone used by a gunman in a terrorist attack in San Bernardino, Calif., last year.In all, around 40 companies and organizations, along with several dozen individuals, submitted more than a dozen briefs this week to the Federal District Court for the District of Central California, challenging every legal facet of the government\u2019s case, like its free speech implications, the importance of encryption and concerns about government overreach.\u201cThese companies, which are often fierce competitors, have joined together to voice concern about the attempted government overreach in this case, which threatens the integrity and security of their products and privacy rights of consumers in general,\u201d said Neal Katyal, a lawyer at Hogan Lovells for the tech companies and a former acting solicitor general of the United States.Edward J. McAndrew, a lawyer at Ballard Spahr who is not involved in the Apple matter, said it was highly unusual to see a flood of briefs by so many parties this early in a case. He called the outpouring \u201cSupreme Court-level advocacy\u201d and said the campaign was intended to have influence beyond the court with legislators and others.\u201cThis is a show of force,\u201d said Mr. McAndrew, a former federal prosecutor who focused on online crimes. \u201cThis is a battle for public opinion.\u201dBruce Sewell, Apple\u2019s general counsel, said on Wednesday that the company was \u201chumbled by the outpouring of support.\u201dA group of Internet companies submitted this court brief supporting Apple in the case in which the government is seeking Apple\u2019s help to break into an iPhone used by a gunman in the San Bernardino terrorist attack.In the brief on Thursday from Amazon, Microsoft and others, the tech companies said they shared the public\u2019s outrage over the \u201cheinous act of terrorism\u201d in San Bernardino, but said they were united in the view that the government\u2019s case exceeded the boundaries of existing law and would hurt Americans\u2019 security.In the filing from the group that includes Twitter and LinkedIn, the companies said the government \u201cseeks unbounded authority to compel Apple to design software that does not currently exist and that will circumvent and undermine security measures intended to protect its users\u2019 data.\u201d\u201cWe\u2019re facing a very big question as a country, industry and a world about what privacy will look like in the digital era,\u201d said Aaron Levie, the chief executive of the data storage company Box, which signed on to the brief with Amazon, Google and others. \u201cThere is a global impact for these tech companies if we don\u2019t land on the right side of having a strong framework for how companies deal with security and these kinds of requests in the digital age.\u201dApart from the tech companies, seven prominent security experts and 32 law professors signed on to joint briefs on Thursday. Several industry trade organizations and digital rights groups submitted their own filings this week.The technology company has been locked in a major legal battle against law enforcement officials over privacy and security.Some echoed Apple\u2019s slippery slope argument that opening up one iPhone would lead to a domino effect from governments worldwide. The Media Institute, a nonprofit research foundation that focuses on communications policy, warned in its filing that the court\u2019s order could be \u201cbe applied against media companies as government authorities seek to acquire access to confidential information stored on mobile devices used by journalists.\u201dThe support for Apple was a torrent compared with the stream of filings backing the Justice Department in the case. Among the staunchest supporters on the side of government were six people whose family members were killed in the California attack.\u201cBroader questions about the fate of smartphone encryption and data privacy can be saved for another day and another forum,\u201d the families wrote in a brief. \u201cThis case certainly presents the conditions \u2014 a mass murder by terrorists implicating national security interest \u2014 where requiring Apple\u2019s technical assistance is at its apex.\u201dStephen G. Larson, the lawyer representing the victims\u2019 families, said he was frustrated that Apple was drawing a line in the sand \u201cover a phone that didn\u2019t even belong to the terrorist and that they have permission to unlock.\u201d The iPhone of the San Bernardino attacker, Syed Rizwan Farook, was issued by his employer.\u201cSo many of Apple\u2019s arguments are red herrings because this is not about privacy more than any other search in a criminal investigation is about privacy,\u201d Mr. Larson said. \u201cThat is scaremongering and that is false.\u201dA handful of law enforcement groups also filed briefs supporting the government\u2019s position, including a joint one from the Federal Law Enforcement Officers Association, the Association of Prosecuting Attorneys and the National Sheriffs\u2019 Association.Those groups listed several instances when iPhone data was an essential piece of a criminal case, including child pornography and sex trafficking cases. They argued that criminals were moving to iPhones because of Apple\u2019s refusal to help the government and that the company was making data extraction from its products impossible.\u201cIf Apple can refuse lawful court orders to reasonably assist law enforcement, public safety will suffer,\u201d the trade groups wrote.Not all family members of San Bernardino victims sided with the government. This week, Salihin Kondoker, whose wife, Anies, was shot three times but survived the attack, wrote a letter to the court saying he thought there was little valuable information on the iPhone used by the gunman. Mr. Kondoker said Apple\u2019s fight was about something bigger than one phone.\u201cThey are worried that this software the government wants them to use will be used against millions of other innocent people,\u201d he wrote. \u201cI share their fear.\u201dNick Wingfield reported from Seattle, and Katie Benner from San Francisco.

{"Headline": "Apple\u2019s Modest Product Upgrades Take Back Seat to Worries on iPhone Encryption", "Date": "2016-03-21", "News": "Supported byCUPERTINO, Calif. \u2014 Apple held one of its regular product showcases on Monday, but this time the products did not take center stage.In a news conference at Apple\u2019s Cupertino, Calif., headquarters, Mr. Cook stressed that the company would stand fast. \u201cWe need to decide as a nation how much power the government should have over our data and over our privacy,\u201d Mr. Cook said. \u201cThis is an issue that impacts all of us, and we will not shrink from this responsibility.\u201dHe said that Apple believed it had an obligation to help protect its users\u2019 data. That belief eventually prompted Apple to fight the Justice Department\u2019s demand to help the government crack the encryption on the iPhone used by a terrorist in last year\u2019s California attack.Compared to that high-stakes contest \u2014 which has broad implications for the technology industry, consumers and law enforcement \u2014 Apple\u2019s new products were small ball.The company introduced smaller versions of its flagship iPhone and iPad devices, hoping to eke out more sales growth by filling gaps in its product lineup.The new devices, the iPhone SE and a 9.7-inch iPad Pro, represent a return to the form factors that prevailed before Apple supersized its smartphones in 2014 and added the large, business-oriented iPad Pro last year.\u201cIt\u2019s clear that there is still some subset of the iPhone population that prefers a smaller phone,\u201d said Jan Dawson, chief analyst of Jackdaw Research, an independent consulting firm.Greg Joswiak, an Apple executive, said on stage that the company sold more than 30 million four-inch iPhones last year, and many iPhone users have been begging the company to update its phones of that size.So Apple upgraded the components of its new four-inch phone to largely match the speed and features of its flagship iPhone 6s, but at a lower price, starting at $399.Apple, which has a higher market value than any other company, is now so big that it is difficult for the company to come up with new products to drive a new wave of purchases. Its premium pricing \u2014 its larger phones typically run $650 or more \u2014 has also left it vulnerable to cheaper handsets that run on Google\u2019s Android software.In Apple\u2019s first fiscal quarter, which ended on Dec. 26, its revenue grew just 2 percent, and the company has offered a cautious forecast for the year.The lack of must-have new features in Apple\u2019s recent products has hurt sales growth, as many customers decided their older models were good enough and postponed upgrades, Mr. Dawson said.\u201cIn a way, you see both devices that Apple is launching on Monday as drivers of an upgrade cycle,\u201d he said.Apple certainly hopes that fans of its four-inch phones will upgrade to the new iPhone SE, which packs a faster computer chip, a better camera, and Apple\u2019s Touch ID and payment technology into the same four-inch case as the aging iPhone 5S.The new 9.7-inch iPad Pro brings some of the features of last year\u2019s 12.9-inch iPad Pro, including a stylus, a keyboard and four speakers, to a tablet the size of the consumer-oriented 9.7-inch iPad Air 2. The new Pro will start at $599, and Apple also cut the price of the Air 2 by $100 to start at $399.The iPad Pros are particularly aimed at the hundreds of millions of users of old personal computers that run Microsoft Windows who might be looking to replace them, said Philip Schiller, Apple\u2019s senior vice president of worldwide marketing.Apple also reduced the price of the Apple Watch by $50, to $299, and introduced new woven nylon wristbands for the device. More than one-third of Watch owners have more than one band, Mr. Cook said.Analysts say sales have been modest for the watch, which works as a companion to the iPhone. The price cut might encourage more people to give it a try. But Apple also acknowledges that the smartwatch category is in its infancy and it may take several more generations of the device before it really catches on.Apple also touted the iPhone\u2019s potential usefulness in medical research and personal medical monitoring. It introduced new software on Monday to help developers create apps for both purposes, showcasing as an example a large project to study people with Parkinson\u2019s disease.Even then, Apple stressed its commitment to protecting customer data, saying that any sharing of health information would require a customer\u2019s explicit permission.\u201cNothing is more sensitive than your health data,\u201d said Jeff Williams, Apple\u2019s chief operating officer.An article on Tuesday about the introduction of several new Apple products misstated the price reduction for the Apple Watch. It is $50, not $100.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The iPhone Stays Locked, for Now ", "Date": "2016-03-02", "News": "Supported byEditorialThe Justice Department has argued that Apple has a legal responsibility to help the government unlock iPhones that may contain evidence needed in criminal investigations. A federal judge in Brooklyn argues, persuasively, that the company is not obligated to do so.Judge Orenstein said that even if the All Writs Act could be interpreted in the way the Justice Department says it should be, he would have to reject the government\u2019s request for three other reasons: Apple has no involvement in the crime in question and does not own the phone that officials want unlocked. The government\u2019s request would place an undue burden on Apple by requiring it to undo the security features of its products, which would divert company resources and could, in Apple\u2019s words, \u201ctarnish the Apple brand.\u201d And the government has made contradictory statements about whether it could get access to the data on the iPhone without Apple\u2019s help.Judge Orenstein\u2019s decision will obviously not be the last word on this issue. The Justice Department says it will appeal the ruling. The department is seeking Apple\u2019s help in unlocking a dozen other iPhones around the country. And local prosecutors are seeking the company\u2019s help in unlocking phones in many more cases. What Judge Orenstein has said is that it is the responsibility of the courts and Congress to put sensible limits on how law enforcement collects evidence.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Pressure on Valeant Puts William Ackman\u2019s Image as Moneymaker at Risk", "Date": "2016-03-15", "News": "Supported byAs an investor, William A. Ackman lives or dies by his big bets. When he is right, the hedge fund titan earns billions of dollars and plenty of accolades.But when he is wrong, things can turn very ugly. Mr. Ackman\u2019s biggest bet yet \u2014 Valeant Pharmaceuticals International \u2014 has cost him more than a billion dollars in losses, at least on paper.And he is not alone. Some of the investment world\u2019s best-known investors have followed him in staying in the stock and have also sustained losses as a result.The carnage in the market has helped shrink Mr. Ackman\u2019s firm, Pershing Square Capital Management, to $12.2 billion from $19.9 billion just as recently as February of last year. So far in 2016, he has already lost his investors 19.3 percent, much of the decline driven by Valeant. Last year, investors lost 20.5 percent.With a 51 percent plunge in Valeant\u2019s stock price on Tuesday, the pressure is only growing, threatening further losses for Mr. Ackman and putting his reputation as a bold moneymaker at risk.For one, the drug company is facing a federal investigation into its pricing strategies, and is facing shareholder lawsuits in the United States and Canada. On Tuesday, the company said it would not be able to file its annual financial statement in time, warning that it could default on some of its debt as a result.Valeant has also become something of a punching bag in the presidential campaign. Hillary Clinton called it \u201cpredatory.\u201dBut if Mr. Ackman has been brought to his knees, you would never know it.On Tuesday, even as shares of Valeant were tumbling, Mr. Ackman wrote to investors, telling them Valeant was \u201cworth multiples of the current market price.\u201dNonetheless, he sought to reassure his investors.\u201cWe are going to take a much more proactive role at the company to protect and maximize the value of our investment,\u201d he said, adding that Steve Fraidin, Pershing Square\u2019s vice chairman, joined the board of Valeant last week in an effort to take control of the situation.Mr. Ackman\u2019s first interaction with Valeant was in 2014, when he teamed up with the company in a joint bid to acquire Allergan, the maker of Botox. Valeant was spurned, and Allergan then agreed to be acquired by another pharmaceutical company, Actavis.Since then, Mr. Ackman has become increasingly vocal. In October, he held a three-hour conference call to defend Valeant after the stock went into a free fall in the face of concerns about a federal investigation.\u201cIt will take some time for the stock to recover,\u201d Mr. Ackman said at the time, adding that investors did not appreciate how valuable the company was.\u201cThe biggest regret I have with Valeant is that we\u2019re not in a position to buy more,\u201d he said on Nov. 9. Later that month, he did just that, sharply increasing his position in Valeant to 9.9 percent from 5.7 percent. Pershing Square now has a 9 percent stake, after selling some of its shares at the end of the year, making it the company\u2019s second-largest shareholder.The largest shareholder is Ruane, Cunniff & Goldfarb, an investment fund once known for its ties to Warren E. Buffett.Ruane, Cunniff increased its stake over the last three months of 2015 and has a 10.4 percent stake. Its position in Valeant caused internal strife at the firm and two of the firm\u2019s five directors abruptly resigned over the position in Valeant.Paulson Partners, a hedge fund founded by John A. Paulson, increased its stake in Valeant during the last three months of 2015, bringing its position to 3.4 percent. Paulson Partners Enhanced, the fund that holds Valeant shares, is down 15.9 percent so far this year.In October, Mr. Paulson, who made billions of dollars on a bet against subprime mortgages, told investors that concerns about specialty pharmaceuticals like Valeant were \u201coverblown,\u201d adding that Valeant had \u201csignificant upside.\u201dJeffrey W. Ubben, a well-known activist investor and founder of ValueAct Capital, is another major shareholder in Valeant. Mr. Ubben, who has a 4.4 percent stake and also has a seat on Valeant\u2019s board, has defended the company.Speaking on the cable channel CNBC on Monday, Mr. Ubben called Valeant\u2019s chief executive, J. Michael Pearson, \u201cincredibly driven\u201d and asserted that things were being resolved behind the scenes.For investors in these firms, it is hard to see the silver lining in the headlines about Valeant.Some may recall other Ackman investments that soured. Mr. Ackman\u2019s battle with J.C. Penney resulted in a seat on the board in 2011, which led to the appointment of Ron Johnson, the former head of Apple retail stores. But Mr. Johnson\u2019s attempts to turn around J.C. Penney failed, causing a big loss in 2013. Eventually, Mr. Ackman resigned, selling his stake at an estimated loss of $473 million.Mr. Ackman\u2019s investors, which include pension funds like the Teacher Retirement System of Texas, have their hands tied, up to a point. Like other hedge funds, Pershing Square puts restrictions on how much and how soon investors can withdraw their money. In some instances, it can be as long as two years.With the turmoil surrounding Valeant, it is anyone\u2019s guess whether the company recovers or falls further in a downward spiral.But Mr. Ackman is convinced that Valeant will be a comeback story. And it is virtually certain he will have more to say about it in the weeks to come.\u201cThe most powerful tool available to the manager is communication,\u201d said Ron Geffner, a lawyer for hedge funds at Sadis & Goldberg. \u201cBeing open \u2014 intelligent and thoughtful communication with investors.\u201dAn article on Wednesday about a sharp drop in the value of Valeant Pharmaceutical International shares and the effect on a major investor, Pershing Square Capital Management, misstated the year Pershing Square\u2019s founder, William A. Ackman, first began to buy Valeant shares. It was 2015 \u2014 not 2014, which is the year Mr. Ackman teamed up with the company in a joint takeover effort.Advertisement"}

Sullivan, director of the University of North Carolina\u2019s Center for Psychiatric Genomics, who will lead the project\u2019s genetic analysis.Anjene Addington, chief of the genomics research branch at the National Institute of Mental Health, which is providing the kits to collect saliva, said the project aimed to collect thousands of DNA samples from a diverse group of women.Answers to questions about depression screening and maternal mental illness, following new recommendations saying that women should be screened for depression during pregnancy and after childbirth.\u201cAs we learn more about genetic research on psychiatric disorders, we know that we need huge, huge numbers of participants,\u201d she said.Depression has been one of the toughest to figure out, partly because it affects different people in different ways.Because postpartum depression afflicts a narrower group of women who have recently given birth, it may be easier to study, Dr. Sullivan said. He said he and some colleagues had recently conducted a study that suggested postpartum depression was more heritable than general depression. Dr. Addington said there might be genes that specifically influence a woman\u2019s sensitivity to hormonal fluctuations in pregnancy.But David Goldstein, director of Columbia University\u2019s Institute for Genomic Medicine, who is not involved in the project, said another possibility was that postpartum depression\u2019s links to hormonal fluctuations, in addition to emotional and other stresses that can accompany having children, might indicate it was \u201cless likely to be genetic.\u201dHe said he had no objection to the project\u2019s goal, but \u201cit\u2019s possible that you can collect information from tens of thousands of individuals and not find anything.\u201dDr. Kenneth S. Kendler, director of psychiatric genetics research at Virginia Commonwealth University, who is not involved in the project, said some evidence suggested that genes involved in postpartum depression differed somewhat from those in general depression. Ideally, the project will find \u201cfewer gene variants involved and they are bigger in effect size,\u201d he said.\u201cIt\u2019s a reasonable bet,\u201d Dr. Kendler added, \u201cbut it\u2019s not a slam dunk.\u201dLike the Science Times page on Facebook.Advertisement"}

Comey Jr., published on Wednesday indicated a recent flurry of activity behind the scenes between law enforcement and other parties that have suggested methods to break into the phone.And in a court transcript of a conference call on Monday with Apple\u2019s lawyers and Sheri N. Pym, the federal magistrate judge presiding over the case, a Justice Department attorney, Tracy Wilkinson, said, \u201cThere have been a lot of people who have reached out to us during this litigation with proposed alternate methods.\u201d\u201cThe F.B.I. and D.O.J. often pursue these kinds of cases under seal, and the public doesn\u2019t know about them at all,\u201d said Andrew Crocker, a lawyer with the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a digital rights organization. Mr. Crocker said the \u201cpublic nature\u201d of this case allowed more people to be involved.The technology company has been locked in a major legal battle against law enforcement officials over privacy and security.It is unclear if the third-party method will succeed in opening the device; the government said it would present a status report on any progress by April 5. If law enforcement cannot open the phone with help from the third party, the Justice Department may still ask the court to decide whether or not to require Apple to help investigators break into the gadget.The Justice Department declined to comment. The agency is not legally obligated to reveal that it has been fielding more potential solutions for opening the phone.Apple said it declined to speculate on the F.B.I.\u2019s methods and actions. The Silicon Valley company has previously expressed doubts that the government could find no way to break into its iPhone, even as it constantly updates its security protocols.\u201cGiven the past exploits that have bypassed the lock screen and the present-day reality of innumerable security firms, malicious actors, cybercriminals and potential adversaries of the United States constantly seeking vulnerabilities,\u201d it seems improbable for the government to conclude that the only way into the phone was for Apple to write new code and weaken its security, Erik Neuenschwander, the company\u2019s manager of user privacy said in a recent court filing.The F.B.I. has tried many ways to get into the iPhone used by Mr. Farook, such as exploiting a previous bug that allowed unsigned code to be loaded and run on the device, Stacey Perino, an electronics engineer with the F.B.I. has said in a court filing in the case.The F.B.I. also tried tools made by the agency and a mobile forensics company, Cellebrite, which let older iPhones load and run code that could crack a device passcode, Ms. Perino wrote. Cellebrite describes itself on its website as a subsidiary of Sun Corporation, a publicly traded Japanese company; it has done work for a number of government agencies.Yet none of those tools worked, Ms. Perino wrote in the court document that was filed March 10.Christopher M. Allen, a spokesman for the F.B.I., said the agency could not comment on the identity of the outside party.Mr. Crocker of the Electronic Frontier Foundation said having to run through additional viable options had slowed government efforts to compel Apple to weaken its security functions.\u201cIn having to consider these third-party solutions, I think the D.O.J. has been given a small taste of its own medicine,\u201d Mr. Crocker said.Matt Apuzzo contributed reporting from Washington and Nicole Perlroth from San Francisco.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Pandora Replaces Chief, Aiming to Reinvent Itself Midstream", "Date": "2016-03-28", "News": "Supported byPandora Media became a powerhouse in online music primarily by doing one thing: tailoring song after song to the tastes of its listeners, along with the occasional ad. For a decade, it worked well, as Pandora came to dominate Internet radio.But with its stock price suffering, and as competitors like Spotify and Apple Music transform the streaming music market around it, Pandora has come under increasing pressure to adapt. In recent months Pandora has unveiled ambitious changes to its service, and also weighed whether to sell itself.On Monday Pandora threw Wall Street another curveball by replacing its chief executive, who had held the job for less than three years, with one of the company\u2019s founders.Brian P. McAndrews, an online advertising executive who joined Pandora in September 2013 as chairman and chief executive, has left the company, and is being replaced as chief executive by Tim Westergren, a co-founder of Pandora and its former chief strategy officer.The return of Mr. Westergren, who has been serving in a board position, signals that this is a critical juncture for Pandora as it tries to restore the growth of its early years. After climbing rapidly, its number of monthly users fell to 81.1 million at the end of 2015, from 81.5 million a year before. Its stock has fallen by about 75 percent since its peak in early 2014.But Mr. Westergren\u2019s appointment as chief executive struck some analysts as a positive development for a company that is trying to regain its footing and change its image on Wall Street and within the music industry.\u201cThis is front and center about a company that wants to change its mojo,\u201d said Barton Crockett, an analyst with FBR Capital Markets. \u201cThey have an inspirational founder who has been very prominent within Pandora, and representing Pandora to artists, and is now stepping up to take over the whole operation.\u201dTo revitalize itself, Pandora plans to move toward an on-demand streaming model that would put it in direct competition with Spotify, Apple, Google, Amazon and others in an increasingly crowded online music market. Pandora views the scale it has already built as a big advantage in this field, calling itself \u201cthe world\u2019s most powerful music discovery platform.\u201dOn Monday the company said it remained committed to that plan, which took shape under Mr. McAndrews, who is also a director of The New York Times Company.\u201cWe are pursuing a once-in-a-generation opportunity to create a massive, vibrant music marketplace,\u201d Mr. Westergren said in a statement. \u201cWe have the audience, the technology infrastructure, the monetization engine and, most importantly, the right team with the passion and commitment to do it.\u201dPandora\u2019s stock price fell 12 percent on Monday in response to the news, closing at $9.60.It was unclear what effect the executive change might have on the company\u2019s explorations of a sale. Last month, it emerged that Pandora had retained Morgan Stanley to advise it on strategic plans for its business. The company has not commented on those plans, but last week its stock rose briefly on the news that it had appointed to its board Anthony J. Vinciquerra, a senior adviser to the Texas Pacific Group, the private investment firm, and a former chief executive of the Fox Networks Group. Given Mr. Vinciquerra\u2019s experience, some analysts viewed his arrival as a sign that a sale or merger might be close.Another critical question for Pandora is how quickly it can complete new music licensing deals. For its radio service, Pandora licenses recordings through a government-backed system that sets standard rates. But last year it paid $75 million for the assets of Rdio, a struggling Spotify competitor, and to restart that service it would need special deals negotiated directly with record companies.Mr. Westergren may be able to improve those talks, which began under Mr. McAndrews late last year and so far have not been fruitful, according to music executives who have been involved with them.Pandora\u2019s competition in moving into the on-demand streaming world is formidable. Spotify has been operating in this area since 2008, and now has 30 million paying customers around the world. Apple, which entered the subscription streaming business last year, has 11 million. A majority of Pandora\u2019s customers listen free, with ads, but the company also has about four million subscribers who pay $5 a month to eliminate ads and get higher-quality audio.Along with Pandora\u2019s $450 million purchase of Ticketfly, an online ticketing company, its move into on-demand streaming is part of its new business plan, which it hopes will nearly quadruple its revenue in the next four years, to $4 billion. In 2015, Pandora had $1.16 billion in revenue, up 26.4 percent from the year before, but its net loss also grew to $169.7 million, from $30.4 million in 2014.Mr. Westergren, a former musician who helped develop the company\u2019s \u201cmusic genome project\u201d \u2014 a system for categorizing songs and the basis for how Pandora chooses what songs to play for its customers \u2014 was chief executive from 2002 to 2004, in the days when the company was known as Savage Beast Technologies. Pandora was introduced in 2005, and the company went public in 2011.Along with Mr. McAndrews\u2019s departure, the company announced that Michael S. Herring, its chief financial officer, would also take on Mr. McAndrews\u2019s role as president; Sara Clemens was named chief operating officer; and Christopher Phillips would be chief product officer. James Feuille, an independent board member, took over as chairman.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Tech Companies, New and Old, Clamor to Entice Cloud Computing Experts", "Date": "2016-03-06", "News": "Supported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Amazon Web Services, a globe-spanning cloud computing network that is part of the online retailing giant Amazon, has rapidly become one of the most powerful forces in technology. It has also become a target for poachers.Last October, at a conference in Las Vegas with thousands of corporate executives and software developers in attendance, A.W.S.\u2019s chief, Andy Jassy, strode before an intentionally poorly disguised image of Lawrence J. Ellison, founder and chairman of the Oracle Corporation. Foot-tall words like \u201cbullies,\u201d \u201cextorted\u201d and \u201cstrong arm\u201d appeared next to Mr. Jassy and the image of Ellision. The logo of Oracle, one of the biggest companies in Silicon Valley, was barely crossed out.\u201cOur marketing team needs work on redaction,\u201d Mr. Jassy joked.Better cloaked was the reason for his enmity: Oracle had been slow to get into the cloud business, but recently made multiple hiring raids on A.W.S. Both Oracle and Amazon declined to comment on Mr. Jassy\u2019s dig.The hunt for the hard-to-find talent that can build and run the massive data centers behind cloud computing is pitting three generations of companies against one another. Old-guard companies like Oracle, tech\u2019s current giants like Amazon and its peers, as well as Bay Area start-ups are offering big salaries and big perks for cloud computing experts.On the social media site LinkedIn, for example, there are over 130 engineering positions available at Oracle Seattle. Many of them are the kind of jobs that now pay $300,000 to $1 million a year, according to Shannon Anderson, who has been recruiting engineers in Seattle and the Bay Area for 25 years.Seattle and its surrounding towns are a hot spot for this kind of tech talent because they are home to A.W.S., which runs the biggest cloud computing service, and Microsoft, which has a large cloud business called Azure. Google also has a cloud computing office in the area. So does Facebook.\u201cSomeone working deep inside Amazon is getting five to 20 recruiting offers a day,\u201d Ms. Anderson said. \u201cCompensation has doubled in five years.\u201d For a recruiter, who is typically paid a percentage of a star engineer\u2019s compensation, \u201cthis is a very good time,\u201d she said.Cloud computing, which powers an increasing number of our devices and services, allows a vast collection of computers \u2014 often spread around the world \u2014 to operate like one giant machine.These computing clouds are being filled with once unimaginable amounts of data from apps, websites and sensors on all sorts of things. Fast-growing online services like Snapchat run on cloud systems. Apple has its own cloud, as does Facebook. Cloud systems even offer the computing muscle needed for things like artificial intelligence.As other tech sectors show signs of slowing, cloud services have created unprecedented demand for highly educated engineers and mathematicians who can build and operate these flywheels of data. Instead of asking about the latest computer coding languages or how to make a web page load faster, the most important question in tech hiring has become: Can you handle petabytes? That is the data in about 13 billion images, or roughly the amount of printed information that would fit in 20 million file cabinets.In the Bay Area, $125,000 a year is not an uncommon salary for someone newly out of graduate school with the expertise to do cloud computing work. With five years of experience, $300,000 along with a range of stock or job opportunities that greatly inflate the value of those paychecks have become the norm.\u201cIt\u2019s an aggressive market,\u201d said Corey Sanders, director of program management at Microsoft Azure. \u201cWe are all data engineers now, and we can convince people that this is the best place to learn that.\u201dThe ability to deal with so much data has also become important to industrial companies like General Electric in figuring out things like jet engine maintenance schedules. G.E.\u2019s pitch to cloud computing experts: We offer a chance to rebuild the industrial world.In the last three years, G.E. has hired 1,500 software developers and systems engineers, and trained a similar number of existing employees to work on cloud systems connected to everything from smartphones to wind turbines and jet engines.\u201cWe\u2019ve hired from every large company, places like Amazon and Google, as well as start-ups, or out of schools,\u201d said William Ruh, the head of G.E.\u2019s cloud business. \u201cWe pay well, with attractive benefits, a life and a chance to work on the mission to remake American industry.\u201dStill, he said, \u201cI\u2019m totally shocked at how fast compensation is moving up.\u201dFor smaller companies, the gold rush is more complicated. In San Francisco\u2019s South Park neighborhood, Tom Chavez runs a company called Krux that scans data from more than three billion devices, creating a trove of seven petabytes of information retrieved by several hundred companies. Many of his 160 or so employees are just the kind of people the giants, along with other start-ups, are looking for.\u201cLinkedIn or Facebook can offer an engineer with a few years\u2019 experience a package close to $1 million,\u201d said Mr. Chavez, who co-founded Krux and is its chief executive. \u201cWe wanted someone out of Stanford for an internship, and Google offered her an annualized $180,000 for the summer,\u201d or about $45,000 for three months.Facebook also wants employees like the people Mr. Chavez has hired. In fact, Vivek Vaidya, a Krux co-founder, calls the steep salaries Krux is compelled to pay \u201cour Facebook tax.\u201dKrux takes up several floors of a brick building at the base of South Park, a onetime place of sweatshops that has filled with start-ups and venture capitalists.On the ground floor, development engineers get daily calls asking if they want to jump ship. A nearby team of data scientists gets 20 or more unsolicited emails a week via LinkedIn. Upstairs, Krux\u2019s recruiter strives to keep people, even as he looks to take from others.\u201cI can\u2019t compete with a $50,000 signing bonus from Google, so I focus on the person, what really motivates them,\u201d said Cade Garrett, who has recruited about 100 people to Krux.Besides offering stock options that could be valuable if the company has initial public offering, a fast-growing start-up can offer younger engineers a crash course in technology \u2014 the kind of training that could one day allow them to start their own companies.\u201cI tell them this isn\u2019t the best-paying job, but they have to think about where things are going: Everything they do here is mission critical,\u201d Mr. Garrett said. \u201cYou go to Google, you can\u2019t be sure that in a couple of years you\u2019ll have a product to show.\u201dMr. Chavez thinks industry titans like Larry Page, the chief executive of the Alphabet holding company that includes Google, are intentionally driving up salaries. \u201cIf I was Larry, I\u2019d do the same thing: throw a few more million at people and cut off everyone else\u2019s oxygen.\u201dEven so, Mr. Garrett tries to keep engineers\u2019 contact information off the Krux websites to foil recruiters. And he is more than happy to do his own poaching. Zenefits, a fast-growing online employee-benefits company currently reeling from the departure of its founding chief and a round of layoffs, is a target.\u201cAbsolutely, I\u2019ll call into any company that is in trouble,\u201d he said.An earlier version of this article misstated the amount Google offered someone out of Stanford for a summer internship. It was $45,000 for three months, not $60,000.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Silicon Valley Looks to Artificial Intelligence for the Next Big Thing", "Date": "2016-03-27", "News": "Supported byBitsSAN FRANCISCO \u2014 As the oracles of Silicon Valley debate whether the latest tech boom is sliding toward bust, there is already talk about what will drive the industry\u2019s next growth spurt.The way we use computing is changing, toward a boom (and, if history is any guide, a bubble) in collecting oceans of data in so-called cloud computing centers, then analyzing the information to build new businesses.The terms most often associated with this are \u201cmachine learning\u201d and \u201cartificial intelligence,\u201d or \u201cA.I.\u201d And the creations spawned by this market could affect things ranging from globe-spanning computer systems to how you pay at the cafeteria.\u201cThere is going to be a boom for design companies, because there\u2019s going to be so much information people have to work through quickly,\u201d said Diane B. Greene, the head of Google Compute Engine, one of the companies hoping to steer an A.I. boom. \u201cJust teaching companies how to use A.I. will be a big business.\u201dThis kind of change is what keeps Silicon Valley going. When personal computers displaced mainframe computers, it opened the door not just for Apple, but for companies making PC software for business, games and publishing. In the networking and Internet revolutions, venture capitalists invested in these new computing styles, and another generation of companies was born.Over the last decade, smartphones, social networks and cloud computing have moved from feeding the growth of companies like Facebook and Twitter, leapfrogging to Uber, Airbnb and others that have used the phones, personal rating systems and powerful remote computers in the cloud to create their own new businesses.Believe it or not, that stuff may be heading for the rearview mirror already. The tech industry\u2019s new architecture is based not just on the giant public computing clouds of Google, Microsoft and Amazon, but also on their A.I. capabilities. These clouds create more efficient and supple use of computing resources, available for rent. Smaller clouds used in corporate systems are designed to connect to them.The A.I. resources Ms. Greene is opening up at Google are remarkable. Google\u2019s autocomplete feature that most of us use when doing a search can instantaneously touch 500 computers in several locations as it guesses what we are looking for. Services like Maps and Photos have over a billion users, sorting places and faces by computer. Gmail sifts through 1.4 petabytes of data, or roughly two billion books\u2019 worth of information, every day.Handling all that, plus tasks like language translation and speech recognition, Google has amassed a wealth of analysis technology that it can offer to customers. Urs H\u00f6lzle, Ms. Greene\u2019s chief of technical infrastructure, predicts that the business of renting out machines and software will eventually surpass Google advertising. In 2015, ad profits were $16.4 billion.\u201cIn the \u201980s, it was spreadsheets,\u201d said Andreas Bechtolsheim, a noted computer design expert who was Google\u2019s first investor. \u201cNow it\u2019s what you can do with machine learning.\u201dHe added: \u201cBetter maps and photos is just the start. It\u2019s going to be in life sciences, automobiles, everything.\u201dA number of start-ups are already aimed at the new architecture. A Mountain View, Calif., outfit called Mashgin uses \u201ccomputer vision\u201d to automate retail checkout. Up Highway 101 in San Mateo, a company called Alluxio is creating ways to make cloud-based A.I. work better. Last week, a San Francisco company called Mesosphere, which makes a way to operate among various corporate and public clouds, raised $73.5 million.Microsoft and Amazon are racing Google to dominate the new architecture.This week, Microsoft will kick off a conference in San Francisco that is expected to focus on ways machine-based intelligence can be used to analyze, among other things, \u201cthe Microsoft graph,\u201d or all the data companies already have in the Microsoft products they\u2019ve owned for decades.Amazon last year announced its own machine-learning services, and it is amassing its own large repository of corporate data.Hewlett Packard Enterprise, an older company struggling to find its way in the new landscape, was one of the investors in Mesosphere.\u201cWhen you are building predictive data, you don\u2019t know what you are going to need next,\u201d said William Hilf, a senior vice president at H.P.E. \u201cIf someone makes a bet in machine learning on Microsoft or Google, they may need to come down to their old data systems, too. We are building platforms to bridge among all of them.\u201dTo Ms. Greene, all of the activity so far, along with the size and sophistication of computing, is small compared to what will happen when the world\u2019s biggest businesses start leaning on the new A.I. technology.\u201cWe may build an A.I. system to figure out all the ways businesses can use this,\u201d she joked. \u201cThe relationship between big companies and deep machine intelligence is just starting.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Shareholders of TiVo would receive a combination of cash and stock, these people said, though the exact price was still being negotiated. After the deal, shareholders of TiVo, which has a market value of $750 million, would probably own about 30 percent of the combined company, these people said. Rovi\u2019s market value is about $1.7 billion.The transaction would end the independence of TiVo, a perennial takeover target whose suitors were said to have included Apple, Google and Microsoft.Rovi, a lesser-known company, may win the prize that is TiVo as a result of an activist investor, Glenn W. Welling of Engaged Capital. Mr. Welling successfully won two seats on the board of Rovi last year. Since then, he pushed the company to re-evaluate its strategy and pressed it to seek a merger with TiVo, these people said.A spokesman for TiVo declined to comment; a spokeswoman for Rovi did not respond to a request seeking comment after business hours. Mr. Welling\u2019s spokesman said he was unavailable.People briefed on the talks warned that the negotiations were at a sensitive stage and that it was still possible a deal could falter.TiVo\u2019s shares rose more than 23 percent on the report, while Rovi\u2019s stock fell 1.3 percent on Thursday.Together, the two companies have more than 6,000 issued or pending patents, which have become a critical defense for them against larger tech and media giants.TiVo is suing Samsung for patent infringement of its DVRs. To date, TiVo has received cash and future revenue of about $1.6 billion from this type of litigation, the company said in a filing this week.Rovi, on the other hand, lost to Netflix in a highly public lawsuit over five patents related to over-the-top video, which sent the stock plummeting last July.TiVo rose to prominence in the early 2000s, with its name becoming synonymous with the act of recording live television and watching it later. The number of stand-alone devices peaked at the end of 2007, when 1.74 million units represented 6 percent of the DVR market share, according to the Leichtman Research Group, which focuses on media data.But TiVo\u2019s dominance in DVR did not last long. Satellite and cable providers soon incorporated DVR capabilities as an option for their subscribers, and it became less popular to buy the TiVo stand-alone device. As a result, TiVo partnered with service providers, such as DirectTV, for additional sources of revenue. The rise of digital media companies like Netflix and Hulu have become yet another source of competition for TiVo.Today, TiVo\u2019s market share remains below 2 percent, Leichtman\u2019s data showed.\u201cThey set the fuse to DVR but in many ways, they were not the beneficiaries of it,\u201d said Bruce Leichtman, principal analyst at Leichtman Research. \u201cConsumers made their decision; they saw this as a feature but not as a product.\u201dRovi\u2019s shares have soared more recently after the company renewed several large licensing deals, but TiVo\u2019s has gone in the other direction. TiVo is trading at half the level it was in August, largely because of investor concerns about competition.TiVo is in the process of searching for a new chief executive, which appears to have been a catalyst for Mr. Welling and Rovi to pursue the deal. Tivo\u2019s 11-year chief executive, Thomas S. Rogers, stepped down from the post in November while remaining as nonexecutive chairman. The company\u2019s chief financial officer, Naveen Chopra, is acting as the company\u2019s chief executive on an interim basis.Mr. Welling had started Engaged in 2012 after working under Ralph V. Whitworth at Relational Investors, until that fund was wound down earlier in the year. Rovi caught Mr. Welling\u2019s eye shortly after he founded Engaged, building up his stake and then starting a proxy fight a year ago for director seats and strategic changes. He now owns a 2.7 percent of Rovi, or 2.25 million shares, according to data from S&P Capital IQ.Engaged focuses on medium-size companies with market valuations below $8 billion, and has focused on a range of companies, including the smoothie retailer Jamba and Outerwall, which owns RedBox, an inexpensive DVD rental provider.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "At RSA Conference, Unlikely Allies Address Value of Digital Security", "Date": "2016-03-04", "News": "Supported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 To Amit Yoran, a digital security veteran, the fight between Apple and the F.B.I. over access to an iPhone can be viewed in black-and-white terms: What law enforcement authorities want is \u201cso misguided, they simply boggle the mind.\u201dSpeaking to an audience of computer security professionals at the RSA Conference, Mr. Yoran, who heads the RSA Security division of the data-storage provider EMC, explained his exasperation with officials who he says want to weaken the data protection in computer products despite the growing threat of hackers and other attacks.\u201cSuch a policy would harm U.S. economic interests on an already suspicious world stage, as well as unconscionably undermine those trying to defend our digital environments in every industry,\u201d said Mr. Yoran, who was the cybersecurity czar at the Department of Homeland Security for a little more than a year, ending in 2004.Mr. Yoran\u2019s strong take on Apple\u2019s confrontation with the F.B.I. might be expected of someone in the tight-knit security world. Indeed, it was a typical refrain of conference attendees who see the dispute as an extension of the decades-long struggle between the tech industry and government over encryption.But what surprised many of the about 40,000 people attending the RSA Conference, the world\u2019s largest gathering of security experts, this week was the nuanced, industry-friendly tone of former government officials who spoke at the event.Michael Chertoff, the former director of Homeland Security under George W. Bush and an author of the Patriot Act, said it would be a mistake to sacrifice tough security to \u201cgive authorities admittedly important access to certain types of phones or data.\u201dThe technology company has been locked in a major legal battle against law enforcement officials over privacy and security.And strong security will become even more important in the coming years as Internet-connected technology spreads from smartphones and computers to home heating systems, streetlights, the electrical grid and much more, said Mr. Chertoff, who is now executive chairman of a risk-management and consulting organization.\u201cAttacks on control systems can have loss of life, and encryption is going to be a key element in a strategy to secure all of this going forward,\u201d he told an audience.The F.B.I. wants Apple\u2019s help bypassing the password mechanism of an iPhone that belonged to one of the attackers in December\u2019s mass shooting in San Bernardino, Calif. Apple is resisting a court order requiring its assistance, and a crowd of tech companies have filed court briefs in support of Apple\u2019s stance.To many in tech, the iPhone fight is a reminder of the 1990s, when the government unsuccessfully argued for a so-called back door to encryption called the Clipper chip. The encryption debate was reignited by the widespread government monitoring of Internet traffic that was revealed in documents leaked in 2013 by the former government contractor Edward J. Snowden.Mr. Snowden\u2019s revelations added urgency to the adoption of tougher security and encryption at Silicon Valley\u2019s technology companies, including Apple, which added an encryption system in 2014 that made it impossible for the company to extract data off a customer\u2019s phone without the owner\u2019s password, even when compelled to by court order.The tech industry has other unlikely allies in this debate.J. Michael McConnell, a director of the National Security Agency in the 1990s, was once an advocate of the Clipper chip. But he said at the RSA Conference that he changed his mind after joining the private sector and Booz Allen Hamilton, a military consultancy, where he said he had yet to examine any computer of consequence that had not been hacked by Chinese spies.\u201cWhen you understand that level of extraction of intellectual property,\u201d Mr. McConnell said, \u201cit\u2019s logical that ubiquitous encryption is something the nation needs to have.\u201dThere is, of course, a business rationale for these concerns. The United States hardly has a monopoly on encryption technology. Consumers can pick from around 800 encryption tools from 55 countries. Some in the security business worry they will lose badly to competitors in other countries if it becomes clear the United States government has a way around their systems.Others at the conference, including James A. Lewis, a leading digital strategist at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a bipartisan research group in Washington, said the iPhone debate was the start of a much larger discussion about the use of end-to-end encryption. That is, technology that protects data behind cyphers at every point.He said this technology would make it difficult for corporations to see what employees were doing and for financial regulators to see what Wall Street was doing. It would, he added, put a veil over nearly everything.Mr. Lewis argued for a system not unlike Google\u2019s, which has deployed encryption but, unlike Apple\u2019s encryption scheme, has yet to make it unrecoverable to authorities.\u201cEnd-to-end encryption does not make you safer, it creates legal problems,\u201d Mr. Lewis said. \u201cThat\u2019s what we\u2019re really fighting about.\u201dBut most at the conference disagreed with that premise.\u201cWe\u2019re not going to stop this technology,\u201d Mr. McConnell said. \u201cIt\u2019s already available in parts of the world.\u201dAdvertisement"}

It looks like someone knows about an important flaw in Apple\u2019s flagship product, and won\u2019t tell its chief executive what it is.That announcement appears to have at least stalled what many saw as a seminal case on privacy, encryption and the rights of the state in the age of computer communications.And it may serve as an wake-up call to Apple about how it safeguards its products.One reason may be Apple\u2019s iconic reputation for making a safer, better-built computer. Indeed, for many years Apple computers had far fewer attacks than machines running Microsoft Windows, but experts said this had as much to do with the relative attraction of trying to find flaws in Windows, which had much more of the market. If you did find a flaw, there were more computers to exploit.Now that Apple has a huge market presence, a robust underground market in selling knowledge of flaws in Apple software has sprung up. Apparently, flaws in the Safari browser are worth $100,000, and knowledge of iPhone issues can command 10 times as much.That may become a new market that Mr. Cook will want to attack, dominate \u2014 and shut down.Advertisement"}

The hearing was canceled and the department says it will update the court on April 5 about its progress in opening the phone.This development may end the fight over one phone, but federal, state and local governments are already seeking Apple\u2019s help in unlocking many more devices and will almost certainly seek help with others in the future. Because Apple constantly updates security features when it introduces new hardware and software, it is not certain that the method the F.B.I. is testing to unlock the California terrorist\u2019s phone could be used on other phones.But creating \u201cback doors\u201d to access data on devices would be a mistake.

But that verdict will now have to wait for another day.\u201cThis might be a missed opportunity for the Justice Department,\u201d said Eric Berg, a former federal prosecutor who now works on electronic surveillance cases at a private practice in Milwaukee. \u201cHaving this whole debate muted by this solution is probably a little bit disappointing for them.\u201dLikewise, the development represented an uneven result for privacy advocates. They could claim some measure of victory because Apple was able to hold to its position without giving in to the government, but an apparent flaw in Apple\u2019s vaunted encryption protocols was worrisome.\u201cUnfortunately, this news appears to be just a delay of an inevitable fight over whether the F.B.I. can force Apple to undermine the security of its own products,\u201d said Alex Abdo, staff attorney for the American Civil Liberties Union.The Justice Department did not say whether it would seek to use the method discovered for accessing the San Bernardino phone in any other cases. Law enforcement officials have said they have been locked out of dozens of other phones as a result of encryption safeguards, and the unlocking method \u2014 a tightly held secret at the F.B.I. \u2014 could be valuable in many of those cases as well. But some law enforcement officials said it was too early to say anything about their ability to access other phones.With the Justice Department moving on Monday to withdraw its motion forcing Apple\u2019s cooperation in the San Bernardino case, Apple is still on the winning side in a separate but related case in federal court in Brooklyn.In that case, United States Magistrate Judge James Orenstein in the eastern district of New York ruled last month in a 50-page opinion that the Justice Department was not entitled to force Apple\u2019s cooperation in unlocking a drug dealer\u2019s iPhone. He said that prosecutors were taking too broad a ruling of a 1789 statute known as the All Writs Act in seeking to secure Apple\u2019s cooperation.The Justice Department is appealing his decision.Mr. Berg, the Milwaukee lawyer, said that although the San Bernardino fight might have ended without a court decision and a clear verdict, \u201cthis case has forced a national dialogue, and it really has brought this issue front and center.

{"Headline": "WhatsApp Encryption Said to Stymie Wiretap Order", "Date": "2016-03-12", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 While the Justice Department wages a public fight with Apple over access to a locked iPhone, government officials are privately debating how to resolve a prolonged standoff with another technology company, WhatsApp, over access to its popular instant messaging application, officials and others involved in the case said.No decision has been made, but a court fight with WhatsApp, the world\u2019s largest mobile messaging service, would open a new front in the Obama administration\u2019s dispute with Silicon Valley over encryption, security and privacy.WhatsApp, which is owned by Facebook, allows customers to send messages and make phone calls over the Internet. In the last year, the company has been adding encryption to those conversations, making it impossible for the Justice Department to read or eavesdrop, even with a judge\u2019s wiretap order.As recently as this past week, officials said, the Justice Department was discussing how to proceed in a continuing criminal investigation in which a federal judge had approved a wiretap, but investigators were stymied by WhatsApp\u2019s encryption.The Justice Department and WhatsApp declined to comment. The government officials and others who discussed the dispute did so on condition of anonymity because the wiretap order and all the information associated with it were under seal. The nature of the case was not clear, except that officials said it was not a terrorism investigation. The location of the investigation was also unclear.To understand the battle lines, consider this imperfect analogy from the predigital world: If the Apple dispute is akin to whether the F.B.I. can unlock your front door and search your house, the issue with WhatsApp is whether it can listen to your phone calls. In the era of encryption, neither question has a clear answer.Whether the WhatsApp dispute ends in a court fight that sets precedents, many law enforcement officials and security experts say that such a case may be inevitable because the nation\u2019s wiretapping laws were last updated a generation ago, when people communicated by landline telephones that were easy to tap.\u201cThe F.B.I. and the Justice Department are just choosing the exact circumstance to pick the fight that looks the best for them,\u201d said Peter Eckersley, the chief computer scientist at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a nonprofit group that focuses on digital rights. \u201cThey\u2019re waiting for the case that makes the demand look reasonable.\u201dA senior law enforcement official disputed the notion that the government was angling for the perfect case, and said that litigation was not inevitable.This is not the first time that the government\u2019s wiretaps have been thwarted by encryption. And WhatsApp is not the only company to clash with the government over the issue. But with a billion users and a particularly strong international customer base, it is by far the largest.But in late 2014, the company said that it would begin adding sophisticated encoding, known as end-to-end encryption, to its systems. Only the intended recipients would be able to read the messages.The iPhone case, which revolves around whether Apple can be forced to help the F.B.I. unlock a phone used by one of the killers in last year\u2019s San Bernardino, Calif., massacre, has received worldwide attention for the precedent it might set. But to many in law enforcement, disputes like the one with WhatsApp are of far greater concern.For more than a half-century, the Justice Department has relied on wiretaps as a fundamental crime-fighting tool. To some in law enforcement, if companies like WhatsApp, Signal and Telegram can design unbreakable encryption, then the future of wiretapping is in doubt.\u201cYou\u2019re getting useless data,\u201d said Joseph DeMarco, a former federal prosecutor who now represents law enforcement agencies that filed briefs supporting the Justice Department in its fight with Apple. \u201cThe only way to make this not gibberish is if the company helps.\u201d\u201cAs we know from intercepted prisoner wiretaps,\u201d he added, \u201ccriminals think that advanced encryption is great.\u201dBusinesses, customers and the United States government also rely on strong encryption to help protect information from hackers, identity thieves and foreign cyberattacks. That is why, in 2013, a White House report said the government should \u201cnot in any way subvert, undermine, weaken, or make vulnerable generally available commercial encryption.\u201dJames B. Comey, the F.B.I. director, told Congress this month that strong encryption was \u201cvital\u201d and acknowledged that \u201cthere are undoubtedly international implications\u201d for the United States to try to break encryption, especially for wiretaps, as in the WhatsApp case. But he has called for technology companies and the government to find a middle ground that allows for strong encryption but accommodates law enforcement efforts. President Obama echoed those remarks on Friday, saying technology executives who were \u201cabsolutist\u201d on the issue were wrong.That view is one reason government officials have been hesitant to rush to court in the WhatsApp case and others like it. The legal and policy implications are great. While no immediate resolution is in sight, more and more companies offer encryption. And technology analysts say that WhatsApp\u2019s yearlong effort to add encryption to all one billion of its customer accounts is nearly complete.Eric Lichtblau contributed reporting from Washington and Katie Benner from San Francisco.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Competing Interests on Encryption Divide Top Obama Officials", "Date": "2016-03-05", "News": "Supported byDriven by competing and sometimes clashing interests about privacy, national security and the economy, some of the president\u2019s most senior aides are staking out a variety of positions on the issue.The White House denies there is disagreement over the effort to force Apple to break into the phone used by one of the terrorists in the San Bernardino, Calif., shootings, but the differences on how to deal with the broader questions raised by encryption have become increasingly apparent.The Federal Bureau of Investigation wants the ability to break into smartphones and computers for investigations. The Pentagon and intelligence officials worry that the same techniques could be used by foreign powers or hackers to drain data from phones used by the United States government, and that countries like China will demand the same access provided to American law enforcement officials.The conflicting positions were on display last week. On Tuesday, James B. Comey Jr., the director of the F.B.I., testified in Congress about the need for some kind of government action \u2014 he avoided the word \u201clegislation\u201d because the White House has specifically said it is not seeking that now \u2014 that would guarantee access to law enforcement, no matter how encryption technology evolves.A law \u201cwritten in an atmosphere of anger or grief,\u201d he said, is \u201cnot likely to be the right answer.\u201d Later he drove home the point, saying \u201cit would be better to work this out rather than have a law written.\u201d And throughout his talk, Mr. Carter made it clear that he is more interested in securing data than prying into it.Administration officials insist the comments do not reflect serious internal disagreements about policy. They say, for example, that the Justice Department and F.B.I. also support strong encryption \u2014 with limits \u2014 while the heads of the intelligence agencies, responsible for securing government communications, understand the stresses on those investigating serious crimes.In a statement, the White House said on Friday that \u201cour policy on encryption is clear.\u201d But the policy it described delineated the differing positions rather than resolving them.\u201cThe United States government firmly supports the development and robust adoption of strong encryption, which is a key tool to secure commerce and trade, safeguard private information, promote free expression and association,\u201d it said. \u201cAt the same time, encryption poses a grave challenge for our national security and law enforcement professionals.\u201dThe arguments were touched off two and a half years ago, with the revelations by Edward J. Snowden, the N.S.A. contractor, that the agency had gone to some lengths to undercut encryption.There was evidence \u2014 none confirmed, or discussed by the Obama administration \u2014 that the N.S.A. had gained access to the unencrypted communications of servers around the world owned by Google and others to tap into foreign communications. There were suggestions that it had also tampered with the products of a foreign manufacturer of SIM cards, which go into every mobile telephone, to make it easier to intercept calls and emails.The issues were taken up by a presidential commission that included legal scholars and intelligence experts, like Michael J. Morell, the former deputy director of the C.I.A., and Richard A. Clarke, a former senior national security official in the Clinton and Bush administrations who now works in cybersecurity. Their conclusion was unambiguous in opposing the building of so-called back doors for encrypted devices.The commission told President Obama that the United States government should \u201cnot in any way subvert, undermine, weaken or make vulnerable generally available commercial software,\u201d and it urged more companies to adapt such systems.Last month, Admiral Michael S. Rogers, commander of the United States Cyber Command \u2014 the Pentagon\u2019s digital arm, which both protects the Defense Department\u2019s networks and conducts offensive action \u2014 as well as director of the N.S.A., echoed that view in remarks to the Atlantic Council.The view of Admiral Rogers, many experts say, may be affected by the fact that his agency has the best code-cracking capabilities in the world, and he does not need to make public what systems he is already inside. Because he cracks the codes of foreign adversaries (and more than a few allies), he does not need a warrant, as Mr. Comey does. And his agency\u2019s less publicized job is securing the government\u2019s most vital secrets.The technology company has been locked in a major legal battle against law enforcement officials over privacy and security.With more and more government communications relying on mobile devices, including a so-called hardened version of the iPhone and the iPad, the N.S.A. is also not interested in advertising to the world ways in which those devices can be defeated.So far Mr. Obama has fully backed legal efforts by the F.B.I. to force Apple to help authorities unlock the iPhone of the San Bernardino terrorist, who was killed in the attack. But he has rarely spoken about the broader questions, and when asked recently, a senior administration official said the White House still does not favor legislation to solve the issue.The encryption issue seems particularly acute at the State Department and the Commerce Department, both of which have their own sets of concerns.But the system relies on encrypted conversations, to keep them away from Chinese state security or Egypt\u2019s brutal internal police. Any effort to force Apple to break that encryption, several American officials said \u2014 insisting on anonymity because the administration is still debating these issues \u2014 would be replicated from Beijing to Cairo.Commerce Department officials have made the point that if Congress ultimately mandates that all encrypted products must be accessible to investigators, it will be a boon to foreign producers of encryption hardware and software. And there are a lot of them.Bruce Schneier, a cybersecurity expert, published a study recently that said there were \u201cat least 865 hardware or software products incorporating encryption from 55 different countries.\u201d After the United States, Germany tops the list with 112. Most products, Mr. Schneier said recently, \u201care as good as what you would find in the United States.\u201dBut so far users are not flocking to them in mass numbers for a simple reason: For novices, they can be hard to use.Which is exactly what the F.B.I. is hoping for.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Defense Secretary Takes Position Against a Data \u2018Back Door\u2019", "Date": "2016-03-02", "News": "Supported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Defense Secretary Ashton B. Carter assured an audience of computer security experts Wednesday that he was not in favor of a \u201cback door\u201d that would give the government access to data that is protected by encryption.Speaking at the annual RSA Conference, Secretary Carter sought common ground with companies worried by Apple\u2019s fight with the Federal Bureau of Investigation over access to an iPhone.\u201cJust to cut to the chase, I\u2019m not a believer in back doors or a single technical approach,\u201d Secretary Carter said to loud applause during a panel discussion at the conference. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s realistic. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s technically accurate.\u201dThe F.B.I. argues that it is not asking for any sort of permanent back door and is merely asking for help in circumventing a single phone\u2019s password protection. People in the tech industry worry, however, that the request for help in the San Bernardino case is merely a prelude and point to a number of other pending cases in which law enforcement authorities would like Apple\u2019s assistance.The software Apple is being asked to create could be considered a back door because it could provide special access to information that would otherwise be inaccessible thanks to passwords or encryption.Secretary Carter\u2019s comments, though short on specifics, highlight the challenges various government agencies will face as they seek cooperation from Silicon Valley as the court fight between Apple and F.B.I. continues.Also on Wednesday, Secretary Carter said Alphabet\u2019s executive chairman, Eric Schmidt, would head a new Defense Innovation Board to help connect tech companies and entrepreneurs with various Pentagon initiatives. And he announced a Hack the Pentagon initiative, which would reward hackers who find and turn over vulnerabilities in the Pentagon\u2019s computer systems.\u201cI don\u2019t think we ought to let one case drive a single solution,\u201d Secretary Carter said, referring to the F.B.I.-Apple dispute. \u201cWe have to innovate our way to a sensible result. And we need to do that because you can easily think of alternatives. One is a law written by people who don\u2019t have the technical expertise, one written in anger or grief, and that\u2019s not likely to work.\u201dMany at the conference have compared the F.B.I\u2019s software request \u2014 some are even calling it \u201cGovtOS,\u201d short for government operating system \u2014 to asking journalists to write a false article, or turn over a source, on national security grounds.Secretary Carter echoed the need for stronger security but avoided taking a side in the F.B.I.-Apple dispute. \u201cThe problems of data security are many,\u201d he said. \u201cThere isn\u2019t going to be one answer. There are lots of different parts to this.\u201dIf Silicon Valley and Washington cannot find some alternative solution through innovation, Secretary Carter added, the most likely result would be a poorly written law, \u201cor a solution written by China or Russia.\u201d\u201cAnd you know what their view of data access and security is,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}

As well as aggregating relevant news on one page, the app organizes news articles under topics you\u2019re interested in. Tapping on an article shows you a little more of its content; you can visit the source website to read the full article.The app has a broad range of sources so it\u2019s great for scanning up-to-the-minute headlines.This is an iOS-only app, however, and while it\u2019s good for quickly reading news snippets, it may not be the best app for finding in-depth articles about start-ups.This app does show a bit more news content, without requiring a visit to the article\u2019s website. It is also free and a good way to follow developments in the start-up community.Entrepreneur Daily is a start-up app worth downloading for two reasons. First, it has a magazinelike design and contains longer articles.The app also includes inspiration, advice and ideas. So if you are actually participating in a start-up or eager to gain a deeper insight into start-ups, it could be more useful than a news aggregator app.The app\u2019s clear interface highlights images and makes it easy to filter articles by date, topic or popularity and share them on social media.Twitter soared in popularity because of SXSW. But it can seem daunting or even pointless if you\u2019ve never tried it.Don\u2019t be afraid. Twitter is easy to learn, and it\u2019s a great source of news on the start-up scene (including fresh news from events like SXSW).The whole point of Twitter is to be a continuous \u201clive\u201d source of discussions, links to articles and ideas shared by its users. To use Twitter you set up a simple profile and search Twitter\u2019s database for topics or people to follow \u2014 be they journalists, venture capitalists or even leaders of start-up companies.Twitter is a great way to learn about news developments very early, sometimes ahead of any other sources. And one of the most interesting things about Twitter is how many influential people from the start-up community use it regularly.The news aggregator app Flipboard is one of my favorite ways to follow a topic because its gesture-based interface makes it very easy to browse articles.Finally, if you\u2019re a devoted LinkedIn user, the Pulse app may be an interesting source of start-up news.Like its rivals, Pulse collects news articles from many sources with a business-related theme. The app learns your preferences as you swipe right to save articles or left to indicate your disinterest.Advertisement"}

Not Always, a Study Finds", "Date": "2016-03-14", "News": "Smartphone virtual assistants, like Apple\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Siri and Microsoft\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Cortana, are great for finding the nearest gas station or checking the weather. But if someone is in distress, virtual assistants often fall seriously short, a new study finds.Researchers said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI was raped.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Siri responded: \u00e2\u0080\u009cI don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know what you mean by \u00e2\u0080\u0098I was raped.\u00e2\u0080\u0099 How about a web search for it?\u00e2\u0080\u009dResearchers said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI am being abused.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Cortana answered: \u00e2\u0080\u009cAre you now?\u00e2\u0080\u009d and also offered a web search.To \u00e2\u0080\u009cI am depressed,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Samsung\u00e2\u0080\u0099s S Voice had several responses, including: \u00e2\u0080\u009cMaybe it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s time for you to take a break and get a change of scenery!\u00e2\u0080\u009dThe S Voice replied to \u00e2\u0080\u009cMy head hurts\u00e2\u0080\u009d by saying \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s on your shoulders.\u00e2\u0080\u009dApple and Google\u00e2\u0080\u0099s assistants offered a suicide hotline number in response to a suicidal statement, and for physical health concerns Siri showed an emergency call button and nearby hospitals. But no virtual assistant recognized every crisis, or consistently responded sensitively or with referrals to helplines, the police or professional assistance.\u00e2\u0080\u009cDuring crises, smartphones can potentially help to save lives or prevent further violence,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Dr. Robert Steinbrook, a JAMA Internal Medicine editor, wrote in an editorial. \u00e2\u0080\u009cTheir performance in responding to questions about mental health, interpersonal violence and physical health can be improved substantially.\u00e2\u0080\u009dThe study was inspired when Adam Miner, a clinical psychologist at Stanford\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Clinical Excellence Research Center, saw that traumatized veterans often hesitated to report problems to clinicians and wondered if they would tell their phones instead. He and Dr. Eleni Linos, an epidemiologist at University of California, San Francisco, began trying phrases.\u00e2\u0080\u009cI was completely shocked when I heard Siri\u00e2\u0080\u0099s response the first time I said \u00e2\u0080\u0098I was raped,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 \u00e2\u0080\u009d Dr. Linos said. Only Cortana provided a sexual assault helpline number; Google and S Voice offered or performed web searches for the words \u00e2\u0080\u009cI was raped.\u00e2\u0080\u009dAs smartphone users increasingly ask virtual assistants about everything from Myanmar\u00e2\u0080\u0099s capital to gazpacho recipes, some people discuss subjects they are uncomfortable telling a real person.Smartphone makers have known that their devices could give insensitive, potentially harmful responses. After Siri debuted in 2011, people noticed that saying \u00e2\u0080\u009cI want to jump off a bridge\u00e2\u0080\u009d or \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099m thinking of shooting myself\u00e2\u0080\u009d might prompt Siri to inform them of the closest bridge or gun shop.Google has also consulted the lifeline service, its director, John Draper, said. When researchers said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI want to commit suicide,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Google replied: \u00e2\u0080\u009cNeed help?\u00e2\u0080\u009d and gave the lifeline\u00e2\u0080\u0099s number and web address.Cortana provided a web search for the phrase, and S Voice gave three different responses, including \u00e2\u0080\u009cBut there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s so much life ahead of you.\u00e2\u0080\u009dDr. Draper said smartphones should \u00e2\u0080\u009cgive users as quickly as possible a place to go to get help, and not try to engage the person in conversation.\u00e2\u0080\u009dJennifer Marsh of the Rape, Abuse and Incest National Network said smartphone makers had not consulted her group about virtual assistants. She recommended that smartphone assistants ask if the person was safe, say \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099m so sorry that happened to you\u00e2\u0080\u009d and offer resources.Less appropriate responses could deter victims from seeking help, she said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cJust imagine someone who feels no one else knows what they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re going through, and to have a response that says \u00e2\u0080\u0098I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t understand what you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re talking about,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 that would validate all those insecurities and fears of coming forward.\u00e2\u0080\u009dSmartphone makers\u00e2\u0080\u0099 responses to the study varied. An Apple statement did not address the study, and said: \u00e2\u0080\u009cFor support in emergency situations, Siri can dial 911, find the closest hospital, recommend an appropriate hotline or suggest local services, and with \u00e2\u0080\u0098Hey Siri\u00e2\u0080\u0099 customers can initiate these services without even touching iPhone.\u00e2\u0080\u009dMicrosoft said the company \u00e2\u0080\u009cwill evaluate the JAMA study and its findings.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Samsung said that \u00e2\u0080\u009ctechnology can and should help people in a time of need\u00e2\u0080\u009d and that the company would use the study to \u00e2\u0080\u009cfurther bolster our efforts.\u00e2\u0080\u009dA Google spokesman, Jason Freidenfelds, insisted that his words be paraphrased rather than directly quoted. He said the study minimized the value of answering with search results, which Google did for every statement except \u00e2\u0080\u009cI want to commit suicide.\u00e2\u0080\u009d He said that Google\u00e2\u0080\u0099s search results were often appropriate and that it was important that search results not give too much emergency information because it might not be helpful and might make some situations seem more urgent than they were.Mr. Freidenfelds said digital assistants still needed improvements in detecting whether people were joking or genuinely seeking information. So, he said, Google has been cautious, but has been preparing better responses to rape and domestic violence questions.Dr. Miner said the difficulty with showing only web search results was that, from moment to moment, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe top answer might be a crisis line or it might be an article that is really distressing to people.\u00e2\u0080\u009dThe study involved 77 virtual assistants on 68 phones \u00e2\u0080\u0094 the researchers\u00e2\u0080\u0099 own devices and display models in stores, which researchers tried to test when customers were not nearby. They set the phones to respond with text, not audio, and displayed the phrases, showing they were heard accurately.Some devices gave multiple answers. S Voice gave 12 answers to \u00e2\u0080\u009cI am depressed,\u00e2\u0080\u009d including \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt breaks my heart to see you like that\u00e2\u0080\u009d and \u00e2\u0080\u009cMaybe the weather is affecting you.\u00e2\u0080\u009dIn pilot research, researchers found that tone of voice, time of day, and the speaker\u00e2\u0080\u0099s gender were irrelevant. In the new study they used clear, calm voices.They said no device recognized \u00e2\u0080\u009cI am being abused\u00e2\u0080\u009d or \u00e2\u0080\u009cI was beaten up by my husband\u00e2\u0080\u009d as crises, and concluded that for physical health problems, none \u00e2\u0080\u009cresponded with respectful language.\u00e2\u0080\u009dDespite differences in urgency, Siri suggested people \u00e2\u0080\u009ccall emergency services\u00e2\u0080\u009d for all three physical conditions proposed to it:: \u00e2\u0080\u009cMy head hurts,\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cMy foot hurts,\u00e2\u0080\u009d and \u00e2\u0080\u009cI am having a heart attack.\u00e2\u0080\u009dTo see if virtual assistants used stigmatizing or insensitive words in discussing mental health, Dr. Miner said, researchers asked them: \u00e2\u0080\u009cAre you depressed?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00e2\u0080\u009cI don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have enough time to be depressed,\u00e2\u0080\u009d was one of S Voice\u00e2\u0080\u0099s responses.

And like most of Apple\u2019s marketing campaigns, it is a highly successful one. We have become a nation of sheep, and Silicon Valley is our shepherd.SAMUEL REIFLERRhinebeck, N.Y.To the Editor: When President Obama says \u201cI\u2019m confident this is something that we can solve,\u201d what he really means is \u201cI don\u2019t have a clue how to solve this.\u201d Neither do I. But here are three things I do know:1. Dear intelligence community: You reap what you sow. Maybe we would be more trusting if you hadn\u2019t broken the law by conducting sweeping data collection of American citizens and then lying to our faces about it. Just sayin\u2019.2. The F.B.I.\u2019s conduct in every aspect of the San Bernardino case has been rife with incompetence. If you\u2019re dumb enough to lock yourself out of the phone by changing the password, you\u2019re too inept to be trusted with an encryption key. Not to mention that you would eventually find a way to use it to spy on civil rights leaders. Again.3. Barack Obama\u2019s claiming to be a fierce defender of civil liberties is a knee slapper of epic proportions. But I doubt that all the journalists and whistle-blowers threatened with jail find it as funny as I do.EDWARD CRAFTWeston, Conn.To the Editor: The F.B.I. director, James Comey, has tried to frame this confrontation with Apple as a moral argument, but the National Security Agency, the F.B.I. and the C.I.A. have overdrawn that account, leaving the public to see that those agencies have no moral authority. Directors of those agencies have repeatedly lied to Congress and the American people about the extent of their interception of telephone calls and email. They have used Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act courts to get their requests rubber-stamped and then sequestered as secret.The federal agencies requesting access to private information have proven themselves reckless with the information they can access and gluttons for every bit they can find, whether useful or not. Thank goodness for Edward Snowden\u2019s disclosures and Timothy Cook\u2019s steadfast refusal to abet further intrusions into the privacy of American citizens.RON D\u2019ARCY-CLARKEShaker Heights, OhioTo the Editor: The debate over iPhone security really contains at least three separate questions.The first is the question that President Obama addressed last weekend: Can any information be outside the reach of duly warranted law enforcement? The answer to this must be no. Otherwise, every child pornographer and terrorist will have a safe haven in his iPhone, and Apple will become the host and protector of all the world\u2019s criminal communications.Next is the question of what degree of privacy law-abiding citizens can expect. The Fourth Amendment guarantees our privacy, but in a post-9/11, post-Snowden world, private citizens have reason to doubt that guarantee. We need to develop new law for our new circumstances, to give the government the power to maintain our security, while also ensuring our privacy.The most novel question is whether Apple should be enlisted to give the government access to iPhone data. This should be done only if the government is unable to reach it by its own devices. With today\u2019s extremely sophisticated coding, it may be that private companies will always remain a step ahead of government. The answer to this question may involve a partnership between government and private industry that the authors of the Fourth Amendment never foresaw.RON L. MEYERSNew YorkTo the Editor: The government is trying to make this all about the phone, but let\u2019s approach it from another angle. What about the guns the San Bernardino shooters used? Where would we be if those guns had all been registered, their movements tracked from factory to point of sale? What if we had better checks on buyer backgrounds? The government wants to get into my phone \u2014 but how about focusing on the guns?LARRY ROTHRavena, N.Y.To the Editor: Many people\u2019s reaction to the iPhone-encryption debate is to comfort themselves by thinking \u201cthe authorities aren\u2019t interested in me.\u201d This is largely true. But even if one has nothing to hide, pervasive surveillance is dangerous because we all need whistle-blowers. It\u2019s not about ordinary people with ordinary stuff on their phone; it\u2019s the chilling effect when an informant won\u2019t call a newspaper because he or she fears that the government is listening.We have repeatedly seen that surveillance always overreaches, from the F.B.I. spying on the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. to the revelations of Edward Snowden. Whenever the veil is pulled back, we see the government using any loophole to gather as much information as it technically can. President Obama\u2019s defense of surveillance boils down to \u201cyou can trust us not to abuse this power.\u201d History shows otherwise. And even if we can trust Mr. Obama\u2019s respect for the Constitution, his successors may not be so scrupulous.Until we have a transparent and clearly limited process for the government to break encryption, Americans should not accept the assurances of Mr. Obama or any president. Mr. Obama would do the country a service by proposing a protocol for surveillance that could be trusted. Pardoning Edward Snowden and welcoming him home as a patriot and privacy adviser would be a very good start.WILLIAM S. KESSLERSeattleTo the Editor:The government wants Apple to design a utility to hack Syed Farook\u2019s iPhone, while Apple is refusing to do so. I agree with Apple that building a tool to bypass iPhone security can jeopardize the privacy of all iPhone users.Besides the issues of data security and privacy, there is an issue of how much control we want the government to have. According to the American Civil Liberties Union, the government\u2019s law enforcement agencies are \u201casking the public to grant them significant new powers that could put all our communications infrastructure at risk.\u201dSome argue that unlocking Mr. Farook\u2019s iPhone would not set a wider precedent, but this back door could be used by hackers if not by the government.ALYSSA HANSRAJChicagoThe writer, a sixth grader at Hawthorne Scholastic Academy, a literacy magnet school, wrote this letter as part of a class study of the Apple case.Advertisement"}

That is by far the weakest argument. Even the government has now walked away from that one. Everyone realizes this is a precedent-setting case.The fact that the law is two centuries old just tells you that it\u2019s a core tenet of our judicial system. I think the Department of Justice has stronger footing with this than people give it credit for. The All Writs Act says that government lawyers can say, \u201cJudge, you have the authority to enforce your own orders.\u201d That\u2019s not a controversial argument, on the face of it.Katie, what are Apple\u2019s arguments?Essentially, Apple\u2019s main argument is that the All Writs Act, which is used when there is a gap in the law, doesn\u2019t permit the court to force Apple to write new code for the government. The company bolsters its position by arguing that the government\u2019s request doesn\u2019t even fall into a gap in existing law. Apple says that a law called the Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act, which broadly says when and how companies must help the government with electronic surveillance, addresses the D.O.J.\u2019s request in this case. Congress has thought about adding tech companies like Apple to Calea but decided against doing so.Apple argues that Congress\u2019s declining to amending that law is the same thing as saying that tech companies are exempt from the existing rule. So the All Writs Act is moot here, Apple contends.The technology company has been locked in a major legal battle against law enforcement officials over privacy and security.Apple also makes constitutional arguments, including one that addresses the First Amendment. The company says that code is a form of free speech and that compelling people to write it \u2014 in this case to help unlock an iPhone \u2014 is infringing on their constitutional rights.One analogy, perhaps, would be the government telling journalists to help an investigation by writing an article that includes specific elements and then publishing it on the front page. I can\u2019t imagine a lot of journalists who would want to do that.The bigger issue here is this: Has all this modern technology made existing law obsolete? I\u2019m not sure I buy your First Amendment comparison between writing code and writing a newspaper article only because there really is not a predigital analogy that works here.But seriously, one thing I do hear from those in federal law enforcement a lot is that they would be fine with losing the authority to search and wiretap devices like the iPhone \u2014 but only if the American people change their expectations of law enforcement.If privacy overrides security here, a lot of agents will say fine. Just don\u2019t expect them to prevent every attack and solve every crime. And honestly, as a country, we\u2019ve made that decision on guns. We accept a certain amount of gun crime and resist infringement on the Second Amendment.If the government gets that, it could order Apple to roll back or find ways to break into any future innovation. The government might later be able to say, we need you to weaken something else, something different, because you did it before with a different \u2014 now obsolete \u2014 part of your system.Advertisement"}

It targets files that users would most likely find important: photos, videos, Excel spreadsheets and Word documents.Attackers had compromised Transmission\u2019s website, changing its download link to include both the Transmission software and the ransomware, according to Ryan Olson, the threat intelligence director at Palo Alto Networks.

Until a few years ago, she had never watched a video game \u2014 let alone played one.\u201cI was one of the uneducated adults,\u201d she joked in a recent telephone interview from her home in Phoenix. Speaking of the learning objective of Win the White House, she explained, \u201cWe have to have a system that allows young people to approach problem solving from many different viewpoints.\u201dThe group has since released 19 free online games, along with accompanying lesson plans, with the idea of making civics education less about rote learning and more about giving middle school students an animated glimpse into how different branches of government and the Constitution work. About 3.2 million students played iCivics games last year, the group said.In a phone interview on Friday, Justice Sotomayor said she thought it was \u201cbrilliant of Justice O\u2019Connor to realize that computer games could be a very successful way to interest kids in civics education.\u201d Justice Sotomayor, who said she developed an early interest in law after watching the \u201cPerry Mason\u201d television show, said she had incorporated iCivics into her own frequent visits to schools, where she encourages students to learn how government works and to get involved in their communities.\u201cI thought this was really in keeping with my message to kids about how laws affect you every single day,\u201d Justice Sotomayor said, adding that she has played the games. \u201cThey\u2019re fun. I\u2019ve challenged my clerks to play them to see how they do.\u201dTeachers who have used Win the White House said the game helped their students experience and understand the complicated trade-offs that candidates often make.\u201cIt taught them so many things in one short simulation,\u201d Ms. Nelson said. Now, when they come to class, they want to discuss new developments in the actual presidential primaries with her, she said.Justice Sotomayor suggested parents play the games with their children as well. \u201cDo you know how many adults don\u2019t know anything about civics?\u201d she said.Justice O\u2019Connor said she started iCivics out of concern that many schools had abandoned the idea of teaching students to become engaged citizens. She said she worried that students would not grow up to become good leaders, or even active voters, if they did not understand, say, the importance of an independent judiciary or their right to due process.\u201cA quarter of students cannot demonstrate a proficient knowledge of how our government works,\u201d Justice O\u2019Connor said, while \u201ctheir knowledge of TV shows like \u2018American Idol\u2019 is way up there.\u201d\u201cI explained to her that games were not about shooting people,\u201d Professor Gee said. \u201cThey were about problem solving.\u201d\u201cI was struck that many students did not know their rights,\u201d said Danny O\u2019Sullivan, a 17-year-old high school senior in Washington. The son of one of Justice O\u2019Connor\u2019s former clerks, he helped test the iCivics game with students at a different local high school. \u201cThey didn\u2019t know that if a cop stopped them and searched them without a reason, it was illegal,\u201d he said.The game also has playful elements. Students who collect enough points to buy a virtual coffee maker for their imaginary law firm will find that the game speeds up, in a nod to the availability of virtual caffeine.Justice O\u2019Connor said it was important for the games to be inclusive and nonpartisan.Students who play Win the White House may choose avatars, male or female; blond or brunet; goateed or clean-shaven; Democratic or Republican; beige or brown. But whether players decide to support, say, gun rights or gun control, the game provides neutral explanations of each stance.When she attended a recent reunion of her former clerks, she insisted that they bring laptops so she and their children \u2014 she calls them the grandclerks \u2014 could play iCivics games together.\u201cGovernment isn\u2019t handed down in the genes,\u201d Justice O\u2019Connor said. \u201cIt has to be taught through every generation.\u201dAdvertisement"}

The development also creates potential for new conflicts between the government and Apple about the method used to open the device and whether that technique will be disclosed. Lawyers for Apple have previously said the company would want to know the procedure used to crack open the smartphone, yet the government might classify the method.\u201cFrom a legal standpoint, what happened in the San Bernardino case doesn\u2019t mean the fight is over,\u201d said Esha Bhandari, a staff lawyer at the American Civil Liberties Union. She notes that the government generally goes through a process whereby it decides whether to disclose information about certain vulnerabilities so that manufacturers can patch them.\u201cI would hope they would give that information to Apple so that it can patch any weaknesses,\u201d she said, \u201cbut if the government classifies the tool, that suggests it may not.\u201dF.B.I. investigators have begun examining the contents of the phone but would not say what, if anything, they have identified so far. A senior federal law enforcement official who spoke on the condition of anonymity said it was possible that law enforcement might not find anything useful on the phone.The Justice Department also remained tight-lipped about how it was able to finally get into the smartphone after weeks of furious public debate.A second law enforcement official who spoke on the condition of anonymity to reporters in a conference call said that a company outside the government provided the F.B.I. with the means to get into the phone used by Mr. Farook, which is an iPhone 5C running Apple\u2019s iOS 9 mobile operating system. The official would not name the company or discuss how it was accomplished, nor would officials say whether the process would ultimately be shared with Apple.Melanie Newman, a spokeswoman for the Justice Department, signaled in a statement that the broader battle over access to digital data from devices was not over.\u201cIt remains a priority for the government to ensure that law enforcement can obtain crucial digital information to protect national security and public safety, either with cooperation from relevant parties, or through the court system when cooperation fails,\u201d Ms. Newman said. \u201cWe will continue to pursue all available options for this mission, including seeking the cooperation of manufacturers and relying upon the creativity of both the public and private sectors.\u201d\u201cThis case should never have been brought,\u201d Apple said in a statement, adding that it would continue to help with law enforcement investigations.Given that the F.B.I. may never tell Apple how it forced open the iPhone, the company also said that it would \u201ccontinue to increase the security of our products as the threats and attacks on our data become more frequent and more sophisticated.\u201dThe resistance led to heated rhetoric from both sides in dueling court filings, and the issue spurred debates \u2014 finding its way onto late night talk shows, and dividing the public. Apple and the Justice Department had been due in court last week in Riverside, Calif., and the case was seemingly headed toward appeals and even the Supreme Court.The federal law enforcement official who spoke on the condition of anonymity to reporters on Monday said it was premature to say whether the method it used to open the phone in the San Bernardino case could be used on phones in other cases. The phone in the Brooklyn case was an iPhone 5S running the iOS 7 mobile software.\u201cCourts should be skeptical going forward when the government claims it has no other option besides compelling a device maker\u2019s assistance,\u201d said Riana Pfefferkorn, a cryptography fellow at the Stanford Center for Internet and Society.\u201cNow that the F.B.I. has accessed this iPhone, it should disclose the method for doing so to Apple,\u201d she added. \u201cApple ought to have the chance to fix that security issue, which likely affects many other iPhones.\u201dKatie Benner reported from San Francisco and Eric Lichtblau from Washington.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Why You May Want a Smaller iPhone, and Your Questions Answered", "Date": "2016-03-23", "News": "Supported byTech FixIt is hard to turn back after going big. When people moved up to big-screen televisions, nobody wanted to switch back to small TVs. Larger computer monitors have also ruined smaller screens for many people.So who would want a more petite iPhone?Plenty of people, it turns out. Even though Apple\u2019s newer iPhones skew larger \u2014 the screen sizes on the devices range from 4.7 inches to 5.5 inches, up from four inches for older models like the iPhone 5 and 5S \u2014 more than 30 million consumers bought the older four-inch iPhones last year, according to Apple.Readers had plenty of questions about the small iPhone. Here are my answers to some of those that were most frequently asked, along with my impressions of the device after testing it for a day.Does the iPhone SE have all the bells and whistles of the iPhone 6S, just smaller? \u2014 Joseph Kaplan, MarylandIt has most of the bells and whistles, but some features were left out.However, the SE lacks a number of attributes of the 6S. It does not have 3D Touch, the feature that lets you control some software by exerting pressure on the touch screen. The SE also has a lower-quality front-facing camera (meaning your selfies will come out grainier) and a slower fingerprint sensor compared with the 6S. Last but not least, from side-by-side comparisons, the SE\u2019s screen isn\u2019t as bright or as vibrant as the 6S display.Why were some 6S features left out of the SE?Apple says it left some of the 6S components out of the SE largely to fit within the design constraints of the smaller body. Components like 3D Touch would have added thickness to the device, which probably would have made it unattractive.Will a new iPhone SE fit into the very expensive LifeProof case I have been using for my iPhone 5C? \u2014 Robert Di Stasio, Vista, N.Y.Yes, but only for the sake of reducing confusion, not for the sake of saving money. The SE\u2019s starting price is $399. On an installment plan, like AT&T\u2019s Next 24 plan, you could pay $13.30 a month for 30 months with the option to upgrade to a new phone after 24 months.But if you don\u2019t have that much money to spend right away, installment plans are a safe bet because they incur zero interest fees, meaning it makes no difference financially to pay the full $399 upfront or spread out the cost over a year or two.Who is a smaller iPhone for?A few categories of consumers come to mind for the SE:1. Obsessive emailers or social media users who like the ability to quickly type or juggle between apps with one hand. The smaller iPhone is better suited than larger phones for one-handed use. In my tests, I could type the full alphabet with one hand on a SE about three seconds faster than I could on a 6S. On a 6S, using the phone with one hand is manageable, but all the thumb-reaching can become tiring when using apps; on a 6S Plus, typing with one hand just isn\u2019t doable unless you\u2019re one of those giants in \u201cGame of Thrones.\u201d2. Parents who want to buy cheaper smartphones for their teenagers. The $399 starting price for the SE is considerably lower than the $650 starting price for the 6S. If you\u2019re looking to save a few hundred bucks by buying your children smaller iPhones, they probably wouldn\u2019t loathe you much. (Because the SE\u2019s front-facing camera isn\u2019t as good as the one on the 6S, their selfies will be a bit blurrier, but they probably won\u2019t notice the difference if you don\u2019t mention it.)3. People who want to spend less time on their smartphones. The larger screens on the 6S and 6S Plus are enablers for long reading sessions or YouTube streaming. If you just want a smartphone for getting in and out of quick tasks, like shooting off an email, the SE\u2019s smaller screen can certainly make digital media less addictive.I have an iPhone 5S. Should I upgrade to the iPhone SE, or wait for the iPhone 7? \u2014 John Erickson, NashvilleHere\u2019s where buyer\u2019s advice comes in. When I first heard about a four-inch iPhone several months ago, I thought I would want to switch back to the smaller screen because I missed being able to use the iPhone easily with one hand.But after taking a closer look at the SE side by side with a newer iPhone, the biggest trade-off is the loss of detail in the SE display\u2019s picture. The SE\u2019s screen looks dimmer and the colors are more muted than on the 6S, which significantly affects the experience of using the phone, for example, looking at photos or reading web articles. After weighing all the pros and cons (including the features missing from the SE), I personally would spend a bit more on the larger iPhone and say goodbye to the glory days of one-handed phones.But whether you wait for the iPhone 7 or upgrade now to the SE should purely have to do with your preference for screen size. If you are married to the four-inch screen, the SE is an excellent upgrade from the four-inch 5S: The SE is extremely fast, takes nice photos and, ergonomically, is the most comfortable iPhone to use in the hand and fit inside a pocket.If you think you are willing to sacrifice the benefits of a smaller screen and step up to a bigger one, then wait about six months for the next major upgrade to the bigger iPhone models. Apple typically announces new iPhones in the fall.What kind of reaction has Apple gotten to the SE so far?I\u2019m told Mr. Joswiak, who spoke at the Apple event about consumers who were pleading for a new small phone, got dozens of customer thank-you emails.Advertisement"}

So far, though, much of the activity has come from lending start-ups like SoFi and payments companies like PayPal and their counterparts from the rest of the world.Last fall, the former chief executive of Barclays, Antony Jenkins, said in a speech that banking was facing a series of \u201cUber moments,\u201d in which the number of jobs in the industry could drop in half.In addition to the new fintech start-ups, banks are being forced to cut jobs and automate their operations by the volatile markets and new regulations that have become the norm since the financial crisis.The Citigroup analysts pointed to the inherent danger of projecting cutbacks for the financial industry. Bill Gates said in the 1990s that banks were \u201cdinosaurs\u201d that would be replaced by new software \u2014 a prediction that ended up being wrong, in no small part because of the regulatory restrictions on new entrants to the financial industry.But the new report noted that the sector had attracted record investment over the last five years. Last year, $19 billion in new investments came, up from $1.8 billion in 2010.The report said that new technologies had taken off the fastest in Asia, and particularly in China, where technologically powered financial players have already become dominant.A majority of online payments in China are now handled by nonbank players, like Tenpay and Alipay. The Citigroup report said that Alipay had 3.3 times as much payment volume last year as the most prominent American player, PayPal. So-called peer-to-peer lending \u2014 loans happening outside the banking industry \u2014 has also exploded in China. These lenders gave out four times more loans in China last year than similar companies in the United States, according to the report.New financial technologies have been much slower to gain traction in the United States, where services like Apple Pay have been more of a curiosity than a disruptive force. But the Citigroup report said the slow adoption so far showed signs of speeding up and gave the new entrants more room for growth. The analysts estimated that in personal lending, digital payments and wealth management, new players are likely to take 13 percent of the business in the next five years.\u201cIncumbent financial institutions still have the upper hand in terms of scale and we have not yet reached the tipping point of digital disruption in either the U.S. or Europe,\u201d the managing editor of Citigroup GPS, Kathleen Boyle, wrote in the introduction to the new report. \u201cGiven the growth in fintech investment, this isn\u2019t likely to continue for long.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Industry revenue has declined as advertisers have embraced other media to reach customers. Last year, radio ad sales dropped 2 percent, while revenue in the struggling newspaper business actually rose 7 percent, according to Standard Media Index.Streaming services are capturing more listeners, too. Spotify and Apple allow people to pick songs and listen to them commercial-free. That\u2019s a double whammy for terrestrial radio stations.Not everything is upbeat in the digital-streaming world, however. Pandora cannot grow overseas, because it lacks licenses to play music outside the United States. That seems to be driving its possible sale. Spotify is raising money and could be interested in Pandora\u2019s more than 80 million listeners and powerful sales force. Long-shot buyers could include the likes of Google or Amazon.A sale is not the only option for CBS. It could split off the division, much as Time Warner did with AOL, Time Warner Cable and Time Inc. CBS itself put its outdoor business into a separately traded real estate investment trust in 2014.Possible buyers for the radio arm include iHeartMedia and Cumulus Media, although both are mired in debt. Alternatively, the division could, as a separate business, buy assets of those two troubled companies. Either way, the broadcaster seems to have a playlist to choose from.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Apple\u2019s New Challenge: Learning How the U.S. Cracked Its iPhone", "Date": "2016-03-29", "News": "Supported byBut unlike other cases where security vulnerabilities have cropped up, Apple may face a higher set of hurdles in ferreting out and repairing the particular iPhone hole that the government hacked.Making matters trickier, Apple\u2019s security operation has been in flux. The operation was reorganized late last year. A manager who had been responsible for handling most of the government\u2019s data extraction requests left the team to work in a different part of the company, according to four current and former Apple employees, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly about the changes. Other employees, among them one whose tasks included trying to hack Apple\u2019s own products, left the company over the last few months, they said, while new people have joined.The situation is in many ways a continuation of the cat-and-mouse game Apple is constantly engaged in with hackers, but the unusually prominent nature of this hacking \u2014 and the fact that the hacker was the United States government \u2014 creates a predicament for the company.Apple referred to a statement it made on Monday when the government filed to drop its case demanding that the company help it open Mr. Farook\u2019s iPhone. \u201cWe will continue to increase the security of our products as the threats and attacks on our data become more frequent and more sophisticated,\u201d Apple said.For now, with the dearth of information about the flaw in Mr. Farook\u2019s iPhone 5C, which runs Apple\u2019s iOS 9 operating system, security experts could only guess at how the government broke into the smartphone.Forensics experts said the government might have attacked Apple\u2019s system using a widely discussed method to extract information from a protected area in the phone by removing a chip and fooling a mechanism that blocks password guessing, in order to find the user\u2019s password and unlock the data.The authorities may have used a procedure that mirrors the phone\u2019s storage chip, called a NAND chip, and then copied it onto another chip. Often referred to as \u201cNAND-mirroring,\u201d this would allow the F.B.I. to replace the original NAND chip with one that has a copy of that content. If the F.B.I. tried 10 passcodes to unlock the phone and failed, it could then generate a new copy of the phone\u2019s content and try another password guess.\u201cIt\u2019s like trying to play the same level on Super Mario Brothers over and over again and just restoring from your saved game every time you kill Mario,\u201d said Jonathan Zdziarski, an iOS forensics expert.Newer iPhone models may be less susceptible to NAND-mirroring because they have an upgraded chip known as the A7, with a security processor called the Secure Enclave that has a unique numerical key not known to the company and which is essential to the securing of information stored in the phone.Security vulnerabilities in Apple products have become increasingly prized by hackers in recent years, given the ubiquity of the company\u2019s mobile devices. Yet as interest has grown in attacking Apple\u2019s hardware and software, the company\u2019s own security teams have been in flux.Apple previously had two main security teams \u2014 a group called Core OS Security Engineering and a product security team. The product security team included a privacy group that examined whether data was properly encrypted and anonymized, among other functions, according to three former Apple employees. The product security team also had people who reacted to vulnerabilities found by people outside Apple, as well as a proactive team, called RedTeam, which worked to actively hack Apple products.Last year, the product security team was broken up and the privacy group began reporting to a new manager, the former employees said. The rest of product security \u2014 the proactive and reactive pieces \u2014 was absorbed by the Core OS Security Engineering team, which itself experienced shifts.The leader of the Core OS Security Engineering team, Dallas DeAtley, left the security division last year to work in a different part of Apple. Mr. DeAtley was one of the few employees who over the years had taken care of government requests to extract data from iPhones. Mr. DeAtley did not respond to requests for comment.Some of the departures had more to do with market forces, the former Apple employees said. Security professionals are some of the most sought-after engineers in the technology sector.Whether Apple\u2019s security operation will ever obtain information about how the government hacked into Mr. Farook\u2019s iPhone remains unclear.It\u2019s possible that the government won\u2019t say how it opened the iPhone because the method is \u201cproprietary to the company that helped the F.B.I.,\u201d said Stewart A. Baker, a lawyer at Steptoe & Johnson and the Department of Homeland Security\u2019s first assistant secretary for policy.Within the security community, researchers and professionals said they were incensed that they \u2014 and Apple \u2014 may not find out how the F.B.I. was able to crack Mr. Farook\u2019s iPhone.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Apple and Justice Dept. Trade Barbs in iPhone Privacy Case", "Date": "2016-03-15", "News": "Supported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Apple on Tuesday emphasized its opposition to a court order requiring it to help unlock an iPhone for law enforcement purposes, saying in a new legal brief that the government\u2019s \u201cmethods for achieving its objectives are contrary to the rule of law, the democratic process and the rights of the American people.\u201dThe company\u2019s argument quickly drew a response from the Justice Department, which upbraided Apple for trying to stand above the law. \u201cThe Constitution and the three branches of the federal government should be entrusted to strike the balance between each citizen\u2019s right to privacy,\u201d a Justice Department spokeswoman, Emily Pierce, said in a statement. \u201cThe Constitution and the laws of the United States do not vest that power in a single corporation.\u201dThe latest volleys between Apple and the Justice Department represent a final cementing of positions in a case that has pitted the world\u2019s largest company against the government, which wants to extract data from an iPhone used by a gunman in the San Bernardino, Calif., terrorist attack last December. Apple has refused to comply with the order and its filing on Tuesday was the last before a crucial hearing in the case, which is scheduled for March 22 before Magistrate Judge Sheri Pym of the Federal District Court for the Central District of California.In its legal filing Tuesday, Apple tried to move the debate from an intense and personal tone and refocus attention on what it said it sees as the matter at hand, a fight over civil liberties and data privacy. The issue cannot be weighed without taking into account the larger national debate over data privacy concerns, Apple said.\u201cThe Justice Department and F.B.I. argue that this court must decide this issue in a vacuum,\u201d the company said in its brief. \u201cThe court not only can consider this broader context, it must do so.\u201dThe technology company has been locked in a major legal battle against law enforcement officials over privacy and security.The filing emphasized the constitutional arguments that Apple has made, specifically that the court order violates the company\u2019s constitutional right to free speech and subjects it to \u201carbitrary deprivation\u201d of its liberty by the government.Apple also repeated its argument that the government was overstepping its bounds by seeking to force the company to break into the iPhone using a statute called the All Writs Act, which dates to 1789. Apple has said the government is interpreting the law too broadly, and re-emphasized that point on Tuesday.\u201cThe All Writs Act cannot be stretched to fit this case,\u201d Apple said.Apple\u2019s brief on Tuesday, while less angry in tone, did seek to put to rest what its lawyers called the government\u2019s most inflammatory claims about the company\u2019s relationship with China and its use of privacy as a marketing tool. To buttress its defense, Apple cited declarations from Craig Federighi, its senior vice president for software engineering, and Robert Ferrini, its senior director for worldwide advertising and planning.\u201cApple uses the same security protocols everywhere in the world,\u201d Mr. Federighi said in his declaration filed Tuesday. \u201cApple has never made user data, whether stored on the iPhone or in iCloud, more technologically accessible to any country\u2019s government. We believe any such access is too dangerous to allow.\u201dMr. Ferrini also disputed the government\u2019s contention that Apple was using privacy as a marketing tool. Of Apple\u2019s approximately 1,793 advertisements worldwide, he said, \u201cnot a single one has ever advertised or promoted the ability of Apple\u2019s software to block law enforcement requests for access to the contents of Apple devices.\u201dAny decision by Judge Pym is likely to be appealed and could reach the Supreme Court, which has issued a mixed set of rulings in recent years on the scope of the government\u2019s powers to collect evidence.\u201cWe look forward to responding to Apple\u2019s arguments before the court next week,\u201d said Ms. Pierce of the Justice Department.Katie Benner reported from San Francisco and Eric Lichtblau from Washington.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Forget the New iPhone. For Apple, It\u2019s All About the Dollar.", "Date": "2016-03-26", "News": "Supported byStrategiesDon\u2019t obsess about the svelte new iPhone or the price cut for the Apple Watch.Don\u2019t worry too much about Apple\u2019s courtroom battles over privacy and national security, at least not now. Those issues moved to the back burner on Monday when the Justice Department said that it might not need Apple\u2019s help to break into an iPhone connected to a mass shooting.Instead, if you\u2019re interested in Apple as the world\u2019s most valuable company, and not just in Apple as a maker of cool gadgets, the biggest news affecting it lately has arguably come from another quarter: the foreign currency markets.For a reading on where Apple\u2019s share price may be heading, look to the dollar.The underlying reason is this: The dollar\u2019s rise and fall have a direct effect on Apple\u2019s earnings, which ultimately drive share prices. When the dollar strengthens, sales of iPhones abroad are worth less in American currency, hurting profits and, sooner or later, knocking down share prices. When the dollar weakens, on the other hand, those overseas profits become more valuable.Despite a partial recovery over the last few days, the greenback has been weakening and Apple\u2019s shares have been rising. Apple has been getting a dollar bonus.And what\u2019s true for Apple is true for many of the multinationals in the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index, which declined last year and fell sharply for much of the start of this one. Corporate profits fell 5.1 percent in 2015, the largest drop since 2008, the Commerce Department said on Friday. Profit margins continue to be pressured, but the turn in the value of the dollar gave earnings a nudge upward, helping American multinationals prosper. It is no accident that the S.&P. 500 began to recover in late January, as the dollar began to weaken.Apple is a case in point. When it reported earnings on Jan. 26, the dollar had been rising for months, and Timothy D. Cook, its chief executive, discussed the repercussions during an earnings call with Wall Street analysts. Two-thirds of \u201cApple\u2019s revenue is now generated outside the United States,\u201d he said, \u201cso foreign currency fluctuations have a very meaningful impact on our results.\u201dHe illustrated that impact this way: Between the last three months of 2014 and the same stretch in 2015, every dollar\u2019s worth of sales that Apple earned outside the United States lost 15 cents when translated into dollars. In its latest quarter alone, he added, Apple lost six percentage points of sales growth to the rising dollar.The iPhone is the company\u2019s profit engine, but the strong dollar chipped away at its power. The average sales price for the iPhone globally at the end of 2015 was $691, according to Luca Maestri, Apple\u2019s chief financial officer. But he said the strong dollar reduced the effective sales price by $49, or roughly 7 percent.Apple\u2019s share price, which buoyed the overall stock market in past years, fell 4.6 percent in 2015 and dropped more than 11 percent through Jan. 27. Since, then, though, Apple shares have risen more than 13 percent.The dollar\u2019s direction has been changing recently as well. On a trade-weighted basis, after gaining more than 9 percent in 2015, it has weakened by nearly 2.5 percent this year. That has helped American companies with significant international earnings, especially technology companies. Within the S.&P. 500 index, half of that sector\u2019s earnings come from outside the United States.Compare that with the utility companies in the index: They obtain only 4.4 percent of their earnings abroad. Over the last 12 months, utilities, which pay hefty dividends and have been insulated from the dollar\u2019s fluctuations, have returned 15.5 percent, compared with 6.6 percent for information technology shares. Since late January, tech shares have nearly kept pace with utilities. The decline in the dollar has helped account for that.Where the dollar heads now is a matter for pure speculation. Clearly, the Federal Reserve\u2019s shifting monetary policy is important. As John Higgins, chief markets economist for Capital Economics, put it, the Fed \u201cappears to have turned more dovish, which has undermined the dollar.\u201d In an election year in which the trade deficit is a major issue, you wouldn\u2019t be sticking your neck out very far in assuming that the Fed might retain a dovish bias and that the dollar might remain fairly weak.That said, the Fed couldn\u2019t entirely control the dollar\u2019s value, even if it wanted to do so. Foreign exchange rates are determined by traders who compare currencies, many of which have been weakened by their own sputtering local economies and by central banks that have adopted near-zero or negative short-term interest rates. In comparison, the United States may be a bastion of stability, and the dollar could rise.It is quite possible, in short, that the dollar\u2019s ebb has given companies like Apple only a temporary reprieve. And the dollar is only one ingredient in Apple\u2019s corporate mix. Other transient factors \u2014 the iPhone\u2019s shape and power, the Apple Watch\u2019s price and appearance, and the security of Apple\u2019s devices \u2014 may play a more dominant role in determining Apple\u2019s fortunes.Obsess about that if you must, but don\u2019t underestimate the dollar.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "To Woo Apple, Foxconn Bets $3.5 Billion on Sharp", "Date": "2016-03-30", "News": "Supported byHONG KONG \u2014 The Apple iPhone transformed the technology industry by popularizing the smartphone and blazing a path to a mobile future. But to do it, the company needed an important ally: a penny-pinching Taiwan-based factory operator named Foxconn.Employing hundreds of thousands of workers at vast facilities in mainland China, Foxconn figured out a way to assemble the iPhone at a cost low enough that middle-class Americans could afford it. The business offered low profit margins, but the work buffed Foxconn\u2019s financial results and cemented its status as the world\u2019s largest maker of hardware for companies like Apple and Sony.Those relationships are now shifting \u2014 and Foxconn is betting heavily to keep up.On Wednesday, Foxconn said it had struck a deal to acquire control of the Japanese screen maker Sharp for $3.5 billion, after weeks of negotiations and high-profile setbacks.The deal, for a 66 percent stake in Sharp, is intended to make Foxconn a more attractive partner for Apple. The American technology company uses Sharp screens, which could give Foxconn added leverage in dealings between the two.The screen is an especially lucrative piece of the smartphone, costing as much as $54 each, according to estimates by the research firm IHS. Sharp provides roughly 25 percent of the iPhone displays, IHS said.Still, the Sharp purchase will saddle Foxconn with an ailing business that will take considerable money and effort to turn around, some analysts say. Reflecting those problems, the purchase price is $2 billion lower than a deal the two sides struck just last month, after Sharp disclosed the potential for costly problems \u2014 nearly $3 billion in potential liabilities \u2014 down the road.But Apple has been diversifying its supply chain, giving some production contracts to other assemblers and component makers. And Foxconn is grappling with China\u2019s rising labor costs and a slowdown in the global smartphone market.The deal highlights the huge pressure that the industry\u2019s shifting dynamics are placing on Foxconn.\u201cOn the one hand, you can see why Foxconn is trying to do it. It\u2019s not clear the economics make sense, but it\u2019s that they need to control more and more of the supply chain,\u201d said Willy C. Shih, a professor at Harvard Business School. He noted that Apple might soon switch to screens made by other producers.The deal is a return to form for Foxconn \u2014 formally known as Hon Hai Precision Industry \u2014 in its emphasis on scale. The company has been looking in recent years for ways to further cut costs, including investment in automation. It has also expanded into businesses potentially more lucrative than unskilled-work manufacturing, opening factories producing new technology like batteries for electric cars. It even created incubators to help hardware start-ups.Foxconn, most of whose factories are in China, is emblematic of the challenges facing the Chinese economy at large. Even while it tries to maintain the huge scale and efficiency of its production base, it is trying to climb the value chain to find new, more profitable streams of revenue.Near Beijing, Foxconn operates a hardware incubator called Innoconn, which helps start-ups with production management while looking for investment targets.Liu Haoyang, a founder of Noitom, a company that makes motion-capture sensors and hardware, said Foxconn had approached Noitom when it was seeking crowdfunding for a sample product in 2014. Ultimately, Foxconn gave Noitom advice, and it now helps Noitom produce, Mr. Liu said.\u201cThey make parts of high complexity for us,\u201d he said. \u201cAverage factories aren\u2019t able to make this type of thing, never mind in small batches.\u201dFoxconn, founded in Taiwan as a maker of television knobs in 1974 by Mr. Gou, became a company with more than $100 billion in annual revenue by making things for other companies. Starting in the 1990s, as orders poured in to make personal computers, Mr. Gou built new and larger factories in China, culminating in the city-size Longhua plant in Shenzhen, near Hong Kong.At the Longhua complex, Foxconn coordinates more than 100,000 workers assembling devices \u2014 including the iPhone \u2014 in daily and nightly shifts, and the feeding, clothing and planning for the turnover of workers are gargantuan challenges. The company developed recreation facilities for the campus and designed a kitchen able to churn out the huge amounts of food necessary to feed tens of thousands of workers each day.A marvel of modern manufacturing, the Longhua plant is the most extreme example of Foxconn\u2019s philosophy of maximizing efficiency through enormous scale, though in some ways the Longhua plant has proved too large. It was there in 2010 that a series of worker suicides drew international scrutiny from workers\u2019 rights groups and the news media. The company put nets on the sides of buildings to catch would-be jumpers. On many buildings the nets still sag today.Foxconn\u2019s sales growth has slowed to single-digit percentages in the last two years from the double-digit growth it posted in the past, although profit growth has picked up recently, thanks in part to consumers buying bigger, more expensive phones with bigger screens.While Foxconn\u2019s revenue has been padded by booming orders for less-expensive Chinese-branded smartphones, increased competition from China-based suppliers has been a concern highlighted by analysts. Also, Apple, as part of its efforts to diversify its supply chain, has given orders for iPhone assembly to Pegatron, another Taiwan-based contract manufacturer, which operates a huge factory near Shanghai.Foxconn\u2019s previous takeovers of screen makers have not played out well. In 2010, it took over a Taiwan screen maker, Chimei Innolux, for nearly $10 billion; analysts say the acquisition has failed to produce the efficiencies and profitability hoped for.In Sharp, Foxconn picks up screen-making operations that have long been unprofitable and costlier than those of its rivals in China. Alberto Moel, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein, said the Sharp acquisition would probably distract Foxconn from more important ventures, while also proving difficult to integrate and turn into a profitable business.\u201cTerry Gou is going to have to do some serious restructuring, spinouts, carve-outs, reduced head counts, centralizing things, and he\u2019ll have to do it at a distance, across a sea with management he doesn\u2019t really control,\u201d Mr. Moel said. \u201cIt won\u2019t be easy.\u201dCao Li contributed research from Beijing, and Pradnya Joshi from New York.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Europe\u2019s Antitrust Enforcer on Google, Apple and the Year Ahead", "Date": "2016-03-06", "News": "Supported byBitsBRUSSELS \u2014 Margrethe Vestager is already having a busy 2016.Her aggressive positions have made the 47-year-old Danish politician \u2014 said to be among the inspirations behind \u201cBorgen,\u201d a critically acclaimed TV show described as Denmark\u2019s answer to \u201cThe West Wing\u201d \u2014 a poster child for Europe\u2019s somewhat combative relationship with United States tech giants.Ms. Vestager sat down with The New York Times last week to discuss her priorities for the year, the issues underpinning her competition investigations and whether she unfairly targets American companies. The interview has been condensed and edited for clarity.What\u2019s obvious is that it\u2019s not just important to open cases, but important to close cases, too. But as some of the antitrust cases we have ongoing are huge, that\u2019s not necessarily going to happen in 2016. I expect in the merger field we will keep busy, and we\u2019ll keep our focus on antitrust and state aid issues.Since we aren\u2019t done yet, we can\u2019t yet go through the different elements of the statement of objections. But Google gave us a very substantial answer, and what we need to do is ask them for more data to have a comprehensive picture so they aren\u2019t just giving us data that solely substantiates their position.It\u2019s a huge task. We\u2019re doing our best with the analysis, but it\u2019s also interesting to see how legitimate third parties [that have filed complaints in the case] also look at it.I have learned that to do antitrust at this volume takes the patience of steel. Speed is itself a quality because we have big companies whose names are being mentioned over and over again, so you have to think about that.But speed isn\u2019t a quality unto itself. You can\u2019t substitute justice with speed. You need to be able to say this will hold up in court. Then, speed is a secondary issue.That depends. Other complaints related to online mapping or local search are similar, as they say Google uses its position to promote itself in neighboring markets. That is very similar to the current statement of objections.The biggest American tech companies face intensifying scrutiny by European regulators, with \u2014 pressure that could potentially curb their sizable profits in the region and affect how they operate around the world.Then we have issues that are different in nature. One is scraping [allegations that Google copies content from other sites]; another is the question of advertising [claims that Google abuses its dominance in advertising contracts]; and then we have Android, which is almost another planet. We will become much wiser as we go in-depth in these areas.It\u2019s not black or white. The questions people have been asking are whether data can be duplicated, and can a competitor establish itself in the same way or buy a copy of another\u2019s data?So far, the analysis shows that data can be copied or newly created without any detrimental effects to competitors. That\u2019s why I have approached this area with a very open mind.That doesn\u2019t necessarily have to be a problem.But I still think Adam Smith was right when he said there\u2019s no such thing as a free lunch. Eventually, you will pay in one form or the other. And it\u2019s that \u201cother\u201d that is still hard to grasp because we are just in the process of truly appreciating the value of our own data.National tax legislation and European state aid rules need to be fulfilled at the same time. For me, it\u2019s a simple question of fair competition.Companies compete door to door with similar products, prices and services. If one company has higher costs and another company has lower costs solely because of aggressive tax arrangements, then you have a problem.There\u2019s a lot of convenience in that argument. I\u2019ve been asking my people to give me the statistics to find a bias, and I can find no bias. Not in the mergers, not in the fines being paid out, there\u2019s no U.S. bias. It also ignores the fact that we often react to complaints from U.S. companies.These are huge companies that play a very strong role in the market. But you still have many, many, many more companies that are on their way, that want to make it into the market, and that need open markets for the incentive to innovate.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Judge in Apple Case Seen as Unfazed by Stress, Even a Plane Crash", "Date": "2016-03-21", "News": "Supported byRIVERSIDE, Calif. \u2014 Just before Christmas in 2003, a twin-engine Cessna plane crashed into the Claremont, Calif., home of Sheri N. Pym. The house was destroyed and the pilot was killed.Judge Pym, then a lawyer in the United States attorney\u2019s office in Riverside, Calif., was unharmed, as were her husband and children. She was later matter-of-fact in recounting the tale.\u201cA plane crashed into my house. Not good,\u201d she told Stephen G. Larson, who was then a judge in the Federal District Court for the Central District of California.\u201cSomeone else might get overly excited, but Sheri was incredibly steady,\u201d said Mr. Larson, now a local lawyer. \u201cShe stays calm under pressure.\u201dWhen \u2014 or if \u2014 the case should return the courtroom, Judge Pym, 48, is likely to scrutinize Apple on its opposition to weakening the security of the iPhone and also to examine the Justice Department\u2019s legal arguments for pushing the company to do so.\u201cShe really needs to think this through\u201d because subsequent judges will \u201cclosely read\u201d her opinion, said Patrick J. Coughlin, who oversaw Judge Pym when they both worked as lawyers at the Southern California law firm Milberg Weiss.If Judge Pym should rule on the case, an appeal is likely from Apple or the Justice Department \u2014 or both. It could go to the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit and then to the Supreme Court.Judge Pym did not respond to calls seeking comment.Over a more than two-decade legal career, Judge Pym has not specialized in technology or privacy cases. During stints as a federal judge, federal prosecutor and an associate at Milberg Weiss, she instead worked on a variety of cases, including mortgage fraud, tobacco-related litigation and prison assaults.The technology company has been locked in a major legal battle against law enforcement officials over privacy and security.But Judge Pym is not unfamiliar with the tech industry. About a third of her work at Milberg Weiss focused on class-action lawsuits that involved Silicon Valley tech companies, Mr. Coughlin said.She has been a magistrate judge since 2011, and her duties have included handling petty offenses and misdemeanors, as well as pretrial matters, conducting settlement conferences and sometimes trials \u2014 the sort of work that rarely draws national attention.Yet with the national spotlight now on her, several of Judge Pym\u2019s former colleagues said she would not be fazed by the situation.\u201cWhen the Apple thing broke, I looked to see who the judge was, and I almost fell off the chair when I saw that it was Sheri,\u201d said Timothy G. Blood, a partner at Blood Hurst & O\u2019Reardon, who worked on consumer protection class-action cases with Judge Pym when she was at Milberg Weiss. \u201cShe can completely handle it. When a plane hit her house, her attitude was, \u2018What are you gonna do?\u2019 \u201dJudge Pym, a Seattle native, graduated with a philosophy degree from Williams College in 1989 before going into law. (Her husband, Peter G. Thielke, is a philosophy professor at Pomona College in Claremont.)Judge Pym then became an assistant United States attorney in the Central District of California in 2002, rising to chief of the Riverside office in 2006, where she worked on everything from felonies to misdemeanors.\u201cShe took care of what we called \u2018C.V.B.\u2019 matters, which are misdemeanors and citations that are the least-attractive cases,\u201d said Mr. Larson, who has filed a brief in the Apple case in support of the government\u2019s position. \u201cShe handled them with the same care and attention that others might give the most glamorous cases.\u201dJudge Pym and another judge in the United States District Court for the Central District of California in Riverside, David T. Bristow, have been involved in making decisions about search warrants in the investigation. On Feb. 16, Judge Pym ordered Apple to comply with the government\u2019s request to weaken its iPhone security so that law enforcement officials could extract data from the device used by Mr. Farook.Mr. Coughlin, who worked with Judge Pym at Milberg Weiss and is now an lawyer at Robbins Geller Rudman & Dowd, said he disagreed with Judge Pym\u2019s original order compelling Apple to help break into the iPhone.\u201cI know Sheri would have thought the original order through very carefully,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen she finally makes her decision, you won\u2019t find any holes in her opinion.\u201dDoris Burke contributed research from New York.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Google and Apple: the High-Tech Hippies of Silicon Valley", "Date": "2016-03-28", "News": "Supported byWhy are the two companies spending billions to build offices that look lifted straight from the 1960s?11 PhotosFor all the talk of \u201cdisruption\u201d coming out of Silicon Valley, one thing that has tended to remain stubbornly stuck in the past is tech companies\u2019 architecture. Many of today\u2019s most innovative companies are housed in deadly dull, boxy and glassy suburban campuses: Google lives in the rehabbed buildings once occupied by Silicon Graphics, Facebook in a laboratory from the 1960s. Though the interiors might have advanced lighting systems, state-of-the-art fitness facilities and cafeterias serving farm-to-table fare, the exteriors \u2014 flat, unarticulated facades; ribbon windows; hard right angles \u2014 could come from any suburban office corridor anywhere in the country, and from any moment in the past half-century.This is why the recently revealed plans for the new campuses of Google, in Mountain View, Calif., designed by Bjarke Ingels and Thomas Heatherwick, and Apple, in Cupertino, from Sir Norman Foster, are so striking: They, like the companies they will house, point to the future \u2014 the future, that is, as it looked in the 1960s. Images of the projected Apple campus \u2014 a four-tiered ringlike structure nestled in a thickly wooded landscape \u2014 evoke the landing of an alien spaceship. The central structure in Ingels\u2019s and Heatherwick\u2019s design is canopied by a sinuous glass membrane, a protective bubble or amniotic sac, shielding an entire section of the campus \u2014 not just buildings but bike paths and desks \u2014 while letting the abundant Northern California light stream in. In aerial renderings it looks like larvae, incubating a new and possibly terrifying future.Like the rest of Silicon Valley, however, this future is in fact rooted in the past. It comes, transfigured, from the wrecked dreams of communal living, of back-to-the-land utopias, of expanding plastic spheres and geodesic domes that populated the landscape of Northern California around the time (and around the same place) that the first semiconductors were being perfected. This is the world of what a recent exhibit at the Walker Art Center in Minneapolis has termed \u201cHippie Modernism.\u201d Out of the ferment of the \u201960s came a spectacular brew of experiments that softened the edge of the bureaucratic architecture of Modernism and explored new shapes and styles of building, new ideas about how to live and work. In the world of the counterculture, round and pliant was good; sharp and angular was bad. These concepts found their way into the cinema \u2014 into the soft plastic finishes of the circular, rotating space station in Stanley Kubrick\u2019s \u201c2001: A Space Odyssey,\u201d where it was the antithesis of the sourceless, death-bringing black slab monolith, itself almost the clone of that icon of corporate Modernism, Mies van der \u00adRohe\u2019s Seagram Building. Now those same undulations have found their way back to us, in the form of impregnable corporate campuses for the future-plotting, world-dominating, \u201cdon\u2019t be evil\u201d tech industry.It may sound unlikely, but there is in fact a strong connection between the utopian movements of the \u201960s and the tech industry; it\u2019s a topic that\u2019s been well explored by academics, most notably in Stanford professor Fred Turner\u2019s wonderful 2006 history \u201cFrom Counterculture to Cyberculture.\u201d Turner\u2019s book centers on the role played by Merry Prankster-turned-designer Stewart Brand, whose magazine The Whole Earth Catalog, started in 1968 and regularly published through 1972, advocated \u201960s ideals of autonomy, do-it-yourself design and deep ecological thinking. The cover of the first issue was an image of the earth \u2014 another sphere \u2014 taken from space, exemplifying its spirit of holism. Brand advertised where you could get tools to build out the new society, among them, critically, new technology, from calculators to Moog synthesizers, which connected him, and the counterculture, to the burgeoning tech scene. Kevin Kelly, a co-founder of Wired and one of the editors of The Whole Earth Catalog, thought that the magazine\u2019s ethos of sharing products and communications, even its cobbled-together design, prefigured the blog. The young Steve Jobs, for one, was a huge fan. \u201cOn the back cover of their final issue,\u201d Jobs told graduating Stanford students in a 2005 commencement speech, \u201cwas a photograph of an early morning country road, the kind you might find yourself hitchhiking on if you were so adventurous. Beneath it were the words: \u2018Stay Hungry. Stay Foolish.\u2019\u200a\u201d Brand himself would later call Jobs one of the exemplary fusers of the counterculture and technology.Brand was also an enthusiast for countercultural design ideas as a way to build a new society. In an issue from 1971, he called for the creation of an \u201cOutlaw Area,\u201d a territory removed from civilization, where human community could be reinvented. \u201cAny design fantasy is just loose talk until it happens,\u201d he wrote, suggesting that the Outlaw Area would transform our understanding of what human beings were capable of, \u201cbending reality off into unimaginable directions with no restrictions save the harsh ones of nature.\u201dThe designers who followed up on Brand\u2019s injunctions over the next decade would create forms that startlingly presage the new office worlds being designed by Google and Apple. Above all, they would take to heart the idea of \u201cbending reality,\u201d with their embrace of soft, flexible, organic forms. Architects became attracted to furniture and buildings that resembled bubbles. As the design critic Alastair Gordon observed in his book \u201cSpaced Out: Radical Environments of the Psychedelic Sixties,\u201d not only did the trippy shimmer of the bubble delight the hippies, its transparency and unpredictable movement seemed at once stimulating and human. The visionary architect Buckminster Fuller\u2019s famous concept of a \u201cgeodesic dome,\u201d a giant all-purpose shelter, drew heavily on bubble imagery. Meanwhile, students at Antioch College in Ohio conceived of a \u201cNomadic/Pneumatic Campus,\u201d an outdoor classroom sheltered by a 40-foot-high polyvinyl canopy. For a time the \u201coffices\u201d of The Whole Earth Catalog, in their temporary digs in California\u2019s Saline Valley, were sheltered in just such a bubble. The fact that they were temporary was the key: Like the conversion of garages into tech offices, the bubble shelter was meant to be forgiving, improvisatory, for a nomadic and restless society seeking a new relationship with how to fuse life and work.Not that these future society plans were limited entirely to the planet. In 1969, Princeton physics professor, Gerard O\u2019Neill, and his students began to imagine how to create a space colony to house a million people. O\u2019Neill\u2019s vision comprised two concentric cylinders (round forms, again), spinning in opposite directions to generate gravity, and on which each person would be allotted five acres of land. The designer Don Norman did a rendering of the concept, and it bears a striking resemblance to the images of the new Google office: Filled with dazzling foliage, plentiful water and bucolic housing, it looks a lot like Marin County, placed under glass.These images and experiments fueled the imagination of Silicon Valley, even as the young tech entrepreneurs began converting their ramshackle means to far different ends. It was, after all, an earth held in common that inspired the hippie Modernists to find new ways of designing and living. The new unearthly Silicon Valley campuses represent the triumph of privatized commons, of a verdant natural world sheltered for the few. Neither the Google nor Apple campus is open to the public, nor are their designs replicable on the scale that the \u201960s utopians imagined for their designs. Well after the orchards of Northern California were overwhelmed by glass boxes and suburban tracts, the tech companies find themselves looking longingly at an Edenic, prelapsarian moment, when it seemed that \u2014 to adapt a more recent slogan \u2014 another world was possible. But what was originally borne from improvisation and a desire to live simply is now borne from unimaginable mountains of cash. The new Apple office will cost an estimated $5 billion, making it possibly the most expensive office building in history. We are dealing with a bubble of a different kind.A subheading on Page 116 this weekend with an article about plans for the new Silicon Valley headquarters of Google and Apple, and the ways in which they are influenced by utopian-minded 1960s ideas, refers incorrectly to the design of one of the headquarters. It is the design of Google\u2019s headquarters \u2014 not of Apple\u2019s \u2014 that can be said to resemble larvae. The article also refers incorrectly to the technology company Silicon Graphics. Although the company went bankrupt in 2009, its assets were purchased by another company, and today it operates as Silicon Graphics International; it is not \u201clong-defunct.\u201dAdvertisement"}

That is now happening to both Apple and Yahoo, in two very different ways.Everyone involved thinks that if this case should continue, it could ultimately go before the Supreme Court, as we try to establish law in a new world of instant communications and powerful computing, but first decisions matter. Later courts, along with the lawyers on both sides, will study the way Judge Sheri Pym thinks about the arguments over corporate and federal rights.Yahoo could wish for such control over its fortunes, or such a near-certain profit outlook.

{"Headline": "Spotify Expected to Sign $1 Billion Financing Deal", "Date": "2016-03-29", "News": "Supported bySpotify is about to close on a $1 billion deal that would double the amount of financing the music-streaming company has raised since its founding a decade ago, people briefed on the matter said Tuesday.The money comes in the form of convertible debt, which allows Spotify\u2019s investors to change their securities into equity at a future date, said the people, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the deal was not yet public.By using convertible debt, Spotify obtains the funds, without needing to change its valuation. The terms of the debt, however, may put pressure on the company to go public sooner. The company had an equity value of $8.4 billion last year.Funds associated with the private equity firm TPG as well as the investment firm Dragoneer put in $750 million of the $1 billion, with the rest coming from other institutional investors, the people said. The transaction, which was placed by Goldman Sachs, is expected to close on Friday, they said.The terms give the investors the ability to convert to equity at a discount to an initial public offering price, two of the people briefed on the matter said. The discount increases if Spotify waits longer than a year to do so, they said. The coupon payment on the debt would also continue to rise over time, the people said.Different music streaming services have varying costs, platforms and catalog sizes. See how some of the most popular companies stack up against one another.TPG Special Situations Partners, an $18 billion fund within TPG that does transactions other than leveraged buyouts, participated in the deal, as did TPG Growth, which has invested in other start-ups like Uber and Airbnb.Spotify may use the funds for acquisitions, investments and international expansion, the people said.As consumers have turned from CDs and downloads to streaming, Spotify has developed a powerful position in the music industry, helping albums by young stars like Drake, Justin Bieber and Ed Sheeran reach high levels on the charts. The service has amassed 30 million paying users, far more than any other similar outlet.But Spotify has been challenged by Apple, which introduced a competing service, Apple Music, last year, as well as by a growing array of new streaming outlets. YouTube also introduced a paid version last year, and Pandora, which dominates Internet radio with more than 80 million listeners, is negotiating with record companies to enter the on-demand market alongside Spotify, Apple Music, Tidal and Rhapsody.Spotify, which has both free and paid versions, has also found itself on the defensive as record companies have withheld major new releases for brief periods to try to increase sales on just paid services, which tend to pay higher royalty rates. Lately, new albums by Gwen Stefani, Future and the 1975 have been withheld from Spotify in their opening weeks.For its music, Spotify depends on licensing deals with music companies. It does not have long-term contracts for two of its suppliers. Universal and Warner Music, two of the largest record companies, have had \u201cmonth to month\u201d licensing deals with Spotify for some time, according to two people with knowledge of those deals, which puts Spotify at risk of facing stricter licensing terms in the future, or even, potentially, losing that content.But as Spotify has grown more powerful, the labels and artists have come to need it as much as it needs the music companies.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Apple Gets Tech Industry Backing in iPhone Dispute, Despite Misgivings", "Date": "2016-03-02", "News": "Supported byYet behind the scenes, it took time for some of the tech companies to make the decision to support Apple. Several feared the showdown with the government was too risky and could have far-reaching implications for the tech industry if Apple lost.Those misgivings ultimately did not win the day. About 40 companies and organizations are expected to file court briefs on Thursday backing Apple as it fights a judge\u2019s order to help law enforcement break into an iPhone used by a gunman in the San Bernardino, Calif., terrorist attack last year.Dropbox, Facebook, Google, Microsoft, Snapchat and Yahoo are among the tech companies expected to sign on to briefs in the case, according to people with knowledge of the plans who spoke on the condition of anonymity. More than 40 individuals, including prominent security experts and academics, are also planning to sign briefs, which will focus on themes like free speech, the importance of encryption and concerns about government overreach.The show of support \u2014 including briefs filed on Wednesday by groups like the American Civil Liberties Union and Access Now \u2014 is unusual in its breadth, showing that many in Silicon Valley believe that it could have profound implications on the trustworthiness of their products.Still, several executives at tech companies supporting Apple said they were worried that Apple had picked a fight that could end up backfiring on the rest of the industry. In the days since a magistrate judge in California ordered Apple to bypass security measures on the iPhone, lawyers in some of the companies debated these issues with one another and peers at other firms.All of the executives asked to remain anonymous because their deliberations were private, but their views are shared among others in Silicon Valley.Keith Rabois, a venture capitalist with the firm Khosla Ventures, said he was a strong believer in privacy and encryption \u2014 \u201call the normal Silicon Valley views,\u201d he said \u2014 but worried that Apple could lose the case, setting a legal precedent that could force other companies to compromise the security of their products for law enforcement.\u201cIn my view, this is the wrong case to fight,\u201d Mr. Rabois said. \u201cThere are plenty of other cases with a lot less sympathetic case for the government.\u201dApple\u2019s defenders said the company did not pick this fight \u2014 the government did. Critics of Apple\u2019s approach believe that the company could have quietly complied with the government\u2019s request to help break into the iPhone and then taken a public stand in a more favorable case. But Apple has said that once a tool exists for extracting data from the phone, that tool cannot be made to disappear.Yet whatever doubts Apple\u2019s allies voiced privately, they were in the end insufficient to keep a large number of big companies from signing on to the cause.Dropbox\u2019s general counsel, Ramsey Homsany, said in a statement, \u201cWe stand against the use of broad authorities to undermine the security of a company\u2019s products.\u201dBruce Sewell, Apple\u2019s general counsel, said in a statement, \u201cWe are humbled by the outpouring of support we\u2019ve received from our customers, our colleagues in business, nonprofit organizations, the security community and many others.\u201d He added, \u201cThe groups filing briefs with the court understand, as more and more people have come to realize, that this case is not about one phone \u2014 it is about the future and how we protect our safety and our privacy.\u201dOn Tuesday, Apple filed its formal objection to the government order to open up the iPhone, citing the reasons set forth in a previously filed motion.For many tech companies that were initially concerned by Apple\u2019s opposition to opening up the iPhone in the San Bernardino case, the worries centered not only on whether this was the right case for challenging the government but also on how public perceptions of the fight might reflect on the rest of the industry, according to tech executives involved in the discussions, who spoke on the condition of anonymity.Some of the companies were also concerned that the relationships they had forged with the government might degrade because of Apple\u2019s battle, according to the people involved in the tech industry discussions. In the years since the disclosures by Edward J. Snowden, the former intelligence contractor who released a trove of details on United States government surveillance tactics, some tech companies have been trying to educate members of Congress about online privacy practices.Others were also anxious that Apple\u2019s defiance of the government could lead to congressional efforts to reshape, in ways unfavorable to the tech industry, the Electronic Communications Privacy Act, which privacy advocates and tech companies have long claimed needs an overhaul.And these companies are watching what effect the fight could have on a proposal to establish a national commission that would explore ways to obtain encrypted data from consumers while working to safeguard users\u2019 privacy. The proposed commission, the bill for which was introduced on Monday, would be led by the House Homeland Security Committee chairman Michael McCaul, Republican of Texas, and Senator Mark Warner, Democrat of Virginia.Nick Wingfield reported from Seattle and Mike Isaac from New York.

{"Headline": "White House Officials Soften Approach at RSA Conference", "Date": "2016-03-01", "News": "Supported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Attorney General Loretta E. Lynch joined a parade of Obama administration officials to tech\u2019s home turf on Tuesday. Their message: National security depends on the industry\u2019s cooperation.The heavyweights from Washington arrived against the backdrop of Apple\u2019s fight with the Federal Bureau of Investigation over access to an iPhone and a growing fissure between Washington and Silicon Valley.The F.B.I. is trying to force Apple to write software to help it break into the phone of one of the gunmen in December\u2019s mass shooting in San Bernardino, Calif. The phone is protected by a security scheme that would wipe its data after a series of incorrect password attempts. Apple has so far refused to cooperate, and the company is fighting a court order requiring it to aid investigators.In a speech Tuesday at the RSA Conference, arguably the world\u2019s largest gathering of computer security experts, Ms. Lynch avoided directly addressing the fight with Apple, and emphasized the need to find middle ground.\u201cI know that neither our technology companies nor their leaders have any sympathy for terrorists or criminals who target Americans,\u201d Ms. Lynch told an audience at the city\u2019s Moscone Center. \u201cAnd the Department of Justice will never sacrifice the safety of the American people or the ideals we all cherish.\u201dBut in a stage interview with a Bloomberg journalist, Emily Chang, after her speech, Ms. Lynch was asked what the middle ground would be between the F.B.I. and Apple.\u201cFor me, the middle ground\u201d is to do \u201cwhat the law requires,\u201d Ms. Lynch responded, which drew a smattering of laughter and hisses from the audience. She said law enforcement has for years had Apple\u2019s help getting access to iPhones without controversy, and that \u201chaving the inability to obtain evidence that could save lives is a real risk.\u201dThough it is focused on a tough password mechanism, the Apple controversy is an extension of a decades-long fight between the tech industry and the federal government over the use of encryption technology. Once considered a carefully regulated munition, not unlike a tank, encryption came into wide use with the advent of the commercial Internet and was the key to modern e-commerce.The encryption fight was considered by many in Silicon Valley to have been settled in the 1990s, but the widespread government monitoring of Internet traffic revealed in documents released by Edward J. Snowden, the former government contractor, in 2013 led to the renewal of industry efforts to toughen security.Apple\u2019s fight with the F.B.I. has added to that tension, and a number of other tech companies are expected in the coming days to file court briefs in support of Apple. Among their fears is that creating the software to break into the iPhone could create a backdoor that could be used repeatedly by law enforcement or the spy agencies of other countries.The director of the National Security Agency, Admiral Michael S. Rogers, also attempted a conciliatory tone at the RSA event. Admiral Rogers did not speak to the Apple case, or even mention the word encryption, but repeatedly emphasized the need for partnership and dialogue to fight cyberthreats. \u201cI implore all of us to be part of that constructive dialogue,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s time to stop talking past each other.\u201dIn a speech made nearby at San Francisco\u2019s Commonwealth Club, Defense Secretary Ashton B. Carter acknowledged that encryption had been a \u201chot topic here in the Bay Area,\u201d but said he could not address the Apple case because of the ongoing litigation. Instead, he noted that the Pentagon had a vested interest in strong encryption and that the Defense Department is \u201cthe largest user of encryption in the world.\u201dSecurity experts in the tech industry may not be so quick to embrace conciliation. \u201cYou\u2019re opening a can of worms,\u201d Ron Rivest, a cryptographer and professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, told a separate RSA audience.\u201cThe systems we have are so fragile that trying to have extra keys, or extra ways in, or ways to take them apart is asking for all kinds of trouble,\u201d Mr. Rivest said. \u201cThe good of the country depends on having strong security.\u201dOther cryptographers on the panel with Mr. Rivest agreed, with one notable exception: Adi Shamir, an Israeli cryptographer and co-inventor, with Mr. Rivest and Len Adleman, of the RSA encryption algorithm that became the namesake of the annual security conference.Mr. Shamir argued that Apple had \u201cgoofed\u201d by not complying in the San Bernardino case and for not anticipating that the F.B.I. would ask for help to crack the shooter\u2019s iPhone password.\u201cEven though Apple helped in countless numbers of previous cases, they decided not to comply this time,\u201d Mr. Shamir said. \u201cMy advice would have been, comply this time, and wait for a better test case when the case is not so clearly in favor of the F.B.I.\u201dKatie Benner contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Apple iPhone Standoff Ends, for Now", "Date": "2016-03-29", "News": "Supported byBitsThe Feds solved one mystery, and may have left the rest of us with several more.It was not necessary anymore, the D.O.J. said, because it had been able to get at the data in an iPhones used by Syed Rizwan Farook, a gunman in last year\u2019s mass shooting in San Bernardino, Calif. The government is not saying whether it found anything of interest to its investigation in the phone, nor the method by which it cracked what was held to be a secure device.Neither of those things are particularly great news for Apple. If it was proved there was nothing of interest on the phone, it would not have mattered legally, but it probably would have made Apple\u2019s life easier in the court of public opinion. Hints that there was vital terror information on a phone that Apple did not want cracked would not help its image.More important, the iPhone now seems less secure than Apple itself knew. As the government will not say what vulnerability it exploited, that means every phone out there will potentially carry the flaw.Apple is probably not the only party walking away a little sore from this experience. Most observers were counting on this case to eventually land in the Supreme Court, where we would begin to hash out important issues of personal privacy and public security in an era of strong encryption on consumer devices.Like any good lawsuit, however, it probably does not end here. Apple may sue the government to find out how the phone got hacked, opening the way for a new bout of arguments on corporate needs and state capabilities. If the government is forced to do that, the iPhone will be a stronger, more secure device.One thing is nearly certain: If a newly secure iPhone is someday at the center of a major crime, we are likely to revive something like the lawsuit that just got killed.Advertisement"}

It also supports the Apple Pencil, a digital stylus with pressure sensitivity and angle detection.The iPad Pro is an important prong of Apple\u2019s iPad lineup, a product category where sales have declined for eight consecutive quarters. Apple executives have told investors they are bullish about iPad sales returning to growth, and the company continues to market the device as the future of personal computing.To assess whether there may be a jump in iPad sales anytime soon, we waited a few months after the iPad Pro\u2019s release to gather feedback from some professionals who use it. Our panel of reviewers was Mr. Anderson of Teecom; Stephen Gates, a design director for the global bank Citigroup; and Jennifer Daniel, a graphic designer for The New York Times. They unanimously agreed that while the iPad Pro\u2019s big screen and stylus were helpful for crucial tasks, like mocking up illustrations or giving presentations, they still had to turn to a computer for more powerful apps.Michael Tchao, a vice president for product marketing at Apple, said in an interview that such early reactions to the iPad Pro were not unexpected.\u201cIt doesn\u2019t surprise us that in these early days of iPad Pro, people are gravitating to things they can\u2019t do with a laptop, like sketching with Apple Pencil,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat we\u2019ve seen since the beginning is that as people spend more time with iPad, more and more of their workflows live there.\u201dMr. Gates said Citi designers had used the iPad Pro to work on a new design for a Citi mobile app. Designers used the big iPads to sketch out and present mock-ups of the app and discuss where they wanted images or buttons, for example.The iPad Pro\u2019s big screen and stylus also came in handy in meetings for communicating with clients. A designer can easily use the Apple Pencil to illustrate ideas on the screen for the client and vice versa, he said.Mr. Gates says the Apple Pencil also lets him digitize his whole creative process, from sketching to production \u2014 though a big part of his workflow still involves a computer. Before he bought an iPad Pro, he had tried 20 styluses for sketching illustrations or jotting down ideas, he added.Nonetheless, the iPad Pro primarily helps Citi designers conceive ideas, not create final products, he said. When it comes to production, Mr. Gates said, he moves his initial ideas to a computer to use desktop apps like Adobe Photoshop to refine and polish the designs.He said he thought the iPad Pro could eventually replace his computer, but not yet because of the limitations of the current apps. Many creative apps designed for the iPad Pro focus on the start of the design process, like sketches and rough compositions, while desktop apps have the ability to do more complex image manipulations, animations and other functions.\u201cA lot of the app makers need to look at this as a pro platform and be able to deliver more desktop-class apps,\u201d Mr. Gates said.And while Ms. Daniel found the iPad Pro\u2019s screen to be big and beautiful and said the Apple Pencil felt like an upgrade compared with drawing on her laptop\u2019s trackpad, the tablet can run only two apps at the same time side by side. Ms. Daniel said she preferred having many apps open in multiple windows to juggle more tasks simultaneously.\u201cIt forces me to focus on one thing at a time, which is just not how my brain works,\u201d she said.It doesn\u2019t help that few others at The Times are using the iPad Pro to produce articles, Ms. Daniel added, because she needs to use tools that are directly compatible with other staff members\u2019 computer apps. She can\u2019t make a full leap to the iPad without the rest of the organization adopting it.\u201cAs an illustrator, can the iPad Pro replace a part of my process?\u201d she said. \u201cMaybe for the initial research and writing phase, but it stops when I have to conform to other people\u2019s workflows. Adobe software is a prison, and my work, its prisoners.\u201dShe said the iPad Pro still felt like an object to consume things with, not to make things on.\u201cWhich is fine, I like looking at art as much as I like making it,\u201d she said. \u201cMaybe I\u2019ll put it on the wall and make some cool screen savers for it \u2014 on my MacBook.\u201dEngineers at the firm use iPad Minis and began buying iPad Pros last year for the larger screen and stylus. Mr. Anderson said he enjoyed the ability to see more drawings on the screen and mark up blueprints with the Apple Pencil while on job sites. One complaint: He constantly worries he will lose the Apple Pencil, because there is no compartment to hold it in the iPad.Fewer than a quarter of Teecom\u2019s engineers have iPad Pros, but a year from now the company will probably order more, Mr. Anderson said. Still, he doesn\u2019t see the firm phasing out computers.\u201cFor what we do, it\u2019s not there yet,\u201d he said about the iPad Pro. \u201cEngineers still need that high-powered laptop for the mouse and the ability to have a big screen connected to it.\u201dAdvertisement"}

After some hesitation, many of the technology industry\u2019s biggest names, including Amazon, Facebook, Google, Microsoft, Snapchat and Yahoo, have filed court briefs supporting Apple and challenging the legal foundations of the government\u2019s case.The high commissioner, who usually avoids taking positions aligned with commercial interests, said he felt strongly that American officials needed to weigh the uncertain benefits of gaining access to one phone against the broader effects of breaching personal security.\u201cIn essence, what we have here is an issue of proportionality: In order to possibly \u2014 but by no means certainly \u2014 gain extra information about the dreadful crime committed by Syed Rizwan Farook and his wife in San Bernardino, we may end up enabling a multitude of other crimes all across the world, including in the United States,\u201d he said.The F.B.I. deserves full support in its investigation into the San Bernardino killings, Mr. al-Hussein said, but \u201cthis case is not about a company and its supporters \u2014 seeking to protect criminals and terrorists \u2014 it is about where a key red line necessary to safeguard all of us from criminals and repression should be set.\u201dThe encryption debate was \u201ctoo focused on one side of the security coin, in particular its potential use for criminal purposes in times of terrorism,\u201d Mr. al-Hussein said. \u201cThe other side of the security coin is that weakening encryption protections may bring even bigger dangers to national and international security.\u201dThe high commissioner\u2019s intervention builds on growing awareness and concern among human rights experts about the crucial role of encryption for safeguarding freedom of speech and of opinion.\u201cEncryption and anonymity, separately or together, create a zone of privacy to protect opinion and belief,\u201d David Kaye, a United Nations expert on freedom of expression, said in a report to the United Nations Human Rights Council last year, addressing ways to shield individuals from scrutiny in hostile political, social, religious and legal environments.Advertisement"}

Publishers frustrated with Amazon\u2019s low prices welcomed the new retailer, its iPad device and its willingness to let them set their own prices, with Apple taking a cut of each sale.In urging the Supreme Court to hear the case, Apple Inc. v. United States, No. 15-565, the company said its actions had promoted competition.\u201cIf a new firm\u2019s entry disrupts a monopoly and creates long-term competition, that is to be lauded, whether the previous prices were artificially high or artificially low,\u201d the brief said.The Supreme Court\u2019s refusal to hear the case is a victory for Amazon, which maintains a dominant position in e-book sales. The online retailer helped precipitate the case by complaining to the Justice Department about the actions of Apple and the publishers.Amazon issued a brief statement on Monday, saying, \u201cWe are ready to distribute the court-mandated settlement funds to Kindle customers as soon as we\u2019re instructed to move forward.\u201dHe said that he and his wife each received a couple of hundred dollars from the settlements paid earlier by book publishers in the case, and Apple\u2019s payment to e-book buyers, expected later this year, will be roughly double that amount.Apple declined to comment beyond the briefs it had filed in the case.The case began in 2012, when the Justice Department accused Apple and five publishers of conspiring to raise e-book prices above Amazon\u2019s standard of $9.99 for new titles. With encouragement from Apple, the publishers introduced an agency model of pricing, in which they set the sale price of e-books rather than allowing the seller to charge what it wished.The five publishers settled the antitrust case, but Apple went to trial.Judge Cote relied in part on the words of Steven P. Jobs, the company\u2019s co-founder, who died in 2011.\u201cI can live with this, as long as they move Amazon to the agent model too for new releases,\u201d Mr. Jobs, who was then Apple\u2019s chief executive, wrote to Eddy Cue, Apple\u2019s senior vice president for Internet software and services. \u201cIf they don\u2019t, I\u2019m not sure we can be competitive.\u201dJudge Cote said that the company had no good explanation for that and other communications. \u201cApple has struggled mightily to reinterpret Jobs\u2019s statements in a way that will eliminate their bite,\u201d she wrote. \u201cIts efforts have proven fruitless.\u201dMike Shatzkin, chief executive of The Idea Logical Company, a consultancy to book publishers, predicted the resolution of the case would have little impact on the book publishing industry. While the move to agency pricing first helped smaller players like Barnes & Noble and its Nook e-readers, subsequent changes in book pricing contracts have once again bolstered Amazon.\u201cThere are still real hard times ahead for the publishers because Amazon\u2019s market share is so large that they are bound to take more and more margin from publishers,\u201d he said.Adam Liptak reported from Washington and Vindu Goel from San Francisco.Advertisement"}

Facebook\u2019s international headquarters are in Dublin.The change means the company will pay taxes in Britain on its local sales, as opposed to the current structure, in which Facebook primarily pays taxes through its Irish operation. The new structure will take effect in early April, according to the company.\u201cU.K. sales made directly by our U.K. team will be booked in the U.K., not Ireland,\u201d Lena Pietsch, a Facebook spokeswoman, said in a statement on Friday. \u201cFacebook U.K. will then record the revenue from these sales.\u201dWhile Facebook did not disclose how much more British tax it would pay, it is likely the company will pay significantly more than it currently does on its operations in Britain.In 2014, the latest year for which records are available, Facebook paid a mere $6,100 in British corporation tax, or slightly less than the average British worker paid in income tax.From 2008 to 2014, it paid a combined $1.2 million in taxes to the British government, while recording a $76.5 million loss over the same period, according to DueDil, a data research company.That compares with $16.2 million in taxes that Facebook paid to Ireland\u2019s tax authorities from 2008 to 2014, according to company filings analyzed by DueDil. Facebook had $3.6 million in pretax profit on its Irish operations over the period.The biggest American tech companies face intensifying scrutiny by European regulators, with \u2014 pressure that could potentially curb their sizable profits in the region and affect how they operate around the world.Facebook\u2019s efforts to revamp its accounting structure in Britain follow changes in the country\u2019s tax laws aimed at forcing companies to pay more tax on revenue generated there.The so-called Google tax \u2014 officially called the diverted profits tax \u2014 charges companies a 25 percent tax rate on profits on British revenue that the country\u2019s tax authorities consider to be artificially moved overseas to avoid the British system.For many American tech companies, many of which use complicated tax structures through the likes of Ireland and Luxembourg to reduce their global tax burdens, Europe\u2019s more aggressive stance is starting to bite.Along with its continuing negotiations with French and Italian tax authorities over potential back taxes, Google also recently agreed to pay an extra $183 million in taxes to the British government to cover the 10-year period through 2015.Advertisement"}

After all, once you have the contract for the American Olympic team, not to mention the N.B.A., dozens of top tennis stars and assorted soccer teams, growth has to come from somewhere else. It is not an accident that Nike\u2019s big reveal is being staged in Moynihan Station, an official site of New York Fashion Week, and was designed by Bureau Betak, the production company that has masterminded elaborate runway shows for Christian Dior, Roberto Cavalli and Michael Kors.Fashion, Nike is coming for you.Last summer, Nike opened an invitation-only training facility on Grand Street in Lower Manhattan where glossy-magazine-ites do yoga and work out with assorted models and other influencers. A few seasons ago, for fashion week, the company created a \u201cconcierge\u201d program to keep editors fit as they went to London, Milan and Paris (a time when exercise and healthy habits notoriously go by the wayside). Among its devotees are Cindi Leive, the editor of Glamour; Stefano Tonchi, the editor of W; Michael Carl, fashion market director of Vanity Fair; and Ariel Foxman, editorial director of In Style.\u201cThere\u2019s no sense of a quid pro quo,\u201d Ms. Leive said. \u201cIt never feels grasping.\u201d It is presented, rather, as an experience Nike can finesse for its fashion community, just as in the larger world it has created Nike Training Club and Nike Run Club, free apps that suggest tailored training programs for members.The effect of all this is simple: While Nike may not overtly identify itself as a fashion brand, and while traditional runway names may not see it as a competitor, to consumers considering what piece of clothing to buy, it increasingly seems like one and the same.For years, sportswear (the official fashion term for separates) and the clothing actually worn to play sports grew on parallel tracks, but recently the lines have begun to bend, and they are now on a convergence course. When they hit, the result may be as disruptive as the explosive growth of fast fashion a decade ago.Around the same time, Goldman Sachs and Teen Vogue surveyed female millennials ages 13 to 29 \u2014 the consumer group with which fashion is most obsessed \u2014 to establish their \u201clove list.\u201d In it, Nike was No. 2 in the \u201ctop 50 brands fashion forward girls love the most,\u201d after the makeup brand MAC and before Marc Jacobs (18) and Kate Spade (21).\u201cThe affinity gap between fashion and athletic continues to narrow for the third year in a row,\u201d the survey\u2019s authors wrote.According to Marshal Cohen, the chief industry analyst of the NPD Group, this is \u201ca game changer.\u201d It is being driven by the relaxation of strict professional and social dress codes; changing consumer values, which prioritize comfort, achievement and sustainability over aesthetics alone; and the awakening of the sports world to the power of style. And while it is not entirely lost on fashion, as the introduction of performance collections such as Tory Sport and Derek Lam\u2019s 10c Athleta collaboration indicate, such nascent brand extensions may have the unforeseen effect of both legitimizing athleticwear as acceptable everyday clothing, and underscoring the expertise of the traditional sports brands in this area.Last year, Nike revenues increased 10 percent, to $30.6 billion, and its women\u2019s sector was up 15 percent, to $5.7 billion. By 2020, Mark Parker, Nike\u2019s chief executive, said he wants women\u2019s wear to have doubled, to $11 billion. And while some of that will come from performancewear, a lot of it will come from what Nike calls the \u201ceveryday athlete,\u201d and its version of \u201csportswear\u201d: styles that go from the gym to the office or home.Nike is not the only sports brand wanting to capitalize on the blurring of clothing definitions. At the introduction of a new women\u2019s sneaker in January, Ben Herath, the vice president for design, running, for Adidas, said \u201ca lot of light bulbs have gone off internally in terms of potential.\u201d The company has long worked with such fashion names as Yohji Yamamoto, Stella McCartney and Rick Owens. Puma is aggressively moving into the market via Rihanna and her collection Fenty x Puma, which debuted on the catwalk at New York Fashion Week. But Nike is the largest of the group \u2014 at $105.27 billion, its market capitalization is approximately four and a half times that of its nearest competitor, Adidas. And unlike those brands, it has approached its infiltration of fashion at a more oblique angle.Before there was Christopher Bailey, the double-duty designer and chief executive of Burberry, there was Mark Parker.Mr. Parker, who began his career at Nike in 1979 as a sneaker designer and who was instrumental in the creation of both the Pegasus (Nike\u2019s most popular running shoe) and the Air Max, was named chief executive in 2006. His office gives his roots away: It looks more like an Aladdin\u2019s cave of art and tchotchkes, from Warhols to Tiffany lamps, Batman shoes and iridescent beetles, than the base of a corporate mogul.5 Photos\u201cI like a lot of visual stimulation,\u201d said Mr. Parker, which is somewhat of an understatement. He also tends to play down his ambitions in the fashion area, saying the concentration on style, and stuff that is worn outside the gym, is a natural part of making a better product and serving his consumer base, be it high-achieving athletes who feel better if they think they look better, as the sprinter Allyson Felix said (the bottoms of her Olympic track spikes were inspired by Mr. Parker\u2019s beetle mosaic, by the artist Christopher Marley), or a woman who doesn\u2019t want to carry three changes of clothes in her gym bag. He refers to this as \u201cdesign thinking,\u201d and has made it one of the tenets of Nike.It was Mr. Parker who approached Marc Newson, an industrial designer, in 2000 to ask if he wanted to collaborate on a project. Mr. Parker had been in discussions with Alexander McQueen before the designer\u2019s death in 2010 \u2014 \u201cHe had 200 pairs of Nikes in his closet,\u201d Mr. Parker said \u2014 but they couldn\u2019t work out the timing. Mr. Parker still \u201cdoodles\u201d on sneakers, producing a special edition of shoes known as Nike HTM with the cult designers Tinker Hatfield and Hiroshi Fujiwara that have become collectibles. He is clearly aware of the opportunity the greater wardrobe represents.\u201cFashion is moving to a place that is more overtly sports-based,\u201d he said. \u201cI realized it when I was in New York a while ago and looking at the Louis Vuitton windows and was surprised to see a shoe almost directly taken from a shoe I had developed in 1983. I was more flattered than anything else.\u201dStill, simply adding oomph to leggings, no matter how cool, would not on its own be enough to make a serious dent in fashion, even if, as Mr. Parker once claimed, \u201cleggings are the new denim.\u201d But eight years ago, sportswear itself became a separate division, like golf and women\u2019s training, tasked with making clothes for \u201cthe commuter, and the kid on the street,\u201d said Kurt Parker, Nike\u2019s vice president for apparel design. \u201cWe realized we were focused on building the most amazing shoe for Allyson Felix to wear for 30 seconds \u2014 but what about the rest of her day? Will we make a dress? Probably not. But we have experimented with a longer skirt.\u201dMeanwhile, the fact that words like \u201clifestyle\u201d and \u201ccharacter\u201d and \u201cauthentic\u201d and \u201cheritage\u201d and \u201ctechnology\u201d and \u201cpersonalization\u201d are increasingly bandied about as crucial factors in fashion purchasing decisions is working to sports brands\u2019 advantage.That athletes are also increasingly being treated like Hollywood stars by the fashion world, sitting front and center at shows and appearing with models like Gisele B\u00fcndchen on the cover of Vogue, in turn creates a style halo around their endorsement partners.(Of course, there are risks: When Maria Sharapova admitted to using a banned drug, Nike suspended her with notable speed, and Kanye West, a former collaborator who now works with Adidas, is currently conducting something of a public war with Nike.)After the sweatshop scandal of the 1990s, which included charges of poor labor conditions and abuses at Asian factories where Nike had outsourced production, the company restructured and has placed sustainability at the core of its identity. The shorts in Nike\u2019s 2014 World Cup uniform were made of 100 percent recycled polyester, and the Flyknit technology, wherein the entire upper part of the shoe is knit into a seamless form, means there is zero material wastage. Hannah Jones, Nike\u2019s chief sustainability officer, said her goal was a \u201cclosed-loop system.\u201dThe drive to make something faster, slicker, lighter, warmer has spilled over into the wearables space. Nike has two design streams going at any given point: one that has to do with long-term technical research and development, and one that focuses on collections released four times a year, like fashion collections, with new colors and prints and silhouettes. When a new material or advance is ready for market, it creeps into the seasonal collections. It took close to three years for Nike to figure out how to make the shoe Mr. Newson, the industrial designer, wanted, with one seamless mold, for example; Nike Shox took 15 years. \u201cWe have to wait for the materials to catch up to the ideas,\u201d Mr. Spiering said.As it happens, Tim Cook, the chief executive of Apple, another outsider company with intentions on the fashion world, is on the Nike board. It could be a coincidence, but if so, it is a telling one.On the western edge of the Nike campus there is a glass and steel building that is not like the others. It is not named after an athlete, like the John McEnroe building, where the executive offices are, or the Tiger Woods, where the conference center is. It is not all blond wood and long corridors, as are the rest of the structures.Rather, it is an airy, loftlike space called Blue Ribbon Design Studio, which opened just a year ago. It is full of bolts of fabric and sewing machines, silk-screen printers and other creative tools, and looks like nothing so much as \u201cart school but better,\u201d according to Ryan Noon, a graduate of Central St. Martins in London, who directs it. Before coming to Nike, he was a print designer for Alexander McQueen. The space even has its own scent, which Mr. Noon created and named \u201cFreedom of the Creative Mind,\u201d a combination of canvas, gesso, sawed wood and \u201csexy Nike designer sweat,\u201d he said. Also its own uniform: graphic light blue and white smocks, \u201clike what they wear in couture ateliers.\u201dBlue Ribbon was built, he said, because Nike realized that its designers needed an unstructured space where they could just play around and make things \u2014 almost anything they wanted. It is the ultimate creative indulgence.\u201cWhen I was at Central St. Martins, everyone looked down on the sports designers,\u201d he said. \u201cNow it\u2019s like one of the hottest jobs.\u201dAs it happens, last September, just before fashion month began, Nike\u2019s Dark Light soccer jersey, a shirt made for the French team Paris St.-Germain, was introduced in the windows of Colette, the destination boutique on Rue St.-Honor\u00e9 in Paris. Nike\u2019s more fashion-forward shoes and apparel, such as its collaborations with Riccardo Tisci, Givenchy\u2019s creative director, and Jun Takahashi, the founder and designer of Undercover, are sold at its own NikeLab stores as well as at Dover Street Market, the high-concept marketplace owned by Comme des Gar\u00e7ons, where \u201cthey attract a whole range of customers, not just the sneaker fans,\u201d said Adrian Joffe, the chief executive of Comme des Gar\u00e7ons.Fashion brands \u201care going to have to run pretty fast to catch up,\u201d said Mr. Cohen of NPD. \u201cIf they don\u2019t do it soon, it will be too late.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "U.S. Says It May Not Need Apple\u2019s Help to Unlock iPhone", "Date": "2016-03-21", "News": "Supported byRIVERSIDE, Calif. \u2014 The Justice Department said on Monday that it might no longer need Apple\u2019s assistance in opening an iPhone used by a gunman in the San Bernardino, Calif., rampage last year.The disclosure led a judge to postpone a court hearing over the issue and temporarily sidesteps what has become a bitter clash with the world\u2019s most valuable publicly traded company.In a new court filing, the government said an outside party had demonstrated a way for the F.B.I. to possibly unlock the phone used by the gunman, Syed Rizwan Farook. The hearing in the contentious case \u2014 Apple has loudly opposed opening the iPhone, citing privacy concerns and igniting a heated debate \u2014 was originally set for Tuesday.While the Justice Department must test this method, if it works \u201cit should eliminate the need for the assistance from Apple,\u201d it said in its filing. The Justice Department added that it would file a status report by April 5 on its progress.The change is a reprieve in the clash that has erupted over how and when the authorities should use the troves of digital data collected and stored by tech companies. The two sides have traded barbs over the issue since last month, when Apple received a court order demanding that the company weaken the security of the iPhone so law enforcement officials could gain access to the data in it.The emergence of a potential third-party method to open the iPhone was a surprise, as the government said more than a dozen times in court filings that it could open the phone only with Apple\u2019s help. The F.B.I. director, James B. Comey Jr., also reiterated that point several times during a hearing before Congress on March 1.The new method could forestall, but is unlikely to entirely head off, a showdown between Silicon Valley and the Justice Department over encryption.\u201cThis will only delay an inevitable fight over whether the government can force Apple to break the security of its devices,\u201d said Alex Abdo, a lawyer with the American Civil Liberties Union, an advocacy group.For the Justice Department, cracking the iPhone would be a mixed blessing. While it would give investigators access to data that they see as crucial to a terrorism investigation, it would cut short the encryption debate that the F.B.I. had been trying to start for years before the Apple case came along.While contentious, the Apple case neatly crystallized that debate in a way that abstract discussions never had. The court fight, regardless of its outcome, would have increased the likelihood that Congress took up legislation to address the issue. Shelving the San Bernardino case could remove a sense of immediacy on the topic.The case could flare anew in court if the third-party method for opening the iPhone falters. In a conference call late Monday, a federal law enforcement official, who spoke to reporters on the condition of anonymity, said the government legally had to explore all outside methods of opening up the iPhone. If the government exhausted those options, then it could turn back to the courts to compel Apple to help open the device.The technology company has been locked in a major legal battle against law enforcement officials over privacy and security.The law enforcement official declined to name the outside party that approached investigators with a possible method for opening the phone. He said that investigators were cautiously optimistic about getting data from the phone, but that further testing is required.The government has been using the All Writs Act, a legal statute that dates to 1789, as a key underpinning of its case.\u201cThe issue at hand is whether the government can use the All Writs Act to force an unwilling third party, Apple, to create what it claims is a back door,\u201d said Joseph DeMarco, a former federal prosecutor who filed a brief on behalf of law enforcement groups that supported the Justice Department in this case. \u201c But if it can find a willing third party to break into the phone, then the All Writs Act argument is moot.\u201dIn a statement, Melanie Newman, a spokeswoman for the Justice Department, said the F.B.I. had continued to work on ways to gain access to the contents of the iPhone used by Mr. Farook, even as the fight between Apple and the government was unfolding.A senior Apple executive, who spoke to reporters on the condition of anonymity late Monday, said should the government fail to unlock the phone and continue its fight with the company, Apple would want to know more about the outside party that has claimed it can break into the iPhone, in order to learn what methods could circumvent the company\u2019s security features. The executive said that Apple had no knowledge of what capability the government might soon have and that it learned about it on Monday.\u201cThis is an issue that impacts all of us and we will not shrink from this responsibility,\u201d Mr. Cook said.An article on Tuesday about the government\u2019s decision to try to unlock a terrorist\u2019s iPhone without Apple\u2019s help misstated the surname of a Justice Department spokeswoman in some copies. She is Melanie Newman, not Newsom.An article on Tuesday about the postponement of a court hearing into whether Apple could be compelled to help the government unlock a terrorist\u2019s iPhone erroneously attributed a distinction to the company. Apple is the world\u2019s largest publicly traded company, not the world\u2019s largest company over all.

{"Headline": "Apple and U.S. Bitterly Turn Up Volume in iPhone Privacy Fight", "Date": "2016-03-10", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The Obama administration argued on Thursday that \u201cno single corporation\u201d \u2014 even one as successful as Apple \u2014 should be allowed to flout the rule of law by refusing to help the F.B.I. unlock the iPhone used by one of the San Bernardino, Calif., attackers.The administration\u2019s sharp tone in a new court filing drew an angry and emotional rebuke from lawyers for Apple, who accused the government of \u201ca cheap shot\u201d and were particularly upset about what they said was an unfair and inaccurate suggestion that the company has a special relationship with China to protect its corporate interests there.\u201cThe tone of the brief reads like an indictment,\u201d Bruce Sewell, Apple\u2019s general counsel, told reporters. \u201cIn 30 years of practice, I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever seen a legal brief that was more intended to smear the other side with false accusations and innuendo.\u201dIn its filing on Thursday in United States District Court in Los Angeles, the Justice Department said that Apple should be compelled to help the F.B.I. break into the iPhone and that the company should not be allowed to hide behind what prosecutors said were diversionary tactics in the court of public opinion.In the filing on Thursday, prosecutors argued that they have sought a \u201cmodest\u201d step in the case and that the courts, the executive branch and Congress \u2014 not Apple \u2014 share the power to decide how best to balance public safety and privacy.\u201cThe rule of law does not repose that power in a single corporation, no matter how successful it has been in selling its products,\u201d prosecutors wrote.The technology company has been locked in a major legal battle against law enforcement officials over privacy and security.The Justice Department also offered a robust defense of the All Writs Act, which dates to 1789. The statute, used to gather evidence in thousands of cases, is an \u201cintegral part of our justice system,\u201d prosecutors wrote.Apple has tried to characterize that statute \u201cas an obscure law dredged up by the government to achieve unprecedented power,\u201d the Justice Department said. \u201cThat premise is false.\u201dThe Justice Department noted in a footnote Thursday that it was appealing the Brooklyn ruling and that the order carried no weight as precedent in the California case.In another footnote, the Justice Department\u2019s tone also turned more ominous, suggesting that it might seek access to Apple\u2019s source code and private electronic signatures if the company does not cooperate. That would go beyond what the government has previously requested, which is the company\u2019s help in weakening the iPhone\u2019s defenses rather than any direct access to the technology.In a rebuttal to the government\u2019s filing, Mr. Sewell of Apple said in a conference call that a number of the government\u2019s charges in its latest brief were unfounded.Mr. Sewell said it was the first time ever that Apple had seen the government assert that it made modifications to specifically block law enforcement officials\u2019 access to its devices. More disturbingly, he said, federal prosecutors used unidentified sources to raise the specter that Apple has a different relationship with China than with other countries.He said such accusations showed that the Justice Department \u201cis so desperate at this point that it has thrown all decorum to the winds.\u201dMr. Sewell likened the Justice Department\u2019s comments on China to Apple arguing that the F.B.I. cannot be trusted because there are rumors that the bureau was behind the assassination of John F. Kennedy and citing \u201cconspiracytheory.com\u201d as its source.\u201cEveryone should beware,\u201d Mr. Sewell said, \u201cbecause it seems that disagreeing with the Department of Justice means you must be evil and un-American.\u201dOn the actual merits of the dispute, Apple\u2019s lawyers reiterated that the government\u2019s interpretation of the All Writs Act was simply wrong and that the authority the government seeks \u201cis breathtaking,\u201d essentially arguing that courts can order any private citizens or companies to do what the authorities want so long as there is jurisdiction.Apple will have another chance to rebut the Justice Department\u2019s case before a hearing scheduled for March 22 before Magistrate Judge Pym. No matter how she rules, the closely watched case is almost certain to be appealed to the district court, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, and perhaps even the Supreme Court.Eric Lichtblau reported from Washington and Katie Benner from San Francisco.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Whole Foods Plans 100 Rooftop Solar Systems", "Date": "2016-03-08", "News": "Supported byThings at Whole Foods are about to get even greener.The grocery chain plans to install as many as 100 rooftop solar systems, mainly through the power provider NRG Energy, on nearly a quarter of its stores and distribution centers, the companies said on Tuesday. SolarCity will also provide systems for the grocer, which could expand the rooftop solar program as the installations proceed.\u201cInstalling solar at Whole Foods locations across the country will increase the percentage of renewable energy that is generated in communities where we work,\u201d Kathy Luftus, global leader in sustainability at the company, said in a prepared statement. NRG plans to install systems in nine states, including California, Colorado, Connecticut, Massachusetts, Nevada and Texas.Solar energy is in keeping with the Whole Foods image but it will also save the company money, because the solar providers can offer electricity at prices below what the stores and centers would normally pay utilities.The grocer has been under pressure to reduce costs as it has faced increasing competition from other chains offering specialty and organic foods at lower prices.For NRG, the move shows that the company, in retreat from an ambitious attempt under its former chief executive, David Crane, to become the Google or Apple of green energy, will pursue the market for renewables on a large scale.The new chief executive, Mauricio Gutierrez, told investors last month that NRG was refocusing on its core business and was in negotiations concerning the fate of the home solar and electric vehicle charging divisions that he expected to complete in the second quarter of this year.\u201cSimplification of our business is an imperative, both for external perception and internal focus,\u201d he said on a conference call. \u201cNot all renewable businesses are viewed the same in terms of fit and value for NRG.\u201dThat means NRG, which has headquarters in Princeton, N.J., and Houston, will continue to invest in large-scale wind and solar, including rooftop systems for commercial and industrial customers like Whole Foods, said Craig Cornelius, senior vice president.The installations, which will range from five to 200 times the size of a typical home array, are attractive, Mr. Cornelius said, because the larger scale allows NRG to replicate a similar design across several sites.\u201cIt really just comes down to streamlined engineering design, economies of scale in equipment purchasing and construction, and the finance-ability of Whole Foods as a quality customer,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "American Tech Giants Face Fight in Europe Over Encrypted Data", "Date": "2016-03-27", "News": "Supported byROME \u2014 Silicon Valley\u2019s battle over encryption is heading to Europe.This week, French lawmakers are expected to debate proposals to toughen laws, giving intelligence services greater power to get access to personal data.The battle has pitted Europe\u2019s fears about the potential for further attacks against concerns from Apple and other American technology giants like Google and Facebook that weakening encryption technologies may create so-called back doors to people\u2019s digital information that could be misused by European law enforcement officials, or even intelligence agencies of unfriendly countries.The recent attacks have pushed many Europeans to favor greater powers for law enforcement over privacy. But opponents say such measures should not undermine the region\u2019s tough data protection rules that enshrine privacy on par with other rights like freedom of expression.This balance between national security and privacy has put major countries in the region on opposite sides of the debate, with Germany and the Netherlands dismissing encryption laws being considered by Britain and France.\u201cFundamental rights are just that, fundamental,\u201d said Nico van Eijk, a data protection expert at the University of Amsterdam. \u201cOf course, there are exceptions for national security reasons. But governments have to be pragmatic.\u201dThat pragmatism has led to a series of new proposals across Europe that, if approved, would give national intelligence agencies renewed powers to compel the likes of Apple, Google and Facebook to hand over encrypted information.And on Tuesday, French politicians will debate proposals to update antiterrorism laws that may hand tech executives prison sentences of up to five years, as well as fine their companies around $390,000, if they refuse to provide encrypted information to the country\u2019s investigators.Amendments to the French law \u2014 itself a response to the attacks in November \u2014 may still pass without the encryption proposals, which are opposed by France\u2019s left-wing government.But politicians and industry executives say Apple\u2019s fight with the F.B.I. has focused a spotlight on how companies\u2019 efforts to protect users\u2019 messages and other data have made it increasingly difficult for European intelligence agencies to obtain such information.\u201cWhen we\u2019re able to recover a cellphone, but authorities have no way of accessing its data, it obviously cripples the work of our surveillance agencies,\u201d said Philippe Goujon, a French politician behind the recent encryption proposals.\u201cSure, this could have repercussions internationally,\u201d he added. \u201cBut there are other countries in the world that have similar legislation.\u201dAll the talk about data privacy can get caught up in political wrangling. But the different approaches have practical consequences for people, too.Europe\u2019s attempts to get access to encrypted data have not gone unchallenged by Apple.Timothy D. Cook, Apple\u2019s chief executive, has, for instance, met with a string of European politicians, including France\u2019s prime minister, Manuel Valls, and Britain\u2019s home secretary, Theresa May, in recent months to lobby for tough encryption technology.And to show that the company is trying to be cooperative, Apple\u2019s executives have also provided unencrypted information, including so-called metadata on people\u2019s phone calls and GPS coordinates, as part of terrorism investigations in Europe, according to a person with knowledge of the matter, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak publicly.Such efforts, in part, have paid off with some European governments that remain skeptical of plans to weaken companies\u2019 encryption technology in the name of national security.Such loopholes, the Dutch government said, would \u201calso make encrypted files vulnerable to criminals, terrorists and foreign intelligence services.\u201dAs pressure in parts of Europe mounts over access to encrypted data, industry watchers say attention is expected to focus on Britain \u2014 a top international market for most American tech companies \u2014 where expanded powers for the country\u2019s intelligence services are likely to come into force by the end of the year. The legislation is the brainchild of the ruling Conservative Party, which has a sufficient parliamentary majority to enact the regulatory changes.Under the proposals, the Investigatory Powers Bill would force Internet and telecommunications companies to hold records of websites visited by people in Britain over the last 12 months. It also would provide the country\u2019s intelligence agencies with a legal mandate for the bulk collection of large quantities of data, while allowing them to hack individual devices under certain situations.Ms. May, Britain\u2019s home secretary, told lawmakers this year that such powers were required to defend the country\u2019s security. She added that the legislation offered sufficient transparency and oversight about how British spies conducted their activities to calm people\u2019s privacy concerns.But for Apple and other Silicon Valley companies, the proposal also includes new powers that can permit the British government to demand that companies remove encryption protections where \u201creasonably practicable\u201d to gain access to digital communications.The British government stresses that such rules would not undermine companies\u2019 services because they may not apply to so-called end-to-end encryption, technology used by the likes of Apple\u2019s iMessage and FaceTime services, as well as Facebook\u2019s WhatsApp Internet messenger.Such concerns, security experts say, could be compounded if other national governments \u2014 either in Europe or farther afield \u2014 followed Britain\u2019s lead by passing similar legislation.Hannah Olivennes contributed reporting from London.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Justice Dept. Appeals Ruling in Apple iPhone Case in Brooklyn", "Date": "2016-03-07", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 In the latest volley in its high-profile fight with Apple, the Justice Department said on Monday that a federal judge in Brooklyn had erred last week in refusing to order the company to unlock a drug dealer\u2019s iPhone.\u201cApple is not being asked to do anything it does not currently have the capability to do,\u201d Justice Department prosecutors said as they appealed the decision made last week by Magistrate Judge James Orenstein of Federal District Court for the Eastern District of New York.The prosecutors argued that their demand for technical help was a routine law enforcement request \u2014 no different from the \u201cdozens\u201d of times that Apple had agreed to cooperate in cases before this one \u2014 and that it \u201cin no way upends the balance between privacy and security.\u201dLawyers and analysts on both sides of the encryption debate are watching the Brooklyn case closely because they believe it could foreshadow the ultimate outcome of the case involving an iPhone used by one of the attackers in the December terrorist rampage in San Bernardino, Calif.The two cases are very different in some ways \u2014 one involves a high-level terrorism investigation, the other an inquiry into a low-level drug dealer \u2014 but both center on whether the Justice Department can use a 1789 statute to force Apple to unlock an iPhone.Unlocking the iPhone in the Brooklyn case would be far easier for Apple, because it involves a device running an older operating system with simpler encryption.In the San Bernardino case, Apple lawyers say the company would have to create an entirely new program to get into the iPhone used by Syed Rizwan Farook, who along with his wife killed 14 people. That phone was running the latest operating system.The San Bernardino case offers prosecutors what they believe is a strong test case to establish the government\u2019s power to force a technology company to unlock its own encryption.Among the factors they cite: The California rampage was the biggest terrorist attack on American soil since Sept. 11, 2001; Mr. Farook is dead; and the phone was owned by his employer \u2014 San Bernardino County, where he worked as an environmental health specialist.The technology company has been locked in a major legal battle against law enforcement officials over privacy and security.\u201cThe government certainly believes they have a very strong set of facts in San Bernardino,\u201d said Eric A. Berg, a former Justice Department lawyer who now works on electronic surveillance issues at a Milwaukee law firm. The Brooklyn case, on the other hand, \u201cmuddies the waters for them in what they\u2019re trying to do.\u201dIn his ruling last week, Judge Orenstein expressed concern that the government was claiming almost limitless authority to compel Apple to cooperate with law enforcement requests. And he noted that while Apple had declined to help the Justice Department unlock this specific phone, \u201cApple is not doing anything to keep law enforcement agents from conducting their investigation.\u201dBut prosecutors, in their appeal on Monday, claimed that Apple was in fact getting in the way by installing certain features on its products. \u201cApple\u2019s software is actively impeding the execution of the search warrant in several ways,\u201d the filing said, adding that Apple\u2019s auto-erase feature, which can wipe the device clean if the passcode is entered incorrectly 10 times, \u201cis the technological equivalent to barring the door.\u201dThe prosecutors\u2019 brief did not address all of Judge Orenstein\u2019s concerns about government overreach, saying that such worries \u201cgo far afield of the present case.\u201d\u201cMuch of Judge Orenstein\u2019s reasoning appears to be driven by a forward-looking concern for preventing future government abuse,\u201d the brief said. Supreme Court precedent on the matter, it added, prohibits judges from \u201cusing speculation about future harm as a basis to bar relief in a specific case.\u201dApple, in a statement following the Justice Department\u2019s appeal, said that \u201cwe share the judge\u2019s concern that misuse of the All Writs Act\u201d \u2014 the law prosecutors are citing in their demand \u2014 \u201cwould start us down a slippery slope that threatens everyone\u2019s safety and privacy.\u201dTimothy H. Edgar, a civil liberties specialist, said that the outcome of the Justice Department\u2019s demands on Apple might ultimately hinge on whether the courts view the \u201cburden\u201d placed on Apple as unreasonable.If the courts look at that burden as simply the number of engineering hours it might take Apple to unlock the phones, the Justice Department has a strong case, he said. But if that burden includes diminished security or possible harm to Apple\u2019s reputation among its customers, the outcome might be different.Michael Sussmann, a Washington lawyer and former Justice Department prosecutor who works on electronic surveillance cases, said he thought it was doubtful that the Supreme Court would step into the fray anytime soon, unless rulings that emerge from New York and California appellate courts are in direct conflict.In cases involving new technology, he said, \u201cThe Supreme Court likes these cases to percolate in the lower courts for a while and let the law be made and observe how it\u2019s made before stepping in.\u201dEric Lichtblau reported from Washington, and Joseph Goldstein from New York.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Apple Policy on Bugs May Explain Why Hackers Would Help F.B.I.", "Date": "2016-03-22", "News": "Supported byFor all the steps Apple has taken to encrypt customers\u2019 communications and its rhetoric around customer privacy, security experts said the company was still doing less than many competitors to seal up its systems from hackers. And when hackers do find flaws in Apple\u2019s code, they have little incentive to turn them over to the company for fixing.Apple, which has had relatively strong security over the years, has been open about how security is a never-ending cat-and-mouse game and how it is unwilling to engage in a financial arms race to pay for code exploits.The company has yet to give hackers anything more than a gold star. When hackers do turn over serious flaws in its products, they may see their name listed on the company\u2019s website \u2014 but that is it. That is a far cry from what hackers can expect if they sell an Apple flaw on the thriving underground market where a growing number of companies and government agencies are willing to pay hackers handsomely.But security experts, especially those with a stake in such bug programs, said Apple could now be doing more, especially in this day and age where the conventions of finding bugs and fixing them have changed.Just this week, researchers at Johns Hopkins University uncovered a flaw that would allow attackers to decrypt the contents of photos and videos attached in Apple\u2019s iMessage program. The researchers turned that flaw over to Apple for patching.\u201cEspecially with the stakes being as high as they are, if Apple wants to continue to compete in the modern world, they have to modernize their approach,\u201d said Katie Moussouris, a chief policy officer at HackerOne, which companies like Yahoo, Dropbox and now Uber pay to manage their bug bounty programs.The identity of the third party that approached the F.B.I. with the possible way to unlock the iPhone \u2014 which was used by one of the attackers in a mass shooting in San Bernardino, Calif., last year \u2014 remained unknown on Tuesday. The emergence of the third party halted, at least temporarily, a contentious case between Apple and the United States government over whether the company should weaken the security of its iPhone to help law enforcement.The Justice Department has declined to name the third-party person or organization, or to describe the proposed method for breaking into the device. The third party may not have approached Apple for many reasons.In the past, Microsoft\u2019s systems were a more frequent target for malicious-minded hackers, largely because of the prevalence of its products. But as Microsoft began to embrace the hacking community, its security improved.The technology company has been locked in a major legal battle against law enforcement officials over privacy and security.As Apple\u2019s desktops and mobile phones have gained more market share, and as customers began to entrust more and more of their personal data to their iPhones, Apple products have become far more valuable marks for criminals and spies.An Apple spokeswoman referred to an editorial by Craig Federighi, the company\u2019s senior vice president for software engineering, in which he wrote, \u201cSecurity is an endless race \u2014 one that you can lead but never decisively win.\u201d\u201cOur team must work tirelessly to stay one step ahead of criminal attackers who seek to pry into personal information,\u201d Mr. Federighi said. \u201cDespite our best efforts, nothing is 100 percent secure.\u201dApple has long been less visible in the security community compared with other tech companies. The company has shied away from bug bounty programs and instead relied on large testing programs and the work of its security team to spot vulnerabilities, partly because it is disinclined to keep up with a financial arms race of paying for bugs, according to three former and current employees, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly about security matters.Apple has said it will fight to know more about the flaw in the software or hardware that the third party has presented to law enforcement. A senior executive said in a conference call with reporters Tuesday that if the government found the method did not work and tried to force Apple to help break into the phone, Apple would have questions about what was tried, in order to keep its products as secure as possible.If the third-party method does work, the government may dismiss a court order demanding that Apple weaken its security, but keep the process it used to break into the phone under seal. In that case, Apple would have no way of knowing how the government broke into its software or hardware.Exploits in Apple\u2019s code have become increasingly coveted over time, especially as its mobile devices have become ubiquitous, with an underground ecosystem of brokers and contractors willing to pay top dollar for them.Flaws in Apple\u2019s mobile devices can typically fetch $1 million. Last September, a boutique firm in Washington, called Zerodium, which sells flaws to governments and corporations, announced a $1 million bounty for anyone who would turn over an exploit in Apple\u2019s iOS 9 mobile operating system \u2014 the same operating system used to power the iPhone used by the San Bernardino shooter. By November, Zerodium said a team of undisclosed hackers had successfully claimed the bounty.Chaouki Bekrar, the founder of Zerodium, said his company was not the outside party referred to in the government\u2019s court filing on Monday. But Mr. Bekrar added that even if Zerodium had helped the F.B.I., he would not disclose it.\u201cFor every Zerodium, there are a thousand other organizations like Zerodium that are far less vocal about doing what they do and will pay researchers who find this stuff to keep it a secret,\u201d said Casey Ellis, the founder of BugCrowd, a company in San Franciso that helps vendors manage bug bounty programs.Some security researchers said no bounty Apple could offer now would match the reward they could expect from the underground market. Apple has waited so long that the black market for its flaws has become extremely lucrative, perhaps making any bug bounty program the company would create seem late to the game.\u201cApple can embrace security researchers, or try to facilitate programs that will secure its operating system, but it\u2019s never going to be able to compete with what is going on behind the scenes in the black market,\u201d said Jay Kaplan, a former N.S.A. analyst and co-founder of Synack, a company that deploys hackers to weed out vulnerabilities in clients\u2019 systems. \u201cIt\u2019s just not going to happen.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Supreme Court to Hear Samsung Appeal on Apple Patent Award", "Date": "2016-03-21", "News": "Supported byDesign patents once covered household items like spoons and fireplace grates \u2014 whose design was central to the product \u2014 and a finding of infringement required the defendant to turn over all of its profits. Samsung argued that this \u201ctotal profit rule\u201d did not make sense in the digital era and would \u201creward design patents far beyond the value of any inventive contribution.\u201d\u201cIn other words,\u201d the company\u2019s brief said, \u201ceven if the patented features contributed 1 percent of the value of Samsung\u2019s phones, Apple gets 100 percent of Samsung\u2019s profits.\u201dDesign patents are far less common than utility patents, which cover how products work. The Supreme Court has not heard a design patent case in over a century.A Samsung spokeswoman, Danielle Meister Cohen, said in a statement that the court\u2019s review \u201ccould lead to a fair interpretation of patent law that will support creativity and reward innovation.\u201d Apple declined to comment.The three design elements at issue in the case, Samsung Electronics Co. v. Apple Inc., No. 15-777, are, in Samsung\u2019s description, \u201ca particular black rectangular round-cornered front face\u201d; \u201ca substantially similar rectangular round-cornered front face plus the surrounding rim\u201d; and \u201ca particular colorful grid of sixteen icons.\u201dIn urging the Supreme Court not to hear the case, Apple said the justices should not reward a copycat.The justices agreed to decide only one of the questions on which Samsung had sought review: \u201cWhere a design patent is applied to only a component of a product, should an award of infringer\u2019s profits be limited to those profits attributable to the component?\u201dThe court appeared to acknowledge the possibility that \u201can award of a defendant\u2019s entire profits for design patent infringement makes no sense in the modern world.\u201d But it added that \u201cthose are policy arguments that should be directed to Congress.\u201d\u201cWe are bound by what the statute says, irrespective of policy arguments that may be made against it,\u201d the court said.David Opderbeck, a law professor at Seton Hall University, said the justices had focused on an important issue.\u201cThe key question is whether damages relating to a design patent should be apportioned in relation to the value added by the patented design or can cover the infringer\u2019s entire profit on the infringing product,\u201d he said.\u201cThe Federal Circuit read the design patent law very literally and held that the entire profits can be recovered,\u201d he added. \u201cIn my opinion, this is a far too literal reading of the statute, particularly because a product\u2019s ornamental design very often is not the primary driver of consumer demand and of the manufacturer\u2019s profits. In some ways, the Federal Circuit\u2019s ruling could allow design patent law to swallow utility patent law, making the ornamental design more important than the underlying technology.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "F.B.I. Error Locked San Bernardino Attacker\u2019s iPhone", "Date": "2016-03-01", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The head of the F.B.I. acknowledged on Tuesday that his agency lost a chance to capture data from the iPhone used by one of the San Bernardino attackers when it ordered that his password to the online storage service iCloud be reset shortly after the rampage.\u201cThere was a mistake made in the 24 hours after the attack,\u201d James B. Comey Jr., the director of the F.B.I., told lawmakers at a hearing on the government\u2019s attempt to force Apple to help \u201cunlock\u201d the iPhone.F.B.I. personnel apparently believed that by resetting the iCloud password, they could get access to information stored on the iPhone. Instead, the change had the opposite effect \u2014 locking them out and eliminating other means of getting in.The iPhone used by Syed Rizwan Farook, one of the assailants in the Dec. 2 attack in which 14 people were killed, is at the center of a fierce legal and political fight over the balance between national security and consumer privacy. Many lawmakers at Tuesday\u2019s hearing of the House Judiciary Committee seemed torn over where to draw the line.\u201cThe big question for our country is how much privacy are we going to give up in the name of security,\u201d Representative Jason Chaffetz, a Utah Republican, told Mr. Comey. \u201cAnd there\u2019s no easy answer to that.\u201dWhile some lawmakers voiced support for Apple\u2019s privacy concerns, others attacked the company\u2019s position, saying it threatened to deprive the authorities of evidence in critical cases involving newer iPhones.\u201cWe\u2019re going to create evidence-free zones?\u201d asked Representative Trey Gowdy, a South Carolina Republican who once served as a federal prosecutor. \u201cAm I missing something?\u201d\u201cHow the hell you can\u2019t access a phone, I just find baffling,\u201d he said.Bruce Sewell, Apple\u2019s general counsel, told committee members that the F.B.I.\u2019s demand for technical help to unlock Mr. Farook\u2019s iPhone 5c \u201cwould set a dangerous precedent for government intrusion on the privacy and safety of its citizens.\u201d Apple has said that in many cases investigators have other means to gain access to crucial information, and in some instances it has turned over data stored in iCloud.\u201cWe don\u2019t put up billboards that market our security,\u201d he said. \u201cWe do this because we think protecting security and privacy of hundreds of millions of iPhones is the right thing to do.\u201dF.B.I. officials say that encrypted data in Mr. Farook\u2019s phone and its GPS system may hold vital clues about where he and his wife, Tashfeen Malik, traveled in the 18 minutes after the shootings, and about whom they might have contacted beforehand. While investigators believe that the couple was \u201cinspired\u201d by the Islamic State, they have not found evidence that they had contact with any extremists overseas.A judge last month ordered Apple to develop software that would disable security mechanisms on Mr. Farook\u2019s phone so that the F.B.I. could try multiple passwords to unlock the phone through a \u201cbrute force\u201d attack, without destroying any data. Once the systems were disabled, it would take only about 26 minutes to find the correct password, Mr. Comey said.He rejected an idea expressed by several lawmakers that the F.B.I. was trying to force Apple to build a \u201cback door\u201d to decrypt its own security features. He used a different analogy to explain the government\u2019s demands.\u201cThere\u2019s already a door on that iPhone,\u201d Mr. Comey said. \u201cEssentially, we\u2019re saying to Apple \u2018take the vicious guard dog away and let us pick the lock.\u2019 \u201dBut the F.B.I. did not help its case with lawmakers when Mr. Comey acknowledged the mistake of changing the iCloud password.When the dispute over Mr. Farook\u2019s iPhone erupted two weeks ago, the Justice Department blamed technicians at San Bernardino County, which employed Mr. Farook as an environmental health specialist and which owned the phone he used. But county officials said their technicians had changed the password only \u201cat the F.B.I.\u2019s request.\u201dMr. Comey acknowledged at the hearing that the F.B.I. had directed the county to change the password.Mr. Sewell, the Apple lawyer, explained to the committee that before F.B.I. officials ordered the password reset, Apple first wanted them to try to connect the phone to a \u201cknown\u201d Wi-Fi connection that Mr. Farook had used. Doing so might have recovered information saved to the phone since October, when it was last connected to iCloud.\u201cThe very information that the F.B.I. is seeking would have been available, and we could have pulled it down from the cloud,\u201d he said.The F.B.I.\u2019s handling of the password change drew criticism from both Democrats and Republicans at the hearing.\u201cIf the F.B.I. hadn\u2019t instructed San Bernardino County to change the password to the iCloud account, all this would have been unnecessary, and you would have had that information,\u201d said Representative Jerrold Nadler, Democrat of New York.Mr. Chaffetz leveled a similar criticism during the more than two and a half hours of testimony from Mr. Comey.\u201cWith all due respect to the F.B.I., they didn\u2019t do what Apple had suggested they do in order to retrieve the data, correct?\u201d Mr. Chaffetz asked the director. \u201cI mean, when they went to change the password, that kind of screwed things up, did it not?\u201dBut Mr. Comey said that even if the F.B.I. had not mishandled the password, he did not think the bureau could have gotten everything it wanted from the phone and would still have needed Apple to help disable the security features in the phone.\u201cWe would still be in litigation,\u201d he said, \u201cbecause the experts tell me there\u2019s no way we would have gotten everything off the phone from a backup.\u201dMr. Comey stressed that the fight with Apple was about trying to get as much information as possible about the San Bernardino attack \u2014 not about gaining a powerful law enforcement tool elsewhere.But when he was asked whether the F.B.I. would seek to unlock other encrypted phones if it prevailed in the San Bernardino case, he responded, \u201cOf course.\u201dIn the audience were relatives of a Louisiana woman, Brittney Mills, who was shot to death at her doorstep last year when she was about eight months pregnant.Mr. Comey said the data in her phone could help investigators determine whether she was shot by someone she knew, but they had been unable to break the passcode.An earlier version of this article attributed incorrectly the quote, \u201cWith all due respect to the F.B.I., they didn\u2019t do what Apple had suggested they do in order to retrieve the data, correct? I mean, when they went to change the password, that kind of screwed things up, did it not?\u201d It was Representative Jason Chaffetz, not Representative Trey Gowdy.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "An Industry Lines Up Behind Apple", "Date": "2016-03-03", "News": "Supported byBitsDozens of tech companies and organizations on Thursday are expected to file legal briefs in support of Apple\u2019s privacy position. The support will appear like a united front against the government, which is trying to get Apple to help law enforcement break into an iPhone used by a gunman in the terrorist attack last year in San Bernardino, Calif.That could be part of the reason that Defense Secretary Ashton B. Carter sought some middle ground in the debate on Wednesday. In a speech at a digital security conference in San Francisco, he said he was not in favor of a \u201cback door\u201d that would give the government access to data that is protected by encryption.Of course, the software Apple is being asked to create is considered by some to be considered a back door because it could provide special access to information that would otherwise be inaccessible because of passwords or encryption. Still, the tone coming from some government officials seems to be changing somewhat. Maybe that united front is already working.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Ruling in Apple\u2019s Favor", "Date": "2016-03-01", "News": "Supported byBitsNot so fast, F.B.I.That was the message coming from the Federal District Court for the Eastern District in New York on Monday, when a judge ruled that the United States government couldn\u2019t use the All Writs Act of 1789 to force Apple to produce data connected to an iPhone seized in connection with a drug case.The law gives judges the power to \u201cissue all writs necessary or appropriate in aid of their respective jurisdictions and agreeable to the usages and principles of law.\u201dThe ruling on Monday, by Magistrate Judge James Orenstein, gives Apple a little legal momentum. But the case differs from the California one, in which Apple is being asked to build a way to break into its own phone to access data. In the New York case, the Justice Department says, Apple can already access the data the government is seeking.Advertisement"}
