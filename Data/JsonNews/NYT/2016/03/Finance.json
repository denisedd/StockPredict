{"Headline": "What Makes a Terrorist Isn\u2019t a Mystery", "Date": "2016-03-29", "News": "Supported byLettersTo the Editor:Efforts by researchers and policy makers to pin down how or why people become radicalized and join violent movements have certainly become notoriously frustrating and semi-masochistic; it seems as if anyone and his opposite may be included in at-risk populations.But while there is no harm in trying to identify markers and trends in radicalization, we must not allow that effort to distract us from the much more important task of understanding \u2014 and ultimately defeating \u2014 the political ideology that is attracting so many followers in the first place.The hard reality is that the longer a militant movement with a powerful global ideology appears to be \u201cwinning\u201d on the world stage, as is the case with the Islamic State, the greater the numbers (and diversity) of the recruits it will be able to net across countries and communities, including inside the United States. STUART GOTTLIEBNew YorkThe writer, a former Senate foreign policy adviser and speechwriter, teaches counterterrorism at Columbia University.To the Editor:The question of who will become a terrorist seems impossible to answer even retrospectively. But one thing does seem clear: The young people attracted to terrorism are looking for belonging, fame, glory and righteousness. An essential antidote could be the use of messaging to change the paradigm.What is needed is a credible voice that booms out the truth \u2014 that being a terrorist leads to the opposite, to a wasted life and infamy. Grim images and truthful words are needed to break the myth that terrorists will become immortal heroes, to show how they are merely pawns in a plot. These words and images also need to convey a clear, new path that leads to a positive version of fame and glory.ELLEN LUBORSKYNew YorkThe writer is a clinical psychologist.To the Editor:In exploring the research on who will become a terrorist, your article does not mention the powerful state sources of Islamic extremism.For many decades, Saudi Arabia, which has imposed the fanatical Wahhabi interpretation of Islam on its people since its foundation, and its close ally Pakistan, whose official \u201cideology of Pakistan\u201d is an intolerant variant of political Islam, have poisoned countless Muslim minds throughout the world with their virulent religious propaganda, sponsorship of militants and recidivist violence.Starting from the premise of \u201cIslam in danger,\u201d these creeds encourage hatred of Hindus, Christians, Jews, other Islamic sects and liberal secular Muslims, and a general loathing of modernity. Alienated, troubled people would not commit such spectacular atrocities if they were not led to believe that they did so for a higher, even transcendental, purpose.Although largely financed by petrodollars, these states with reactionary ideologies have greatly benefited from the military assistance and diplomatic support extended by the United States during the Cold War \u2014 a policy that has remained largely unchanged and unexamined in a very different time.In searching for the roots of terrorism, the true question is what has come of America\u2019s having such \u201callies.\u201dVANNI CAPPELLIPoughkeepsie, N.Y.The writer is president of the Afghanistan Foreign Press Association.To the Editor:Although, as your article says, the backgrounds of terrorists \u201care so diverse that they defy a single profile,\u201d the murderers share a characteristic that is worth noting: a casual acceptance of causing the death of random people.This capacity to depersonalize derives in large part from cultural and political attitudes. The modern tolerance of civilian casualties can be seen in the nuclear attacks on Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 1945. That these acts were military, not \u201cterroristic,\u201d is most likely a distinction lost on jihadists.The sanctity of one person\u2019s existence is not part of our collective wisdom; instead, we have concepts like nationalism, race and ethnicity. Violence against others to achieve group ambitions is universally accepted, at the expense of millions of lives.In the effort to end the mayhem, it might be more useful to study ourselves than to study terrorists.GARY ABRAMSONGoshen, N.Y.To the Editor:As a powerful way to prevent violence and terrorism, young men and women need structure and purpose. A required civilian \u201carmy\u201d corps would be a possible solution.All those in their midteens to early 20s should have to spend summers plus several weekends a year in vocational training and doing needed socially valuable tasks and chores. It would give the young people job experience as well as offer possible intervention for those in trouble.VIVIEN WOLSKNew YorkThe writer is a clinical psychologist.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Cruyff\u2019s \u2018Total Football\u2019 Vision Transformed Two Great Clubs", "Date": "2016-03-27", "News": "Supported byGlobal SoccerLONDON \u2014 Inside his modest townhouse in Vinkeveen, the Netherlands, just south of Amsterdam, Johan Cruyff offered beer or spirits. \u201cMine,\u201d he said, \u201cis soda water. Has to be. I\u2019m trying to be a good athlete.\u201dMoments later, Cruyff leaped off the sofa in the lithe and athletic way that characterized him and grabbed his Camel cigarettes before his 2-year-old daughter, Chantal, could reach them.It would be 20 years before a heart attack prompted Cruyff to give up cigarettes, and another 25 years after that when lung cancer cut short his life.Cruyff, who died last Thursday, retired as one of the greatest players of all time. He was up there with the Brazilian Pel\u00e9 and the three extraordinary Argentines, Alfredo Di St\u00e9fano, Diego Maradona and Lionel Messi.But Cruyff was something else. He changed the Dutch style of play, and he changed the ethos of two top clubs, Ajax Amsterdam and Barcelona. It started with their youth academies and went on up to the senior teams, which won European and world championships several times over, with a flow that brought soccer as close to ballet as we have seen. The Russian dancer Rudolf Nureyev made the comparison between how Cruyff moved and how Nureyev danced.\u201cEvery time I see the video,\u201d Olsson said, \u201cI think I have got the ball, Every time, he surprises me. Every time, I love that moment.\u201dOlsson is not alone. I had the privilege of knowing Johan Cruyff when we were young men. I first interviewed him for television in 1972, and two years later we worked on a 16-week newspaper series, \u201cCruyff\u2019s Eye View,\u201d analyzing specific players and tactics of the coming 1974 World Cup.Cruyff had a home videocassette recorder before they were on the market. He had his own library of tapes on players who interested or inspired him. Di St\u00e9fano was his reference point, but we also pinpointed what made Gerd M\u00fcller an exceptional scorer for West Germany, how Kazimierz Deyna made Poland tick, the way that Roberto Rivellino bent those Brazilian free kicks, and how his friend Johan Neeskens put the fighting spirit into the Dutch Oranje.Sometimes, the tutorials were physical and not just verbal. There were insights beyond what a spectator, or even an average pro, would see. There were moments in his living room when Cruyff rearranged the furniture and used cutlery, salt and pepper and even cigarette packets to illustrate a point.When asked at what stage he might attempt a 40-yard pass as Germany\u2019s G\u00fcnter Netzer imperiously did, Cruyff responded: \u201cI don\u2019t answer. First, tell me who the pass is for?\u201dHe meant which Dutch colleague was in which position on the field. This, remember, was the gestation of \u201cTotal Football\u201d \u2014 the soccer attributed to Coach Rinus Michels as he revolutionized tactics with Ajax and the Netherlands and later Barcelona.The essence was that players rotated within the team. A fullback like Ruud Krol might appear on the wing, a winger like Piet Keizer might drift inside and Cruyff might pop up anywhere.So, if the nimble Keizer was the recipient of the long pass, then yes, Cruyff would hit it. If it was another, slower individual, Cruyff would instead run forward with the ball, take out an opponent or two with his hyper-quick mind and movement and then pass for a colleague in free space.Total Football meant total integration of the mind and the footwork. Coach Michels encouraged it, but players had to initiate it.Cruyff learned it on the streets near Ajax\u2019s old De Meer stadium. He was a child laced to the ball. His father died of heart failure when Cruyff was 12, and the boy decided then to opt out of formal schooling. His mother was a cleaner at the stadium, and Johan was on the streets, whirling around lampposts, bemusing older kids, living his game and inventing his own moves. Jan Olsson needn\u2019t think he was the first, or the last, to be flabbergasted by those moves.Cruyff said he wasn\u2019t especially quick, but if you always knew what you would do and could move the ball just a fraction of a second before your opponent, there was no way he could catch up.There was, though, a physical price to pay. \u201cI\u2019m 1.8 meters,\u201d the 5-foot-11 Cruyff said, \u201cand I should be 75 kilos. But I\u2019ve always been only 67 kilos,\u201d or 147 pounds.He then rolled down his socks to show five bruises and cuts from his last game. \u201cThis I call routine,\u201d he said.He laughed, drew on another cigarette and said that the way to hit back was to make the offender look foolish by running off with the ball.\u201cI have an instinct to do wrong things,\u201d he continued. \u201cThe coaches always said you must trap the ball with your foot, but if you do that you have stopped it, lost momentum.\u201dThe most wrong thing he ever did was smoke. He kicked the habit after a cardiac surgeon told him in 1991 he was three breaths away from death. In the end, it was lung cancer that took him, at 68. He thought he was beating the cancer. A colleague working on Cruyff\u2019s memoirs knew only two weeks ago that time was running out.His legacy remains. The Cruyff Institute \u2014 named after a boy who quit school at 12 \u2014 offers degrees in sports management with academies on three different continents, and his foundation financed hundreds of play areas for children in inner cities.He was a special player, an extraordinary man. When Jordi Cruyff, his son, was asked how he compared with his dad, he replied, \u201cThe rest of us are just mortals \u2014 we come and go.\u201dAdvertisement"}

As British politicians debate the repercussions of killing one of their own citizens, an American drone pilot (Aaron Paul) spies a complicating factor: a young girl, selling bread her mother has made, has wandered into the kill zone.As the film ricochets among London, Nairobi, Nevada, Singapore, Beijing and Hawaii, what ensues is not just a game of bureaucratic buck-passing. It\u2019s a nuanced grappling with the ethics of modern warfare. Does killing a suspected terrorist by unmanned aircraft constitute extrajudicial execution? What qualifies as an imminent threat? And is saving the lives of 80 people who could perish in a suicide attack worth the death of an innocent girl and the anger of the local population?It\u2019s not hard to understand why drones make for compelling fare.\u201cThey\u2019re flying robots,\u201d said Arthur Holland Michel, co-founder of the Center for the Study of the Drone at Bard College. \u201cThey\u2019re used by spies acting on orders that come directly from the president. They\u2019re operated by former jet pilots living in Las Vegas, who feel the psychological toll of what they\u2019re doing even though they\u2019re not in danger. And they rain missiles called Hellfire on Al Qaeda, the Taliban and also, every so often, women, children and other civilians. How could the public not be fascinated and terrified by drones?\u201dThe new film \u201cEye in the Sky\u201d takes a more wide-angled view of the issues. The English writer Guy Hibbert (\u201cFive Minutes of Heaven\u201d) began researching drone warfare about seven years ago, before the issue began to permeate the public consciousness. The spark: his imaging of what happens when \u201csome glorified toy, 20,000 feet up in the air\u201d fires and the \u201chorrific disconnect for the victims below.\u201dA producer at the BBC, a friend of his, commissioned a script, and Mr. Hibbert began talking to British Army and Air Force officers (including some who worried that this new form of warfare was unfolding without any debate in Parliament), politicians and human rights lawyers. After being told about the \u201ckill chain\u201d \u2014 the elements (and players) involved in the selection, vetting and dispatching of targets \u2014 Mr. Hibbert found his dramatic instincts kicking in.Finding financing, however, was a struggle. It took nearly four years before an escalation of the United States drone program moved the subject onto the front pages and the production company of Ged Doherty, a British former music executive, and the actor Colin Firth took on the $13 million project.Mr. Hibbert\u2019s kaleidoscopic approach, one that painted in shades of gray, resonated with the director, Gavin Hood (\u201cRendition,\u201d \u201cTsotsi\u201d).\u201cIt doesn\u2019t take a smug or easy position,\u201d Mr. Hood said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t profess to have the perfect answer, but it sure gives you an emotional, visceral sense of what it\u2019s like to be in the shoes of very many different people involved in this warfare.\u201dMr. Hood, who served two years in the South African Marines more than 30 years ago, then embarked on a fact-finding mission of his own, speaking to military intelligence officers, drone pilots, defense contractors and others.Mr. Hood\u2019s major alteration involved Ms. Mirren\u2019s character. In the original script, the colonel was a man. But \u201cI didn\u2019t want to make a guy\u2019s war movie,\u201d Mr. Hood said. \u201cThe themes and ideas of the movie should be discussed by all of us, regardless of gender.\u201dEnticed by the multiple-viewpoint story, told in real time, that explored the realistic life-and-death compromises of war in an age of terrorism, Ms. Mirren signed on.\u201cTo me, it\u2019s kind of like a courtroom drama, only the audience is the jury,\u201d wrestling with the right and wrong of it while leaving the theater, Ms. Mirren said.\u201cThat\u2019s what one really hopes come out of this movie,\u201d she added. \u201cNot assumption, but discussion.\u201dMs. Kennebeck, an investigative journalist making her first feature-length film with \u201cNational Bird,\u201d also hopes to spark conversation with her narrower focus.The stories of three former United States Air Force personnel in the drone program serve as the backbone of the documentary, which counts Wim Wenders and Errol Morris as its executive producers. \u201cI wanted to talk to the people on the inside,\u201d Ms. Kennebeck said, not experts and other talking heads.Heather, a former imagery analyst, now receives disability benefits for post-traumatic stress disorder, even though she was thousands of miles away from the strikes. Daniel, a former signals intelligence analyst, has become an antiwar campaigner. And Lisa, a former technical sergeant in the Air Force drone program, is so disturbed and conflicted by what she witnessed remotely, she travels to Afghanistan to meet civilian survivors of a strike gone awry. (That incident resulted in the deaths of 23 civilians, according to the United States military.)Winning the hearts and minds of the local population is the core of counterinsurgency philosophy. But how does the West succeed if the drone attacks make the ground only more fertile for the enemy?\u201cThat to me is the key debate here,\u201d Mr. Hood said. \u201cAre we engaged any longer in counterinsurgency, or are we simply engaged in a game of whack-a-mole? And when you whack the mole, do you have one less mole, or do another 20 moles pop up?\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "European Museums Adapt to the American Way of Giving", "Date": "2016-03-15", "News": "Supported byMuseums in the United States, helped by favorable tax laws, are sustained by a culture of giving by private donors and a universe of trained development officials.That culture isn\u2019t common in other parts of the world, where governments often support museums.\u201cIt is not as ingrained as it is in the U.S.,\u201d said Richard Hamilton, director of the Tate Americas Foundation, which raises money in this country for the Tate museums in England. \u201cPeople love leaving things to dogs and cats, but not to museums,\u201d he said.That is changing.Governments in Europe are cutting back their support of museums, and so these museums are adapting the American model and increasingly are turning to private citizens and corporations for donations. They are looking both to their own citizens, and to Americans who are fond of certain major European museums.\u201cThey are becoming more hip to what Americans are doing as they shift from public to private funding,\u201d said Ellena E. Fotinatos, deputy director of donor and nonprofit services at the King Baudouin Foundation United States, whose mandate is to help European and African nonprofits raise money in this country. \u201cWith increased austerity in Europe, professional fund-raising is growing more focused around this area.\u201dSome large cultural institutions have long had American outposts. Others are just beginning a major push. In Spain, the Prado\u2019s Amigos del Museo del Prado foundation boasts 29,000 members and raised more than $5 million last year. (Marie-Jos\u00e9e Kravis, a philanthropist who is the president of the Museum of Modern Art in New York, contributes to the Spanish group.)That support is crucial. In 2006, the Prado received 64.9 percent of its funding from the government. Last year, the government provided just 32.4 percent of the museum\u2019s 38.5 million euro budget.The Prado is expanding what was once a small American effort offering no tax benefits for donors. It will start an American Friends of the Prado website this year and establish a nonprofit group that will allow American donors to receive the tax benefits of their gifts from the government.\u201cLots of Americans love the Prado,\u201d said Christine Simmons, an American who has lived in Madrid since 1998 and is on the board of the American Friends of the Prado. \u201cLast year, of our 2.6 million visitors, 200,000 came from the United States.\u201dIn the Netherlands, the newly redesigned Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam has seen government funding drop to 40 percent of the budget after supplying as much as 70 percent in 2012. The museum\u2019s development office now has 15 people, up from three in 2009, according to Hendrikje Crebolder, head of development. This year, the Rijksmuseum will lend \u201cSmall Wonders,\u201d a collection of small medieval prayer pieces, to the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, to be exhibited at the Cloisters. Among the benefits of such loans is the opportunity to cultivate relationships in the United States, Ms. Crebolder noted.Europeans who want to learn more about fund-raising are taking their cues from Americans. Next month, representatives of 38 organizations are expected for the King Baudouin Foundation United States\u2019 annual spring seminar in New York on \u201cThe Art and Science of the American Fundraising Model.\u201d Three years ago, there were representatives from just 25 institutions. The event, which kicks off with cocktails at the Whitney Museum of American Art, will include officials from the Prado, the Rijksmuseum, the Benaki Museum in Athens and the City of Rome, as well as the Pompeii Project and the Archaeological Park at Paestum in Italy.Sometimes, efforts to raise donations are begun by passionate museumgoers, not by the institutions. For example, fans of the Mus\u00e9e d\u2019Orsay in Paris created the American Friends of the Orsay in 2009. Peter Solomon, who shares the chairmanship with his wife, Susan, said that it raises $1 million to $1.5 million a year. Their organization makes it possible for American donors to contribute cash or art objects and receive a tax deduction.There is a provision in the tax code that cash gifts from living people that go to a 501(c)(3) entity allow the donor to receive a tax write-off, providing the gift does not exceed 50 percent of the donor\u2019s adjusted gross income.If the gift is an art object for a foreign charity that has 501(c)(3) status, the American charity must retain control over when and how to give the gift to the recipient. For example, the recipient, such as American Friends of the Orsay, might hold on to the gift for several years, according to William Josephson, former head of the New York State Charities Bureau. On the other hand, a bequest from the will of a deceased American can go directly to the foreign charity and still provide a tax benefit to the estate, but determining the value of the art object is a complicated process.Regardless of how much money they raise, such groups can be finicky about what they will support. American Friends of the Orsay will not, for example, give money to pay salaries. \u201cThose costs should be borne by the government,\u201d Mr. Solomon said. \u201cWe don\u2019t pay ordinary maintenance.\u201d However, the organization did match the museum\u2019s crowdfunding effort that raised roughly $150,000 to help clean a painting by Gustave Courbet.A few institutions have taken the courtship of donors to improbably high levels. The 51-year-old Israel Museum in Jerusalem, which showcases both artworks and archaeological pieces, has an endowment of more than $200 million. International support covers more than half its operating needs, according to the museum\u2019s director, James Snyder. The museum itself was founded by an international group of supporters. \u201cIt is not a national institution, and the government support, which hovers at about 15 percent of the operating budget, is an annual grant and not a guaranteed state allocation,\u201d he pointed out.The British have been active in American fund-raising for many years. The Tate Americas began with a $6 million gift in 1989. To date, it has raised about $300 million, according to Mr. Hamilton. \u201cThe Tate has benefited from the American model,\u201d he said, raising money around the world.Institutions of every size are looking beyond the state for financing. While the Louvre got 57 percent of its budget from the French government in 2002, in 2014, the government provided 50 percent of the overall budget.It is easier to coax money from corporations in France than from individuals, according to Sue Devine, who founded American Friends of the Louvre with Christopher Forbes in 2002 and is now its director. \u201cThe French government gives corporations significant incentives: For example, they can deduct what they give from their taxable income, thereby reducing their taxes,\u201d Ms. Devine said. \u201cBut the incentives are far less for individuals. As a result, individuals are more likely to believe that the money to support the institutions comes out of their taxes, so why pay twice?\u201d She added, \u201cPeople who are 50 and over grew up with that mind-set about getting money from the state, so they look to the state for funding.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Republican Rivals Talk Tough, but Even Presidents Have Limits", "Date": "2016-03-28", "News": "Supported byLetter From AmericaSenator Ted Cruz, a candidate for the Republican presidential nomination, has proposed surveilling Muslim neighborhoods. His chief rival, Donald J. Trump, says he would deport millions of undocumented immigrants and allow the use of torture. The campaign has also produced calls for carpet bombing in Syria and steps to rein in the press at home.But you have to wonder: If elected, could a new president intent on pushing or exceeding the boundaries of the Constitution or the law actually follow through? Or would the Constitution, the Geneva Conventions and other long-established legal barriers leave the new president unable to turn heated and sometimes hyperbolic campaign talk into reality?Reflecting the mood of a populist and often angry Republican primary electorate, Mr. Trump and to a lesser extent Mr. Cruz have at times suggested that they would not be constrained by political correctness or traditional boundaries.Among their critics, the more provocative proposals from Mr. Trump and Mr. Cruz are viewed as hateful, ineffective and unlikely to ever become detailed policy proposals, much less American policy. President Obama, asked about Mr. Trump\u2019s proposals during a trip to Argentina last week, largely shrugged, saying the country\u2019s separation of powers imposes \u201ca limit to some of the damage.\u201dThere is always a gap between what candidates say in the heat of the campaign, when they are not constrained by the realities of governance, and how they act after being sworn into office. Asked about the likelihood of a Trump or Cruz presidency following through by successfully implementing primary campaign promises that raised serious constitutional or legal questions, some legal scholars said the probability is relatively low.Noah Feldman, a Harvard law professor, said the greatest bulwark against presidential overreach would be the huge number of people needed to carry out the work.Political appointees and career civil servants could refuse directives. Congress could refuse to pass and finance policies. The Justice Department\u2019s Office of Legal Counsel could declare initiatives unconstitutional.But, Mr. Feldman added, another crisis \u2014 say, something like the Sept. 11 attacks \u2014 could change the dynamic. Officials might back down. A president could invoke President Lincoln\u2019s suspension, over the objection of the Supreme Court chief justice, of habeas corpus, the foundational right to protest one\u2019s detention.\u201cCould a president unilaterally suspend habeas corpus? Well, all you can say is: It happened once,\u201d Mr. Feldman said.Some legal scholars have speculated about the potential for a candidate like Mr. Trump to shatter convention if elected and go well beyond the broad assertions of executive authority by President Obama and President George W. Bush in fighting terrorism.Eric Posner, a law professor at the University of Chicago, has said the chance that a president would seize dictatorial powers is \u201cextremely remote.\u201d But in his blog, he has also written about the ways it could happen, like \u201cimpounding\u201d congressionally appropriated funds and using them for an unauthorized purpose.Since 2001, she said, executive branch officials and the courts have \u201ctoo easily\u201d allowed torture, surveillance and the rendition of prisoners.The court said then that it \u201ccannot reject as unfounded the judgment of the military authorities and of Congress that there were disloyal members of that population,\u201d that \u201csuch persons could not readily be isolated,\u201d and, thus, that the demands of security outweighed those of rights.Two years ago, Justice Antonin Scalia, normally a defender of precedent, declared Korematsu \u201cwrong.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "A Baseball Renaissance on Florida\u2019s East Coast", "Date": "2016-03-27", "News": "Supported byWEST PALM BEACH, Fla. \u2014 When the Palm Beach County commissioner Priscilla Taylor attended a groundbreaking in November for the spring training baseball complex being built here, her car wound up with two flat tires.Construction crews had just started clearing thousands of tons of dirt, debris and trees from the 161-acre site, which was a garbage dump for more than a half-century.Four months later, Taylor returned to see a line of trucks hauling out what was left of the trash; concrete being poured to form walls; and a crane near where home plate will be in a 6,500-seat stadium that, if all goes well, will open in January as the winter home of the Houston Astros and the Washington Nationals.\u201cThis land was just out there not being used, so it\u2019s a win-win for Palm Beach County,\u201d said Taylor, whose district covers part of West Palm Beach. \u201cCertainly, other things are happening, but this can help bring in dollars to the county.\u201dThe $148.5 million spring training complex will help rebalance the geographic alignment in Florida, bringing two teams that play in out-of-the-way corners of the state closer to their rivals.Once the center of spring training, the east coast of Florida saw an exodus of major league teams during the past few decades. Some left for other parts of the state, others to Arizona, where the 15 clubs in the Cactus League are within about an hour\u2019s drive of one another in the Phoenix area.To date, the Miami Marlins and the St. Louis Cardinals, which share a spring training complex in Jupiter; the Mets in Port St. Lucie; and the Nationals farther north in Viera are the four remaining teams on the Atlantic Coast.Like the Nationals, the Astros, who have played in Kissimmee in Central Florida since the 1980s, ride two or more hours on a bus to get to many away games. By sharing a complex in West Palm Beach, the teams would cut their travel time and attract more fans eager to see their team play at home and on the road.\u201cThe best part was the proximity to the Cardinals and Marlins and Palm Beach Airport,\u201d said Giles Kibbe, who has spearheaded the project for the Astros. \u201cWe\u2019ll still have some games on the West Coast, but it\u2019s going to be a significant convenience.\u201dJust as significant, the county and state are paying for the construction of the complex to lure the Astros and the Nationals. Aware that voters would oppose any tax increases to pay for sports facilities, Taylor and other county commissioners dedicated a slice of an existing hotel bed tax to cover the county\u2019s $113 million share of the project, which includes construction and financing. The state committed another $50 million over 25 years. While these figures pale when compared with the hundreds of millions of dollars that governments lavish on pro teams building stadiums and arenas, critics said that sports facilities rarely generated the economic benefits that their proponents contended.They also disputed the notion that building stadiums was a zero-sum game, and that land would lie fallow if not used for sports. Lawmakers prefer hotel bed taxes because they are often paid by visitors from out of town. But that money could easily be used for something else, critics said.\u201cWhat gets lost is it\u2019s not the cost of the doing nothing with the land, but something else that could be done with it,\u201d said John Zipp, a sociologist at the University of Akron who has studied the economic viability of spring training facilities in Florida. \u201cThe taxes could be used for other things, too, like schools. There is no natural law that says bed taxes have to go to stadiums.\u201dTaylor, though, was convinced that more baseball fans would flock to Palm Beach County to see the Astros and the Nationals, who will each pay an average of $1.4 million a year over 30 years to use the complex. The teams will also cover any cost overruns beyond the original projected construction cost, $135 million.While the Astros and the Nationals look forward to their new digs, they leave behind empty buildings. After the Astros decamp for West Palm Beach, Osceola County will scramble to make up some of $47 million in revenue that the team generates during spring training. Don Miers, who runs the stadium for the county, which spent $18 million to renovate it in 2003, said he would try to attract youth tournaments and baseball teams from Japan or South Korea and possibly to host a round of the World Baseball Classic.But \u201cmore youth sports isn\u2019t going to replace the $47 million,\u201d he said.Palm Beach County, which lost the Atlanta Braves in 1997, was happy for the new tenants. But it has been forced to complete the project in 14 months, a schedule that could tighten further if an unexpected event like a hurricane occurs.\u201cThis is a massive project that we are racing to complete in record time,\u201d the Nationals, who declined to make an executive available, said in a statement. \u201cBut we plan to be ready to play in 2017; however, the paint may still be wet and some projects may be wrapping up as the first pitch is thrown.\u201dEvidence of that race was everywhere. About 75 loads of debris are hauled from the site each week, turning mountains of trash as high as 20 feet into land suitable for ball fields. Some concrete retrieved from the dump is being recycled, and hundreds of trees were removed and will be replanted in parks elsewhere in the city. Several of the 12 practice fields have been laid out, and land has been cleared for seven recreational sports fields, five to be used by the county and two by the city.The beginning of the first-base line, the Nationals\u2019 clubhouse and the right-field wall are taking shape, not far from a machine being used to sort the tires, metal and other garbage being sent to a solid waste site a mile away.With all that is going on, the Astros and the Nationals may end up with another neighbor. The Braves, who will play at least one more season near Walt Disney World, are also looking to move out of Central Florida. The Braves have spoken with officials in four communities, including Palm Beach and Pinellas Counties. According to Tom McNicholas, a lobbyist for the team, the Palm Beach County commissioners may vote as soon as April 5 on whether to begin negotiations to bring the Braves back to the county.\u201cThe most important thing is to find a community that accepts us,\u201d said John Schuerholz, president of the Braves. \u201cThe great thing about Florida is you can get projects completed in a shorter period of time.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Review: \u2018Dry Powder,\u2019 a High-Finance Comedy Drama", "Date": "2016-05-01", "News": "Supported byAs the play opens, Mr. Azaria\u2019s Rick is in a foul mood. He\u2019s been fending off anxious calls from investors who have been targeted by protesters after Rick gave himself a lavish engagement party (the elephant was definitely a bad idea) at the same time the company was announcing layoffs at a grocery store chain it had bought.This doesn\u2019t faze Ms. Danes\u2019s Jenny, whose immersion in her job and the world of the 1-percenters she inhabits is pretty much total. When told of the angry mobs descending upon the firm\u2019s investors, Jenny scoffs: \u201cOf course they\u2019re protesting. That\u2019s what unemployed people do.\u201dJenny sports a fresh blowout so sharp that her blond hair looks as if it would cut your throat if she flipped it in your direction. And rather than come to your aid, Jenny would probably step over your bleeding body to sidle into a town car and head to her next meeting. (She travels only by town car, never by cab.)More understanding of Rick\u2019s distress is Mr. Krasinski\u2019s Seth, who believes he has found a deal that, magic-bullet-like, will make all the bad publicity go away while making the firm a nice chunk of change. He\u2019s friendly with the C.E.O. of a luggage company in Sacramento that\u2019s looking to be acquired, and the price he\u2019s negotiated is irresistible.Selling it hard, Seth says: \u201cThis is a slam-dunk growth play. An American family business, American designers, American made. We\u2019d be creating jobs right here in the U.S. Think about how helpful that would be right now.\u201d He and the C.E.O., Jeff Schrader (Sanjit De Silva), devise a plan to sell custom luggage online and have high hopes of a future initial public offering.While Jenny cannot deny that the price is right, she ridicules the idea as pie in the sky, and as the deal goes into motion, hatches an alternative plan: a \u201cliquidation play\u201d that would involve stripping the company\u2019s assets and ending production, or, as Rick suggests, maybe just moving production to Mexico or Bangladesh. She brings up numbers that Rick finds awfully hard to resist.Ms. Burgess\u2019s grasp of the jargon of high finance is impressive. Terms like \u201csell-side banker,\u201d \u201czero-based budgeting,\u201d \u201cdividend recap\u201d and \u201cdisintermediation\u201d are tossed around like confetti as Seth and Jenny make the case for doing the deal in radically different ways.Still, \u201cDry Powder\u201d \u2014 the title refers to available investment capital on hand \u2014 takes a long time to move beyond mildly entertaining verbal fisticuffs between Jenny and Seth and dizzying instruction in high-end deal making. These people may live their jobs, but watching them do so does not have infinite appeal, unless you enjoy clucking at amorality for 100 minutes.Jenny is an amusingly drawn gorgon of greed. Her jabs at Seth and his more empathetic approach to his work can be savagely acerbic. But she\u2019s also so heartless, ruthless and snobbish (referring to Yale as a \u201csecond-tier\u201d Ivy League college) that she borders on caricature. If there\u2019s an element of stiffness in Ms. Danes\u2019s nonetheless tartly funny performance, it probably derives from a glaring lack of nuance in the character. Jenny is lovably hateful, but eventually, even the pleasure of inwardly hissing at her begins to pall.Mr. Krasinski is excellent as Seth, whose sparring with Jenny at one point descends, hilariously, into an argument over who got a higher score on the G.M.A.T., the business school entry exam. Seth\u2019s growing anxiety and anguish as he sees Jenny manipulating Rick is palpably conveyed. But when he\u2019s offered an alternative by Jeff, who suggests that they scuttle the deal and bring Seth aboard under different circumstances, Mr. Krasinski nicely conveys Seth\u2019s ambivalence about leaving his comfortable berth. What do you do with a yacht in Sacramento, after all?Mr. Azaria\u2019s Rick is a convincing portrait of a cold-eyed, moneyed titan who\u2019s dismayed to discover that the opprobrium his fateful party touched off may be disastrous for his company. But Rick gradually returns to his ethical equilibrium \u2014 meaning, well, I won\u2019t say much more for fear of giving away the game.\u201cDry Powder,\u201d directed at a brisk clip by Mr. Kail, on a chic, pulsating blue platform designed by Rachel Hauck, becomes more engrossing when we meet Jeff, played with a nice measure of affability by Mr. De Silva. He flies in to seal the deal and finds himself unexpectedly embroiled in the battle over his company\u2019s future. Ms. Burgess tosses in some jolting twists that disrupt, to use a fashionable term, our view of at least one of the characters.Still, it\u2019s always pretty clear where Ms. Burgess\u2019s sympathies lie. (If you know the history and cultural bent of the Public Theater, you can probably guess where.) It\u2019s hard not to laugh when Jenny, practicing a speech she plans to give to finance students, casts herself and her colleagues as victims of outrageous oppression by an envious rabble ignorant of all the good they do.But you know you\u2019re laughing at a straw man, or rather a straw woman. For all its flashy talk, \u201cDry Powder\u201d mostly just brings us the unsurprising news that the folks who work in the higher realms of high finance are very, very interested in making lots and lots of money.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Warning in Wall Street Paydays", "Date": "2016-03-09", "News": "Supported byEditorialThe Dodd-Frank financial reform law called for new regulations to prohibit banks and other financial firms from offering compensation deemed excessive or that could encourage reckless risk-taking. At a meeting on Monday with financial regulators, President Obama drew attention to the fact that nearly six years after passage of the legislation, these regulations remain unfinished.In that time, Wall Street pay has grown largely unchecked and with it, undue risks have grown. In data going back to 1986, three of the six biggest years for Wall Street bonuses were 2013, 2014 and 2015.Regulatory foot-dragging is not the only reason that excessive pay and its negative effects persist. Another is the common belief among elected officials in New York that reining in Wall Street pay would irreparably harm the New York economy.But the proper response to Wall Street\u2019s economic importance is not to ignore or delay needed financial reforms, but to reduce reliance on Wall Street by broadening the tax base and diversifying the economy of the city and the state.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Pacific Standard Time Initiative Seeks to Rescue Fugitive Art", "Date": "2016-03-15", "News": "Supported byA patchwork quilt of short quotations from around 120 different publications and public figures, from Lyndon B. Johnson to Pope Paul VI, this literary collage skewers what the artist viewed as a Western thirst for violence during the Vietnam War. It has been performed only twice before, in 1968 in the basement of a London home, and in 1972 in a small theater in Buenos Aires.\u201cOne problem we are having with this project, which is understandable, considering it happened almost 50 years ago and was very underground, is that we don\u2019t have any recordings,\u201d said Ms. Est\u00e9vez, who runs the gallery at the nonprofit Roy and Edna Disney/CalArts Theater, known as Redcat, in Los Angeles.Yet Ms. Est\u00e9vez and her co-curator, Miguel L\u00f3pez, were able to track down Leopoldo Maler, the artist who had directed the London reading, in the Dominican Republic. And they were rewarded with some important materials, including his edited script and a stack of the original transparencies, with Letraset type that he used in London to flash onto the wall the name of each character speaking.\u201cThe transparencies are super-beautiful,\u201d said Ms. Est\u00e9vez, who is planning to recreate the performance at Redcat next year. \u201cWe don\u2019t know exactly how yet, but we know we will use them.\u201dMs. Est\u00e9vez and Mr. L\u00f3pez are not the only curators facing the conundrum in reviving an experimental play or performance nearly lost to history. To what extent do you try for a faithful reproduction, which can verge on seeming nostalgic or academic? Conversely, can you adapt or reimagine a performance for a new audience and time without losing sight of the original?At the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, the original text is the Guatemalan writer Hugo Carrillo\u2019s 1962 \u201cEl Coraz\u00f3n del Espantap\u00e1jaros\u201d (\u201cThe Heart of the Scarecrow\u201d), a play that had students in clown makeup playing the roles of politicians and police officers. Participants received death threats when it was performed in Guatemala City in 1978, a particularly violent year under a military government.Now, the Guatemalan artist Naufus Ram\u00edrez-Figueroa is working to reimagine that performance for a group show that Jos\u00e9 Luis Blondet, Rita Gonzalez and Pilar Tompkins Rivas are organizing for the museum. He is creating sculptures that could be used as props in the play and is in the process of commissioning a young Guatemalan writer to compose a script responding to the props. In essence, \u201cNaufus is rewriting the play instead of recreating it,\u201d Mr. Blondet said.In other Pacific Standard Time shows, curators are working on re-creations or reinterpretations more explicitly guided by the historical goal of preserving and representing artworks that are little known.Ms. Wolffer has not yet finalized details, but \u201cdefinitely\u201d plans to do \u201ca reinterpretation and not a re-creation,\u201d she said in an email. \u201cI believe that trying to literally reproduce the piece would not make much sense in the face of all that has happened in Mexico and U.S.-Mexico relations since then,\u201d she wrote.The curators expect to include a few of the artist\u2019s interactive, technology-based sculptures, which will help put his performances in context, and vice versa. What is more, they have access to one of Mr. Downey\u2019s collaborators, the Chilean dancer and choreographer Carmen Beuchat.\u201cWe are hoping to bring her in as a kind of consulting choreographer as well as a performer, but we don\u2019t want to be too greedy,\u201d said Robert Crouch, an artist-curator who is organizing the show with Ciara Ennis of Pitzer\u2019s gallery.They said their show, which will feature around 10 Downey performances, would probably blend the notions of re-creation and reinterpretation. For a 1972 piece titled \u201cImperialistic Octopus,\u201d for instance, Mr. Downey branded the eight arms of a massive sculpture with names of big corporations that also had long tentacles. Ms. Ennis is considering having students at Pitzer use contemporary references.But for other pieces, she said that she felt a \u201cresponsibility for retaining the original integrity of the work\u201d \u2014 and the technology embedded in it \u2014 because Mr. Downey\u2019s oeuvre is unfamiliar to many. For the 1974 piece \u201cVideo Trans Americas Debriefing Pyramid,\u201d a large installation that originally framed a slow dance by Ms. Beuchat, Ms. Ennis has scoured Craigslist in search of old-style video monitors to be suspended from the ceiling. \u201cFlat-screen TVs would just not give the same aesthetic,\u201d she said. Mr. Crouch said, \u201cSince Juan isn\u2019t here to push back, I think we will have to take our cue from each piece.\u201dAs for Ms. Est\u00e9vez, she has already made several creative decisions about reviving Mr. Ferrari\u2019s \u201cThe Words of Others.\u201d She has rejected the idea of using a stage set, abiding by his own conception of the piece as a text or \u201cliterary collage\u201d to be read (he had radio announcers in mind) rather than a play to be performed. Her plan is to situate the reading within the gallery, alongside other Ferrari artworks and documents.And she has no intention of bringing 120 actors into the space to recite the quotations. While Ms. Est\u00e9vez originally considered trying to create a \u201cfull concert of voices,\u201d she learned that Mr. Maler\u2019s 1968 version in London had only four performers, each of whom recited many quotations. She said her main goal was for the work to have a \u201ccontinuous presence\u201d in the gallery, with at least one reader always present during open hours.Ms. Est\u00e9vez has also assembled a small team to translate the Spanish text and locate the source publications for all quotations that originated in English. Their annotated edition of \u201cThe Words of Others\u201d will be the first published in the United States, providing scholarship for those in the future who might one day seek to realize Mr. Ferrari\u2019s antiwar project in yet another way.An article on Thursday about the J. Paul Getty Trust\u2019s Pacific Standard Time initiative, which is developing exhibitions of art with Latin American and Latino themes in Southern California museums, misstated the surname of an artist-curator who is jointly preparing an exhibition about the Chilean-born artist Juan Downey. He is Robert Crouch, not Couch.An earlier version also omitted the name of one of the curators who is organizing a group show revisiting a 1978 performance of Hugo Carillo\u2019s \u201cEl Coraz\u00f3n del Espantap\u00e1jaro.\u201d She is Pilar Tompkins Rivas.Advertisement"}

Do your job!\u2019\u00a0\u201d Mr. Johnson said, invoking the Democrats\u2019 battle cry in their quest to get Judge Garland a hearing. \u201cWe\u2019re doing our job,\u201d Mr. Johnson declared, to shouts of \u201cyes.\u201d\u201cOur job as a coequal branch in the nomination process is advise and consent,\u201d he said. \u201cWell, President Obama \u2014 surprise \u2014 didn\u2019t heed our advice. So now we are doing the second part of that advice and consent: We\u2019re withholding our consent. Completely appropriate.\u201dWhile Republican leaders say they are taking a principled stand against election-year appointments rather than focusing on Judge Garland\u2019s qualifications, Mr. Johnson, without any pretense, is boasting that he and his Republican colleagues are preventing Mr. Obama from tilting the ideological balance of the court to the left. And he is attacking Judge Garland \u2014 without any basis, many legal experts say \u2014 as posing a grave threat to Second Amendment gun rights, seizing on a potent issue that incites far more passion than the Citizens United campaign finance ruling, which is one of Mr. Feingold\u2019s favored talking points when he discusses the importance of the court vacancy.\u201cJudge Merrick is hostile to your Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms,\u201d Mr. Johnson said in Pewaukee, using the judge\u2019s first name. \u201cSo I am doing my job to protect the Second Amendment rights of Wisconsinites.\u201dDemocrats, including Mr. Feingold, say they are confident that Mr. Johnson is making a politically fatal mistake by playing to the Republican Party\u2019s conservative base in a state that despite the party\u2019s recent inroads has voted Democratic in the past seven presidential elections, and where pocketbook issues like jobs and trade are dominant.\u201cThe two issues \u2014 paying the bills and the Supreme Court \u2014 have the same common problem, which is that the people on the Republican side are not delivering, they are not doing their job,\u201d Mr. Feingold said in an interview in Fond du Lac, where he spoke at a fund-raiser for the county Democratic Party \u2014 a chili cook-off event that organizers called a \u201cKoch off\u201d in satirical honor of the billionaire Koch brothers.\u201cThey protect those at the very top, and they are not even willing to do their job when it comes to a clear issue on the Supreme Court because everything is about being partisan and keeping control on the Supreme Court,\u201d Mr. Feingold said. \u201cSo people smell a rat. They smell that something is not honest about this.\u201dTo be sure, Democrats at Mr. Feingold\u2019s campaign events this week expressed outrage over the refusal by Senate Republican leaders to consider Mr. Obama\u2019s court nomination.Fourteen Republicans and all Democrats are needed to break a filibuster and confirm the nominee.\u201cThat\u2019s not acceptable,\u201d said Sarah Lloyd, a newcomer to politics who is challenging Representative Glenn Grothman in Wisconsin\u2019s Sixth Congressional District. \u201cI mean the whole point of the Supreme Court is that it\u2019s outside of partisan politics. But the rules are that the sitting president gets to appoint. So it\u2019s ironic that the people claiming to be the strict constitutionalists are saying that they want to have an exception in this case.\u201dBut so far, the excitement voiced by Wisconsin Republicans over preventing the appointment of a left-leaning justice suggests that the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky, acted far more strategically than many Democrats believed when he announced just hours after the death of Justice Antonin Scalia that the vacancy would not be filled this year. The unknown question is how moderate and independent swing voters, who do not turn up at campaign events but will likely determine the outcome of the November elections, will respond.The fight over the court could hardly be framed better than in Wisconsin. Mr. Feingold, a longtime member of the Senate Judiciary Committee and former chairman of the subcommittee on the Constitution, is trying to win back the seat he lost as part of the nationwide Tea Party wave that swept over the state in 2010 \u2014 the same year Scott Walker was elected governor.Mr. Feingold cites his past record, noting that he voted to confirm Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr., but opposed the nomination of Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr. \u2014 each selected by President George W. Bush.\u201cI never, ever, ever questioned his right to fill those seats,\u201d Mr. Feingold said of Mr. Bush. \u201cI reserved the right to vote against somebody he put forward. I, of course, met with the nominees. I went to the hearings.\u201dBut Mr. Johnson is adamant. When pressed to explain his position while campaigning at Weldall, a metal fabrication plant in Waukesha where he picked up the endorsement of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, he vowed that Senate Republicans would not budge.Merrick B. Garland is a candidate who had support from Republicans in the past but would still move the court in a progressive direction.Legal experts, including some who have worked for Mr. Bush, say Judge Garland is a moderate jurist who might just as well have been nominated by a Republican president. But Mr. Johnson told his audience that Judge Garland \u201cwould be pretty hostile toward your Second Amendment rights\u201d and other basic freedoms outlined in the Bill of Rights and he was trying to preserve them.\u201cSo again, I am doing my job,\u201d Mr. Johnson said in response to a question from Richard Diercksmeier, a retired engineer. \u201cI am withholding my consent, on particularly this nominee who would be very hostile to certainly Wisconsinites\u2019 Second Amendments rights to keep and bear arms, as well as your right to free speech, freedom of religion.\u201dMr. Diercksmeier pronounced himself satisfied with that response. \u201cI have been reading the news, and I\u2019ve been getting the impression that he might be vacillating on his feelings about the possible appointment of a replacement on the Supreme Court before the election happens,\u201d he said. \u201cBut he pretty much dispelled my concerns.\u201dLike many Republicans, Mr. Diercksmeier said he was willing to take a chance that a Democrat would win the White House and nominate an even more liberal judge to the Supreme Court. \u201cI think it\u2019s worth a gamble to see who the next president is and who he appoints,\u201d he said.Democrats say there are reasons for Mr. Johnson and his supporters to worry, noting that 15 Republican senators have now said that they would be willing to meet with Judge Garland even after Mr. McConnell and others called such meetings pointless.Still, Ricky Watson, who works on the factory floor at Weldall, and described himself as a supporter of Mr. Obama, said he would not be surprised if many of his co-workers were persuaded by Mr. Johnson\u2019s arguments.\u201cThese guys I work with, all they are talking about is buying guns,\u201d he said. \u201cGuns. Guns. Guns. I don\u2019t understand it. You can only fire one at a time.\u201dAdvertisement"}

The great powers of bygone centuries subscribed to the economic theory of mercantilism, \u201cWherein we must ever observe this rule: to sell more to strangers yearly than we consume of theirs in value,\u201d as its apostle, the East India Company director Thomas Mun, wrote in the 1600s.Now Mr. Trump is bringing mercantilism back. The New York billionaire is challenging the last 200 years of economic orthodoxy that trade among nations is good, and that more is better.He is well on his way to becoming the first Republican nominee in nearly a century who has called for higher tariffs, or import taxes, as a broad defense against low-cost imports. And there is a good chance he would face a Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton, who has expressed fewer reservations about trade, inverting a longstanding political dynamic.Mr. Trump\u2019s mercantilism is among his oldest and steadiest public positions. Since at least the 1980s, he has described trade as a zero-sum game in which countries lose by paying for imports. The trade deficit with China, which reached $366 billion last year, makes America the biggest loser. \u201cOur trade deficit with China is like having a business that continues to lose money every single year,\u201d Mr. Trump told The Daily News in August. \u201cWho would do business like that?\u201dDuring the current campaign, he has regularly advocated tariffs as the best solution.He has promised to penalize American companies that build foreign factories. For months, his favored example was Ford, which announced plans last summer to expand in Mexico. More recently, he has called out Carrier, which is shifting air-conditioner production to Mexico from Indiana.\u201cI will call the head of Carrier and I will say, \u2018I hope you enjoy your new building,\u2019 \u201d Mr. Trump said last month. \u201c\u2018I hope you enjoy Mexico. Here\u2019s the story, folks: Every single air-conditioning unit that you build and send across our border \u2014 you\u2019re going to pay a 35 percent tax on that unit.\u2019 \u201dEconomists have long struggled against the popular view that exports are a measure of economic vitality while imports are evidence of regrettable dependence.They argue that the opposite is true.Everyone can buy a cheaper air-conditioner when Carrier debarks for a lower-cost country, but a few hundred people will lose their livelihoods.Pietra Rivoli, a finance professor at Georgetown University who explored the effect of increased globalization in her 2005 book, \u201cThe Travels of a T-Shirt in the Global Economy,\u201d said Mr. Trump might be finding a receptive audience in part because the United States had provided relatively little help to workers harmed by trade.\u201cYou have much more negative sentiment about trade in the U.S. than you do in pretty much any other wealthy country, and they\u2019ve lost their T-shirt jobs, too,\u201d Ms. Rivoli said. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on there is that in those countries, which are even more exposed to trade than we are, those countries have a bigger safety net.\u201dMr. Trump has also accused other nations, notably Japan and China, of cheating by suppressing the value of their currencies to make their exports cheaper.\u201cI am all for free trade, but it\u2019s got to be fair,\u201d Mr. Trump has said repeatedly.Economists persuaded governments to abandon mercantilism by demonstrating that trade barriers imposed higher prices on the masses while narrowly benefiting those sheltered from competition.A coalition of Republicans is banking on a scenario in which Donald J. Trump fails to reach the 1,237 delegates required to secure the party\u2019s nomination before its July convention, creating a potential opening for another nominee as the delegates vote on the convention floor.The United States largely dismantled its broad tariffs in the mid-20th century, opening the modern era of globalization. But some tariffs remain, providing a reminder of the costs and benefits. Annual imports of Chinese tires increased to 46 million in 2008 from 15 million in 2004, and American tire makers shed several thousand jobs.So in 2009, the Obama administration, at the urging of workers\u2019 unions, imposed a Trump-like tariff beginning at 35 percent and expiring after three years.China, moreover, retaliated by slapping a punitive tariff on American chicken parts \u2014 China is a particularly lucrative market for chicken feet \u2014 which cost American poultry exporters about $1 billion in lost sales over the same period.Eswar Prasad, a Cornell University economist, said Mr. Trump was raising legitimate concerns. Other nations do impose disproportionate restrictions on American goods, he said. The problem, Mr. Prasad said, is the proposed solution.\u201cIt might be that the threat of tariffs or other trade sanctions could cause American trading partners to open up their markets or drop their barriers to trade,\u201d Mr. Prasad said. \u201cPerhaps as a bargaining chip, it\u2019s not necessarily so bad. But there is a risk that rather than having that positive effect, it leads to retaliation on both sides.\u201dBecause of an editing error, an article on Friday about Donald Trump\u2019s views on American trade policy misidentified the location from which Carrier will be shifting its air-conditioner production. It is Indiana, not India. (It is expanding to Mexico.)Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Taking On Citizens United", "Date": "2016-03-30", "News": "Supported byOp-Ed ContributorSOMETHING is very wrong with the way we fund our elections. This has become especially clear since Citizens United, the 2010 Supreme Court decision that struck down campaign spending limits on corporations, ruling they were intrusions on free speech.This key distinction, read in harmony with existing law, provides ways to blunt the impact of the decision that gave corporations the right to spend unlimited sums of money on federal elections.Foreign nationals are another matter. They are forbidden by law from directly or indirectly making political contributions or financing certain election-related advertising known as independent expenditures and electioneering communications. Government contractors are also barred from making contributions.Thus, when the court spoke of \u201cassociations of citizens\u201d that have the right to participate in American elections, it can only have meant associations of American citizens who are allowed to contribute.But many American corporations have shareholders who are foreigners or government contractors. These corporations are not associations of citizens who are allowed to contribute. They are an inseparable mix of citizens and noncitizens, or of citizens and federal contractors.Since the court held that a corporation\u2019s right to participate in elections flows from the collected rights of its individual shareholders to participate, it follows that limits on those individuals\u2019 rights must also flow to the corporation.You cannot have a right collectively that you do not have individually. Individual foreigners are barred from spending to sway elections; it defies logic to allow groups of foreigners, or foreigners in combination with American citizens, to fund political spending through corporations. If that were true, foreigners could easily evade the restriction by simply setting up shell corporations through which to funnel their contributions.Arguably, then, for a corporation to make political contributions or expenditures legally, it may not have any shareholders who are foreigners or federal contractors. Corporations with easily identifiable shareholders could meet this standard, but most publicly traded corporations probably could not.This may sound like an extreme result, but it underscores how urgently policy makers need to examine these issues with an eye toward drawing acceptable lines. Perhaps we could require corporations that spend in federal elections to verify that the share of their foreign ownership is less than 20 percent, or some other threshold. The Federal Communications Commission, for example, bars companies that are more than 20 percent owned by foreign nationals from owning a broadcast license. At the moment, without a clarifying rule, the only standard that follows the law is a zero-tolerance standard.If one thing is clear this election season, it is that many voters feel that their voices are not being heard. We should make sure that the voices of citizens are not being drowned out by corporate money. American billionaires already have an outsize influence on our elections. Let\u2019s not cede yet more power to foreign elites.To that end, at the next public meeting of the Federal Election Commission, I will move to direct the commission\u2019s lawyers to provide us with options on how best to instruct corporate political spenders of their obligations under both Citizens United and statutory law. The American people deserve assurances from American corporations that they are not using the money of foreign shareholders to influence our elections.Regardless of whether the perpetually deadlocked F.E.C. takes action, lawyers may wish to think twice before signing off on corporate political giving or spending that they cannot guarantee comes entirely from legal sources.States can also take action, since Citizens United and federal law barring foreign money apply with equal force at the state level. States can require entities accepting political contributions from corporations in state and local races to make sure that those corporations are indeed associations of American citizens \u2014 and enforce the ban on foreign political spending against those that are not.Advertisement"}

He had to look convincing as an aspiring Olympian who spends the whole show in the swimsuit of the title. And he needed to, well, play dumb \u2014 at least outside the water, where his character is caught up in a doping scandal that could derail a lucrative future.He applied his background as an athlete to both.Six-foot-three and slim, Mr. Breaux, a 30-year-old former Harvard University wide receiver, was in good shape when he was cast in Lucas Hnath\u2019s play last fall \u2014 he has taught spinning seven mornings a week since he was in graduate school at Juilliard \u2014 but he said he didn\u2019t want audience members to have to suspend any disbelief.So he undertook a grueling exercise and diet regimen that has dramatically reduced his body fat while giving him an extremely defined chest, back and washboard abs. He acknowledged losing more weight than he intended \u2014 he wouldn\u2019t say what he weighs now \u2014 but said he feels satisfied with the look he has achieved for the role.As for why Ray seems dense, Mr. Breaux noted that athletes who have to do a very repetitive movement over long periods \u2014 running or rowing or swimming \u2014 need to be able to get into a Zen-like state.\u201cTo rip Ray out of the flow zone, out of that spaciness, and then start peppering him with questions,\u201d as his brother does, \u201cyou\u2019ve just changed the rules of engagement for him, and of course he\u2019s going to come across as inarticulate,\u201d Mr. Breaux said.Indeed Mr. Breaux \u2014 yes, it\u2019s pronounced BRO \u2014 doesn\u2019t agree that Ray, who spends large chunks of the play staring at the middle distance, absent-mindedly munching carrots, is unintelligent. \u201cHe\u2019s very articulate under water, physically \u2014 he\u2019s a genius,\u201d he said.Mr. Breaux himself was animated and energetic during an interview last week, which seemed incredible after he admitted that during previews he was getting only three to five hours of sleep a night.He is remarkably earnest. To not succumb to the constant rejection an actor experiences, he posts motivational quotes around his room, like \u201cLove your guts\u201d and \u201c\u2018Want\u2019 is more popular than \u2018work.\u2019\u201dHe was born in Richmond, Va., but grew up mostly in Oakland, Calif. He described his family as sports-oriented and \u201cnot artistic at all.\u201d He played football in high school and was the homecoming king. His coach and English teacher, Jamie Donohoe, with whom he is still close, said he had imagined that Mr. Breaux might ultimately have some kind of job on the business side of sports, \u201cdoing that hustle, where he could use that creative mind of his, but also that charm and that work ethic.\u201dAs a sophomore, Mr. Breaux was majoring in economics, with plans to work after graduation at an investment bank when, on a whim, he went to see a play at the American Repertory Theater. He had never really been interested in theater, he said, which at the time he associated mostly with big Disney musicals.In a talk after the performance, he asked an actress who had recited a monologue while consuming an entire birthday cake if she ever worried she would choke.\u201cShe was like, \u2018I pretty much choke on the cake every night,\u2019\u201d he recalled. \u201cAnd I loved that.\u201dMr. Breaux cherished football, he said, in part because the experience of catching a pass was \u201clike knowing you\u2019re about to get in a car crash, but you don\u2019t know from which direction or how heavy the impact.\u201d It felt to him like the cast of \u201cbobrauschenbergamerica\u201d was doing something similarly dangerous and daring.He began auditioning for student productions, but didn\u2019t get any roles until his junior year, when he was cast as Father Flynn, the priest who may or may not have molested a boy in \u201cDoubt.\u201d His senior year he played Joe Pitt, the closeted Mormon lawyer, in both parts of \u201cAngels in America.\u201dHe still played football, so he would go to practice, then run \u2014 without showering \u2014 to rehearsal. Halfway through the year, he decided he would be unfulfilled working in finance and turned down a job he had accepted at Barclays. He auditioned for Juilliard and was accepted.Ellen Lauren, the actress who had talked about choking on the cake, became one of his teachers.\u201cI made sure I was incredibly rude, cocky and generally misbehaved while in the room,\u201d Mr. Breaux said of his auditions for the role.Then there was his experience on the field.\u201cAt one of the callbacks, I just remember he spoke really eloquently about being an athlete,\u201d Ms. Blain-Cruz explained. \u201cHe just spoke about the kind of high that you get when you\u2019re constantly working your body and it puts you in a certain state, and I thought that was really helpful in thinking about Ray.\u201dIn the last year, Mr. Breaux has shot two independent films that have not yet been released: \u201cBushwick,\u201d an action movie set in the near future, about a second American civil war, in which he gets beaten up by Dave Bautista, the professional wrestler turned actor; and \u201cKatie Says Goodbye,\u201d in which he plays a long-distance trucker with a debilitating stutter, who asks out the title character. It\u2019s \u201ca rare, sympathetic, nonbloody role for Alex Breaux,\u201d Mr. Breaux said.He is auditioning for other film and TV jobs and also revising a pilot about college football. He wrote, directed and acted in a short film, \u201cHotline,\u201d about a combat medic home from Afghanistan who is contemplating suicide. He has also written a screenplay based on Pat Conroy\u2019s memoir, \u201cMy Losing Season,\u201d about his senior basketball season at the Citadel during the Vietnam War.Mr. Breaux doesn\u2019t know what his next job will be after \u201cRed Speedo,\u201d which is scheduled to run through April 3. But he has envisioned the \u201cblowout meal\u201d he\u2019ll eat, at his favorite restaurant, the Cheesecake Factory, when he\u2019s done.

{"Headline": "Donald Trump Considered Path to Presidency Starting at Governor\u2019s Mansion in New York", "Date": "2016-03-05", "News": "Supported byThe four-page briefing outlined the challenges that most first-time political candidates face, including \u201cendless chicken dinners\u201d and a high probability of a \u201closs of income from serving in government.\u201dBut the document also had the particular interests of Mr. Trump in mind: It was titled \u201cSpringboards to the Presidency.\u201dMr. Trump has a long history of musing about running for office, and then abandoning the idea. His flirtation with the 2014 race for governor was viewed then as another headline-grabbing stunt, much as his current presidential bid had been initially dismissed.An examination by The New York Times of contemporaneous documents and emails, as well as interviews with people who met with Mr. Trump during that period, found how he carefully weighed a run, measuring whether the governor\u2019s office was a necessary steppingstone to his long-held goal: the White House. His calculations at the time run contrary to the seat-of-the-pants image he projects on the campaign trail, and offer a look at a formative stage of his presidential ambitions.He discussed with state Republican leaders the idea of using the governorship as a platform to run for president, a situation in which he would serve for a year or so and be succeeded by his lieutenant governor.Mr. Trump also foreshadowed themes that have surfaced on the campaign trail, giving a blunt assessment of what he felt was ailing New York State and the country: jobs going overseas, crushing taxes, restrictive gun laws.During another meeting with state Republican leaders at Trump Tower in Manhattan, the conversation migrated to the nation\u2019s future. Mr. Trump told them he did not think the country could withstand eight years of Hillary Clinton after eight years of President Obama, according to a document summarizing the meeting. Mr. Trump added that he wanted to \u201csave the country\u201d from debt and felt the political left was going to destroy the American work ethic.For his supporters, the recruitment drive offered an unexpected look at Mr. Trump\u2019s budding strategy to capture the White House, which he predicted he would begin in 2015. As such, they tailored their local pitch to his national ambitions, saying that his road to Washington almost certainly ran through Albany.\u201cThe most common path to the presidency is through a governor\u2019s office (19 out of 43) and the most common governor\u2019s office to hold is New York (4 out of 19),\u201d Assemblyman Bill Nojay, the freshman legislator who represents the Rochester area, wrote in the memo given to Mr. Trump and a small group of Republicans.Mr. Trump hosted numerous meetings with state Republican leaders at his office in Trump Tower, used his private jet to attend upstate rallies and even tried to secure the support of another voting bloc, the Conservative Party.His allies commissioned a poll, and in one meeting even presented Mr. Trump with documentation to register an official exploratory committee, with a notary public at the ready.Many would-be Trump organizers were convinced that he was serious about unseating Mr. Cuomo. \u201cHe came to us,\u201d said Sandra King, chairwoman of the Yates County Republican Committee. \u201cHe took our phone calls. He listened to what we had to say.\u201dMr. Trump confirmed in a statement that the state Republican Party\u2019s inability to assure an uncontested race was a deal-breaker, though he played down his interest. \u201cI never looked seriously at running for governor,\u201d he said, adding, \u201cIf I ran, I would have won.\u201dHe said that \u201ceven then, what I really wanted to do was run for president, and obviously, now that I am the substantial front-runner, I made the right decision.\u201d\u2018Almost Iconic Figure\u2019A memo sent to Donald J. Trump in December 2013 detailed how he could increase his chances of winning the White House if he first ran for governor of New York.But when Mr. Trump declared his White House bid last year, this campaign was no fleeting thought.David DiPietro, a Republican lawmaker from the Buffalo area, said he and Mr. Nojay were on the floor of the State Assembly that June, lamenting the corruption in Albany, when they first hit on the idea of encouraging Mr. Trump to run for governor.\u201cWe have to find someone to clean up\u201d this mess, Mr. DiPietro recalled telling Mr. Nojay.A few months later, Mr. Nojay put their thoughts down on paper.\u201cIn many respects Trump is not considered a Republican \u2014 he is his brand, an almost iconic figure of Rockefellerian proportions,\u201d Mr. Nojay wrote in October in a three-page memo, \u201c2014 NY Governor Race Analysis,\u201d which he sent to a small group of party members, including Edward F. Cox, the state\u2019s party chairman and a son-in-law of President Richard M. Nixon.The conditions for a Trump for governor bid, the analysis continued, were ideal. New York City was about to elect Bill de Blasio, its first \u201ctruly radical\u201d mayor, whom the memo referred to as a Marxist who honeymooned in Havana. \u201cBy 2014 a pro-business, proven executive will be welcome to offset\u201d a Mayor de Blasio, the memo said.Behind the scenes, another story was playing out. A member of Mr. Trump\u2019s inner circle contacted Mr. Nojay, and in early November he and Mr. DiPietro found themselves meeting Mr. Trump for the first time, at Trump Tower in a large conference room with floor-to-ceiling windows overlooking Central Park.The meeting, scheduled for roughly 30 minutes, stretched beyond two hours. The group denounced the Safe Act, far-reaching gun-control legislation that Mr. Cuomo signed into law, and bemoaned job losses and economic erosion.Intrigued, Mr. Trump agreed to keep talking about a possible bid for governor. A larger meeting was convened in early December.An October 2013 memo sent to senior New York State Republicans urged them to consider Donald J. Trump as the party's nominee for governor.Path to the White HouseMr. Nojay, armed with data, ran Mr. Trump through a list of presidents and their r\u00e9sum\u00e9s. \u201cGoing back to George Washington, there has never been a president who has not served in high public office,\u201d he said he told Mr. Trump.Mr. Nojay recalled that while he was speaking, Mr. Trump asked an aide to bring his daughter Ivanka and sons Donald Jr. and Eric, and additional employees into the conference room.After they entered, Mr. Trump asked Mr. Nojay to repeat his pitch for their benefit.\u201cHe read the political landscape better than anyone,\u201d said Joseph C. Borelli, a Republican councilman from Staten Island who was an assemblyman when he attended the meeting. \u201cHe all but said he would enter the presidential race in the summer of 2015 and he would be first in the polls.\u201dIn late December, Mr. Trump received Mr. Nojay\u2019s \u201cSpringboards to the Presidency\u201d memo. It included an exhibit titled \u201cPaths to the Presidency,\u201d again outlining the careers of past presidents, all of whom had previous public service. \u201cThis is not an accident of history,\u201d he wrote.The notion of a Trump bid for governor gained more momentum among his supporters when a group that opposed Mr. Cuomo commissioned a private poll, conducted by Kellyanne Conway, a Republican strategist. The poll showed Mr. Cuomo leading Mr. Trump in a head-to-head matchup, Ms. Conway said, but it also highlighted the governor\u2019s vulnerabilities. It suggested that Mr. Trump, with his name recognition and ability to finance a sizable campaign, could be a formidable opponent.Mr. Long said he went to Trump Tower in December 2013, \u201cunder the pretense that Mr. Trump would be there.\u201d Instead, Mr. Long experienced something even more surreal: He arrived at Mr. Trump\u2019s office, only to realize that Mr. Trump was not there and he would be speaking to him by phone.It was clear, Mr. Long said, that Mr. Trump was \u201cup to speed\u201d on New York issues, and that he had a real animus toward Mr. Cuomo. But Mr. Trump, unwilling to face competition for the nomination, told Mr. Long that one condition for his candidacy would be to get Rob Astorino, the Westchester County executive who was already planning to run, out of the race.\u201cI made it clear to him, that\u2019s not how politics works,\u201d Mr. Long said. \u201cIt isn\u2019t us picking up a phone and telling a candidate you can\u2019t run.\u201dAround the same time, Mr. Trump reached out directly to Mr. Astorino, whom he knew for many years through his golf club in Briarcliff Manor in Westchester. When they met at Trump Tower, Mr. Astorino said he told Mr. Trump, \u201cLook, my intention is to stay in.\u201dEventually, Mr. Astorino recalled, he was asked (though he would not say by whom) to consider joining a \u201cunity ticket\u201d in which Mr. Trump would run for governor and Mr. Astorino for lieutenant governor. Mr. Astorino would become governor after Mr. Trump declared his presidential bid.Bigger PlansIn January 2014, a small number of political operatives met privately with Mr. Trump in his penthouse at Trump Tower. One participant, Ralph C. Lorigo, the chairman of the Erie County Conservative Party, recalled that he brought the necessary papers for Mr. Trump to form an exploratory committee to run for governor, with a notary stamp in his pocket.\u201cHe toyed with it back and forth,\u201d Mr. Lorigo said. \u201cBut I couldn\u2019t convince him.\u201dNot long after these sessions, Mr. Cox, the state\u2019s Republican Party chairman, began to voice his concerns of a Trump candidacy. At a meeting at the University Club in Manhattan, which was attended by some of the same people who had just met with Mr. Trump, Mr. Cox said he told the group, \u201cI am really concerned this is not something he wants to do.\u201dMr. Trump\u2019s supporters were livid. \u201cDonald Trump didn\u2019t run for governor because Ed Cox wouldn\u2019t get out of the way,\u201d said Michael Caputo, a political consultant who helped arrange several of the meetings.Undeterred, Mr. Trump flew to Buffalo and Syracuse, where he headlined local party fund-raisers. In New York City, at a February fund-raising event, Mr. Isaacs unveiled a large blue and red sign that read \u201cTrump For Governor.\u201d The crowd erupted in applause, and many attendees expected Mr. Trump would announce his candidacy that night.He did not. Several weeks later, over dinner at the mogul\u2019s Mar-a-Lago Club in Palm Beach, Fla., Mr. Cox told Mr. Trump that the New York State Republican Committee could not stop other candidates from competing.\u201cHe made it clear to me that night he wasn\u2019t going to run,\u201d said Mr. Cox, who described Mr. Trump as upset. Mr. Cox would not elaborate further.A few days later, Mr. Trump ended the speculation via Twitter: \u201cWhile I won\u2019t be running for governor of New York State, a race I would have won, I have much bigger plans in mind \u2014 stay tuned, will happen!\u201dSusan C.

{"Headline": "Health Law Insurance Plans to be Rated by Network Size", "Date": "2016-03-06", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The Obama administration, responding to consumer complaints, says it will begin rating health insurance plans based on how many doctors and hospitals they include in their networks.At the same time, the maximum out-of-pocket costs for consumers under the Affordable Care Act will increase next year to $7,150 for an individual and $14,300 for a family, the administration said. Consumer advocates said those costs could be a significant burden for middle-income people who need a substantial amount of care.About 12.7 million people signed up or had their coverage automatically renewed in the third annual open enrollment season, which ended on Jan. 31.Many health plans offered in the public marketplaces provide a limited choice of doctors and hospitals, and some insurers narrowed their networks this year by excluding some doctors and dropping popular teaching hospitals.Consumers have grumbled about the changes, and some say they have had difficulty finding medical specialists. But cost-conscious consumers have gravitated to these plans because they tend to offer lower premiums than health plans providing a greater choice of doctors and hospitals.Consumers can already find out which health plans include a specific doctor. But until now they had no reliable way to determine if a health plan had a large or small network of providers. The new ratings will indicate how the breadth of a health plan\u2019s network compares with that of other plans in the same geographic area.Consumers have also complained about the out-of-pocket costs for many health plans under the Affordable Care Act.Out-of-pocket costs, as defined by the government, include deductibles and co-payments, but not the premiums that people pay for insurance. Each insurer sets limits on out-of-pocket costs for its health plans, and the limit cannot be higher than the maximum specified by the government. The maximum for an individual will exceed $7,000 next year for the first time. It will go up by $300 in 2017, after an increase of $250 this year.Consumer groups say this rate of increase is unsustainable. Moreover, they say, high out-of-pocket costs have deterred some people with insurance from using expensive prescription drugs.People with low incomes can obtain discounts that reduce their deductibles and other out-of-pocket costs if they choose midlevel silver plans. Slightly more than half of the people with marketplace coverage received such \u201ccost-sharing reductions\u201d last year.Ms. Corlette, the Georgetown University professor, said that in writing the new rules, \u201cthe administration was walking a very delicate line, pushing forward with consumer protections while trying to keep insurers onboard and participating in the marketplaces.\u201dIn some markets, consumers can choose from dozens of health plans. In a move intended to simplify the shopping experience, the Obama administration has devised six model health plans that it describes as standardized options. Federal officials specify the amount of deductibles, co-payments and other charges for doctors\u2019 services, hospital care, X-rays, laboratory tests and prescription drugs.The standard features will make it easier for consumers to compare plans, officials said, and the government will highlight these plans in some way on HealthCare.gov. But the government is not requiring insurers to offer the standardized options or limiting their ability to offer other plans in 2017.Another new requirement is meant to guarantee \u201ccontinuity of care\u201d for certain patients. If a health plan drops a doctor from its network without cause, the insurer must allow patients in \u201can active course of treatment\u201d to continue seeing the doctor for up to 90 days. This protection would apply, for example, to patients receiving chemotherapy or radiation therapy for cancer and to women in the second or third trimester of pregnancy.Under the new rules, consumers using the federal marketplace will be able to get help year-round from insurance counselors financed by the government. The counselors, known as navigators, help people sign up in the annual open enrollment period. The administration is expanding their duties to include teaching people how to use insurance, appeal denials of coverage and obtain exemptions.Advertisement"}

The city agents get a cut of the commission if their clients decide to buy a house in the suburbs. The services, which reside somewhere between shrink session and sales pitch, intend to address the concerns of families unsure about leaving the city and guide them to suburbia, step by step.At the October event, four agents who had made the move from the city to the suburbs themselves presented overviews of real estate options in Long Island, Westchester County, Fairfield County, Conn., and Essex County, N.J., to a mix of couples in business suits and parents with babies in slings and toddlers on iPads. The overall message: Life isn\u2019t so terrible in the \u2019burbs.In addition to highlighting the better real estate values, each broker emphasized the cultural attractions, farmers\u2019 markets and culinary options of their respective neighborhoods, often drawing comparisons to New York City.While some families moving to the suburbs want to replicate a semblance of their former urban lifestyle, many are happy to escape the excruciating process of securing a spot in a good New York City school. Joan O\u2019Rourke Tuckman had no intention of leaving the city. After all, she and her husband, Joe Tuckman, an advertising sales executive, rented a $4,200-a-month two-bedroom on the Upper West Side just two doors down from a top public school. \u201cIn my eyes, we had the best deal in the world and we never needed to leave,\u201d said Ms. Tuckman, who had worked in advertising sales before taking time off to be with her son, Ryan.Circumstances changed last year when Ryan was wait-listed for kindergarten because the school did not have enough open seats. So the couple began looking outside the city and, working with Lois Lehman, a real estate agent at William Raveis, closed in January on a $1.06 million four-bedroom, three-and-a-half-bath in Fairfield, Conn.\u201cIt was very hard for me to leave,\u201d Ms. Tuckman said, noting that she had an enlarged photograph of the noisy city corner where they had lived hanging in a central spot in their new suburban living room. But she admits she was glad when she finally moved. \u201cI was the happiest person this summer,\u201d she said.Ms. Tuckman\u2019s transformation is common for New York City expats in suburbia, according to Ms. Lehman, the Tuckmans\u2019 broker. \u201cThere\u2019s a certain resistance to the white picket fence and the suburban lifestyle,\u201d she said. \u201cJoan dealt with that.\u201dBrokerage firms see an opportunity right now, as prices in leafy suburban communities look increasingly attractive compared with the skyrocketing expense of buying in the city. \u201cWhile the Manhattan market has soared in the last few years, the suburban markets remained relatively unchanged, so a lot of people are saying, \u2018Is it time to at least think about moving out to the suburbs?\u2019 \u201d said Mr. Gold of Douglas Elliman.In the fourth quarter of 2015, the median price in Manhattan was $1.15 million, up 36.1 percent from $845,000 in the same period in 2010, according to Jonathan J. Miller, the president of the appraisal firm Miller Samuel. The median in Brooklyn was $650,000, up 36.8 percent over the same five-year span. By contrast the median fourth-quarter prices remained relatively unchanged during the same period in Westchester ($425,000 versus $450,000), Fairfield ($385,000 versus $380,000), and Nassau Counties ($435,000 versus $405,000).Three couples detail their moves to find more space in the areas surrounding New York.There is no fee for this service. Clients are later referred to outside real estate agents in their chosen towns who have been vetted by Suburban Jungle, which gets a cut of the commission if the agent sells a home.\u201cWe weren\u2019t sure where we wanted to live, and they were really helpful in narrowing it down,\u201d said Amanda Allen, 33. Ms. Allen moved to Old Greenwich, Conn., from Manhattan earlier this month with her husband, Edward, 42, who works in finance, and Grayson, their 2-year-old son.After selling their one-bedroom co-op in Greenwich Village about a year ago, the Allens, who are expecting their second child in May, had hoped to use the profit to buy a larger apartment in the city. \u201cAbout a year ago we put in a bid for a two-bedroom,\u201d said Mr. Allen. \u201cIt went for $350,000 over ask.\u201d In the meantime, they rented a two-bedroom near Lincoln Center.\u201cNeither of us really wanted to live in the suburbs,\u201d he said. They came across Suburban Jungle while attending a baby industry event last May and spent an hour and a half on the phone with a consultant who sent them town reports on Harrison and Rye in Westchester County and Darien and Greenwich in Fairfield County.\u201cThey could tell us more than a broker is legally allowed to tell us,\u201d Mr. Allen said. \u201cBecause they were moms living there with their kids,\u201d he added, the strategists not only knew which areas were zoned for good public middle schools, \u201cthey knew which roads you don\u2019t want to live on because the traffic is heavy.\u201d He added, \u201cIt was like getting an insider\u2019s perspective.\u201dAfter ruling out Westchester because of high taxes, they narrowed their search to Old Greenwich for its \u201cproper Main Street,\u201d good schools and proximity to the water.In January, they closed on a five-bedroom four-and-a-half-bath for about $2 million. Owning the house, which is on a quarter acre that backs onto Greenwich Cove, \u201cis far cheaper than renting the two-bedroom in the city,\u201d Mr. Allen pointed out. After they moved in last month, neighbors started showing up with gifts. \u201cThey brought us flowers. We had a welcome book,\u201d said Mrs. Allen. \u201cWhen we moved into our Ninth Street co-op we certainly did not get that \u2014 just a list of what our hours of construction would be.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Bernie Sanders, Buoyed by Poll, Sprints Through Wisconsin", "Date": "2016-03-30", "News": "Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont spent Wednesday crisscrossing Wisconsin, hosting events in three cities and arguing that his stances on trade deals, campaign finance and foreign policy make him a stronger candidate than Hillary Clinton.Mr. Sanders also assailed Gov. Scott Walker of Wisconsin, a Republican who has waged public feuds with progressive groups over several issues, including voter identification laws, union organizing, reproductive rights and cuts to educational programs.The senator began the day in Kenosha, Wis., speaking to a crowd of 2,750 at Carthage College. There and in later events, he took aim at Mrs. Clinton for her stances on trade policies like the North American Free Trade Agreement and cast himself as the best person to protect American workers from companies who would rather employ lower-paid workers abroad.\u00e2\u0080\u009cOver the last 30, 40 years, we have had trade policies in this country written by corporate America, and what they have been designed to do is to allow companies to shut down plants in Vermont, in Wisconsin and all over this country because they don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want to pay workers here $15, $20, $25 an hour,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Sanders said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThey don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want to pay them a living wage. They don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want to protect environmental rules. They don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want to deal with unions. They\u00e2\u0080\u0099d rather move to Mexico or China, pay people pennies an hour.\u00e2\u0080\u009dHe went on to connect Mrs. Clinton to those companies, using a line of attack that worked well in Michigan, where he pulled off a surprising victory this month. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe are talking, over a period of years, of the loss of tens of thousands of good-paying jobs here in Wisconsin, millions of jobs throughout this country,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cOn all of these trade policies, Nafta, permanent normal trade relations with China, I not only voted against them, I help lead the opposition against them. On the other hand, over the years, Secretary Clinton has supported virtually all of these disastrous trade agreements.\u00e2\u0080\u009dMr. Sanders listed several companies in Wisconsin that he said had been affected by trade deals. He said Chrysler received billions of dollars in a bailout in 2009 but then shut down its Kenosha Engine Plant and cut 800 jobs, moving the operation to Saltillo, Mexico. He also pointed to the 2008 closing of the General Motors manufacturing plant in Janesville, which he said meant the city lost more than 2,800 jobs because the company moved the plant to Silao, Mexico.In an effort to further appeal to voters, Mr. Sanders also assailed Mr. Walker for making changes to the state\u00e2\u0080\u0099s voter identification laws and urged his supporters to set a new voter turnout record for Wisconsin.\u00e2\u0080\u009cWe will win if the voter turnout is high. We will lose if the voter turnout is low,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Sanders told 1,678 people who came out to his Madison rally. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd I am asking that all of those people who have given up on the political process, who have turned their backs on politics and no longer vote, please come out. And I am asking the young people who maybe have never voted in their lives to please come out. Let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s send a very strong message to Governor Walker.\u00e2\u0080\u009dEarlier in the afternoon, Marquette Law School released a poll showing that among likely voters in the Wisconsin Democratic primary, Mr. Sanders held a 49 percent to 45 percent edge over Mrs. Clinton.\n\t\tFirst Draft provides fast-paced and comprehensive coverage of politics and elections by The New York Times.

Corey Brennan, the classics professor who has been collaborating with Ms. Seidel, of Mr. Pereda. \u201cPeople are excited he\u2019s here.\u201dBecause of an editing error, an article in some editions this weekend on Page 10 about a digital filmmaking program at Rutgers University omits the given name of a classics professor who comments on the program.

But investors are struggling to see the silver lining in the headlines about Valeant.Mr. Levine also notes that he does not understand Valeant\u00e2\u0080\u0099s investor-relations strategy. Why have one-on-one calls to reassure analysts, only to  sandbag them with bad results and guidance two weeks later? he asks. Also in question is why the company had to issue a correction over an earnings release that it knew would be heavily scrutinized.  Its stock market value of $11.4 billion after the close of business on Tuesday was less than half of the $31 billion in debt the company carries. Valeant\u00e2\u0080\u0099s reliance on acquisitions makes the company\u00e2\u0080\u0099s true cash flows much harder to fathom and its preferred measure of cash flow is not based on generally accepted accounting principles, so it is not reliable.

SunEdison controls the yieldcos but does not own a majority interest. Appaloosa Management protested about the acquisition, asserting that SunEdison used its control position to force TerraForm Power into this deal. Then the price of oil collapsed and investors drove down the stocks of solar power companies. After TerraForm Power openly talked of getting out of the deal and a delay in completing SunEdison\u00e2\u0080\u0099s financial statements, a new ironclad merger agreement was written.

{"Headline": "Political Cloud Relegates Marco Rubio\u2019s Onetime Insider to the Outside", "Date": "2016-03-11", "News": "Supported byAnd when Mr. Rubio was introduced as the next speaker of the Florida House in 2005, there was no doubt that Mr. Rivera would celebrate his elevation.\u201cThere are no words to express or describe how I feel making this nomination for Marco Rubio, so I won\u2019t even try to find them,\u201d Mr. Rivera said on the House floor. \u201cBesides, I don\u2019t think I can do it without getting all choked up anyway.\u201dA decade later, the two men\u2019s paths have radically diverged. Mr. Rubio is a senator running for president, facing a do-or-die moment in Tuesday\u2019s Florida Republican primary. Mr. Rivera is in political exile, trying to resuscitate a tarnished career after losing his bid in 2012 for a second term in Congress. He has been the subject of state and federal investigations, including one into his campaign expenses and another in which two associates pleaded guilty to a scheme to funnel money to a sham candidate in an effort to weaken a political opponent of Mr. Rivera\u2019s. But he has not been indicted on any charge and denies wrongdoing.Their relationship casts light on the rough-and-tumble nature of Miami-Dade County Cuban politics, where tempers run hot, insults are traded in both Spanish and English and local corruption runs deep. For years, the pair\u2019s friendship unfolded like a political buddy movie, with Mr. Rubio the charismatic, ambitious up-and-comer, and Mr. Rivera, six years his senior, the sharp-elbowed operative.\u201cI would say without equivocation that without David Rivera it would have been difficult to envision Marco Rubio\u2019s rapid rise to the speakership,\u201d said Al Cardenas, a Republican power broker in Florida who knows both men and hired Mr. Rubio into his law firm fresh out of law school. (Mr. Cardenas supported former Gov. Jeb Bush, once a mentor to Mr. Rubio, in the presidential contest.)Mr. Rubio\u2019s spokesman, Alex Conant, said Mr. Rivera \u201chas no role in the campaign.\u201d\u201cHe does not advise Marco on foreign affairs or any other issue,\u201d he added. \u201cThe campaign did not provide him tickets to the debate.\u201dAmong Mr. Rubio\u2019s supporters, Mr. Rivera\u2019s legal troubles and their impact on Mr. Rubio elicit shrugs. Many have praised Mr. Rubio for not abandoning his friend. They point out that Mr. Rivera has not been charged and that Mr. Rubio has never been tied to any of the accusations.\u201cMarco wishes him well,\u201d said Nelson Diaz, who was once Mr. Rivera\u2019s roommate and a top aide to Mr. Rubio and is now executive director of the Miami-Dade County Republican Party. \u201cHe\u2019s not going to throw David under the bus.\u201dBut others said Mr. Rivera always tap-danced around ethical lines and took chances that others would not have, something that Mr. Rubio used to his advantage. Questions about their relationship, as close as u\u00f1a y carne \u2014 a Spanish expression that means as close as a fingernail on flesh \u2014 are fair game, they said.\u201cDime con qui\u00e9n andas y te digo qui\u00e9n eres,\u201d said J. C. Planas, a Republican lawyer in Miami who served with Mr. Rubio in the State House and said he suffered retribution from Mr. Rivera and Mr. Rubio: \u201cTell me who your friends are and I\u2019ll tell you who you are.\u201dOn the face of it, the two men have little in common: Mr. Rubio has a family he dotes on, loves football and popcorn movies, and is known for his ambition and skill as an orator. Mr. Rivera has never married, adores baseball, enjoys art house movies and is known for his legal pads scrawled with political minutiae.What they share is a strong Cuban heritage and a profound love for politics. Mr. Rubio saw the presidency writ large years ago; Mr. Rivera helped shove the boulders out of the way.\u201cI was willing to do what was needed to be done to help Marco be successful,\u201d Mr. Rivera said.They met in 1992, while Mr. Rubio was still in college, when the two served as volunteers for Lincoln Diaz-Balart\u2019s campaign for Congress. Their friendship blossomed in 1996, when Mr. Rivera hired Mr. Rubio to help run Bob Dole\u2019s presidential campaign in Miami-Dade, a big job that gave him political entree with Republican power brokers, like Mr. Cardenas.In 1998, Mr. Rubio, two years out of law school, won a seat on the City Commission in his neighborhood of West Miami. Voters responded to his charm, warmth and energy. Two years later, Mr. Rubio was catapulted to the Florida House in a special election. He soon eyed his next, more audacious goal: first Cuban-American speaker of the Florida House.According to the Associated Press, Donald J. Trump and Hillary Clinton have each won enough delegates to claim their party\u2019s nomination for president.House Republicans who wavered in their support of Mr. Rubio\u2019s speakership or strayed from the Republican leadership\u2019s agenda on taxes and education found themselves yanked from committee chairmanships, being criticized on Spanish radio or suddenly facing primary opponents.\u201cPeople always feared what David Rivera would do,\u201d said Christian Ulvert, who was a top aide to Dan Gelber, the House Democratic leader at the time. \u201cWhen someone became a vulnerability in Marco world, they were expendable.\u201dBut Mr. Rivera said that he was not alone in playing hardball politics in Tallahassee. \u201cThere were a lot of interests beyond David Rivera and Marco Rubio that were involved in those events,\u201d he said.As the pair rose to power, their lives became increasingly intertwined.Mr. Rivera was also instrumental in persuading Mr. Rubio to enter a long-shot bid for the United States Senate in 2009. Traveling the state for his own campaign for the State Senate, and later Congress, Mr. Rivera methodically gauged Republican support for Mr. Rubio against Charlie Crist, then the governor.Mr. Rivera has been eyed by state and federal investigators.In one case, federal prosecutors investigated Mr. Rivera\u2019s role in a secret plot to finance a sham candidate, Justin Lamar Sternad, in which tens of thousands of dollars were spent to pay for Mr. Sternad\u2019s mailers, robocalls and other expenses with the goal of undercutting Mr. Rivera\u2019s Democratic opponent, Joe Garcia, in the 2012 congressional race.Instead, Mr. Rivera\u2019s friend, Ana Alliegro, who helped facilitate the plan, as well as Mr. Sternad, testified before a grand jury and pleaded guilty to felonies in the case. Mr. Rivera was named in open court by federal prosecutors as a \u201cco-conspirator.\u201dIn an interview, Ms. Alliegro said Mr. Rivera supplied the money to her to use for the candidate, helped her flee to Nicaragua twice, visited her there and orchestrated the cover-up. Mr. Rivera said none of that was true. Nearly four years later, he has not been charged and maintains his innocence.\u201cWhen you know you haven\u2019t done anything wrong, you sleep well at night,\u201d Mr. Rivera said, adding he had never been contacted by a federal investigator.Still, his troubles continue. On Feb. 26, Ms. Alliegro, who was jailed for six months in the election case, sought a temporary order of protection against him, accusing him of stalking her and hacking into her cellphone. The court turned down the request.Mr. Rivera called her accusation \u201ca complete fabrication,\u201d adding that he was in Tallahassee on the day she says he stalked her in Miami and has witnesses who can verify the fact.In 2012, the Florida Ethics Commission cited him with 11 potential ethics violations, including misusing campaign funds and not disclosing a $1 million consulting contract with a Miami gambling business while he served in the State House. Several violations were dismissed, but an administrative law judge determined that Mr. Rivera had broken rules pertaining to travel expenses and disclosing income. He recommended a fine of $58,000, which Mr. Rivera is appealing.After an investigation of similar evidence, the Miami-Dade state attorney\u2019s office decided in 2012 not to bring criminal charges against Mr. Rivera. But in a memo closing out the case, prosecutors wrote that they were \u201cconfronted with the fact that an elected official over a period of many years\u201d was essentially able to \u201clive off\u201d political money \u201cwhile avoiding penal sanction.\u201dHis friends say that Mr. Rivera has weathered the controversy and that Mr. Rubio, facing his own political problems, is far removed from the scandal.\u201cIt\u2019s a nonissue,\u201d said Mr. Diaz, Mr. Rubio\u2019s former aide who works at Southern Strategy Group, a lobbying organization. \u201cYou can\u2019t say this is guilt by association.\u201dStill, the public distance between Mr. Rubio and Mr. Rivera is palpable. When Miami\u2019s Republican members of Congress, past and present, held a news conference last month, after Mr. Bush dropped out of the race, to endorse Mr. Rubio for president, Mr. Rivera was nowhere to be found.\u201cRivera has been relegated to a footnote,\u201d said Mr. Planas, a former State House member and Rivera critic.Far from the spotlight of the presidential campaign, Mr. Rivera said he was weighing a run for a local Florida House seat. He is also keeping close tabs on Mr. Rubio\u2019s future.\u201cMarco is as inspirational to me and the Cuban-American community today as he was in the Florida House,\u201d he said, \u201cno matter how this ends up.\u201dLizette Alvarez reported from Miami, and Steve Eder from New York.

{"Headline": "Time for Credit Suisse to Rethink Its Strategy", "Date": "2016-03-17", "News": "Supported byBreakingviewsIt has been five months since Tidjane Thiam set out his strategy for Credit Suisse in a 69-page presentation. Since then, shareholders have seen a negative 42 percent return \u2013 worse than the returns at all of the bank\u2019s European rivals, and twice as bad as those at its Swiss peer UBS.Mr. Thiam\u2019s grand plan was to double pretax profit in Asia from 2014 levels and in some areas of wealth management. Events have overtaken him. It is time for what in bankspeak is known as a strategic acceleration.Mr. Thiam gave himself three years to reach his goals. Two of them look unattainable. In the wealth management division, pretax profit shrank 42 percent in 2015, so it now has to treble its pretax profit in three years to meet his target. Wealth management brings its own peculiar, unforeseeable risks. A lawsuit filed on Tuesday is at least the second to seek damages over claims that Credit Suisse failed to prevent a former employee from laundering money.Asia, too, is a tough choice of strategic focus. Even leaving aside the slowdown in China, UBS already has double the investment banking market share of its Swiss rival and more than a quarter more Asian wealth advisers than Credit Suisse is aiming for by 2018, notes Macquarie.Mr. Thiam could help himself out with some simplicity. He does not like return-on-equity targets, but an overall group pretax profit target would still be more helpful than the individual divisional ones he has now. If this were set at 6.5 billion Swiss francs ($6.6 billion) for 2018, then Credit Suisse still might be able to make an 11 percent return on equity \u2013 which is what analysts forecast for UBS.Or he could cut more deeply in investment banking. Mr. Thiam envisages risk-weighted assets for his trading and corporate finance businesses growing more than a quarter by 2018. Cut them by a fifth instead, and that 11 percent return on equity could come in three years on a lesser 6.1 billion Swiss francs in group pretax profit.Mr. Thiam, who has not run a bank before, was a high-risk choice for chief executive. In his last job, running the insurer Prudential, one of his first moves was a bold albeit failed bid for its Asian rival AIA that, in light of AIA\u2019s subsequent strong performance, looks smart. The most decisive thing about his time at Credit Suisse so far is the fall in its shares. Mr. Thiam\u2019s revamp needs a do-over.Dominic Elliott is a columnist at Reuters Breakingviews.

{"Headline": "Escalating the War on Looting", "Date": "2016-03-11", "News": "Supported byArt for TomorrowPARIS \u2014 Like the wars themselves, the looting of antiquities in Syria and other conflict zones in the Middle East is proving virtually impossible to stop, despite the best efforts of a host of international agencies, cultural organizations and dogged independent researchers.As the pillaging continues in a region rich in layers of ancient civilizations, the international community is focusing on the marketplace, doing what it can to scare off demand in hopes that supply will shrink. \u201cThere wouldn\u2019t be any looting if there wasn\u2019t money to be made,\u201d said Kathryn Walker Tubb, a lecturer at the Institute of Archaeology at University College London.In the past few years, the effort to intercept the illicit trade has intensified.In February last year, the United Nations Security Council passed a resolution banning trade in artifacts illegally removed from Syria since 2011 and from Iraq since 1990. The International Council of Museums has issued \u201cred lists\u201d for objects at risk in Iraq, Syria and now Libya. Last August, the State Department in Washington announced a $5 million reward for information that could disrupt the ransacking and looting of cultural sites by the Islamic State, or ISIS.Last month, Unesco followed up its Emergency Safeguarding of the Syrian Heritage Project, introduced in 2014 with the European Union, with a special task force that would deploy experts from Italy\u2019s carabinieri force, with its long experience in tracking down looted art, to help hunt down stolen items.The Asia Society and the Antiquities Coalition recently concluded an international conference on \u201ccultural racketeering\u201d with calls for special training for customs agents and support for local governments in conflict zones to catalogue and safeguard their treasures.\u201cWe believe it is imperative to do what we can,\u201d said Christine Anagnos, the executive director of the Association of Art Museum Directors, which last October issued a set of \u201csafe haven\u201d protocols that offer protection for cultural property put at risk by wars and other disasters, with the guarantee that it will be returned to home countries once its safety can be assured. As of February, however, no offers have been made to deposit endangered objects for safekeeping in foreign museums, Ms. Anagnos said.But investigations rarely produce arrests because of the difficulty in proving the provenance of antiquities, often produced by civilizations that stretched across the ancient world.Traffickers are also masters at coming up with fake documents that purport to show that the disputed object had been long held by mysterious collectors, now conveniently deceased. Such lack of evidence often means that the authorities often choose to avoid pursuing criminal charges in return for reclaiming the objects, which results in shady dealers getting off the hook, experts say.But the publicity surrounding the effort to stem the flow of smuggled artifacts from Syria, Iraq and other war zones in the Middle East has had a dampening effect, said Christopher Marinello, the founder and director of the Art Recovery Group, an organization in London that has developed a database to recover lost and stolen artworks around the world.\u201cThe media coverage has done such an incredible job that any reputable dealer will have taken a huge step backwards,\u201d Mr. Marinello said. \u201cWe see dealers and auction houses coming in with questions about specific objects. We have seen catalogues for antiquities shrink.\u201d Small items periodically appear on e-commerce sites: Two coins from Apamea, a looted archaeological site in Syria, recently showed up on eBay, priced at $84 and $133.But most people agree that the market for larger, more valuable pieces has shrunk under international pressure. This concerns Ms. Tubb who fears that precious artifacts are being stashed in warehouses \u2014 in the Middle East but also in Europe \u2014 where they will remain hidden until the pressure eases.\u201cWho knows where these things are housed,\u201d she said. \u201cThere are all sorts of different routes.\u201dCol. Ludovic Ehrhart, an investigator for France\u2019s cultural theft police unit, told Le Monde that those trading in \u201cblood antiquities\u201d can afford to bide their time. \u201cThese long-standing networks wait three, five, even 10 years before they sell them on the official market, \u2018\u2019 he said.The role played by terrorist groups such as Islamic State in the looting of antiquities from the Middle East has helped put a chill on the market, Mr. Marinello said. \u201cIt didn\u2019t hurt that the F.B.I. has said you could be arrested for aiding international terrorism,\u201d he said. \u201cThat is quite an incentive to not buy something.\u201d Although Islamic State\u2019s vicious attacks and subsequent pillaging of Syrian sites like Palmyra have attracted attention, there are other culprits.\u201cIt is not just the Islamic State that is destroying or looting,\u201d said Sam Hardy, a research associate at University College London\u2019s Institute of Archaeology, \u201calthough they have certainly upped the attention.\u201dThe looting at Apamea, one of the largest and best preserved Roman and Byzantine sites in the world, took place on an industrial scale, as seen on satellite images that show the area pockmarked by a grid of more than 5,000 looting pits, at a time when the area was under the control of the Syrian government.\u201cThat may not indicate looting that was directed by the regime,\u201d said Mr. Hardy, \u201cbut it does suggest looting that benefited the regime.\u201dHard proof of the Islamic State\u2019s involvement in antiquities trafficking came in May, when a United States-led raid on a compound in eastern Syria used by Abu Sayyaf, a commander identified as the director of the terrorist group\u2019s oil smuggling and its trade in antique objects.Abu Sayyaf, who was killed in the operation, was in possession of an odd assortment of artifacts \u2014 including an ivory plaque traced to the museum in Mosul, Iraq \u2014 Islamic State territory \u2014 as well as a collection of coins, bracelets and other easy-to-transport objects and a few obvious fakes. The cache also revealed receipts for the 20 percent tax on precious materials \u2014 antiquities, but also minerals \u2014 collected from civilians by Islamic State. The total sum shown from these \u201ctax\u201d receipts reportedly amounted to $265,000, suggesting that the antiquities trade is just a small part of the group\u2019s financing streams. But it shows the lengths to which the local population is willing to go to survive.\u201cWar is always the worst time for cultural heritage, particularly in a part of the world that was a cradle of civilization,\u201d Mr. Marinello said.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Once a Darling, Spanish Solar Company Abengoa Faces Reckoning", "Date": "2016-03-17", "News": "Supported byAnnouncing government support for clean-energy projects, President Obama hailed a Spanish company, saying its new solar technology would supply tens of thousands of American homes with renewable power, while spurring local employment.Since then, the Spanish company, Abengoa, has built two American plants, in Arizona and California, supplying electricity to more than 160,000 homes. It is the world leader in a technology known as solar thermal, with operations from Algeria to Latin America.But Abengoa\u2019s global ambitions are now the source of its troubles.Saddled with debt from its expansion, the company is scrambling to avoid what would be the largest bankruptcy in Spanish corporate history. Creditors and shareholders are taking the company to court as losses mount and crucial financial support disappears.The company\u2019s changing fortunes, from industry darling to financial invalid, are an extreme example of the challenges facing players in the renewable energy business.In Abengoa\u2019s case, its signature American projects still have around $2 billion in outstanding loans guaranteed by the United States government, and the company benefited heavily from subsidies in Spain. But its solar thermal projects have been slow to turn a profit and generate little income in the interim, amplifying its cash squeeze.\u201cI always had the intuition that so much corporate ambition would end up bursting at the seams,\u201d he said.Founded by two engineers in Seville in 1941, Abengoa initially set out to manufacture a type of electricity meter. Though the meter never gained traction, the company began installing auxiliary panels for power stations and electrical systems for buildings.By the 1960s, it began expanding overseas to Central and South America, with projects like erecting transmission lines in Argentina. It made its first foray into renewables in the 1980s.In 2007, the company established the world\u2019s first commercial solar thermal power plant in Sanl\u00facar la Mayor. On the outskirts of Seville, a handful of towers dominate the farming landscape, rising above sunflower and cattle fields like modern obelisks to solar energy.In a solar thermal power plant, mirrors reflect the sun\u2019s rays toward the top of each tower, concentrating the light and generating high enough temperatures to heat up a transfer fluid. That heat creates steam to power a turbine, generating electricity.Abengoa now accounts for more than a quarter of the five gigawatts produced worldwide by solar thermal plants. Unlike conventional solar power, the thermal technology allows energy to be stored, meaning the turbines can generate power for hours after the sun sets.The same year the Sanl\u00facar plant opened, Abengoa\u2019s stock price hit a record high of 7.39 euros a share. By November, when it began insolvency proceedings, it had fallen below 40 euro cents. It now sits at 71 euro cents.Since then, Abengoa has been looking for a lifeline to restructure its $10.3 billion of debt.Spanish law gives the company four months to right the ship. And last week, Abengoa said it had reached an agreement with creditors, a deal that requires final approval.As part of the restructuring, Abengoa\u2019s global activities \u2014 from transmission lines across the Amazon, to water desalination plants in Algeria and Ghana \u2014 could all be up for grabs.\u201cMy expectation is that a lot of Spanish know-how will end up in foreign hands,\u201d said Javier Garc\u00eda Breva, a renewable energy expert who is president of N2E, a consultancy.For now, Abengoa says the deal will not affect its operations in the United States, where the company holds a 42 percent stake in Atlantica Yield, which runs two solar thermal plants in Gila Bend, Ariz., and near Barstow, Calif.The plants, known as Solana and Mojave, have drawn criticism for years over the American government\u2019s backing.Abengoa says that nearly $1 billion of the federally guaranteed loans has been repaid. American taxpayers, it says, will incur no costs for the projects as long as they continue operating normally.Abengoa\u2019s problems extend from the balance sheet to the courtroom.It is facing lawsuits in the United States and Spain from shareholders and creditors. The suits make a variety of claims, with one accusing the company of misleading investors about downplaying its capital needs and another accusing individual executives of acting against investor interests.An Abengoa spokeswoman said the company would not comment on the cases.At home, crucial revenue supports that Abengoa and other clean-power producers relied on have been removed.The multitude of problems is amplifying the pain for Abengoa, which lost $1.3 billion last year. In February, its employees were paid late and, as part of the negotiations with creditors, it asked for more time to repay one of its bonds.The ripple effects are being felt beyond the company.A short drive away from Sanl\u00facar, a research and business park was meant to feed off Abengoa\u2019s presence. Regional authorities originally set aside $22.4 million to develop the area as a hub for clean technology and environmentally focused companies. But three years after opening, only $3.6 million has been spent on it, and it has failed to attract other companies.Abengoa\u2019s problems have also cast a pall on Spain\u2019s renewables sector. Industry groups, fearful of a withdrawal of government support, are on the defense.James B. Stewart, whose Common Sense column normally appears on this page, is away.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Sugru, a Versatile Glue From Ireland, Gets Help From Web", "Date": "2016-03-02", "News": "Supported byIt can fix a broken statue, repair a frayed iPhone cable, add a rubbery grip to a kitchen knife, make those Bose earbuds fit better, repair a leaky boat \u2014 and even create a prosthetic leg for a chicken. So, what is this product?It is Sugru, and it is being heralded as the product you never knew you needed \u2014 until you did.Sugru is a moldable glue. It looks like Play-Doh, can be shaped around any object, sticks to almost any material, is waterproof, is heat-resistant and dries to a silicone rubbery finish in 24 hours. Its ability to bond to virtually any surface \u2014 wood, glass, metals and ceramics among others \u2014 and its moldable nature make it unusual in the world of adhesives, sealants and glues.\u201cI wanted to design something that was so easy and so fun to use that more people would consider fixing things again,\u201d said Jane Ni Dhulchaointigh, the Irish entrepreneur behind Sugru. Even the name is taken from the Irish word \u201csugradh,\u201d which means \u201cplay.\u201dBridget Grunst, a buyer for Target Corporation stores, admits she was skeptical before meeting Sugru\u2019s team in the fall of 2014. After all, Target already carried more than 40 glue products in its home improvement section alone.\u201cDid I roll my eyes? Yes,\u201d she said, laughing. \u201cI mean, glue is not the most innovative category out there.\u201d But all of that changed when Ms. Grunst met the Sugru team and watched in amazement at the myriad ways, both practical and creative, that the glue could be used. The iPhone charger repair was the clincher.\u201cI have frayed cords at home, and it\u2019s a unique way to fix it versus having to go buy another charger for $50,\u201d Ms. Grunst said. Sugru\u2019s rubbery flexible finish allowed it to repair charger cords, which superglues, with their rock-hard finishes, cannot do, she said.Ms. Grunst also liked Sugru\u2019s moldable nature, with its ability to fill gaps, replace broken appliance parts or rebuild a broken handle on a kitchen faucet. Other glues, which are often liquids and sprays, cannot, she said.That Ms. Ni Dhulchaointigh (pronounced nee-GULL-queen-tigg) would develop a product like Sugru would not have been easy to predict.Born in Kilkenny, Ireland, in 1979, Ms. Ni Dhulchaointigh grew up on a farm, where her father, John, worked as a farmer, and her mother, Eilis, was a teacher. As a youngster, she had an artistic bent, making paintings and sculptures. She received a degree in fine art from the National College of Art and Design in Dublin in 2001 and a master\u2019s degree in product design from the Royal College of Art in London in 2004.It was at college where she first started experimenting with clay, silicon sealants and other materials for sculpting. She would bring them home and soon started using them around the house \u2014 wrapping the putty around knife handles to get a better grip, using it to fix a leaky kitchen sink stopper, adding it as rubber \u201cfeet\u201d to the bottom of a laptop and repairing a mug handle. Her boyfriend, James Carrigan, who is now her husband, noticed her clever repairs and suggested she try to market it.When she showcased the prototype at a student product design exhibition in 2004, the response was overwhelming, she said. \u201cThe top two questions were: \u2018How much is it\u2019 and \u2018Where can I get it?\u2019 \u201d she said. She knew she had a potential hit.With a $50,000 grant from Nesta, a British research firm, in 2005, and a $500,000 equity investment from Lacomp, a venture fund, in 2006, she dove in. She brought in a business partner, Roger Ashby, and hired two former Dow Corning scientists as consultants to help build the prototype. It took five years, 5,000 experiments and 8,000 lab hours to perfect and patent the formula.At this point, the recession had hit and financing was almost nonexistent to market the product to retailers. \u201cWe pitched to almost 100 investors\u201d without luck, she said. A private investor finally provided $150,000, far short of what was needed.So, in 2009, she took the social media route, sending samples to dozens of technology bloggers, in the belief that if they saw its potential role in repairing information technology equipment, they\u2019d promote it. The strategy worked. \u201cIt went viral,\u201d she said. When the company introduced its website in December 2009, all 1,000 packages, which took two months to make by hand, sold out within six hours. An additional 2,000 were sold on back order. \u201cIt was incredible; it changed everything.\u201dSuddenly, \u201cinvestors were reading about us all over the Internet, and they started coming to us asking how they could help,\u201d she said. Time magazine listed Sugru, alongside the iPad, as one of the top 50 inventions of 2010.Sales topped $5.5 million in 2015, up from $3.4 million in 2014 and $250,000 in its first year in 2010. Ms. Ni Dhulchaointigh expects sales to exceed $10 million this year and $60 million by 2020.It is now sold online to more than 160 countries and through 19 brick-and-mortar retailers in 6,050 stores in four countries. In the United States, 10 retailers carry the product in 4,500 stores.Ms. Ni Dhulchaointigh said Sugru could withstand temperatures as high as 356 degrees and as low as minus 58 degrees, making it durable indoors and out. It will not melt, freeze, soften or harden. It can be thrown into a washing machine or dishwasher, and even soaked in seawater.If a user makes a mistake, a sharp knife can be used to cut through Sugru\u2019s rubbery surface, removing it without damaging the surface of the repaired item. With other two-part hard-core glues, \u201conce you put them on something, you can\u2019t go back. They\u2019re on there forever,\u201d she said.Sugru has raised about $12 million from investors and another round is expected this year. Ms. Ni Dhulchaointigh\u2019s goal is to make Sugru a staple in everyone\u2019s kitchen drawer and to expand into more countries and into other fields, such as medical devices, the auto industry and toys.Still, Sugru has its limitations: Its shelf life is 13 months, and once a packet is opened, it must be used within 24 hours. It cannot compete with products that promote their sticking power, where ads show a man dangling in a helmet glued to a steel beam. Sugru holds up to about four pounds.It is Sugru\u2019s \u201cfix it\u201d abilities that make it unique, said Lisa Smith, a buyer for the Container Store, which has stocked Sugru since late 2013.Sugru retails for $12 for a package of three packets. \u201cIt\u2019s a pretty expensive product versus a little thing of superglue for $4,\u201d Ms. Grunst said.The product needs \u201ca lot of explanation,\u201d Ms. Smith added.Sugru relies on social media for that.A motorcyclist used Sugru to mount a camera to his helmet, and then went on a ride down the highway filming his journey.Lauren Richardson, an aerobatic pilot in Britain, used Sugru to strap a camera to the outside of her plane\u2019s wing, so the camera could capture her flips and turns.\u201cThere were some really clever fixes and really wacky ones that made us laugh,\u201d Ms. Ni Dhulchaointigh said.And then there\u2019s the chicken. When a fox attacked a pet hen at a family\u2019s home in Cork, Ireland, the hen lost a leg. So, the owner, a retired engineer, built a fiberglass prosthetic leg and used Sugru to add chicken feet to the prosthetic.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How Will Trump Redecorate the White House?", "Date": "2016-03-17", "News": "Supported byNews AnalysisWHEN Louis XIV moved his court to the Ch\u00e2teau de Versailles outside Paris in the 17th century, the palace was a dazzling symbol of dominance and royal power, its gilt-encrusted \u201cHall of Mirrors\u201d a riot of luxurious materials that expressed intimidation, wealth and political clout.So it\u2019s little wonder that Versailles serves as a stylistic jumping-off point for Donald J. Trump, whose own let-it-rip aesthetics arguably have few (if any) parallels in American campaign history.The visual spirit of the Sun King, of course, has been on exuberant display in the White and Gold Ballroom of Mar-a-Lago, the immense Palm Beach estate of the cereal heiress Marjorie Merriweather Post that Mr. Trump bought and converted into a Xanadu for 1-percenters. The room, a camera-ready tableau of crystal chandeliers and gilt-splashed moldings, served as the backdrop for Ben Carson\u2019s endorsement last week as well as Mr. Trump\u2019s victory speech on Super Tuesday, setting off the politicians like gemstones in a twinkly Tiffany bauble.Mr. Trump declared his candidacy last year in the atrium of Trump Tower. High above in the three-level penthouse aerie with sweeping views of Central Park, the CNN anchor Anderson Cooper recently interviewed the Slovenian supermodel and potential first lady Melania Trump beside an indoor fountain in the Trumps\u2019 marble-columned Versailles Nouveau.It\u2019s part of Art of the Spectacle, the kind of fantasy that motivates lottery ticket buyers at the 7-Eleven and slot players on casino floors. \u201cDonald Trump\u2019s idea of luxury may seem quite vulgar to many educated, well-off people,\u201d said Virginia Postrel, the author of \u201cThe Power of Glamour: Longing and the Art of Visual Persuasion.\u201d \u201cBut the very fact that elites reject his taste resonates with people who don\u2019t want to be told by others that they\u2019re in some way inferior.\u201dAs he seeks membership in the ultimate club at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, a question nags: How might Mr. Trump\u2019s brand play out within the staid and stately confines of the White House, America\u2019s most hallowed home? The historian Douglas Brinkley, whose book \u201cRightful Heritage: Franklin D. Roosevelt and the Land of America\u201d came out this week, noted that Mr. Trump\u2019s excess contrasts with other eras in politics, when candidates \u201ctried to tamp down the perception of wealth.\u201dFranklin Delano and Eleanor Roosevelt, for example, emphasized rusticity, waxing eloquently to reporters about his tree farm and her artisan furniture in upstate New York. A previous billionaire candidate, Ross Perot, packaged himself as \u201cTexarkana folksy\u201d in Mr. Brinkley\u2019s words. Mitt Romney backpedaled after being mocked during the 2012 campaign over plans to install an elevator for his cars in the garage of his oceanfront home in La Jolla, Calif.Mr. Trump, on the other hand, \u201cwould probably have bragged about it and doubled the size,\u201d Mr. Brinkley said. \u201cTrump is like a one-man Gilded Age, carrying opulence wherever he goes. We\u2019ve never had someone running for president who is a bling artist.\u201dEver since George Washington sketched plans for reflecting pools and water cascades for the gardens of the Presidential Palace, as it was called by its first architect, James Hoban, presidents have arrived with their own ideas of how the White House should look. It is the president\u2019s house by Constitution, and \u201chis to do with as he pleases,\u201d said William Seale, a historian and the author of a two-volume history published by the White House Historical Association. An advisory committee set up during the administration of Lyndon B. Johnson establishes policies related to the museum function of the house, the state rooms and the collections.Changes to the d\u00e9cor and other alterations can be a political hot potato as well as a source of national pride. The late Nancy Reagan famously caught flak for spending too much on china; she also asked the Carters to move out early so she could start redecorating. Although the president is not required to live there, Mr. Seale said, \u201cthe public flew up in anger\u201d when President Dwight D. Eisenhower suggested that for privacy and convenience he might prefer to live in a high-rise. In theory, Mr. Trump could set up a pied-\u00e0-terre in the Old Post Office Pavilion, a federal landmark blocks from the White House that he leases from the government and is turning into a luxury hotel.Newton\u2019s Third Law of Motion applies at the White House: Jacqueline Kennedy, widely credited with bringing in a more authentic and dignified period look, was horrified by furnishings done by the B. Altman department store following a Truman-era reconstruction. Hillary Clinton responded to the patrician tastes of George H. W. and Barbara Bush by bringing in an Arkansas decorator with a penchant for over-the-top Victorian drapery. (Would Bill as first gent bring this decorator back?)Of the 132 rooms, the Blue Room has a decidedly French influence, with an antique chandelier and other rare objects that could tide Mr. Trump over until the completion of the Gold Room.For those prone to catastrophizing, the prospect of a Trump White House can elicit dark visions of high-decibel audio tours, 24K-plated presidential souvenirs or a 55-foot-tall garden wall financed by Mexico.Yet in an interview last year in People magazine, Mr. Trump vowed moderation \u2014 of a sort. \u201cIf I were elected I would probably look at the White House, and maybe touch it up a little bit,\u201d he said. \u201cBut the White House is a special place, you don\u2019t want to do much touching.\u201dHis version of \u201ca little bit,\u201d however, may well be different from that of most of us. As his Republican rivals, and perhaps much of the country, know all too well, a little bit of Donald Trump can go a long way.A news analysis on March 20 about how Donald J. Trump might redecorate the White House misidentified its first architect.

And it was the smartest deal Jackson ever made.Now those songs have helped provide a windfall for his estate. On Monday, Sony said it had agreed to pay $750 million for the Jackson estate\u2019s share of what is now Sony/ATV \u2014 a collection of more than a million songs, with hits by Taylor Swift and Lady Gaga, chestnuts like \u201cMoon River\u201d and \u201cMona Lisa,\u201d and of course the Beatles songs.After Jackson died, on the eve of a series of concerts in London that he had hoped would be a comeback, sales of Jackson\u2019s music spiked around the world. His estate, led by his longtime lawyer John Branca and the music executive John McClain, made a series of lucrative deals that stabilized the Jackson finances.Sony Pictures paid $60 million for the rights to \u201cMichael Jackson\u2019s This Is It,\u201d drawn from rehearsal video from the London concerts. Other deals were lined up for Jackson\u2019s recording rights with Sony Music, for two theatrical shows by Cirque du Soleil and in areas like merchandising and video games.The Jackson estate has long since paid off most of Jackson\u2019s personal debts. But the latest deal will allow it to clear its last obligation, a $250 million debt that was tied to Jackson\u2019s holdings in Sony/ATV.According to its most recent public accounting, the estate generated $600 million in gross earnings through the end of 2013. With its earnings since then, the estate is estimated to have earned more than $800 million. But the deal for the song catalog could now push those earnings above $1 billion, a big return for a financial move that began as a simple conversation between two music legends.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Donald Trump\u2019s Presidential Run Began in an Effort to Gain Stature", "Date": "2016-03-12", "News": "Supported byDonald J. Trump arrived at the White House Correspondents\u2019 Association Dinner in April 2011, reveling in the moment as he mingled with the political luminaries who gathered at the Washington Hilton. He made his way to his seat beside his host, Lally Weymouth, the journalist and socialite daughter of Katharine Graham, longtime publisher of The Washington Post.A short while later, the humiliation started.He lampooned Mr. Trump\u2019s gaudy taste in d\u00e9cor. He ridiculed his fixation on false rumors that the president had been born in Kenya. He belittled his reality show, \u201cThe Celebrity Apprentice.\u201dMr. Trump at first offered a drawn smile, then a game wave of the hand. But as the president\u2019s mocking of him continued and people at other tables craned their necks to gauge his reaction, Mr. Trump hunched forward with a frozen grimace.After the dinner ended, Mr. Trump quickly left, appearing bruised. He was \u201cincredibly gracious and engaged on the way in,\u201d recalled Marcus Brauchli, then the executive editor of The Washington Post, but departed \u201cwith maximum efficiency.\u201dThat evening of public abasement, rather than sending Mr. Trump away, accelerated his ferocious efforts to gain stature within the political world. And it captured the degree to which Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign is driven by a deep yearning sometimes obscured by his bluster and bragging: a desire to be taken seriously.That desire has played out over the last several years within a Republican Party that placated and indulged him, and accepted his money and support, seemingly not grasping how fervently determined he was to become a major force in American politics. In the process, the party bestowed upon Mr. Trump the kind of legitimacy that he craved, which has helped him pursue a credible bid for the presidency.Repeatedly underestimated as a court jester or silly showman, Mr. Trump muscled his way into the Republican elite by force of will. He badgered a skittish Mitt Romney into accepting his endorsement on national television, and became a celebrity fixture at conservative gatherings. He abandoned his tightfisted inclinations and cut five- and six-figure checks in a bid for clout as a political donor. He courted conservative media leaders as deftly as he had the New York tabloids.At every stage, members of the Republican establishment wagered that they could go along with Mr. Trump just enough to keep him quiet or make him go away. But what party leaders viewed as generous ceremonial gestures or ego stroking of Mr. Trump \u2014 speaking spots at gatherings, meetings with prospective candidates and appearances alongside Republican heavyweights \u2014 he used to elevate his position and, eventually, to establish himself as a formidable figure for 2016.In an interview on Friday, Mr. Trump acknowledged that he had encountered many who doubted or dismissed him as a political force before now. \u201cI realized that unless I actually ran, I wouldn\u2019t be taken seriously,\u201d he said. But he denied having been troubled by Mr. Obama\u2019s derision.\u201cI loved that dinner,\u201d Mr. Trump said, adding, \u201cI can handle criticism.\u201dBut Mr. Trump understood his role differently. Reading carefully from a prepared text, he tested the themes that would one day frame his presidential campaign: American economic decline, and the weakness and cluelessness of politicians in Washington.Over the next few months, Mr. Trump met quietly with Republican pollsters who tested a political message and gauged his image across the country, according to people briefed on his efforts, some of whom would speak about them only on the condition of anonymity.One pollster, Kellyanne Conway, took a survey that showed Mr. Trump\u2019s negative ratings were sky-high, but advised him there was still an opening for him to run.Another, John McLaughlin, who had been recommended to Mr. Trump by the former Clinton adviser Dick Morris, drew up a memo that described how Mr. Trump could run as a counterpoint to Mr. Obama in 2012, and outshine Mr. Romney with his relentless antagonism of the president.Roger Stone, a longtime Trump adviser, wrote a column on his website envisioning a Trump candidacy steamrolling to the nomination, powered by wall-to-wall media attention.After all that preparation, Mr. Trump rejected two efforts to \u201cdraft\u201d him set up by close advisers. If his interest in politics was growing, he was not yet prepared to abandon his career as a reality television host: In mid-May, Mr. Trump announced that he would not run and canceled a planned speech to a major Republican fund-raising dinner in Iowa.Having stepped back from a campaign of his own, Mr. Trump sought relevance through Mr. Romney\u2019s. Again, Mr. Trump\u2019s determination to seize a role for himself collided with the skepticism of those he approached: While he saw himself as an important spokesman on economic issues and a credible champion for the party, the Romney campaign viewed him as an unpredictable attention-seeker with no real political foundation.Still, given his expansive media platform \u2014 in addition to his reality-show franchise, Mr. Trump was a frequent guest on Fox News \u2014 and a fortune that he could theoretically bestow upon a campaign, Mr. Trump was drawing presidential candidates seeking his support to his Fifth Avenue high-rise. In September 2011, Mr. Romney made the trip, entering and exiting discreetly, with no cameras on hand to capture the event.The decision to court Mr. Trump, former Romney aides said in interviews, stemmed partly from the desire to use him for fund-raising help, but also from the conviction that it would be more dangerous to shun such an expert provocateur than to build a relationship with him and try to contain him.The test of that strategy came in January 2012, before the make-or-break Florida primary, when Mr. Trump reached out to say he wanted to endorse Mr. Romney at a Trump property in the state. Wary of such a spectacle in a crucial state, Mr. Romney\u2019s aides began a concerted effort to relegate Mr. Trump\u2019s endorsement to a sideshow.The Romney campaign conducted polling in four states that showed Mr. Trump unpopular everywhere but Nevada, and suggested to Mr. Trump that they hold an endorsement event there, far away from Florida voters.On the day he was to deliver the endorsement in Las Vegas, according to Mr. Romney\u2019s advisers, Mr. Trump met with Romney aides and said he hoped to hold a joint news conference with Mr. Romney, raising for the campaign the terrifying possibility that Mr. Romney might end up on camera responding to reporters\u2019 questions next to a man who had spent months questioning whether the president was an American citizen.In an appeal to Mr. Trump\u2019s vanity, the Romney campaign stressed that his endorsement was so vital \u2014 with such potential to ripple in the media \u2014 that it would be a mistake to dilute the impact with a question-and-answer session.\u201cThe self-professed genius was just stupid enough to buy our ruse,\u201d said Ryan Williams, a former spokesman for the Romney campaign. While they agreed to hold the event in a Trump hotel, the campaign put up blue curtains around the ballroom when the endorsement took place, so that Mr. Romney did not appear to be standing \u201cin a burlesque house or one of Saddam\u2019s palaces,\u201d Mr. Williams said. On stage, as the cameras captured the moment, Mr. Romney seemed almost bewildered. \u201cThere are some things that you just can\u2019t imagine happening in your life,\u201d he told reporters as he took the podium, taking in his surroundings. \u201cThis is one of them.\u201dMr. Trump insisted in the interview that the Romney campaign had strenuously lobbied for his support, and described his own endorsement as the biggest of that year. \u201cWhat they\u2019re saying is not true,\u201d he said.But if Mr. Trump expected a major role in the Romney campaign, he was mistaken. While Mr. Trump hosted fund-raising events for Mr. Romney, the two men never hit the campaign trail together. The campaign allowed Mr. Trump to record automated phone calls for Mr. Romney, but drew the line at his demand for a prominent speaking slot at the Republican National Convention. (Mr. Trump recorded a video to be played on the first day of the convention, but the whole day\u2019s events were canceled because of bad weather.)Stuart Stevens, a senior strategist for Mr. Romney, believed that Mr. Trump had been strictly corralled. \u201cHe wanted to campaign with Mitt,\u201d Mr. Stevens wrote in an email. \u201cNope. Killed. Wanted to speak at the convention. Nope. Killed.\u201dStill, to Mr. Romney\u2019s opponent that year, the accommodation of Mr. Trump looked egregious. Mr. Obama, in a speech on Friday, said Republicans had long treated Mr. Trump\u2019s provocations as \u201ca hoot\u201d \u2014 just as long as they were directed at the president.Mr. Trump conferred with Mr. Bossie during the 2012 election and, as 2016 approached, sought his advice on setting up a campaign structure. Mr. Bossie made recommendations for staff members to hire, and Mr. Trump embraced them.Mr. Trump also carefully cultivated relationships with conservative media outlets, reaching out to talk radio personalities and right-wing websites like Breitbart.com.By then, Mr. Trump had won a degree of acceptance as a Republican donor. Advised by Mr. Stone, one of his longest-serving counselors, he had abandoned his long-held practice of giving modest sums to both parties, and opened his checkbook for Republicans with unprecedented enthusiasm.Mr. Trump began a relationship with Reince Priebus, the Republican National Committee chairman, who was trying to rescue the party from debt. He gave substantial donations to \u201csuper PACs\u201d supporting Republican leaders on Capitol Hill.In 2014, he cut a quarter-million dollar check to the Republican Governors Association, in response to a personal entreaty from the group\u2019s chairman \u2014 Chris Christie. Still, Mr. Trump\u2019s intentions seemed opaque.In January 2015, Mr. Trump met for breakfast in Des Moines with Newt and Callista Gingrich. Having traveled to Iowa to speak at a conservative event, Mr. Trump peppered Mr. Gingrich with questions about the experience of running for president, asking about how a campaign is set up, what it is like to run and what it would cost.Mr. Gingrich said he had seen Mr. Trump until then as \u201ca guy who is getting publicity, playing a game with the birther stuff and enjoying the limelight.\u201d In Iowa, a different reality dawned.\u201cThat\u2019s the first time I thought, you know, he is really thinking about running,\u201d Mr. Gingrich said.On June 16, 2015, after theatrically descending on the escalator at Trump Tower, Mr. Trump announced his candidacy for president, hitting the precise themes he had laid out in the Conservative Political Action Conference speech five years earlier.\u201cWe are going to make our country great again,\u201d Mr. Trump declared. \u201cI will be the greatest jobs president that God ever created.\u201dStill, rival campaigns and many in the news media did not regard him seriously, predicting that he would quickly withdraw from the race and return to his reality show. Pundits seemed unaware of the spade work he had done throughout that spring, taking a half dozen trips to early voting states of Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina and using forums hosted by Mr. Bossie\u2019s group to road test a potential campaign.Even as he jumped to an early lead, opponents suggested that he was riding his celebrity name recognition and would quickly fade. It was only late in the fall, when Mr. Trump sustained a position of dominance in the race \u2014 delivering a familiar, nationalist message about immigration controls and trade protectionism \u2014 that his Republican rivals began to treat him as a mortal threat.Mr. Trump, by then, had gained the kind of status he had long been denied, and seemed more and more gleeful as he took in the significance of what he had achieved.\u201cA lot of people have laughed at me over the years,\u201d he said in a speech days before the New Hampshire primary. \u201cNow, they\u2019re not laughing so much.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "With Obama Visit to Cuba, Old Battle Lines Fade", "Date": "2016-03-26", "News": "Supported byReporter\u2019s NotebookHAVANA \u2014 For decades, Cuba and the United States have framed their relationship as a conflict of opposites: Communism vs. capitalism; Cuban loyalists vs. Cuban exiles; the state vs. the individual.But last week\u2019s visit to the island by President Obama \u2014 the first by a sitting American president since Calvin Coolidge \u2014 made clear that the old lines of battle are breaking down. Here in a place known for its rigidity, ruled since 1959 by a single family, a confounding mash-up of what was once held apart now defines how life works.Just watching the awkward dance between Mr. Obama and his Cuban counterpart at a news conference on Monday left many Cubans stunned. Young and old remarked that their president, Ra\u00fal Castro, did not deliver a strong performance. But there he was, a Castro, admitting he had agreed to take only one question, then stumbling through three \u2014 about human rights, no less \u2014 as an American president nudged him along in a classic ritual of a more open society.It was awkward to watch, the octogenarian guerrilla and the younger American, especially the missed handshake-hug at the end, precisely because it showed Mr. Castro moving into uncomfortable territory.Mr. Obama\u2019s engagement policy and Mr. Castro\u2019s minor opening to free-market ideas and careful criticism have together created a new dynamic for Cuba that is just beginning to reveal what it could become.\u201cWhile I\u2019m confident that history will judge Obama\u2019s visit and speech as a unmitigated home run, in the Cuban context he\u2019s only a pinch-hitter or a warm-up batter,\u201d said Ted Henken, a Cuba scholar at Baruch College. \u201cThe real contest can only be decided through a frank, respectful and broadly inclusive national dialogue among Cubans themselves.\u201dLoyalists vs. ExilesCuban-Americans of some prominence, including Jorge Mas Santos, the son of Jorge Mas Canosa, who used the foundation as a cudgel against the Castros, had told Mr. Obama that there would be broad support in the exile community for loosening travel rules, to allow Cuban-Americans more freedom to go back.Mr. Obama and his campaign chose to elevate emotion over ideology. Who could oppose reuniting Cuban families?I was the New York Times bureau chief in Miami then, and I remember thinking the Obama approach was a bit risky. The embargo prohibiting imports and exports was still sacred, and Cuban-American hard-liners dominated public discussion, calling those who asked if the politics around Cuba were changing \u201cclowns,\u201d \u201cidiots\u201d or worse. Polls showed most Cuban-Americans still supported the embargo and a stiff anti-Cuba position.But when Mr. Obama told the crowd that if elected, he would immediately allow \u201cunlimited family travel and remittances to the island,\u201d a cheer arose, even among middle-aged exiles in Guayaberas who told me they had previously rejected that kind of engagement.When Mr. Obama fulfilled that promise with a policy change in 2009, a rush to Cuba began. Now more than 400,000 Cuban-Americans go annually. When Mr. Castro later signaled a shift of his own, no longer calling exiles gusanos, or worms, as his brother and predecessor Fidel Castro had done, the divide between Cuban and Cuban-American, between exile and loyalist, eased further away.The examples Mr. Obama cited in his speech on Tuesday of Cuban-Americans\u2019 experiencing emotional reunions \u2014 including Melinda Lopez, who said \u201cso many of us are now getting so much back\u201d by returning after more than 50 years \u2014 are commonplace now. And they are only part of the story.More significant are the connections between recent migrants and relatives back in Cuba who have opened small businesses under Ra\u00fal Castro\u2019s new allowances for self-employment. Over the past few years, I\u2019ve met mechanics, chefs, barbers and clothes sellers who all relied on family members abroad to act as unofficial partners, even though investment is illegal under the embargo and Cuban law.The entire idea of going and staying is now being renegotiated. With Cuba also gambling on Cuban families \u2014 in 2012, Ra\u00fal Castro made it easier for Cubans to travel without losing citizenship \u2014 many more Cubans leave, but do not stay away.A few weeks ago at Florida International University in Miami, I visited a class filled with the children and grandchildren of exiles, and Analiz Faife, a biology major, who told me she was sad to have left Cuba just two years ago (after waiting seven years for a visa) and planned to move back as soon as she could. \u201cWe\u2019re here not just for our own futures,\u201d she said through a rush of tears, \u201cbut because we want to go back and help our country.\u201dOutside the baseball stadium where Mr. Obama and Mr. Castro sat together for a game, I heard something similar from Juliet Garcia Gonzalez, 17. \u201cMost people here want to leave and come back,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s really the best way to do it.\u201dWe were standing in a new Wi-Fi zone. Juliet fiddled with her phone; she was eager to keep video-chatting with a friend already in Miami.Communism vs. CapitalismMany Cubans see technology and affordable Internet access as one of, if not the, most important priorities for their country. In his speech on Tuesday, Mr. Obama told them, \u201cThe Internet should be available across the island so that Cubans can connect to the wider world and to one of the greatest engines of growth in human history.\u201dBut his meeting with entrepreneurs the day before missed the degree of activity already taking place, and the way some Cubans see technology as the path to a new economic model that is neither communist nor capitalist, and perfectly suited to Cuba\u2019s culture of sharing.I met Mr. Rodriguez outside the entrepreneur event, then sat down with him later for a lengthy interview that began with coffee and moved on to beer. He told me that Merchise\u2019s goal was to create a series of networking events and online and offline communities of people across the country who could use their programming skills to earn money with contracts for global software companies (which already happens, somewhat), then create start-ups to serve Latin-American and American markets.It was the kind of thing that would have been impossible to imagine before the announcement of restored relations between Cuba and the United States on Dec. 17, 2014. But a few days before the Obama visit, Stripe Atlas \u2014 a start-up in San Francisco that helps international companies set up a payment system in the United States \u2014 agreed to work with Merchise.Mr. Rodriguez, who started Merchise in the 1990s by recruiting two or three of his best students from each of his classes, said he expected sizable growth, with several events in the coming year. Even though public Internet access is still limited to hotels and government Wi-Fi hot spots, he said most programmers worked offline and then got online when they needed to.\u201cThe great thing about right now is that we have the attention of the world,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m constantly getting emails from people I don\u2019t know, who want to work with us.\u201d He went on to say, \u201cThis is a perfect moment for Cuba,\u201d adding, \u201cWe just have to take advantage of it.\u201dHe acknowledged challenges, mentioning infrastructure and bureaucracy. But when I asked if he thought the Cuban government would allow what sounded like a grand capitalist experiment, he cautioned against such categorizations.\u201cI don\u2019t like names; what is capitalism?\u201d he said. \u201cIs it the United States, France, Haiti or Burundi?\u201dState vs. IndividualThe techo-utopian dream of Merchise slows to a crawl when confronted with questions of freedom of expression and politics. The state continues to be ever-present and suffocating for Cubans seeking changes beyond the safety of business.Elizardo S\u00e1nchez, who heads the Cuban Commission for Human Rights and National Reconciliation, said he worried that the hopes that blossomed during the president\u2019s visit would be crushed by government repression.He himself had been detained for several hours at the Havana airport when he flew in last weekend from Miami to join a group of dissidents meeting with Mr. Obama on Tuesday.\u201cObama is running a grave risk, because the government of Cuba has an enormous capacity to make promises they never fulfill,\u201d he said. \u201cThey manipulate everything.\u201d\u201cThe Castros,\u201d he added, \u201chave an enormous capacity to intimidate all Cubans.\u201dYet Mr. S\u00e1nchez was not too intimidated to speak up, nor are many others. Cubans have been becoming bolder since Ra\u00fal Castro took over. But Mr. Obama\u2019s visit has cracked open Cuba\u2019s careful conversations, creating an eruption of frank criticism of Mr. Castro\u2019s policies, at least in private.The ranks of independent Cuban reporters trying to capture those voices, explain Cuba and hold it accountable are not large, nor are they as well-financed as the state-run media that filled the television airwaves this week with the usual menu of anti-American propaganda between Obama appearances. (Many Cubans turned off their TVs at that point.)But those ranks are growing. Elaine Diaz, a former Nieman fellow at Harvard, told me she had come back to Cuba after relations were restored because she felt there might be more freedom to do real journalism here, and she said that had mostly proven true.\u201cI\u2019m feeling much more calm,\u201d she told me, adding, \u201cIt\u2019s impossible to control millions of Cubans.\u201dWhat Ms. Diaz and many other Cubans say they want is a Cuba that confronts its own problems separate from its relationship with the United States. In many corners, there is a desire to look further back in history, to before Castro\u2019s revolution, for Cuba\u2019s essential nature, and to be done with the duality that Mr. Obama described when he said, \u201cCuba has emphasized the role and rights of the state; the United States is founded upon the rights of the individual.\u201dThe Cubans I\u2019ve talked to during this trip and many others want something else. A pair of teachers, who now have nearly 40 students per class, told me they hoped economic growth would lead to a better free education system. A tour guide for the government said the state needed to shrink quickly and significantly, but stay strong enough to keep inequality in check.The challenge for the United States and Cuba \u2014 or, really, for the Castro family \u2014 now involves finding ways to help Cubans chart their own course into this unfamiliar territory that is neither purely go-go American, nor the restricted Cuba of today.It means more uncomfortable questions. And more answers.Advertisement"}

Says", "Date": "2016-03-29", "News": "Supported byAt least six children have been killed or maimed in the fighting every day for the past year, Unicef said, calling that \u201cthe tip of the iceberg\u201d because that number represented only the cases that had been verified. The toll is almost certainly much higher, the organization said.For the past year, a Saudi-led coalition has sought to re-establish the government of President Abdu Rabbu Mansour Hadi, which was driven into exile by Houthi rebels and their allies.Mr. Hadi was able to reach the southern port city of Aden in September, but the front lines have hardly shifted since, despite a costly campaign marked by intensive Saudi-led airstrikes.The Unicef report was released as the Saudi-backed government and the Houthi rebels prepared for a halt to hostilities scheduled to come into effect at midnight on April 10, and for a round of peace talks, the second this year, to start in Kuwait eight days later.Saudi military officials reported a drop in fighting this month along the border with Yemen, but Unicef\u2019s representative in Yemen, Julien Harneis, said that fighting around the fiercely contested city of Taiz had intensified in recent days and that heavy airstrikes had continued in the north of the country.The World Health Organization said last week that more than 6,200 people had been killed and over 30,000 others wounded in the past year. Unicef reported that at least 934 children had been killed in the conflict, 61 percent of them in airstrikes, and that an additional 1,356 had been wounded.\u201cChildren are paying the highest price for a conflict not of their making,\u201d Mr. Harneis said in a statement. \u201cChildren are not safe anywhere in Yemen.\u201dUnicef said it had verified 51 attacks on schools in the past year, and in comments by telephone from Sana, the capital, Mr. Harneis said the organization had also seen a \u201cmassive spike\u201d in the recruitment of children, some as young as 10, by armed groups, particularly the Houthis.He added that the indirect consequences of the fighting were taking an even bigger toll, most notably on children, citing the widespread destruction of civilian infrastructure, including hospitals, health centers, and electricity and water supplies.Before the conflict, about 40,000 children under 5 died from preventable diseases each year, Unicef said. But it has estimated that 10,000 more succumbed to disease in the past year because of a lack of access to clean water or health care.\u201cThat\u2019s the catastrophe for me,\u201d Mr. Harneis said. \u201cThese children would never have died if it were not for this war.\u201dAbout 600 health centers have closed and 63 have come under attack, Unicef reported, adding that children\u2019s vulnerability to disease had increased as a result of a sharp rise in the number suffering from acute malnutrition. Despite the conflict, United Nations agencies have been able to deliver aid to most parts of the country, vaccinating more than four million children against polio and 1.8 million against measles, but they have been able to address only the most urgent needs.The United Nations has reported that more than 80 percent of Yemen\u2019s population of 24 million needs some form of humanitarian aid, with 19 million lacking access to clean water and 14 million in urgent need of health care.Because of an editing error, an earlier version of a picture caption with this article misstated the year the picture was taken.

And it has left some unresolved mysteries in its wake, not least whether Mr. Abdeslam was a frightened young man who got in over his head or a determined terrorist who continued to plot further assaults up until he was captured.Mr. Abdeslam, 26, handled logistics for the Paris attackers.

Instead, Salah Abdeslam, who told the police that he had wanted to blow himself up at the national soccer stadium north of Paris, lost his nerve and, according to French investigators, made a panicked call to friends in Brussels asking to be picked up and taken home in the hours after the attack, before the authorities learned his identity.The neighborhood he returned to, Molenbeek, is a working-class district, where mosques outnumber churches, cafes specialize in scalding hot tea vibrant with fresh mint and many women wear hijab. Mr. Abdeslam\u2019s Molenbeek was an even more insular sub-community, made up of small-time drug dealers and petty criminals, unemployed young men with few prospects.It was this Molenbeek that sustained him before and after the attacks. Much of Mr. Abdeslam\u2019s life was spent within a mile of his mother\u2019s house. A half-hour walk away was the bar he and Ibrahim ran until it was closed just two weeks before the attacks. It was a place where young men traded in illegal drugs, drank tea and watched extremist videos of fighting in Syria.Many of the first- and second-generation immigrants in Molenbeek, especially those living near a canal that separates the district from wealthier central Brussels, have roots, like the Abdeslam family, in Morocco. One of the busiest shops in the area has pay telephone booths for long-distance calls and computers because some Molenbeek residents cannot afford international calling plans or Internet service.It can seem at times as if a community has migrated to Belgium with its customs, loyalties and language intact, putting a premium on family ties and fostering an insularity that made finding Mr. Abdeslam that much harder. Johan Leman, an anthropologist who works in Molenbeek, said the atmosphere resembled the culture of omert\u00e0, the code of silence followed by the Mafia.Upon his return from Paris, the authorities said, Mr. Abdeslam went underground, hidden by friends and family, staying mostly in the area but moving around and relying on others to bring him food.\u201cIt was a pre-existing network that came together to do small time trafficking or other things and it was at least partly used to help in Salah Abdeslam\u2019s flight,\u201d Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Van Leeuw, the Belgium federal prosecutor, said on Belgian television on Saturday.But Mr. Abdeslam also retained close links while in hiding to other men who appear to have been involved in planning the Paris attacks and possibly trained by the Islamic State in Syria. That association suggests Mr. Abdeslam may not have given up on engaging in further terrorist activities, and that the militants in Belgium had not yet dismissed him as unwilling to give his life for their cause.The turning point in the case came last week when the police raided an apartment about six miles from Molenbeek, seeking clues but believing it to be empty.Instead, they were met with gunfire. They killed the gunman, Mohamed Belkaid, a 35-year-old Algerian who had already been linked to the Paris plot. But two men escaped. And when the police entered the apartment, they found large quantities of ammunition, an Islamic State flag \u2014 and Mr. Abdeslam\u2019s fingerprints.\u201cThere was no electricity, no water, no gas,\u201d said Ahmed El Khannouss, the deputy mayor of Molenbeek. \u201cHe was living in catastrophically unhygienic conditions.\u201d\u201cIt was basically because Salah Abdeslam activated his cellphone and the number was known to the police and then they knew his location geographically,\u201d Mr. Van Ostaeyen said.On Thursday, Ibrahim Abdeslam was buried in an unmarked grave in an ecumenical cemetery in Brussels, nearly 18 weeks after his death. The short funeral service took place under heavy surveillance, and the 20 men who attended it were identified and most likely being watched by the authorities from then on if they were not already, neighbors said.Among the attendees was Abid Aberkan, who Mr. El Khannouss said was a cousin of the Abdeslam brothers. It was to a Molenbeek apartment used by Mr. Aberkan\u2019s family that Mr. Abdeslam went at some point after the raid. And on Friday, the police targeted that apartment in a raid that ended when Mr. Abdeslam sprinted into the street from the doorway, wearing a hoodie; he was shot in the leg by the police and taken into custody.What finally gave Mr. Abdeslam away, a spokesman for the Paris prosecutor\u2019s office said, was a combination of \u201ctelephony and surveillance.\u201dMr. Abdeslam began talking to interrogators over the weekend, and France is seeking his extradition. It remains unclear how ideologically committed he was to the Islamic State, the terrorist group also known as ISIS and ISIL. His role went unmentioned in the organization\u2019s social media propaganda after the Paris attacks. There is no evidence that he tried to get to Syria. Mr. El Khannouss, the Molenbeek deputy mayor, described him as someone \u201ctrying to fill shoes that were too big for him.\u201dYet up until his capture, Mr. Abdeslam appears to have been among more hardened jihadists. Mr. Belkaid, the Algerian killed in the gunfight with the police, is suspected of wiring money to help finance the Paris plot.As the police were capturing Mr. Abdeslam on Friday, they were arresting a man whose real name they do not know yet, but since they also found false papers during the raid in the name of Amine Choukri and another set in the name of Monir Ahmed Alaaj, it is possible that he was using one or both of those names.Mr. Abdeslam, who traveled to Budapest twice last fall before the Paris attacks to pick up several men at a time when tens of thousands of undocumented migrants were streaming through Europe each week, was stopped by the police in October in Germany with a man traveling under the name Amine Choukri.On Monday, the Belgian authorities identified another man they suspect of being an accomplice of Mr. Abdeslam\u2019s: Najim Laachraoui, 24, a Belgian citizen who went to Syria in February 2013. Mr. Laachraoui, using the name Soufiane Kayal, was one of two men \u2014 Mr. Belkaid was the other \u2014 with fake Belgian identity cards who were with Mr. Abdeslam on Sept. 9 as they passed through a checkpoint between Hungary and Austria.In Molenbeek\u2019s teahouses, it is hard to get anyone to say much about Mr. Abdeslam or his capture. Men walk outside rather than speak to outsiders.That does not make them jihad supporters, said Mr. Leman, the anthropologist. \u201cEven if they disapprove of what someone did in family,\u201d he said, \u201cthey feel it should be dealt with internally.\u201dA picture on March 22 with an article about the way in which Salah Abdeslam, the lone surviving suspect from the Paris terror attacks in November, managed to elude capture for months afterward was published in error. It showed Najim Laachraoui, believed to have made the bombs used in the Paris and Brussels attacks \u2014 not Mr. Abdeslam. The error was pointed out shortly after publication, but editors failed to follow through with a print correction.Milan Schreuer and Aurelien Breeden contributed reporting from Brussels, and Lilia Blaise from Paris.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Autodesk Chooses Peace With Activist Investors", "Date": "2016-03-11", "News": "Supported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 While activist battles at other technology companies appear to be heating up, what looked like a potential fight brewing at Autodesk has instead ended quietly.The design software maker said on Friday that it had settled with two activist hedge funds, Sachem Head Capital Management and Eminence Capital, that together held more than 10 percent of the company\u2019s shares.Under the terms of the agreement, Autodesk will add three new directors: Scott Ferguson, the managing partner of Sachem Head; Richard S. Hill, the chairman of Tessera Technologies; and Jeff Clarke, the chief executive of Kodak. Though the board will initially expand to 13 with the new members, it will shrink to 11 after the company\u2019s annual meeting, when two current directors will stand down.Shares of Autodesk closed up 1.2 percent on Friday, at $56.61.Friday\u2019s announcement is the latest instance of a company choosing to settle with activist investors looking to shake up its plans rather than wage potentially long and costly battles.Only two weeks ago, Autodesk appeared ready to fight Sachem Head and Eminence. During the company\u2019s earnings call on Feb. 25, the software maker\u2019s chief executive, Carl Bass, compared the two hedge funds to callers on sports-radio talk shows.From a transcript of the call provided by Standard & Poor\u2019s Capital IQ:As a matter of fact, if you turn on sports radio or political-talk radio, on sports radio, you can hear thousands of people who know what the coach or general manager or the owner should have done differently. And I\u2019m worried about that [indiscernible]. I watched the game last night, I had a million ideas of what the coach should do, but I didn\u2019t actually have to do the job.On Friday, however, Crawford W. Beveridge, non-executive chairman of the board, struck a more conciliatory tone toward his new fellow directors.\u201cWe welcome Scott, Rick and Jeff to the board, who bring considerable expertise in technology, finance and governance for the benefit of the company and its shareholders,\u201d Mr. Beveridge said.When Sachem Head first emerged as an investor in Autodesk last November, the hedge fund disclosed wanting to discuss financial matters like costs. Now Mr. Ferguson, a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of veteran activist William A. Ackman, will have some say as a member of the board\u2019s compensation and human resources committee.Mr. Hill will serve on the corporate governance and nominating committee, while Mr. Clarke will join the audit committee.\u201cThe actions taken by the company are evidence that there is a strong alignment between the current board and shareholders on a path forward that will drive long-term shareholder value,\u201d Mr. Ferguson said in a statement.Ricky Sandler, Eminence\u2019s chief executive, added: \u201cWe are pleased to have reached a constructive agreement with the board and are confident that the addition of these directors will help create significant value for all shareholders. As committed long-term investors, we strongly support Autodesk\u2019s business model transition and move to the cloud.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Ferguson Approves a Federal Plan to Overhaul Police and Courts", "Date": "2016-03-15", "News": "Supported byFERGUSON, Mo. \u2014 The City Council here voted on Tuesday to approve a settlement with the Justice Department to overhaul the city\u2019s police and courts, capping a tense few weeks of indecision over how to push forward a community at the center of more than a year and a half of racial upheaval in America.With the 6-to-0 vote, the Council reversed itself and avoided an expensive legal fight with the federal government. Ferguson must now begin the long, deliberate and costly process of carrying out reforms to a criminal justice system that has been under fire since a white police officer fatally shot an unarmed black teenager in 2014. \u201cFerguson has been literally the emotional ground zero of this issue,\u201d Wesley Bell, a councilman, told the crowd of several dozen after the vote was taken. He added that with the world watching, the city could \u201cshow what change looks like.\u201dVanita Gupta, who leads the Justice Department\u2019s Civil Rights Division, released a statement saying the city had taken \u201can important step towards guaranteeing all of its citizens the protections of our Constitution.\u201d The meeting, at a local church, was not nearly as crowded or contentious as previous sessions in which the consent decree was discussed. Almost all who addressed the Council spoke in favor of signing the decree. Council members stared, arms crossed, as audience members spoke.\u201cI know that this has been a long journey for all of us, but I am so looking forward to the opportunity for the city to turn this page,\u201d Cassandra Butler, a Ferguson resident, told the Council.But after the vote, some members warned of jumping ahead.\u201cThis is just one step,\u201d Councilman Dwayne T. James said. \u201cWe still have a lot of work to do.\u201dAfter the vote, Michael Brown Sr., whose son\u2019s killing by a police officer here in August 2014 set off national unrest, shook hands with Mayor James Knowles III and said thanks.\u201cIt\u2019s beautiful,\u201d Mr. Brown said in an interview. \u201cIt\u2019s a good feeling. It let me know that, at the end of the day, you still have to make choices, and hopefully they\u2019re the good choices.\u201dThe reforms include changing policies on stun guns and on shooting at moving vehicles, repealing questionable laws and carrying out new guidelines for stops and searches by local law enforcement. The city must also hire an independent monitor to ensure that the changes are enacted properly. When federal officials and the city announced the accord in late January after several months of talks, they did so with optimism that the city was turning a new leaf and setting a national example for change. About a year earlier, the government had released the scathing results of an investigation that found that Ferguson\u2019s law enforcement system regularly violated people\u2019s constitutional rights and used its police and courts to make money rather than ensure public safety. The investigation unfolded in the wake of the fatal police shooting of 18-year-old Michael Brown, after complaints from the predominantly black population of Ferguson and surrounding communities that the police regularly harassed them.But after the Council held several public hearings, members started to waver. While many in the community urged the Council to pass the agreement, others expressed concern that its cost would bankrupt the city. Ferguson\u2019s finance director, Jeffrey Blume, said enacting the agreement would cost as much as $3.7 million in the first year and $3 million in subsequent years. Yet others argued that challenging the agreement would lead to a court battle that one lawyer for the city estimated would cost as much as $8 million. The city has been running an operating deficit of about $2.5 million a year since the Brown shooting, which led to widespread demonstrations and unrest.The Council voted a little more than a month ago to send the agreement back to the Justice Department with seven amendments, even though federal officials had said they would sue if the city did not approve the consent decree in its entirety. The Justice Department did just that, filing a lawsuit the day after the Council\u2019s vote. But Ferguson officials started showing signs of a change of heart about a week ago after the Justice Department sent them a letter saying it would work with them to keep the costs of the changes in check. To help cover the costs of the agreement, the city has placed tax increases on the ballot next month.\u201cThe federal government now, and their monitor, will oversee and watch and report back on the progress we\u2019ve made,\u201d Mr. Knowles said in an interview. \u201cThis is no longer me sitting at a meeting saying, \u2018Look at all the stuff we did,\u2019 and people saying, \u2018Ah, you\u2019re lying.\u2019 That will really help us get past that level of distrust.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "In a Rebel Camp in Colombia, Marx and Free Love Reign", "Date": "2016-03-18", "News": "Supported by10 PhotosIN THE MOUNTAINS OF COLOMBIA \u2014 The rebel camp is a Communist time capsule. An old guerrilla fighter sings songs about Che Guevara on his guitar as a crowd leans in to listen, armed with rifles and grenades.Salaries do not exist here, or even marriage. The fighters believe in free love, saying they are wed only to the revolution. They say life is still possible with Karl Marx in one hand and a Kalashnikov in the other.Now, the two sides are negotiating an end to decades of fighting, the longest conflict in modern history. But the end was nowhere in sight that day.It was around 6 p.m. when the communiqu\u00e9 reached the guerrilla camp \u2014 and the news was not good.The message, read aloud under a tent, came from Rodrigo Londo\u00f1o \u2014 or Timochenko, as he is called here \u2014 the top FARC commander negotiating with the government to lay down arms after so much war.The talks were in a state of collapse, the communiqu\u00e9 warned. The rebels had stormed from the negotiating table in anger.War could be on the horizon once again.\u201cThere may be nothing else than to continue with what we came here 50 years ago to do,\u201d the message concluded, as the fighters in the camp gasped and gripped their weapons tighter.Both sides are saying that the March 23 deadline for a final deal may be missed, leaving little certain now.After the letter was read, a hushed silence fell under the tent. It was broken by a man in a beret with a red star who yelled slogans shouted by guerrillas throughout the ages:\u201cAgainst imperialism,\u201d he shouted.\u201cFor the Fatherland!\u201d the camp roared back.\u201cAgainst the oligarchy,\u201d he shouted.\u201cFor the people!\u201d they replied.The day begins here an hour before dawn. At 5:15, the fighters line up for the day\u2019s tasks: guarding outposts, slaughtering a cow. Breakfast is served out of a thatched-roof hut with ovens built into the ground.The prospect of peace might be a national question in Colombia, but it is a very personal one in this camp. Will the fighters return to the villages they once knew? Will they reunite with children abandoned years ago, children who are now adults themselves?Samy is 28 now, but she was barely 16 when she became a guerrilla.Like many rebels, who used their first names to keep their families safe, her childhood was filled with memories of deadly campaigns waged against peasants by paramilitary groups searching for guerrillas. She remembers six people shot dead in her small village. She decided that taking up arms was the way to survive.\u201cHere, you form another family,\u201d she said.Since then, Samy has seen her mother only once, during a brief meeting in a safe house when she was 21. The two women talked about what Samy had been like as a child, a distant memory that is almost gone. Samy has no plans to go home if the FARC disarms.The group, listed as a terrorist organization by the State Department, once counted some 17,000 fighters in its ranks; now it is down to just 7,000.Many here in the camp are still teenagers. Didier, 15, has barely shot the rifle he was given by the FARC when he joined the group six months ago.He came with two other teenage runaways, ushered away before sunrise on motorcycles by FARC militiamen from a small river port town. He hopes a peace deal will allow him to head home to explain to his father why he left: His family was running out of food.By 1 p.m., it had grown hot. The fighters were washing clothes and swimming in the river. Angela, a girl of about 18 with the nickname \u201cGunpowder,\u201d stepped out giggling in her underwear to escape a group of young men and teenage boys splashing water at her. She picked up her Kalashnikov and left.While marriage is unknown here, relationships among guerrillas are common. The man asks his commander for permission, just as many rural Colombians would ask the father for a woman\u2019s hand. When the two want to have sex, they tell the commander and then slip off into the woods, with palm fronds for bedding.The relations come and go.\u201cHow long did we live together, Andrea?\u201d asked the fighter Samuel, 31.\u201cI don\u2019t even remember,\u201d said Andrea, 26.The two laughed. Both now have children by other partners, civilians living elsewhere in Colombia. They both plan to go raise them if there is a peace deal.Camilo, 19, had a relationship, too, but the woman was killed along with 10 other fighters in an aerial bombing six months ago by the government.\u201cWe are in a war, and that is just how it is,\u201d Camilo said. \u201cThe things you see in a place like this. A leg over there, a foot across the river, and then an arm in some other place.\u201dNight falls, and marches begin into the forest. One squad of fighters heads to a distant part of the jungle. They sling up hammocks between trees next to large spiders and a few tree frogs.Someone whistles, a signal that an airplane is approaching overhead, and the guerrillas turn off their lights so as not to be seen from above.For many in the older generation, the graying fighters of the FARC, the future brings the possibility of a political rebirth. They have abandoned any hope that the guerrillas will topple the government one day, as revolutionaries did in Cuba and Nicaragua. The future in Colombia, they say, will come through joining the system that exists.\u201cWe will get rid of the arms and become politicians,\u201d said Luisito, the camp\u2019s second in command. \u201cBut we will not lose our structure. We will be at the ballot boxes this time.\u201dThe FARC is preparing its rank and file for what life will be like after a peace deal. Most mornings, fighters assemble under the tent for \u201cpedagogy.\u201d Leaders explain the agreement being negotiated in Havana and solicit responses from fighters.Hand-painted signs reinforce the new tone: \u201cIn principal, we are for peace and not for war,\u201d says one sign hanging above a row of Kalashnikovs.Some fighters want to know where they will live after a peace deal. Can they stay in the camp, simply without weapons? How will life be financed if the FARC can no longer levy its \u201ctaxes\u201d in the hinterlands, like the one on the lucrative coca trade?Others want to know if they will even be allowed to live.One fighter with the nom de guerre Te\u00f3filo Panclasta said he had gotten out of a Colombian prison this month after serving two years on rebellion charges. In the mid-1980s, he said, he was part of the FARC\u2019s largest experiment in political participation, the Patriotic Union, a party that the guerrillas formed as part of peace talks at the time. The effort brought part of the FARC out of the shadows.The response of paramilitary groups was brutal. In all, about 3,000 members of the party, from supporters to presidential candidates, were killed in retributive violence.\u201cDon\u2019t think this could not happen all over again,\u201d Mr. Panclasta said. \u201cIf we give up our rifles, our grenades, our pistols, we can only defend ourselves with our words.\u201dMembers of the camp say they came under fire last month when they ran into the Colombian military about 30 miles away. Eight guerrillas were wounded. One commander, Alberto, jumped off a rooftop to take cover. He now hobbles around the camp on crutches.\u201cWe had no idea what it meant was that socialism was coming to an end,\u201d he said.While the model may be ending, the FARC will remain, he insisted. \u201cWe are seeking peace, but we are not demobilizing,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re simply taking a new shape.\u201dMr. Panclasta hoped for the same.He seemed to feel liberated in the outdoor camp, after his years in a prison cell. He was shouting old slogans, slapping shoulders and pouring coffee for the fighters.He cited a phrase from Marx.\u201c \u2018From each according to his ability, to each according to his needs,\u2019 \u201d he said. \u201cThese ideas may be old ones \u2014 but they are the ones which have saved us in the forest here, and the ones that will save us through whatever is next.\u201dAdvertisement"}

And she has increased the amount of time she spends shopping on the Internet because merchants offer incentives online for cardholders that are not available in stores.\u201cI haven\u2019t paid for a trip on Southwest in years,\u201d says Ms. Falcone, which may be technically true, but a host of economic and social science research suggests that consumers tend to spend more using plastic than they ever would with actual cash.Incentives like frequent-flier miles or rewards points only amplify a temptation that banks and financial services companies have been profiting from for decades.With M.B.A. students as the subjects, Mr. Simester and a colleague, Drazen Prelec, held an auction of tickets to basketball and baseball games featuring two local teams, the Boston Celtics and the Boston Red Sox.Some participants were told they would have to pay by credit card, others were informed that only cash would be accepted.When credit cards were an option, the M.B.A. students offered to pay roughly twice as much as they were willing to hand over in cash for the same tickets.\u201cThe most surprising thing was the size of the effect,\u201d said Mr. Simester, who titled the resulting paper \u2018Always Leave Home Without It: A Further Investigation of the Credit-Card Effect on Willingness to Pay.\u2019 \u201dHe added that while it was not unusual to see spending patterns shift by 5 or 10 percent in experiments, \u201cyou don\u2019t see too many examples where people offer double what they would have otherwise.\u201dBut the ease of buying with plastic, or what marketers call \u201cfriction-free spending,\u201d is only half the story. Social scientists have also found that consumers have been conditioned by even the sight of credit card logos to want to spend more.Unlike Mr. Simester, who created an experiment from scratch, Richard Feinberg of Purdue University persuaded restaurants near campus in West Lafayette, Ind., to let him study actual patrons\u2019 spending habits.Mr. Feinberg placed credit card logos and symbols on some tables and left others without them, as normal. The sight of images associated with credit cards prompted diners to spend more and leave bigger tips.A similar exercise in a faculty member\u2019s office produced larger donations to the United Way, Mr. Feinberg added, while credit card images bolstered sales at a Fannie May candy store.\u201cPeople spend more when these stimuli are present,\u201d he said. \u201cJust as Pavlov found that dogs would salivate when they heard tones that were associated with food, people have been conditioned to associate credit cards with spending.\u201dAlthough tools like Apple Pay and other mobile payment methods are too new to have generated much academic research, or allowed the kind of conditioning that half a century of credit card use has produced, Mr. Feinberg suggests a similar dynamic could be at work.\u201cThe less friction there is, the easier it becomes to spend,\u201d he said. \u201cJust stand at Starbucks and watch how many people there use their smartphones to buy a latte.\u201d\u201cPaying $5 for a coffee might seem like a lot if you only have $10 in your wallet,\u201d he said. \u201cBut if your credit card has a $10,000 limit on it, it doesn\u2019t seem like much.\u201dThe key, said Greg McBride, chief financial analyst at Bankrate.com, a personal finance website, is to try to exercise the same discipline with plastic that you would with cash, despite the urge to splurge.If you can\u2019t help yourself, or occasionally do have to carry a balance, avoid incentive cards at all costs. \u201cThey only work for consumers who pay their balances in full,\u201d he said, as Ms. Falcone does scrupulously each month.For the 60 percent of consumers who can\u2019t pay off what they owe each month, a much smarter bet would be to seek out the card with the lowest possible interest rate.Of course, even the best card rates are still high \u2014 the typical consumer today has $2,200 in credit card debt, with an average annual interest rate of nearly 16 percent, according to Bankrate.com.Does that mean consumers should cut their cards up, stick to cash the way our great-grandparents had to and embrace the supposedly traditional value of thrift?It\u2019s not that simple today, nor was there really ever a golden age when Americans bought only what they could truly afford, said Lendol Calder, a professor of history at Augustana College in Rock Island, Ill.\u201cThe river of red ink has run through American history from the beginning,\u201d said Mr. Calder. \u201cThe Pilgrims took out loans from London investors and many of them died without ever having paid off their debts. As far back as you go, people were in over their heads.\u201dThat said, Mr. Calder says he believes credit cards do offer advantages, despite the inevitable temptation to spend more.\u201cCredit cards are useful because people want to be thrifty with time,\u201d Mr. Calder explained. \u201cIn the 20th century, time became scarce and credit cards and credit in general helps with that. It\u2019s one thing to save and save and buy an engagement ring for someone you love, but not if you wait and she runs off with someone else.\u201dNelson D.

{"Headline": "With Two Bids, Iona Savors \u2018Incredible Accomplishment\u2019", "Date": "2016-03-14", "News": "Supported byNEW ROCHELLE, N.Y. \u2014 Once the final cord of the net was cut and the final picture was taken to commemorate Iona\u2019s triumph in the Metro Atlantic Athletic Conference men\u2019s basketball tournament, Iona Coach Tim Cluess went looking to congratulate Billi Godsey.A few hours before the Iona men\u2019s team (22-10) won the MAAC tournament title (its league-record ninth) on March 7, earning an automatic berth in the N.C.A.A. tournament, Godsey and the Iona women\u2019s team (23-11) had matched the feat. It was the first conference title, and the first N.C.A.A. berth, for the program since its inception in 1974.At least a dozen universities will send their men\u2019s and women\u2019s teams to the N.C.A.A. tournaments this season. Still, an achievement that has become the norm at places like UConn, Oklahoma and Maryland feels a bit more remarkable at a place like Iona.\u201cIt\u2019s so hard for one team to make it, let alone two, especially in a conference our size,\u201d Cluess said.For Cluess and Godsey, that made last Monday twice as sweet. They understand better than most the challenges midmajor programs face in facilities, recruiting and financing when competing against major conferences for players as well as victories.Kansas, North Carolina, Virginia and Oregon are the top seeds in the N.C.A.A. men\u2019s basketball tournament.\u201cI think it\u2019s an incredible accomplishment,\u201d said Rick Cole Jr., who is in his third year as Iona\u2019s athletic director, adding: \u201cYou can find excuses or you can find ways to succeed. How do you want to spend your energy?\u201dFor decades, enthusiasm and energy at Iona, a private Catholic liberal arts college with an enrollment of about 3,800, revolved around the men\u2019s program. Jim Valvano, as energetic and charismatic as they come, helped to place Iona on the national stage from 1975 to 1980, and many his successors fed off of his creation.The women\u2019s program provided a stark contrast. While the Gaels men have made 11 N.C.A.A. tournament trips, the women\u2019s team finished without a winning record every season from 1982-83 until 2005-6. Coaches came and went, but success never arrived.\u201cThe presidents would always wonder why we didn\u2019t do much better,\u201d said Richard Petriccione, Iona\u2019s athletic director from 1989 to 2001. \u201cBut other than that, there wasn\u2019t a sense of urgency to get the program to the point where we would be very competitive as opposed to just putting out a team.\u201dHe added: \u201cThe biggest difference I see today, which is really great, is that the student-athlete experience for the men\u2019s and women\u2019s teams is, for the most part, equal, if not absolutely equal. That was different in those days. Budgets were different, the way teams traveled was different, recruiting budgets were different.\u201dCole emphasized Iona\u2019s desire to do more than comply with opportunity required by Title IX, saying, \u201cWomen\u2019s basketball matters to Iona.\u201d Godsey, in her third year, credits her team\u2019s long-awaited breakthrough to that administrative support.Hired in May 2013, she inherited a rising program from Tony Bozzella \u2014 he is N.C.A.A.-bound this season with the Seton Hall women\u2019s team \u2014 and continued its ascent through tough defense and strong recruiting. Marina Lizarazu, a junior guard and a key figure on this year\u2019s team, readily downsized in transferring to Iona after her freshman year at Texas Tech.\u201cI was looking for a different kind of environment, and Iona is next to the best city in the world,\u201d said Lizarazu, who is from Madrid. \u201cI love all the people. I love all my teammates.\u201dGodsey, who holds a master\u2019s degree in psychology, also tries to turn Iona\u2019s small size to its advantage by working to create a family atmosphere. Aaliyah Robinson, a senior guard, said of Godsey, \u201cI feel like one of her daughters.\u201dReferring to what bigger programs can offer, Godsey said: \u201cThat facility is not going to love you back. You can get in that gym and shoot all you want, but it\u2019s people who are going to take care of you.\u201dGodsey is so intent on achieving the right chemistry that she acknowledges scrutinizing the parents of recruits before recruiting them. \u201cWe see how they cheer for players or against players and see the manner in which they interact in general,\u201d she said, \u201cbecause we want good people.\u201dStylistically, Godsey emphasizes defense. Her team ranks 38th nationally, allowing 56.6 points a game. Cluess\u2019s 22-10 squad, by contrast, is built around a high-powered offense that ranks 31st at 79.6 points a game.Now those paths are finally converging in the N.C.A.A. tournament. The women\u2019s team, a 15th seed in the Lexington Region, was matched against No. 2-seeded Maryland in the first round Saturday in College Park, Md. The men\u2019s team, seeded 13th in the Midwest Region, is off to Denver, where it will face Iowa State (21-11) on Thursday.Advertisement"}

Singer may have been a victory for both the South American nation and the hedge funds, but it has left many small bondholders out in the cold.Mr. Singer\u2019s NML Capital will have made about 369 percent, or $2.4 billion, on defaulted bonds whose principal value was $617 million, according to data from the finance ministry of Argentina that was filed to the court on Monday. Bracebridge Capital, another holdout hedge fund, will be paid $1.15 billion, representing a 952 percent return on bonds with principal worth $120 million, according to the data.On Tuesday, the Federal District Court in Manhattan heard from the lawyers of individual investors, most of whom bought Argentine bonds before the country\u2019s colossal debt default in 2001.One lawyer, Jessica J. Sleater, spoke of a 90-year-old client who bought Argentine bonds in the 1990s for \u201cpatriotic\u201d reasons and has still not been repaid. Her client, who is partly paralyzed, had planned to use money from the interest to pay for costs associated with his disability, she added.These investors, like the big hedge funds, are known as holdout investors because they have refused to take part in two debt restructurings by Argentina after the country defaulted in 2001.\u201cWe stand ready, willing and able\u201d to negotiate with Argentina, Ms. Sleater said. She was referring to the fact that while Argentina has participated in several intense negotiations over the last month with lawyers and principals of six of the biggest holdout hedge funds, it has not sat down with other holdout investors. Instead, it has made a blanket offer in a take-it-or-leave-it manner that has some investors angry.At the 11th hour of what many have called a historic deal involving Argentina and its holdout investors, it seems that those investors who were once united in their dispute against Argentina are turning against one another.\u201cWe haven\u2019t been intransigent, there isn\u2019t an impasse,\u201d said Michael Spencer, a lawyer who represents another group of individual bondholders and small funds contesting Argentina\u2019s offer. Mr. Spencer said most of his clients bought their bonds before Argentina defaulted for full value. \u201cWe\u2019re not greedy,\u201d he added as he sought to separate his clients from the holdouts that have been at times called vultures for their reputation of buying bonds up for pennies on the dollar and then seeking full repayment.Judge Thomas P. Griesa heard from 15 lawyers representing the holdout investors big and small, Argentina, the banks, and even a group of exchange bondholders investors who agreed to take a so-called haircut during one of Argentina\u2019s two restructurings. The exchange bondholders have not been paid since Judge Griesa ruled that Argentina cannot pay any bondholders without also paying the holdouts.The hearing on Tuesday became messy as lawyers divided into two groups: one group that wants Argentina to be able to pay those who have settled immediately, and another group that is asking the judge to give everyone 30 more days.Judge Griesa wants to lift the injunction that has prevented Argentina from making these payments to all bondholders after a settlement offer and the proposal it made on Feb. 5.\u201cWe should no longer be held hostage by other parties who want a better deal,\u201d an animated Christopher J. Clark, a representative of a group of exchange bondholders, said on Tuesday. He said his clients had been denied $3.1 billion in interest payments.After nearly two hours of arguments and rebuttals, Judge Griesa, who has been presiding over the battle for over a decade, adjourned the hearing, deferring a decision for later.\u201cThis has been a remarkable afternoon,\u201d he said shortly before walking out of the court.Advertisement"}

Many are now trying to turn around the prison juggernaut by steering drug addicts into treatment instead of jail and retooling parole systems that once sent people back to prison for technical violations.\nThe editorial board makes a very compelling case for investing in a solid higher education system for prisoners. It made me think about the roles of inmates in society once they are released from prison, and how we should really be considering that when looking at criminal justice reform. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not just about improving inmates\u00e2\u0080\u0099 experiences in prison; it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s making sure that they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re on their feet once they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re released.\nIn Albany, lawmakers started petitions to collect signatures from constituents who oppose the idea, including one with the title \u00e2\u0080\u009cHell No to Attica University.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The State Senate, which is controlled by Republicans and a group of independent Democrats, included in its draft of the budget a provision that forbade the use of state money to pay for college degree programs in prisons unless inmates pay the full tuition.The idea provoked outrage in Washington: Three Republican congressmen from upstate New York introduced what they called the Kids Before Cons Act, which would prevent federal money from being used to pay for college classes for federal or state prison inmates.The proposal also gave fodder to Rob Astorino, the Westchester County executive, who is campaigning to unseat Mr. Cuomo in November. During a recent visit to Buffalo, Mr. Astorino, a Republican, spoke about how he and his wife were saving to pay for their children to go to college. \u00e2\u0080\u009cMaybe our 10-year-old son, we should sit him down and explain how to rob a bank,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Astorino said.\u2014 What do you think? Should prisoners be given the opportunity to get an education?\u2014 Does providing prisoners with the chance to take college courses in prison help them get a leg up when they are released? Does it help prevent inmates from landing back in jail later on?  \u00e2\u0080\u0094 Do you trust the research, cited in the editorial, that shows money spent on prison education actually saves the government money in the long run because prisoners are less likely to get wrapped up in the criminal justice system again?\u2014 Or do you think any money spent on prison education programs takes away from money that could be spent on education for law-abiding citizens? \u2014 Do you agree with Mr. Astorino, the Westchester County executive, who argued that investing money in prison education sends the wrong message to hard-working families?

{"Headline": "Facebook Faces German Antitrust Investigation", "Date": "2016-03-02", "News": "Supported byBRUSSELS \u2014 Facebook became the latest American technology company on Wednesday to face antitrust hurdles in Europe after the German competition authority opened an investigation into whether the company has abused its dominant position in social networking.The move puts Facebook, which is used by many of Europe\u2019s 500 million citizens, alongside other United States technology companies, like Google and Microsoft, which have also faced antitrust investigations into their activities across the region.European officials have taken a tough stance on how American tech giants operate across the 28-member bloc, as many politicians here remain concerned that these companies often dominate many aspects of people\u2019s digital lives, including social networking, online search and e-commerce.As part of the new investigation, German authorities said they were looking into whether Facebook misused its position to collect people\u2019s digital information. That included complicated terms and conditions that individuals had to sign to use the social network, and whether such contracts placed unfair constraints on the company\u2019s users.In response, Facebook said it was confident that it had complied with German law.\u201cWe look forward to working with the Federal Cartel Office to answer their questions,\u201d the company said in a statement.While the German investigation will look into Facebook\u2019s digital practices, it remains unclear whether other European policy makers \u2014 including at the European Commission, the executive arm of the European Union \u2014 will also open antitrust inquiries into the social network.The biggest American tech companies face intensifying scrutiny by European regulators, with \u2014 pressure that could potentially curb their sizable profits in the region and affect how they operate around the world.Several national privacy regulators are looking into how the social network collects data on both its users and those who are not signed up for its online services.Facebook was also at the center of a successful legal challenge in Europe\u2019s highest court over how data was transferred between the European Union and the United States. That led to senior European judges invalidating the so-called safe harbor data-transfer agreement between the two regions, increasing uncertainty over how companies like Facebook could move data across the Atlantic.In an acknowledgment of the growing regulatory challenges now confronting Facebook in Europe, Mark Zuckerberg, the company\u2019s 31-year-old chief executive, traveled to Germany last month to meet with policy makers, local publishers and the company\u2019s users.For Facebook, whose business model is based on selling advertisements targeted at users based on information in their posts, the company\u2019s use of people\u2019s digital data is increasingly putting it at odds with Europe\u2019s tough data protection rules, which view individuals\u2019 privacy rights on a par with rights such as the freedom of expression.European competition authorities are also increasingly looking at how companies like Facebook may hold a dominant position over people\u2019s digital information, which may give them an unfair advantage over rivals.This year, for example, Margrethe Vestager, the European competition commissioner, said the collection of a vast amount of users\u2019 data by a small number of tech companies like Google and Facebook could violate of the region\u2019s tough competition rules.\u201cIf a few companies control the data you need to cut costs, then you give them the power to drive others out of the market,\u201d Ms. Vestager said.\u201cIt\u2019s a business transaction, not a free giveaway,\u201d she added, referring to companies\u2019 use of people\u2019s digital data. \u201cAs consumers, we need to be treated fairly.\u201dAdvertisement"}

To people in China, it is hardly different.The problem: a recent, highly public attack on free speech, this time not against a little-known rights advocate, but against a wealthy and politically well-connected businessman who dared to criticize the leadership.On Saturday, the National People\u2019s Congress, the country\u2019s legislature, convenes. The two sessions bring about 5,000 delegates to Beijing, many of them politically, economically or socially influential, for significant, if closed-door, deliberations.\u201cThe two sessions are for discussing important national matters and putting forward constructive opinions, not for the discussion of trivia,\u201d Mr. Jiang, who is a professor at the Shanghai University of Finance and Economics, told Caixin in an article posted on Thursday.\u201cBut because of the influence of certain events, everyone is a bit dazed, and people don\u2019t want to talk so much.

{"Headline": "Ethereum, a Virtual Currency, Enables Transactions That Rival Bitcoin\u2019s", "Date": "2016-03-27", "News": "Supported byA new virtual gold rush is underway.Even as Bitcoin, riven by internal divisions, has struggled, a rival virtual currency \u2014 known as Ethereum \u2014 has soared in value, climbing 1,000 percent over the last three months.Beyond the price spike, Ethereum is also attracting attention from giants in finance and technology, like JPMorgan Chase, Microsoft and IBM, which have described it as a sort of Bitcoin 2.0.Like Bitcoin, the Ethereum system is built on a blockchain in which every transaction is recorded publicly. The promise of such a system is that it allows the exchange of money and assets more quickly and more cheaply than relying on a long chain of middlemen.But Ethereum has also won fans with its promise to do much more than Bitcoin. In addition to the virtual currency, the software provides a way to create online markets and programmable transactions known as smart contracts.Many Bitcoin advocates say Ethereum will face more security problems than Bitcoin because of the greater complexity of the software. Thus far, Ethereum has faced much less testing, and many fewer attacks, than Bitcoin. The novel design of Ethereum may also invite intense scrutiny by authorities given that potentially fraudulent contracts, like the Ponzi schemes, can be written directly into the Ethereum system.Microsoft has been working on several projects that make it easier to use Ethereum on its computing cloud, Azure.\u201cEthereum is a general platform where you can solve problems in many industries using a fairly elegant solution \u2014 the most elegant solution we have seen to date,\u201d said Marley Gray, a director of business development and strategy at Microsoft.Mr. Gray is responsible for Microsoft\u2019s work with blockchains, the database concept that Bitcoin introduced. Blockchains are designed to store transactions and data without requiring any central authority or repository.Blockchain ledgers are generally maintained and updated by networks of computers working together \u2014 somewhat similar to the way that Wikipedia is updated and maintained by all its users.Many corporations, though, have created their own Ethereum networks with private blockchains, independent of the public system, and that could ultimately detract from the value of the individual unit in the Ethereum system \u2014 known as an Ether \u2014 that people have recently been buying.Many of these banks have recently been looking at how some version of Ethereum might be put to use. JPMorgan, for instance, has created a specific tool, Masala, that allows some of its internal databases to interact with an Ethereum blockchain.Michael Novogratz, a former top executive at the private equity firm Fortress Investing Group, who helped lead Fortress\u2019s investment in Bitcoin, has been looking at Ethereum since he left Fortress last fall. Mr. Novogratz said that he made a \u201csignificant\u201d purchase of Ether in January. He has also heard how the financial industry\u2019s chatter about the virtual currency has evolved.\u201cA lot of the more established players were thinking, \u2018It\u2019s still an experiment,\u2019 \u201d he said. \u201cIt feels like in the last two to three months that experiment is at least getting a lot more validation.\u201dSince the beginning of the year, the value of an individual unit of Ether has soared as high as $12 from around $1. That has brought the value of all existing Ether to over $1 billion at times, significantly more than any virtual currency other than Bitcoin, which had over $6 billion in value outstanding last week.Since Bitcoin was invented, there have been many so-called alt-coins that have tried to improve on Bitcoin, but none have won the following of Ethereum.Unlike Bitcoin, which was released in 2009 by a mysterious creator known as Satoshi Nakamoto, Ethereum was created in a more transparent fashion by a 21-year-old Russian-Canadian, Vitalik Buterin, after he dropped out of Waterloo University in Ontario.The most basic aim of Ethereum was to make it possible to program binding agreements into the blockchain \u2014 the smart contract concept. Two people, for instance, could program a bet on a sports game directly into the Ethereum blockchain. Once the final score came in from a mutually agreed upon source \u2014 say, The Associated Press \u2014 the money would be automatically transferred to the winning party. Ether can be used as a currency in this system, but Ether are also necessary to pay for the network power needed to process the bet.The Ethereum system has sometimes been described as a single shared computer that is run by the network of users and on which resources are parceled out and paid for by Ether.A team of seven co-founders helped Mr. Buterin write up the software after he released the initial description of the system. Mr. Buterin\u2019s team raised $18 million in 2014 through a presale of Ether, which helped fund the Ethereum Foundation, which supports the software\u2019s development.Like Bitcoin, Ethereum has succeeded by attracting a dedicated network of followers who have helped support the software, partly in the hope that their Ether will increase in value if the system succeeds. Last week, there were 5,800 computers \u2014 or nodes \u2014 helping support the network around the world. The Bitcoin network had about 7,400 nodes.One of Mr. Buterin\u2019s co-founders, Joseph Lubin, has set up ConsenSys, a company based in Brooklyn that has hired over 50 developers to build applications on the Ethereum system, including one that enables music distribution and another that allows for a new kind of financial auditing.The ConsenSys offices are in an old industrial building in the Bushwick section of Brooklyn. The office is essentially one large room, with all the messy trademarks of a start-up operation, including white boards on the walls and computer parts lying around.Mr. Lubin said he had thrown himself into Ethereum after starting to think that it delivered on some of the failed promise of Bitcoin, especially when it came to allowing new kinds of online contracts and markets.\u201cBitcoin presented the broad strokes vision, and Ethereum presented the crystallization of how to deliver that vision,\u201d he said.Joseph Bonneau, a computer science researcher at Stanford who studies so-called crypto-currencies, said Ethereum was the first system that had really caught his interest since Bitcoin.It is far from a sure thing, he cautioned.\u201cBitcoin is still probably the safest bet, but Ethereum is certainly No. 2, and some folks will say it is more likely to be around in 10 years,\u201d Mr. Bonneau said. \u201cIt will depend if any real markets develop around it. If there is some actual application.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Trade Deficit Isn\u2019t a Scorecard, and Cutting It Won\u2019t Make America Great Again", "Date": "2016-03-27", "News": "Supported byThe 2016 RaceDonald Trump believes that a half-trillion-dollar trade deficit with the rest of the world makes the United States a loser and countries with trade surpluses like China and Mexico winners.The reality is different. Trade deficits are not inherently good or bad; they can be either, depending on circumstances. The trade deficit is not a scorecard.What\u2019s more, eliminating the trade deficit would not, on its own, make America great again, as Mr. Trump promises. And in isolation, the fact that the United States has a trade deficit does not prove that trade agreements are bad for Americans, a staple of Bernie Sanders\u2019s campaign in the Democratic presidential primary. In fact, trying to eliminate the trade deficit could mean giving up some of the key levers of power that allow the United States to get its way in international politics.Getting rid of the trade deficit could very well make America less great. The reasons have to do with the global reserve currency, economic diplomacy and something called the Triffin dilemma.Imagine a world where there are only two countries, and only two products. One country makes cars; the other grows bananas.People in CarNation want bananas, so they buy $1 million worth from people in BananaLand. Residents of BananaLand want cars, so they buy $2 million of them from CarNation.That difference is the trade deficit: BananaLand has a $1 million trade deficit; CarNation has a $1 million trade surplus.But this does not mean that BananaLand is \u201closing\u201d to CarNation. Cars are really useful, and BananaLandites got a lot of them in exchange for their money.Similarly, it\u2019s true that the United States has a $58 billion trade deficit with Mexico, for example. But it\u2019s not as if Americans were just flinging money across the Rio Grande out of charity. Americans get a lot of good stuff for that: avocados, for example, and Canc\u00fan vacations.If you want to think of it in terms of winners and losers, in fact, you could justifiably reverse Mr. Trump\u2019s preferred framing: \u201cThose losers in Mexico gave us $58 billion more stuff than we gave them last year. Ha, ha, ha. We\u2019re winners.\u201dMaybe.It is true that a trade deficit subtracts from a country\u2019s gross domestic product. G.D.P. measures the value of goods and services produced within a country\u2019s borders, so when a country is selling less stuff abroad than it buys from abroad, the country is making less stuff, and as a result there are fewer jobs. This piece of the Trump theory of trade is true.But when a country runs a trade deficit, as the United States does, there is a countervailing force. Think back to our pretend countries. BananaLand has a $1 million trade deficit with CarNation. But that means that car producers in CarNation are sitting on an extra $1 million a year in income.Something has to happen with that $1 million, and both of the two options have consequences.One option is to keep that money at home. But keeping that money inside CarNation will push the value of its currency upward. And as its currency goes up, cars will become more expensive in BananaLand \u2014 causing people there to buy fewer of them until eventually the trade deficit is eliminated.If CarNation doesn\u2019t want its currency to rise, it has to take that $1 million trade surplus and plow it back into BananaLand. There are different ways it could do that. People in CarNation could buy stocks or bonds in BananaLand, or companies in CarNation could invest in factories in BananaLand, or the government of CarNation could buy assets directly.The choice is stark: A country running a trade surplus must either let its currency rise or let money flow back to its trading partners.This isn\u2019t just an abstraction. It\u2019s what has happened between the United States and China for the last couple of decades. China has had consistent trade surpluses, but it did not want its currency to rise in a way that would undermine its exporters. So money has flowed from China into the United States \u2014 both from the Chinese government\u2019s purchases of United States Treasury bonds and more recently in the form of direct investment from Chinese companies into the United States.So does a trade deficit mean fewer jobs? It depends on which force is more economically powerful: fewer jobs creating exports or investment dollars flowing into the country.It depends on what the country does with the investment that comes in.In theory, that money could go toward long-lasting investments with positive economic returns: new factories and equipment; education for the work force; and new roads and bridges, or repairs and improvements to existing ones.Unfortunately, how countries use these capital inflows is not always so good. In the United States, the influx of foreign capital in the mid-2000s went in large part to fuel an unsustainable housing and mortgage bubble. Greece\u2019s capital inflows in the same time period went to fund bloated public spending.When the world is flinging money at you, it\u2019s important to use it for something productive. It\u2019s not that trade deficits (and the capital inflows that are their flip side) don\u2019t matter \u2014 but just knowing the numbers doesn\u2019t tell you much about whether they are good, bad or indifferent.It\u2019s not clear that that\u2019s even an option, because the dollar isn\u2019t used just in trade between the United States and other countries.The dollar is a global reserve currency, meaning that it is used around the world in transactions that have nothing to do with the United States. When a Malaysian company does business with a German company, in many cases it will do business in dollars; when wealthy people in Dubai or Singapore\u2019s government investment fund want to sock away money, they do so in large part in dollar assets.That creates upward pressure on the dollar for reasons unrelated to trade flows between the United States and its partners. That, in turn, makes the dollar stronger, and American exporters less competitive, than they would be in a world where nobody used the dollar for anything except commerce involving the United States.The roughly $500 billion trade deficit that the United States runs each year isn\u2019t just about poorly negotiated trade deals and currency manipulation by this or that country. It\u2019s also, to some degree, a byproduct of the central role the United States plays in the global financial system.There\u2019s even a name for this: the Triffin dilemma. In the mid-20th century, the economist Robert Triffin warned that the provider of the global reserve currency would need to run perpetual trade deficits to keep the world financial system from freezing, with those trade deficits potentially fueling domestic booms and busts.The key idea is that if a President Trump or any other future leader really wants to reduce our trade deficits in a major way, that leader is going to have to rethink the very underpinnings of global finance.Be careful what you wish for.There\u2019s no doubt that maintaining the global reserve currency creates costs for the United States, namely a less competitive export industry.But it also creates a lot of advantages. Lower interest rates and higher stock prices are among them (though they have the downside of also feeding debt-driven booms and busts). Even more important is what the dollar\u2019s prominence in global finance does for America\u2019s place in the world.It helps ensure that the United States can afford to finance wars, and it gives the government greater ability to fight recessions and panics. A country experiencing a banking panic will see money sent out of the country, causing its currency to fall and its interest rates to rise. All that limits a government\u2019s options for fixing the problem. In 2008, when the United States experienced a near collapse of the banking system, the opposite happened.The centrality of the dollar to global finance gives the United States power on the global stage that no other country can match. It has enforced sanctions on Iran, Russia, North Korea and terrorist groups with the implicit threat of cutting off access to the dollar payments system for any bank in the world that does not cooperate with American foreign policy.Part of what makes the United States powerful is the great importance of the dollar to global finance. And part of the price the United States pays for that status is a stronger currency and higher trade deficits than would be the case otherwise.The debate over the trade deficit is about more than Mexico and China, cars and bananas, or winning and losing. It\u2019s about what makes America great, and which of the country\u2019s priorities should come first.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "China Weighs Letting Banks Sell Bad Debt to Investors", "Date": "2016-03-12", "News": "Supported byBEIJING \u2014 China is exploring a new way to grapple with its mounting pile of bad corporate debt, though its top central banker sought on Saturday to dispel worries that the plan would simply shift the burden to other parts of the country\u2019s vast economy.Under the tentative proposal, Chinese officials would allow banks saddled with growing quantities of bad loans to sell that debt to investors, said Zhou Xiaochuan, the governor of the People\u2019s Bank of China. The goal is to help alleviate one of the major drags on China\u2019s economy, the world\u2019s second largest after the United States\u2019 and a major driver of global growth.But Mr. Zhou and a deputy central bank governor, Pan Gongsheng, said they would take steps to make sure the effort did not create the kind of risk-laden financial products that played a major role in the 2008 global financial crisis. The effort would be modest, regulators would monitor it closely, and mom-and-pop investors would be kept out, they said.\u201cThere\u2019s no need to exaggerate,\u201d Mr. Zhou said at a news conference held as part of China\u2019s annual legislative session in Beijing. \u201cThere\u2019s not certainty that this would be a very big market.\u201dThat lending spree has also led to a major surplus of Chinese steel factories, glassworks and other industrial facilities, dragging down China\u2019s economic performance to its slowest rate in 25 years and casting a pall over the broader global outlook.On paper, China\u2019s banks have some of the world\u2019s lowest loan default rates. But economists inside and outside the country say many banks \u2014 in a practice known as \u201cextend and pretend\u201d \u2014 do not force companies to pay up or restructure, putting off the problem. That raises concerns that China\u2019s big banks could have considerable amounts of bad loans on their books.Some experts are skeptical that such a program would resolve the problem. \u201cUsing shares to pay overdue loans could help banks temporarily shore up their balance sheets, but it could cause greater difficulties down the road,\u201d said Ning Zhu, a finance professor at the Shanghai Advanced Institute of Finance.\u201cBanks are positive about securitization,\u201d Mr. Zhou said. \u201cIf some assets can be packaged and sold off, they can adjust their balance sheets.\u201d He said that because the loans sold off would be troubled, they would fetch prices below their face value.Mr. Zhou and Mr. Pan stressed that the program would be modest at first and absorb lessons from the 2008 financial crisis. China\u2019s new debt products would be kept simple, Mr. Pan said.\u201cThis is just a pilot,\u201d Mr. Pan said. \u201cWe\u2019ve selected a small number of major financial institutions with quite high management standards to develop trials, and the credit involved in the initial trials is not large.\u201dShang Fulin, the head of the China Banking Regulatory Commission, said at a separate news conference on Saturday that the trial effort to sell off bad debt was needed to ensure that more bank loans flowed into supporting the real economy, rather than turning over old loans.\u201cOur total volume of loans is quite adequate, but the speed of turnover of loans has been falling year after year,\u201d Mr. Shang said.Keith Bradsher contributed reporting from Hong Kong.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Cruz, Rubio and Sanders Plan Their Next Moves to Close Rivals\u2019 Leads", "Date": "2016-03-02", "News": "Supported byHere is how they all plan to forge ahead:It did not quite happen that way.By holding on to his home state of Texas and winning Oklahoma, Mr. Cruz was, as of 10 p.m. Tuesday, the only candidate who had beaten Mr. Trump, furthering his argument that no one else can.For days, Mr. Cruz has dispensed with any pretense that he can rise above Mr. Trump in a fractured field. It must be one-on-one, his team says, and it must happen soon.Accordingly, Mr. Cruz plans to hammer Senator Marco Rubio of Florida as an obstacle for conservatives hoping to take down Mr. Trump, reminding voters that to win, one has to eventually win.\u201cA campaign sticking around when you can\u2019t win a state and you\u2019re not amassing delegates \u2014 that doesn\u2019t stop Donald Trump,\u201d Mr. Cruz told reporters this week, dismissing the suggestion of a contested convention, which Mr. Rubio views as a path to the nomination.It could be a difficult sell for Mr. Cruz, considering some in the Republican establishment view him just as warily as they view Mr. Trump.Regardless, Mr. Cruz is positioned to build at least a modest delegate lead over his non-Trump rivals, leaning on a formidable war chest and sprawling field operations across the electoral map. This is a campaign, after all, with a Guam chairman.An exit from Ben Carson, who has siphoned some evangelical support from Mr. Cruz, would not hurt, either.For now, Mr. Cruz is setting his sights on Kansas, Louisiana and Maine, which hold their voting contests on Saturday. His first post-Super Tuesday event will be held in Kansas on Wednesday.Other potential targets, like Mississippi, loom next Tuesday, and Mr. Cruz\u2019s team has cast an eye toward North Carolina and Missouri on March 15. Even in defeat, Cruz allies think both can be delegate mines because of allocation rules.Indeed, the most important state on the map for Mr. Cruz this month might be one few expect him to win: Florida \u2014 the site of Mr. Rubio\u2019s potential last stand. Mr. Cruz is expected to campaign aggressively in the state, particularly if Mr. Rubio appears weakened after a fresh string of defeats.Mr. Cruz\u2019s team believes the field must narrow to two, for all practical purposes, before the end of March. A loss by Mr. Rubio in Florida could seal his fate.And after another string of second- and third-place finishes on Tuesday night, Mr. Rubio needs that to be true now more than ever.No longer are his supporters arguing that a victory in Ohio on that day is plausible. They speak with growing frustration about Gov. John Kasich\u2019s insistence that he will stay in the race until the primary there and beyond. In their view, Mr. Kasich cost them Virginia on Tuesday.And they are openly discussing the likelihood of a fight at the convention to deny Donald J. Trump the nomination.Mr. Rubio, speaking in English and Spanish to a roaring hometown crowd of several thousand in Miami, vowed not to let the Republican Party fall into Mr. Trump\u2019s hands.\u201cDo not give in to the fear, do not give in to anger, do not give in to sham artists and con artists who try to take advantage of your suffering,\u201d he said. \u201cI will campaign as long as it takes and wherever it takes to ensure that I am the next president of the United States.\u201dWhile there are a handful of states that Mr. Rubio believes he can do well in over the next two weeks \u2014 Illinois, Missouri, Michigan \u2014 Florida is the most vital to his survival.He has opened six offices across the state. He has shipped campaign operatives in from the early caucus and primary states where he built ground operations. He hopes to pick up what could be a few meaningful endorsements from Floridians like Jeb Bush, the former governor whose campaign recently ended.A loss would be much more than the symbolic gut punch of losing your home state. Since it is a winner-take-all contest, it would deny Mr. Rubio the 99 delegates he needs to remain a legitimate contender.His performance in the race should not be a matter of not having the financing. His campaign has reported raising plenty of money since his second-place finish in South Carolina.But Mr. Sanders, unable to convince many Southern voters to back him, will face a tough road as he tries to close Hillary Clinton\u2019s growing delegate lead.Tad Devine, Mr. Sanders\u2019s senior campaign adviser, said the senator and his top staff were meeting on Tuesday to decide how best to allocate their money. The campaign said it had raised more than $42 million in February. It did not say how much cash it had left after its February expenses, but Mr. Sanders has said that he has the money to fight on.\u201cIf we have more momentum coming out of today, we are likely to be more aggressive in terms of resource deployment,\u201d Mr. Devine said before the early results came in, showing Mr. Sanders winning only Vermont and Oklahoma. \u201cIf we feel that Secretary Clinton\u2019s momentum is still substantial, then we may be more defined in terms of where we deploy those resources.\u201dJeff Weaver, Mr. Sanders\u2019s campaign manager, said the campaign would consider running television ads in Maine, Kansas and Nebraska, where caucuses are being held this weekend, and Ohio, which votes on March 15 and has the third-largest number of delegates in play, after Florida and Illinois. It has also been running ads in Michigan, the biggest state voting on March 8, and on black radio stations in several states.Mr. Weaver said that Mr. Sanders will seek to broaden his support among black voters in the Midwest \u2014 something he failed to do in South Carolina and on Super Tuesday \u2014 by tying Mrs. Clinton\u2019s stances on trade policies to the unemployment rates in once-prosperous industrial cities.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Learning Lessons From Outrage", "Date": "2016-03-21", "News": "Supported byThere is so much we have learned from this painful election season and the rise of a demagogic real estate developer.We have learned that a human branding machine who grew up in the shadows and spotlight of New York City\u2019s cutthroat media knows intuitively how to exploit that media.We have learned that too many in the media are ever so willing to be exploited if the exploitation is mutual and money is to be made.We have learned what conditions make the prime environment for the rise of a demagogue: disaffection, demographic change, the demise of hope and opportunity and the dislocation of traditional power and privilege from automatic inheritance of prosperity.We have seen that divisive, dangerous leaders don\u2019t necessarily rise because of stirring oration or a clear and compelling vision. They can be quirky, disarming and idiosyncratic, with a vague, hollow message that says little even as it promises much.We have learned the dangers of doubting the depravity and desperation of some who would follow such a man despite, or possibly even because of, his offensive rhetoric and outrageous policies.We have learned just how much ugliness exists in this country, and what it looks like when it finds a voice, a leader and a reason to gather and unite.We have learned that the Republican establishment has no clue who the Republican base is anymore, or if they do, they thought wrongly that they could control them by feeding them crumbs of obstruction and vague aspirationalism from their table of excess. In fact, that base has been gorging itself on fear and anger, vileness and the possibility of violence.\u201cRepublicans didn\u2019t listen,\u201d says Luntz. \u201cThey didn\u2019t hear the anger because they spent too much time in Washington and not enough in the rest of America. The Republican finance people, the donor class, they didn\u2019t see it and didn\u2019t hear it, and by the time they did, it was too late.\u201d Luntz compared it to a horror film: \u201cYou know something\u2019s out there, but you don\u2019t see it until you\u2019re getting stabbed.\u201dWhen you compare your own base to the killer in a slasher flick, you know you have a problem.We have learned what it looks like when a party eventually wakes up to itself being overtaken and undone and throws itself into convulsions to rescue itself from a creature of its own creation.The article continued, saying that \u201can effort to block him would rely on an array of desperation measures, the political equivalent of guerrilla fighting.\u201d It\u2019s war.But for all those looking on in horror and disbelief, I hope that we have learned something else, something great.I hope that we learn to constantly center the ideal at that core of the current offense: enlightenment, equality and idealism.I hope that we learn that progress is not an unfailingly upward, inexorably positive movement, but an awkward and clumsy dance in which we lurch forward three steps and stumble back two.I hope we learn that citizenship and comfort in a free society is not free. It comes at a cost. You must work to grow and maintain our liberty, because there are forces that would undo and dismantle those liberties. We must stay awake and engaged, informed and involved if we are to continue to move out of darkness and into light.I hope we learn that if one is not actively working to dismantle oppressive forces and inclinations in oneself and in society, one\u2019s silence and inaction provide support for their continuation and prosperity.Inertia is no respecter of ideology. It can move right just as easily as it can move left. It can move toward the better just as easily as toward the worse.There is no moment in a republic when there is a lull in the fight. The battles always rage. The enemy stays busy. Nothing that is won stays won without vigilant protection. We, as a country, again find ourselves standing at the precipice, staring into the darkness of the void, and we must fight our way back from it.And this is not just about being against the real estate developer. It\u2019s more. It\u2019s about being for something: nobility, honor and character, righteousness, civility and togetherness. We have to decide who we are as a country, not as an opposition force but as a positive, proactive force, and use all levers of power to which we have access to bring our vision of America into reality.The rise of the real estate developer has drawn into sharp relief the idea that doing nothing and expecting to preserve or extend progress isn\u2019t an option.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Starwood Bidding War Escalates With Higher Offer", "Date": "2016-03-28", "News": "Supported byStarwood declared Monday that Anbang\u2019s latest offer was \u201creasonably likely to lead to a \u2018superior offer,\u2019 \u201d paving the way for Starwood to break its agreement with Marriott.The bidding war \u2014 the most prominent so far this year \u2014 pits Marriott, the nearly century-old hotelier, against Anbang, a Beijing-based insurer that already owns the Waldorf Astoria and the JW Marriott Essex House hotels in Manhattan.Combining Marriott and Starwood would create the biggest hotel company in the world, with more than 5,500 owned or franchised hotels and 1.1 million rooms.But Anbang has close ties to the Chinese government, potentially furnishing the insurer with huge sums of cash.In a statement, Starwood said that the Anbang group had offered $81 a share on Saturday, and then the current $82.75 after talks between the two sides began.Both offers would supplement Starwood\u2019s plan to sell its time share business to the Interval Leisure Group, an all-stock transaction that is valued at about $5.91 a share, based on Thursday\u2019s closing prices.Analysts have said that Marriott will be hard-pressed to raise its offer to win the battle, since raising the cash portion of its offer could threaten its investment-grade rating. Adding more stock as consideration could harm its earnings per share.\u201cWe do not believe Marriott is willing to incur earnings dilution to facilitate the transaction,\u201d analysts at Wells Fargo wrote in a research note on Monday.That has left Marriott raising concerns about the certainty of Anbang\u2019s offer. In its statement on Monday, Marriott questioned whether the Chinese insurer truly had the financing necessary to close that deal, and how long American government regulators would drag out their inquiries into the transaction.Of particular concern, Marriott is likely to note, is how critically a government panel focused on the national security aspect of mergers will look at an Anbang-led takeover. Marriott could argue that the proximity of Starwood properties near sensitive locations such as government offices and military bases could force divestitures, pushing back the closing of a deal.Shares in Starwood were up more than 2 percent Monday afternoon, to $83.94, suggesting that investors expected further escalation. Shares in Marriott were up 4 percent, to $71.40.An earlier version of this article misspelled the name of a hotel chain operated by Starwood. It is Westin, not Weston.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Taunt From Dimon That Wells Fargo Would Be Reckless to Heed", "Date": "2016-03-01", "News": "Supported byBreakingviewsIt sounds as if Jamie Dimon has been brushing up on his Sun Tzu.Wells Fargo, based in San Francisco, has a generally narrower focus on home buyers and corporate borrowers in the United States, which appeals to investors these days. Simplicity has trumped sprawl and riskier operations like bond trading since the financial crisis. JPMorgan trades at 90 percent of its expected 2016 book value, according to estimates culled by Reuters Eikon, but the larger Wells Fargo fetches a multiple of 1.3 times.Mr. Dimon gives the impression that he is both impressed by and fearful of Wells Fargo\u2019s slow and steady rise in corporate finance. Though it is not top five in any broad market category, Mr. Stumpf\u2019s bank claimed 2.5 percent of the industry\u2019s global fees last year, as tallied by Thomson Reuters. That\u2019s a far cry from JPMorgan\u2019s leading 6.9 percent, but it put Wells Fargo ahead of the likes of UBS and Lazard, mainly on the back of selling bonds and syndicating loans for clients.Notwithstanding concerns from regulators, there would probably be some willing sellers of investment banking operations. Barclays, Credit Suisse and Deutsche Bank are struggling to develop profitable strategies in the new capital-intensive world order. Mr. Dimon may be theoretically correct in saying that top clients operate globally, and that Wells Fargo could chase them across oceans with an acquisition leveraging its corporate relationships and lower cost of capital.History suggests that kind of derring-do is fraught with danger, however. It would be uncharacteristic for Wells Fargo, and would undoubtedly spook its shareholders, including Warren E. Buffett\u2019s Berkshire Hathaway. Mr. Stumpf will be familiar with Mr. Buffett\u2019s aversion to investment banking. Such a bold move would distract Wells Fargo from the traditional lending at which it excels and developing the technology needed to attract a new generation of customers.Surely, Mr. Dimon would not want any of that to happen.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Myanmar Approves Cabinet Nominees, but Some Face Questions Over Credentials", "Date": "2016-03-24", "News": "Supported byYANGON, Myanmar \u2014 Myanmar\u2019s Parliament approved a slate of cabinet nominees on Thursday, including two officials with dubious academic degrees on their r\u00e9sum\u00e9s, raising questions about the credibility of the country\u2019s new government before it comes to power next week.Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, the leader of the nation\u2019s pro-democracy movement, was the only woman among the 18 nominees. She is expected to take four cabinet posts, including that of foreign minister, ensuring that she will have a powerful role in governing the country, despite being unable to assume the presidency.Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi\u2019s party, the National League for Democracy, won a landslide victory in November in elections that were the freest in decades. She is barred from the presidency by a clause in the Constitution that prohibits people with foreign relatives from holding the post; her two sons are British.But she has carved out broad responsibilities as the likely head of the ministries of foreign affairs, education, energy and the presidential office. The president-elect, U Htin Kyaw, is an ally of Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi, and she has said her authority will supersede his.Mr. Kyaw Win is an economic adviser to the National League for Democracy who was formerly a longtime employee of the Ministry of National Planning and Finance. Despite the revelations about his academic background, his nomination was approved on Thursday.He now acknowledges that the degrees were not legitimate. \u201cNow I am ashamed to call myself a Ph.D.,\u201d he has said. \u201cEverything I have tried has now become water in the desert\u201d \u2014 a mirage.Another likely cabinet member, U Than Myint, has said he has a master\u2019s and a doctorate from Pacific Western University, an unaccredited correspondence school. Mr. Than Myint, who worked with the Ministry of National Planning and Finance before serving with the United Nations, has said subsequently that he does not believe he did anything wrong. He is expected to become the minister of commerce.The questions about these likely new ministers have provoked criticism from some of the same voters who overwhelmingly supported Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi\u2019s party at the polls last year.\u201cTo be frank, it\u2019s embarrassing,\u201d said Daw Sandi Sein Thein, 27, a technology entrepreneur in Yangon. \u201cI think the leaders don\u2019t need to lie just to impress people.\u201dU Yan Myo Thein, a well-known political commentator in Yangon, said he thought the nominees whose academic records had been questioned should step away from the process \u201cto save the image of the new government\u201d during the delicate transition period.\u201cThe scandals indicate the lack of transparency and accountability in forming a new government led by Daw Aung San Suu Kyi,\u201d he said.The National League for Democracy holds about 60 percent of the votes in both houses of Parliament, which approved all 18 nominees without objection on Thursday.U Zaw Myint Maung, a spokesman for the National League for Democracy, defended Mr. Kyaw Win and Mr. Than Myint.\u201cI want to say my men are honest,\u201d he said.Wai Moe reported from Yangon, and Austin Ramzy from Hong Kong.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "$2 Billion Worth of Free Media for Donald Trump", "Date": "2016-03-15", "News": "Supported byThe 2016 RaceOf all the ways Donald Trump has shocked the political system, one of the most significant is how he wins primary after primary with one of the smallest campaign budgets.He still doesn\u2019t have a super PAC. He skimped on ground organization and field offices. Most important, he spent less on television advertising \u2014 typically the single biggest expenditure for a campaign \u2014 than any other major candidate, according to an analysis by SMG Delta, a firm that tracks television advertising.But Mr. Trump is hardly absent from the airwaves. Like all candidates, he benefits from what is known as earned media: news and commentary about his campaign on television, in newspapers and magazines, and on social media. Earned media typically dwarfs paid media in a campaign. The big difference between Mr. Trump and other candidates is that he is far better than any other candidate \u2014 maybe than any candidate ever \u2014 at earning media.No one knows this better than mediaQuant, a firm that tracks media coverage of each candidate and computes a dollar value based on advertising rates. The mentions are weighted by the reach of the media source, meaning how many people were likely to see it. The calculation also includes traditional media of all types, print, broadcast or otherwise, as well as online-only sources like Facebook, Twitter or Reddit.Mr. Trump earned $400 million worth of free media last month, about what John McCain spent on his entire 2008 presidential campaign. Paul Senatori, mediaQuant\u2019s chief analytics officer, says that Mr. Trump \u201chas no weakness in any of the media segments\u201d \u2014 in other words, he is strong in every type of earned media, from television to Twitter.Over the course of the campaign, he has earned close to $2 billion worth of media attention, about twice the all-in price of the most expensive presidential campaigns in history. It is also twice the estimated $746 million that Hillary Clinton, the next best at earning media, took in. Senator Bernie Sanders has earned more media than any of the Republicans except Mr. Trump.Of course, as Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Trump would probably attest, not all media attention is positive. (Mrs. Clinton\u2019s mentions, for example, would include news coverage of congressional hearings on Benghazi; Mr. Trump\u2019s will eventually include articles about violence and fights at his campaign rallies.)The mediaQuant model collects positive, neutral and negative media mentions alike. Mr. Senatori said negative media mentions are given somewhat less weight. The best way to think of the numbers, he said, is as a gauge of which candidates are \u201ctrending\u201d in the earned media market at any given time.The model shows different candidates trending at different times. In February, Senator Ted Cruz of Texas earned almost as much media coverage as Mrs. Clinton, and about as much as Mr. Trump earned last October.But Mr. Trump still dominates. In February, he earned as much media as Mr. Cruz and Mrs. Clinton combined.Advertisement"}

But given that it takes places upstairs from the actual ceremony, there was no time to change.

How will you teach with this \u201crevolutionary musical about taking your shot, speaking your mind and turning the world upside down\u201d? Let us know. \u201cAlexander Hamilton,\u201d the opening number, performed at the 2016 Grammy Awards.Overview: \u201cA Story About America Then, Told by America Now\u201dThe genesis of \u00e2\u0080\u0098\u00e2\u0080\u0098Hamilton\u00e2\u0080\u0099\u00e2\u0080\u0099 has already entered theatrical lore. While on vacation in Mexico in 2008, Miranda cracked Ron Chernow\u00e2\u0080\u0099s doorstop biography, \u00e2\u0080\u0098\u00e2\u0080\u0098Alexander Hamilton,\u00e2\u0080\u0099\u00e2\u0080\u0099 which was nominated in 2004 for the National Book Critics Circle Award and won the George Washington Book Prize. A few dozen pages in, Miranda\u00e2\u0080\u0099s new project began leaping to life. In Hamilton, he saw a figure he recognized: a word-drunk firebrand with untrammeled ambition, raw talent, an outsize ego and a lust for combat, verbal and otherwise. Miranda saw a rapper.Mr. Miranda first performed \u201cAlexander Hamilton,\u201d the song that would go on to open the musical, at the White House in 2009.  Sung by Aaron Burr, the song begins:Ms. Rosen writes:The question is a good one. How exactly did Hamilton rise from the deprivations of his childhood in the island backwater of St. Croix to become a storied founding father: an aide-de-camp of Gen. George Washington, the prime mover in the creation of the United States financial system, the first secretary of the Treasury, the author of nearly half of the Federalist Papers, the subject of America\u00e2\u0080\u0099s first political sex scandal, the bane and bugbear of everyone from Burr to Thomas Jefferson and James Madison? But it is the manner in which \u00e2\u0080\u0098\u00e2\u0080\u0098Hamilton\u00e2\u0080\u0099\u00e2\u0080\u0099 poses this question \u00e2\u0080\u0094 in the emphatic cadences of rap, with witty rhymes pouring out over a tolling beat \u00e2\u0080\u0094 that has been electrifying audiences since January, when the show debuted Off Broadway at New York\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Public Theater.\nMr. Miranda says that \u201cHamilton\u201d is \u201ca story about America then, told by America now.\u201d  The \u201cbeef\u201d Hamilton and Jefferson had then are debates we\u2019re still having today. How many connections to our world can your students make as they read, watch and listen?Below, a few ideas to help.Ideas for History, Civics and Social Studies Teachers:Getting to Know the CharactersRon Chernow, who wrote the biography that inspired \u201cHamilton,\u201d discusses the similarities between Washington and Hamilton.\u201cHamilton\u201d takes the dull, virtuous characters students know from history textbooks and reveals them to be complex, contradictory flesh-and-blood human beings.  Hamilton was not only the most brilliant of the Founders, but also the most flamboyant. An orphan raised in the West Indies, he was the only self-made man in a galaxy of patricians. His adulterous affair with Maria Reynolds produced the first great sex scandal in American politics.Then they might \u2026\u2013 Compile a list of the top 10 most interesting facts about this person \u00e2\u0080\u0094 with, of course, proper source-citation.\u2013 Or read on to use some of the other ideas in this post, from rap battles to social-media profiles to their own artistic interpretations of history in the genre of their choice.On a basic level, the American Revolution was driven by words: fiery statements of principle; charges of imperialist oppression; accusations of betrayal; fine points of governance; even wordy obfuscations to gloss over disagreements that could have sabotaged the country at its start. What better musical genre to tell this tale?Here is a selection from the battle:Jefferson:Digging into the Federalist PapersAfter gaining independence from the British in the American Revolution, the young United States adopted the Articles of Confederation to set up its new government. By design, the central government was very weak. After all, the people desperately did not want another King George.But was the new national government too weak? The founding fathers thought so \u2014 and so they met in Philadelphia in the summer of 1787 and drafted a new Constitution that would set up a new framework for a stronger government.Just because they wrote it, though, did not mean the country would adopt it. So Alexander Hamilton, along with James Madison and John Jay, rallied to the cause. In the musical, Hamilton asks Burr to help him write the Federalist Papers, but Burr declines, even as Hamilton argues:What did Hamilton and the other founding fathers write in the 85 Federalists Papers? What arguments did they make in favor of the Constitution? And what was the response from anti-Federalists, the founding fathers who vocalized their concerns with the Constitution?Here are a few possible pairings. We\u2019d love to add more, so please suggest your ideas in the comments.Taking Creative License With HistoryAs Lin-Manuel Miranda says in the video above, some of his choices for the musical are not historically accurate, but made the story stronger dramatically. He also points out that the way \u201chistory\u201d is told depends on who is telling the story. Invite your students to think about questions of historical accuracy and artistic license through exercises like the following:\u2013 What works of art \u00e2\u0080\u0094 whether literature, film, theater or visual arts \u00e2\u0080\u0094 drawn from real events in history or the lives of real people, do you especially admire? How have they shaped how you view that person, time or place? Where and how was creative license taken? Did it strengthen or weaken the work? Why? \u2013 What event in American history would you like to use as inspiration for your own creative piece? What would you do with it? Would you write a scene from a musical or novel, paint a picture, make a video or create a poem? To what extent would you need to take creative license with the facts? Why? \u201cHamilton\u201d and Politics TodayIn one scene Hamilton drops a thick batch of papers several feet to the floor, a screed against John Adams that lands like a punch \u00e2\u0080\u0094 a moment that mirrors Senator Lindsey Graham\u00e2\u0080\u0099s dropping his cellphone from a roof, in a recent video, to mock his rival Mr. Trump for giving out his number. (In another video, Rand Paul takes a chain saw to a stack of papers meant to be the federal tax code.) Ted Cruz, Mike Huckabee, Rick Perry and Mr. Trump have also embraced a call-it-as-I-see-it style of attack that calls to mind one of Hamilton\u00e2\u0080\u0099s slaps at Jefferson: \u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd another thing, Mr. Age of Enlightenment, don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t lecture me about the war, you didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t fight in it.\u00e2\u0080\u009dAt times it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s today\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Republicans who seem more in tune with the blunt Hamilton and bombastic Jefferson of the musical. By contrast the leading Democratic candidate in the 2016 race, Hillary Rodham Clinton, occasionally seems like a kindred spirit of Aaron Burr, the Hamilton nemesis who would probably approve of Mrs. Clinton\u00e2\u0080\u0099s refusals to take a stand on the Keystone XL pipeline and the Pacific trade deal. As Burr puts it in one song:How are the same things at issue?  Who do the characters in \u201cHamilton\u201d remind you of today? What might politicians learn from the show?  And finally, a possible class debate topic: Were partisan politics nastier then or now?The Effects of Nonwhite Casting The founding fathers were white, and many owned black slaves. The cast of \u00e2\u0080\u009cHamilton\u00e2\u0080\u009d is mostly nonwhite. Can you tell me about your thinking as you wrote and cast the show? Odom Jr.:  In the first two minutes of this show, Lin steps forward and introduces himself as Alexander Hamilton, and Chris steps forward and says he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s George Washington, and you never question it again. When I think about what it would mean to me as a 13-, 14-year-old kid, to get this album or see this show \u00e2\u0080\u0094 it can make me very emotional. And I so look forward to the day I get to see an Asian-American Burr. Miranda: That\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be the note that goes with the school productions: If this show ends up looking like the actual founding fathers, you messed up.What classic films, television shows or works of theater might change in interesting and important ways if cast differently than they were originally? How? Burr vs. HamiltonWe stop the press to announce the melancholy intelligence that Gen. Hamilton is dead. He expired about 2:30 o\u2019clock.Who was Aaron Burr? How were he and Hamilton both alike and different? Watch the video above and read the book review to begin answering those questions. How does Mr. Miranda play up their contrasts while exploring the complexities of their relationship?What do you learn from this piece about how Americans viewed Hamilton and Burr in their time? One hundred years later?Immigrants/We get the job doneThe ensemble sings:I didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know Hamilton was an immigrant, and I didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know half of the traumas of his early life. And when he gets to New York, I was like, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI know this guy.\u00e2\u0080\u009d I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve met so many versions of this guy, and it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the guy who comes to this country and is like, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI am going to work six jobs if you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re only working one. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m gonna make a life for myself here.\u00e2\u0080\u009d That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a familiar story line to me, beginning with my father and so many people I grew up with in my neighborhood. So \u2026 every play or work of fiction kind of has to start with you identifying a character and saying, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI know this guy. I could write that guy.\u00e2\u0080\u009d And I kind of ran with that.He points out that right now \u201cimmigrant is used as a dirty word by politicians to get cheap political points.\u201d Go through The Times to find stories about immigrants today that fit the description of the immigrant spirit that Lin-Manuel Miranda describes and \u201cHamilton\u201d illustrates. How are they lending their energy and talents to our nation?Behind Every Great Man Is a Great WomanWhile most students are aware of Aaron Burr and Alexander Hamilton thanks to American history class, they are less aware of the women who also played a role in the revolution.

Encourage them to research the women who don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t often receive credit for the work they do \u00e2\u0080\u0094 women like Elizabeth Schuyler.

What words do they need to look up?  Can they figure out the meanings based on the context?  What language and rhymes do they especially admire? What are your student\u2019s favorite lines? Why? One of the reasons Shakespeare stands above his contemporaries is that he had such a great ear. His characters have individual voices. They don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t all speak in the same patterns, but rather, he defines each speaker by particular quirks and habits \u00e2\u0080\u0094 just as we speak in everyday life. Miranda does the same thing.Read the post to learn how \u201canyone who can understand and enjoy Hamilton can understand and enjoy Shakespeare,\u201d and to see the writer\u2019s analysis of rhetorical patterns in songs like  \u00e2\u0080\u009cStay Alive\u00e2\u0080\u009d  and \u201cSatisfied.\u201d After students have identified the techniques in \u201cHamilton,\u201d ask them to look for similar uses in Shakespeare. What do the two have in common? Lin Manuel-Miranda\u2019s Musical InfluencesThe 35-year-old son of Puerto Rican parents, raised in a heavily Hispanic neighborhood of northern Manhattan and educated at a public school for gifted children on the Upper East Side, Mr. Miranda is an exuberant fanboy who happily tweets mash-ups of lyrics from Drake and \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe Little Mermaid,\u00e2\u0080\u009d knowing that almost no one will get the joke.He recognized early that hip-hop and show tunes, even with their different sounds and audiences, share an emphasis on storytelling \u00e2\u0080\u0094 both musical styles are animated by lyrics that advance narrative, and that understanding shaped \u00e2\u0080\u009cHamilton,\u00e2\u0080\u009d which he conceived, wrote the music and lyrics for, and stars in.Latin music was big in the Miranda home, in Inwood, and in Puerto Rico, where Mr. Miranda spent his summers. But rap and hip-hop were woven into his childhood as well.Hip-Hop History and \u201cHamilton\u201d\u00e2\u0080\u009cBy the second chapter, I was like, \u00e2\u0080\u0098I know this guy,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 \u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Miranda said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cJust the hustle and ambition it took to get him off the island \u00e2\u0080\u0094 this is a guy who wrote his way out of his circumstances from the get-go. That is part and parcel with the hip-hop narrative: writing your way out of your circumstances, writing the future you want to see for yourself. This is a guy who wrote at 14, \u00e2\u0080\u0098I wish there was a war.\u00e2\u0080\u0099 It doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t get more hip-hop than that.\u00e2\u0080\u009dHip-hop is a native tongue to him, but he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s putting it in service of the musical. His hip-hop references are expedient first, winks to those in the know second, and true to the genre\u00e2\u0080\u0099s tenets last. There is a nerd instinct in hip-hop, particularly lyrically minded hip-hop \u00e2\u0080\u0094 it can be collegiate at times. What inspires Miranda is assonance, polysyllabic rhyme, cramming bars full of detail. He\u00e2\u0080\u0099s also someone who understands rapping as a game of one-upmanship \u00e2\u0080\u0094 hence the pair of scenes in which Hamilton and Thomas Jefferson face off, which could have come from \u00e2\u0080\u009c8 Mile\u00e2\u0080\u009d or Scribble Jam.Mr. Caramanica goes on to cite references to Mobb Deep, LL Cool J, Jay Z, and, as he says: Biggie, Biggie, Biggie. For a certain stripe of hip-hop fan, Biggie is the ne plus ultra. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve got all of \u00e2\u0080\u009cReady to Die\u00e2\u0080\u009d and \u00e2\u0080\u009cLife After Death\u00e2\u0080\u009d committed to memory, and I suspect Miranda does, too. \u00e2\u0080\u009c10 Duel Commandments\u00e2\u0080\u009d is, natch, a remake of \u00e2\u0080\u009c10 Crack Commandments,\u00e2\u0080\u009d with its same blend of horror and pathos. And the \u00e2\u0080\u009cif you don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know, now you know\u00e2\u0080\u009d Jefferson drops in \u00e2\u0080\u009cCabinet Battle No. 2\u00e2\u0080\u009d is straight out of \u00e2\u0080\u009cJuicy.\u00e2\u0080\u009dThe piece then points out:Likewise, anyone who follows Mr. Miranda\u00e2\u0080\u0099s lively Twitter feed knows all about his 3-month-old son, his obsession with \u00e2\u0080\u009cLes Mis\u00c3\u00a9rables\u00e2\u0080\u009d and the roster of celebrities and friends seeing his show on a given night. Before lunch, Mr. Miranda tweeted a photo of himself working on his laptop at the tavern, a Revolutionary War haunt of Hamilton\u00e2\u0080\u0099s and Burr\u00e2\u0080\u0099s, and the place where George Washington held a farewell dinner for his officers.Invite students to take the historical or literary figure of their choice \u00e2\u0080\u0094 whether Alexander Hamilton or Katniss Everdeen \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and imagine what his or her social media presence might look like. What would their bios read? What images and status updates would they post? Whom would they follow, friend, retweet or repost? Why? Who Lives, Who Dies, Who Tells Your Story?But the boldest stroke in Miranda\u00e2\u0080\u0099s musical is that he takes on the whole life \u00e2\u0080\u0094 every significant episode. He shows how the active life is inevitably an accumulation of battles, setbacks, bruises, scars, victories and humiliating defeats.He ends the column this way:America changes color and shape, but the spirit Hamilton helped bring to the country still lives. I suspect many people will leave the theater wondering if their own dreams and lives are bold enough, if their own lives could someday be so astounding.\u201c\u00e2\u0080\u0098We could all be dead tomorrow,\u00e2\u0080\u0099\u00e2\u0080\u0099 Miranda says. \u00e2\u0080\u0098\u00e2\u0080\u0098Who tells our story? Will it be told? We have no way of knowing. In essence, that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s what the show is about.'\u201d\u2026\u00e2\u0080\u0098\u00e2\u0080\u0098 \u00e2\u0080\u0098Who lives? Who dies? Who tells your story?\u00e2\u0080\u0099 It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a question for the characters on that stage, and it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s also a question for the audience. It leaves you reckoning with: Wait, who does tell my story? What am I doing with my life? I think that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s why, when I get emails about this show from people in the audience, they usually come at three in the morning. They\u00e2\u0080\u0099re dark-night-of-the-soul emails. Because it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a question we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re all grappling with.

{"Headline": "Why Trump Now?", "Date": "2016-03-01", "News": "Supported byThe economic forces driving this year\u2019s nomination contests have been at work for decades. Why did the dam break now?In other words, the economic basis for voter anger has been building over forty years. Starting in 2000, two related developments added to worsening conditions for the middle and working classes.After 2000, the middle class continued to shrink, but so did the percentage of households making $100,000 or more. The only group to grow larger after 2000 was households with incomes of $35,000 or less. Americans were moving down the ladder. (This downward shift can be seen in the other chart that accompanies this article.)If one had to project the impact of China\u2019s momentous economic reform for the U.S. labor market with nothing to go on other than a standard undergraduate economics textbook, one would predict large movements of workers between U.S. tradable industries (say, from apparel and furniture to pharmaceuticals and jet aircraft), limited reallocation of jobs from tradables to non-tradables, and no net impacts on U.S. aggregate employment. The reality of adjustment to the China shock has been far different. Employment has certainly fallen in U.S. industries most exposed to import competition. But so too has overall employment in local labor markets in which these industries were concentrated. Offsetting employment gains either in export-oriented tradables or in non-tradables have, for the most part, failed to materialize.High wage workers find it relatively easy to adjust and \u201cdo not experience an earnings loss,\u201d argue Autor and his colleagues. Low wage workers, in contrast, \u201csuffer large differential earnings loss, as they obtain lower earnings per year both while working at the initial firm and after relocating to new employers.\u201dThis is why Trump\u2019s charge that China has gotten the better of the United States has gained traction.The recipe for populism seems pretty clear: take a surge in manufacturing imports from China and continued automation in the US workplace and add a tepid macroeconomy. The result is a combustible stew sure to sour the stomach of party leaders nationwide.The widespread sense that all the elites in Washington and New York conspired to bail out the miscreants who caused the disaster and then gave them bonuses, while the rest of us lost our houses or saw their value, the biggest and often only asset of Americans, plummet, lost our jobs or saw them frozen and stagnant, and then saw gaping inequality grow even more, is just palpable.Voter anger was directed at two targets \u2014 the \u201cundeserving rich\u201d and the \u201cundeserving poor.\u201dThe 2010 election pattern was repeated in the 2014 midterms.Jared Bernstein, a senior fellow at the Center for Budget and Policy Priorities, described in blunt terms the consequences of disillusionment with old guard Republicans:The intersection of inequality driven by real wage/income stagnation and the fact that the folks perceived to have blown the damn economy up not only recovered first, but got government assistance in the form of bailouts to do so. If you\u2019re in the anxious middle and that doesn\u2019t deeply piss you off, you\u2019re an unusually forgiving person.In these circumstances, Bernstein wrote, the logic supporting the traditional Republican Party fell apart:The core theme of Republican establishment lore has been to demonize not unregulated finance or trade or inequality, but \u2018the other\u2019 \u2013 e.g., the immigrant or minority taking your job and claiming unneeded government support. And yet, none of their trickle down, deregulatory agenda helped ameliorate the problem at all. So they lost control.Just as animosity to Republican power brokers in Washington intensified, the Republican Party began to splinter.This election has demonstrated that there is no Republican Party organization, per se. The Republican Party exists as an array of allied groups, incumbent office holders, media organizations, and funding vehicles (e.g., SuperPACs, 501(c)(4)s, and the like). When people ask why the \u201cestablishment\u201d or \u201cthe party\u201d has not done anything to stop Trump, it is not exactly clear who they mean.The tragedy of the 2016 campaign is that Trump has mobilized a constituency with legitimate grievances on a fool\u2019s errand.If he is shoved out of the field somehow, his supporters will remain bitter and enraged, convinced that a self-serving and malign elite defeated their leader.If he prevails, a constituency that could force politicians to confront the problems of the working and middle class will waste its energies on a candidate incompetent to improve the lives of the credulous men and women lining up to support him.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Starwood Bidder Is a Reclusive Chinese Insurer With Opaque Backing", "Date": "2016-03-29", "News": "Supported byBut that is where the comparisons between Wu Xiaohui, the chairman of the Anbang Insurance Group of China, and Mr. Buffett come to a halt.Mr. Buffett is a public figure who built his fortune over decades. Mr. Wu avoids interviews. The fax number on his company\u2019s website connects to a dentist\u2019s office. And, unlike Mr. Buffett, whose net worth can be easily calculated, Mr. Wu\u2019s fortune is a cipher, lost in Anbang\u2019s labyrinthine shareholding structure made up of 37 interlocking holding companies.As the economy stumbles, individuals and companies are pulling money out of China en masse, leaving the government scrambling to limit the outflows.Anbang, founded only in 2004, exploded in size two years ago, as those same 37 companies poured billions of dollars into its coffers.\u201cAny time somebody in China magically snaps their fingers and has a lot of money, in this case a colossal amount of money, that sets off red flags for me,\u201d said Christopher Balding, associate professor of finance and economics at Peking University\u2019s campus in Shenzhen, a city in southern China. \u201cIt\u2019s in their interest to share information to say \u2018we come in peace,\u2019 but there\u2019s just not that culture of information-sharing. In China, when people are hiding this amount of information, it\u2019s for a reason.\u201dMr. Wu has links to some of the most powerful families in China. He married Zhuo Ran, the granddaughter of Deng Xiaoping, China\u2019s former paramount leader in the 1980s and much of the 1990s. That name, uncommon in Chinese, appears in corporate records tied to at least two of the 37 holding companies.Calls to Anbang\u2019s listed phone number were not answered. Nobody replied to a list of questions delivered to its Beijing headquarters, with its enormous lobby \u2014 the size of several basketball courts \u2014 and its large chandelier. An Anbang employee said the company did not answer media questions.Mr. Wu, 49, a native of the city of Wenzhou in eastern China\u2019s Zhejiang province, in rare public appearances talks of Anbang\u2019s ability to generate high returns from the companies it takes over and the benefits to its corporate culture of globalization.His exact holdings in Anbang are not clear. A close examination of Anbang\u2019s shareholding structure shows that the 37 companies control more than 93 percent of Anbang, while two Chinese state-owned companies own the rest. The 37 shareholders are linked by common phone numbers, email addresses and interlocking ownership, according to company records filed with the Chinese government and available online.For example, one Anbang shareholder \u2014 a coal mining company in China\u2019s western region of Xinjiang \u2014 is owned by another mining company, Zhongya Huajin, that listed a Zhuo Ran as its first legal representative, though that person has since resigned.Zhongya Huajin shares an official website address with a different Anbang shareholder, a Beijing real estate company. Collectively, those companies own nearly 4.6 billion shares of Anbang, or more than 7 percent. The companies could not be reached for comment, and their common website now contains only links to pornography and gambling services.Five shareholders list the same legal email address in government filings. Phones at those companies rang unanswered, and a message to that address was not returned.The companies injected billions of dollars in capital into Anbang in 2014, its documents show, increasing its registered capital fivefold from 2011 levels and making it bigger than any other Chinese insurance company. \u201cWarren Buffett got wealthy by growing a small insurance company into a behemoth,\u201d Mr. Balding said. \u201cThis is the exact opposite of that.\u201dCollectively, the group of 37 companies controls enough of Anbang to make any one person one of China\u2019s wealthiest individuals. Mr. Wu is not listed in the documents as a major shareholder, and he does not appear on wealth-tracking lists compiled by media companies.Chang Ping, a former news department director of the paper who was not employed by Southern Weekend at the time, said that the apology had been made \u201cunder pressure\u201d for political reasons.An article on Wednesday about the reclusive chairman of the Anbang Insurance Group of China, which has been pursuing deals for hotels and hotel chains in the United States, misstated the title of Chang Ping, a former employee of China\u2019s Southern Weekend newspaper, who commented on the reason for an apology issued by that newspaper after it published an article identifying two directors of some of Anbang\u2019s companies. He was its news department director, not its editor in chief.Javier Hernandez contributed reporting from Beijing, and Kiki Zhao contributed research from Beijing.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Will a Liberal Supreme Court Limit Money in Politics?", "Date": "2016-03-21", "News": "Supported byOp-Ed ContributorSo imagine that a Democratic president\u2019s nominee is eventually confirmed, and at the next opportunity, Citizens United is reversed. What happens next? Will money lose its hold on American politics?Probably not \u2014 though not because money in politics doesn\u2019t matter. Citizens United stands at the end of a long line of decisions that have weakened Congress\u2019s ability to limit money in politics, not all of them wrongly decided. Instead of rolling back all those decisions, we should seek to balance, rather than limit, money, and make it easier for people without wealth to run and be heard.In itself, reversing Citizens United would be a minor step. The decision\u2019s most specific change to campaign finance law \u2014 allowing corporations and unions to make independent expenditures to influence an election \u2014 has been of little consequence. Corporations, especially household names and publicly traded companies, would rather avoid the controversy that comes with big campaign spending. Most money still comes from wealthy individuals, as it did before Citizens United.It was the signal the Citizens United ruling sent that has been a much bigger deal. The majority decision went beyond the question in the case to assert that only quid pro quo corruption \u2014 a measurable exchange of legislative favors for campaign money \u2014 justified regulation, indicating that the court would look skeptically on most campaign-finance limits. And, particularly because of the uproar surrounding the decision, donors and political strategists believed that an era of \u201canything goes\u201d had begun, and they behaved accordingly, testing all kinds of limits, such as using nonprofit organizations to finance election campaigns.And there will always be a way out. The problem is not the Supreme Court \u2014 it\u2019s the First Amendment itself. The challenge in regulating campaign spending is not deciding whether money is speech or corporations have rights, it\u2019s defining the boundaries of the election. Elections are a special zone, and by regulating spending clearly intended to influence the election, we keep it a zone of political fairness, where voters hear all sides and elected officials can remain independent. (Think of it like the signs limiting electioneering within 75 feet of the polling place.)Then there are all the other ways that the wealthy influence policy, without getting involved in elections \u2014 through media, lobbying and philanthropy. Each channel is legitimate and most efforts to restrict them would create more problems than they solved. What Mr. Sanders calls \u201cthe billionaire class\u201d will not lose its influence even after all the court decisions back to 1976 have been reversed.After Citizens United, the next step is not backward, toward old laws that didn\u2019t work well, but forward, toward a politics that respects and expands free expression and robust debate.Advertisement"}

Starting with a computer company called Sahara, they have built an empire in mining, transportation, technology and media. They own a newspaper and television network which tend to offer favorable coverage of Mr. Zuma and the A.N.C.Some senior party leaders directly criticized Mr. Zuma on Thursday. \u201cTo those people who believe they still need to defend Zuma and have benefited from a close relationship with the Guptas, I appeal to them now to stand back,\u201d Barbara Hogan, a former minister of public enterprises under Mr. Zuma, said in call to a radio station.A day earlier, Mcebisi Jonas, the deputy finance minister, said in a statement that in a meeting with the Guptas in December they had offered him the job of finance minister. Mr. Jonas \u2014 who on Thursday drew statements of support from many high-ranking government officials \u2014 said he immediately rejected the offer.In December, a few days after the alleged offer to Mr. Jonas, Mr. Zuma removed a widely respected finance minister, Nhlanhla Nene, and replaced him with a little-known legislator, a decision that shocked the financial markets, sent the rand plummeting and also drew criticism from senior party members and businessmen. Critics of the decision said that, in appointing a pliable finance minister, Mr. Zuma was seeking to ease financing for public projects that would benefit the Guptas and other allies.Mr. Zuma was forced to reverse himself a few days later by removing his new finance minister and reappointing a well-regarded former finance minister, Pravin Gordhan, who had served from 2009 to 2014. Mr. Gordhan has spent the last three months trying to reassure investors and persuade credit-rating agencies not to downgrade South Africa\u2019s government debt to junk status.But analysts say that continuing doubts about governance in South Africa \u2014 as well as a drought and low commodity prices that have hurt its economy \u2014 will make it difficult for the nation to fend off an eventual downgrade.A day before Mr. Jonas\u2019s statement about the offer of a post, a former A.N.C. lawmaker, Vytjie Mentor, wrote on her Facebook page that the Guptas had offered her the position of minister of public enterprises in 2010. Ms. Mentor wrote that the offer was made in a meeting inside their house, in which Mr. Zuma was also present.The Gupta brothers, all in their 40s, have released statements denying the recent allegations. Mr. Zuma said he had no \u201crecollection\u201d of Ms. Mentor.In Parliament on Thursday, Mr. Zuma said he knew nothing about the alleged offer made by the Guptas to Mr. Jonas.\u201cIf Jonas says he was offered by the Guptas, I think you will be well placed to ask the Guptas, or Jonas,\u201d Mr. Zuma said, as members of his party cheered. \u201cDon\u2019t ask me.

{"Headline": "Can Labor Still Turn Out the Vote?", "Date": "2016-03-04", "News": "Supported byNews AnalysisON Labor Day in 1960, John F. Kennedy kicked off the final push of his presidential campaign in Cadillac Square in Detroit with a rousing speech to thousands of United Auto Workers members. It was a nod to the immense clout of organized labor.Can a weakened labor movement still provide the money, voters and get-out-the-vote muscle to elect the Democratic nominee in crucial swing states, as it has in the past?Democratic strategists point to statistics they say demonstrate labor\u2019s continued influence. In union households in Ohio, President Obama beat Mitt Romney in 2012 by 54 percent to 44 percent among white voters without college degrees. But in nonunion households, he lost 39 percent to 59 percent among the same voters. In Wisconsin, the results were similar: Mr. Obama won 60 percent to 38 percent in union households among those voters, but lost in nonunion households 42 percent to 57 percent.Union voters helped deliver those crucial states to Mr. Obama. For one thing, unions shape their members\u2019 economic and political views long term. Just as important, unions mount intense campaigns \u2014 with workplace fliers, phone calls and door-knocking \u2014 to get their members to vote for the labor-backed candidate.\u201cFor the Democratic nominee, the labor movement is the most effective tool after the candidate\u2019s own campaign,\u201d said Steve Rosenthal, a former political director of the A.F.L.-C.I.O., the nation\u2019s main union federation. He noted that even in Michigan and Ohio, where union membership is down, labor households still represent nearly a quarter of all voters.A decade ago, labor\u2019s political operation was \u201cunmatched by anything on the right,\u201d said Luke Hilgemann, chief executive of Americans for Prosperity, a free-market advocacy group founded by the Koch brothers. \u201cNow we\u2019re spreading the message through the same means.\u201d The biggest difference, he noted, \u201cis they have seen their numbers decline and we have seen our numbers skyrocket.\u201dAmericans for Prosperity has built a nationwide campaign network based on labor\u2019s model. Mr. Hilgemann says this 35-state effort has a staff of 500, enlisted 2.8 million activists and already made 4.5 million phone calls. It remains unclear whether the group will support Mr. Trump, as the Kochs, along with many other conservatives, have criticized the candidate.Some major unions are planning to create their own super PAC. Although it would have far less money than its conservative rivals, such an organization would help labor to finance even more door-to-door outreach, their traditional strength.\u201cThe other side has money, but we have people,\u201d said Randi Weingarten, president of the American Federation of Teachers.And Michael Podhorzer, the A.F.L.-C.I.O.\u2019s political director, said: \u201cAll these attacks are creating a more activist culture in unions. There may be a decline in absolute numbers, but the intensity that union members feel has gone up, and so has the recognition that there are huge stakes in this election.\u201dOne big issue is the Supreme Court vacancy left by Antonin Scalia\u2019s death. With major labor-related cases pending before the court, tipping the balance toward its liberal faction could motivate many union members to turn out for the Democratic candidate.Labor\u2019s task has also been complicated by Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, whose passionate attacks on income inequality, wage stagnation and trade deals have won over many union members. Union leaders, on the other hand, lean heavily toward Hillary Clinton, partly because they see her as a safer bet to win in November.As a result, the A.F.L.-C.I.O. has refrained from endorsing either candidate, although about two dozen national unions, with more than 10 million members, have backed Mrs. Clinton, while just three support Mr. Sanders.With Mrs. Clinton having a clearer road to the nomination after Super Tuesday, many Democrats are wondering whether unions can rally Sanders supporters to Mrs. Clinton in November. \u201cWe\u2019re going to make it crystal clear to union members, whether Democrats, Republicans, independents or first-time voters, that Hillary Clinton should be their choice,\u201d said Mary Kay Henry, president of the Service Employees International Union.But Larry Cohen, a former president of the Communications Workers of America union and now a senior Sanders adviser, said it might not be so easy.\u201cHillary will have an issue about enthusiasm, given what\u2019s turned up in this campaign,\u201d he said, predicting that union members would overwhelmingly back the Democratic nominee. Still, he added: \u201cIf Bernie is the candidate, then very few union members will back Trump. If Hillary is the candidate, there\u2019ll be more.\u201dSome labor leaders say the real danger to Mrs. Clinton, at least among working-class voters, is Mr. Trump.\u201cDefinitely some like Trump,\u201d said Thomas Hanify, president of the Professional Firefighters Union of Indiana. \u201cThey like his upbeat message that we\u2019re going to make it good again.\u201dSteven Greenhouse, a visiting researcher at the Russell Sage Foundation, is a former labor and workplace reporter for The New York Times and the author of \u201cThe Big Squeeze: Tough Times for the American Worker.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Veterans Seek Help for Infertility Inflicted by Wounds of War", "Date": "2016-02-29", "News": "Supported byDuring a firefight in Afghanistan in 2005, Army Cpl. Tyler Wilson, then 20, was hit by a bullet that pierced his spine and left him paralyzed below the waist.Since then, the Department of Veterans Affairs has provided him with free health care, as it does for all veterans who were disabled while serving. Yet there was a gap in his coverage that came as a shock.By law, the V.A. cannot provide in vitro fertilization, not even to a veteran like Corporal Wilson whose ability to have children was impaired by an injury sustained in the line of duty. Doctors have told him and his fianc\u00e9e, Crystal Black, that in vitro fertilization is their only chance of conceiving a child. Each attempt costs more than $12,000, and they will have to pay for it themselves.\u201cThanks for your service, but you\u2019re on your own with this,\u201d Corporal Wilson said.A few thousand veterans, male and female, are infertile because of injuries sustained in combat or training. Some are paralyzed, some have damage to reproductive organs, and some have brain injuries that disrupt the secretion of hormones needed to produce eggs or sperm.Many veterans are confounded to learn that the Defense Department, which covers service members while their status is still active military, provides infertility treatment at seven hospitals, without charge for those who need it because of service-related injuries. But very few wounded troops are in any position to take advantage of that benefit. While in the hospital they still have active status until they are medically retired or discharged from the military, but they are usually in rehabilitation and struggling to recover. Only 20 service members have taken advantage of the I.V.F. benefit, according to Defense Department officials.The Defense Department is \u201clooking at how it can provide reproductive technologies like I.V.F. to a wider population,\u201d it said in a statement in late January, but the idea was part of a plan, along with increased maternity leave, that applies to active-duty service members, not veterans.An infertility clinic has offered Corporal Wilson and Ms. Black a discount, and friends have started a GoFundMe website to help pay for the treatment. But Ms. Black said: \u201cIt\u2019s very taxing when you have to come up with such a large amount to even try to have a family. The fertility issues arise 100 percent from his combat-related injury.\u201dSenator Patty Murray, Democrat of Washington, has been trying for several years to change the law. \u201cThis is a widely used medical procedure, and our veterans should have access to it,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is an issue between the veteran and the spouse and their doctor.\u201dThe V.A. supported legislation by Ms. Murray to change the law, provided that money was allocated pay for the services, according to testimony last June before the Senate Committee on Veterans\u2019 Affairs by Dr. Rajiv Jain, a V.A. assistant deputy under secretary.Ms. Murray has vowed to keep trying. \u201cI\u2019m never going to give up until we get this done,\u201d she said. \u201cI believe it is so essential for these young men and women to know their country is behind them when they get home, and their dream is not taken away.\u201dBut for many couples, the biological clock is ticking. Ms. Murray acknowledged that for some, who had asked for her help years ago, it is already too late.Army Staff Sgt. Michelle Wager was injured by a roadside bomb in Baghdad in 2007. She lost one leg and had severe damage to the other. She has sustained fractured vertebrae and a brain injury.\u201cOnce I was at Walter Reed and sort of conscious, sort of understanding what was going on, I realized that I stopped having periods immediately,\u201d Sergeant Wager said.She was only 31, and her menstrual cycles had always been normal, she said. But the injuries seemed to plunge her into menopause, complete with hot flashes. Initially, military doctors reassured her that she would remain fertile. But the changes troubled her, and she sought treatment. Drugs prescribed in 2011 brought some irregular periods. A doctor told her that if she wanted children, she should try to get pregnant as soon as possible. But she had no partner.\u201cMy options were to pick a donor out of a book,\u201d she said. \u201cI wasn\u2019t quite prepared for that.\u201dLater, she started a new relationship, and in October 2014 became pregnant. But she miscarried.\u201cWe\u2019ve had baby fever ever since,\u201d she said.But she and her husband have not conceived again. In a letter written to help explain her condition to the V.A., her gynecologist said, \u201cIn my professional opinion, her infertility could likely be explained by her traumatic injuries that she suffered while serving in Iraq.\u201d He went on to say that the brain injury had probably caused her to stop menstruating, and that he had referred her to an infertility clinic.Even though the V.A. does not provide in vitro fertilization, Sergeant Wager said she hoped it would recognize her infertility as a service-related injury and provide compensation, which she could use to pay for the treatment she needs.\u201cI\u2019m dumbfounded,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re just sort of at the end of our rope here, not sure where to go or where to turn.\u201dShe and her husband have been seeing an infertility specialist, paying out of pocket. The clinic donated one attempt at intrauterine insemination a few months ago, but it failed, and the doctor told the couple that their best bet, probably their only one, was I.V.F. They cannot afford it, and are considering borrowing the money from a finance company that lends to couples having I.V.F. She is now 40, and time is running out.\u201cWe\u2019re not the richest people, and for something that\u2019s not guaranteed, it\u2019s a little bit scary,\u201d Sergeant Wager said. \u201cBut we\u2019re not ready to give up yet, either.\u201dKathleen Causey, whose husband, Sgt. First Class Aaron Causey, had an injury to the testicles that impaired his fertility, called the discounts \u201cwonderful and gracious.\u201d But she said: \u201cWe shouldn\u2019t have to rely on people\u2019s kindness to have children. Where is the support of the V.A.? Why isn\u2019t Congress taking this seriously?\u201dShe added, \u201cWe\u2019re only in this situation because he chose to serve his country, and now his country is not taking care of him.\u201dBecause of an editing error, an earlier version of a picture caption with a photo of Army Cpl. Tyler Wilson and his fianc\u00e9e misstated his age. He was 20 when he was injured, which was in 2005; he is not 20 now.Alain Delaqueriere contributed research.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Migrant Crisis Alters E.U. Calculations for Greece as Its Debt Struggle Continues", "Date": "2016-03-04", "News": "Supported byEight months after Greece agreed to do its part, it is the rest of Europe that is failing to muster the will to address a threat to the bloc\u2019s unity, this time the continued influx of migrants from the Middle East and beyond. And Greece, the main entry route for asylum seekers, has been largely left to fend for itself.\u201cWe are now in the situation where Greece is essentially becoming a holding pen for refugees and is being asked to solve a problem created by other countries,\u201d said Jens Bastian, an economics consultant based in Athens and a former member of the European Commission\u2019s task force on Greece. \u201cYou are basically putting the management of Europe\u2019s migrant crisis at the doorstep of Greece.\u201dBut if the situation is generating more despair in an already battered nation, it also holds the potential for Mr. Tsipras to exert new leverage over the rest of Europe \u2014 with a possible ally in Ms. Merkel, long seen in Greece as a usurper of Greek sovereignty and a dispenser of economic punishment.Perhaps more than any other European leader, Ms. Merkel, who continues to welcome refugees from Syria and Iraq to Germany despite intense opposition at home and among other governments, needs a deal to defuse the migrant problem. She would find her job that much tougher if Greece deteriorates further into humanitarian and political crisis.With Mrs. Merkel angered by decisions in Austria and nine other countries to tighten their borders, trapping tens of thousands of migrants in Greece, \u201cthis creates an opportunity for a closer alliance between Athens and Berlin,\u201d said Mujtaba Rahman, the head of European analysis at the Eurasia Group in London. The refugee crisis \u201ccould win Greece some bailout flexibility,\u201d he said.Some members of Mr. Tsipras\u2019s fragile coalition government have also hinted they would like creditors to reduce some of Greece\u2019s debt in exchange for Greece bearing the burden of warehousing the migrants Europe will not allow in.There is little outward sign that European leaders are willing to link the two issues and let up on requirements in last summer\u2019s bailout plan for deep budget cuts and painful overhauls of many elements of the economy. Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble, the German finance minister, warned on Thursday in a speech at the London School of Economics that the refugee crisis did not mean Greece could relax its fiscal efforts.\u201cOf course, there is a new situation, the refugee crisis, and therefore Greece needs beyond all discussion additional solidarity,\u201d he said. \u201cThis does not mean that Greece should not continue to work to regain competitiveness.\u201dBut Mr. Tsipras\u2019s challenge remains substantial, with political opponents coming at him from the far left and right.The economy has continued to weaken since last summer, when Greece imposed capital controls during turbulent negotiations with its European Union creditors for a new bailout in exchange for accepting harsh austerity terms.Despite tentative signs that the worst was over, the economy has continued to contract after Mr. Tsipras imposed new taxes and began cutting pensions further to comply with the terms of the bailout. Greece\u2019s overall unemployment rate has been stuck above 25 percent for more than two years, while the number of young people without jobs remains near 50 percent.Mr. Tsipras\u2019s biggest immediate challenge is to complete an overhaul of the near-bankrupt pension system, without which Greece cannot move forward in talks with creditors on sorely needed debt relief. The pressure from creditors has sparked raucous street protests in recent weeks. The creditors have also delayed disbursing billions of euros in new bailout funds, citing slow progress by Mr. Tsipras\u2019s government in implementing the austerity measures.Throughout last year, the government had effectively waved through migrants \u2014 almost none of whom wanted to stay in the economically moribund country \u2014 to Germany and other prosperous nations where they wanted asylum. But when the nations along the migrant trail decided to constrain the flow of people, the rest of Europe warned Greece that it could be kicked out of the Schengen system of passport-free travel if it did not exercise control over its borders.At the same time, he has hardened his position with Europe, demanding this week that the European Union \u201cexplicitly recognize that Greece cannot assume all the responsibility by itself,\u201d and demanding sanctions for countries that do not take their share of refugees under a Europe-wide relocation plan that has so far been a flop.\u201cThe one thing he can\u2019t let happen is for migrants and refugees to be left out in the open, where they become not only vulnerable to extremists, but turn into a focal point for the far right to try and rally support,\u201d he said.In a peculiar reversal, analysts say, Mr. Tsipras\u2019s greatest hope may lie with Mrs. Merkel, who has steadfastly admonished other countries not to let Greece \u201cplunge into chaos,\u201d and rebuked Austria and the nine Balkan states that shut their borders.\u201cDo you seriously believe that all the euro states that last year fought all the way to keep Greece in the eurozone \u2014 and we were the strictest \u2014 can one year later allow Greece to, in a way, plunge into chaos?\u201d she said in a weekend interview with the public broadcaster ARD.Yet on the streets of Athens, few are buying talk of European solidarity.\u201cThis just shows you how not-united Europe is,\u201d said Jackie Rogers, a Briton who has lived in Greece for nearly 40 years, sweeping her eyes over migrants scrambling for donated food, water and clothing at Victoria Square in central Athens.\u201cI think it suits northern European nations who don\u2019t want the problem in their backyard to use Greece as a dumping ground.\u201dPrashant Rao contributed reporting from London.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "High Hopes for Hillary Clinton, Then Disappointment in Haiti", "Date": "2016-03-14", "News": "Supported byCarrying horns, handwritten signs and bottles of gasoline to set tires on fire, a group of men marched into one of the many protests that have paralyzed parts of the Haitian capital, Port-au-Prince, this year.\u201cYou see all these people here?\u201d said one of the Haitian-flag-draped protesters, Jean Renold Cenatus, 32, who said he was unemployed. \u201cIt\u2019s because of what Mrs. Clinton did five years ago that we are facing this situation.\u201dThey often speak fondly of Haiti, one of the first places they visited as newlyweds in 1975.But as she seeks the world\u2019s most powerful job and Haiti plunges into another political abyss, a loud segment of Haitians and Haitian-Americans is speaking of the Clintons with the same contempt they reserve for some of their past leaders.According to the Associated Press, Donald J. Trump and Hillary Clinton have each won enough delegates to claim their party\u2019s nomination for president.In widely read blogs, in protests in Port-au-Prince and outside Mrs. Clinton\u2019s campaign headquarters in Brooklyn, and on popular call-in radio shows in Florida, where primaries will be held on Tuesday, the Clintons have become prime targets of blame for the country\u2019s woes.\u201cA vote for Hillary Clinton means further corruption, further death and destruction for our people,\u201d said Dahoud Andre, a radio show host in New York who has helped organize protests against the Clintons. \u201cIt means more Haitians leaving Haiti and not being able to live in our country.\u201dTony Jeanthenor, 55, a member of the Miami-based Haitian human rights group Veye-Yo as well as Lavalas Family, a Haitian political party, said he was voting for Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont because of the senator\u2019s distaste for involvement in other countries\u2019 affairs.\u201cNothing good for Haiti can come out of Hillary because of her past behavior,\u201d Mr. Jeanthenor said.The dismay over Mrs. Clinton in South Florida\u2019s Haitian community is not likely to affect her fortunes on Tuesday, as she holds a comfortable lead over Mr. Sanders in state polls. Whether it could damage her in a general election is unclear. An estimated 150,000 Haitian-American voters live in Florida, the state where 537 votes decided the 2000 election. But they have also overwhelmingly voted for Democrats, according to Fernand R. Amandi, a principal partner of Bendixen & Amandi International, a public opinion research firm in Miami that has polled Haitian-Americans extensively.Jean Monestime, a Haitian-American who is the chairman of the Miami-Dade County Commission as well as a chairman of Caribbean Americans for Hillary, said he had spoken to the Clinton campaign about the criticisms. But many Haitian-Americans in South Florida still appreciate her efforts on the country\u2019s behalf, he said, and intended to vote for her.The others should not \u201ckeep whining and complaining,\u201d he said, because if another candidate wins, one who is less interested in Haiti, \u201cwe are going to be marginalized by the change.\u201dIndeed, the Clintons have been involved extensively in Haiti for years. Mr. Clinton won the praise of many Haitians by sending in 20,000 American troops to return Jean-Bertrand Aristide, the country\u2019s former president, to power in 1994, three years after he was ousted in a military coup.The Clintons had large roles in the earthquake recovery effort, Mrs. Clinton as secretary of state and Mr. Clinton as co-chairman of the Interim Haiti Recovery Commission. Along with his predecessor in the White House, the elder George Bush, Mr. Clinton raised tens of millions of dollars through the Clinton Foundation to promote development, schools and farming in Haiti, while also helping draw hundreds of millions in private investments.Officials at the Clinton Foundation said they were not surprised by some of the disappointment, given that even before the earthquake, Haiti was one of the world\u2019s poorest countries. Now, the average family gets by on $1.25 a day.Jake Sullivan, Mrs. Clinton\u2019s deputy chief of staff for policy at the State Department and now the senior policy adviser for her campaign, said the United States\u2019 work under Mrs. Clinton\u2019s leadership \u201ccertainly had a significant impact in support of Haiti\u2019s recovery.\u201d\u201cOur commitment of more than $4 billion since 2010 has helped provide shelter for more than 300,000 Haitians; health care for more than half the country in U.S.-supported facilities; train a new national police force; and raise the average incomes of tens of thousands of farmers,\u201d Mr. Sullivan said in an email. \u201cSecretary Clinton is extremely proud of the work she and her team have done since the earthquake.\u201dThe night of the runoff, which Mr. Martelly won, Mrs. Clinton\u2019s chief of staff, Cheryl D. Mills, wrote a congratulatory note to top American diplomats in Haiti.\u201cYou do great elections,\u201d Ms. Mills wrote in a message released by the State Department among a batch of Mrs. Clinton\u2019s emails. She wrote that she would buy dinner the next time she visited: \u201cWe can discuss how the counting is going! Just kidding. Kinda. :)\u201dMs. Mills\u2019s email may have been intended as tongue in cheek, but it has fed a suspicion among Haitians, if lacking in proof, that the United States rigged the election to install a puppet president.After Mrs. Clinton declared her candidacy for president of the United States, calls began coming in to Mr. Andre\u2019s radio show, like one in June in which a woman lamented that she and her late father had been supporters of The Clintons and had donated money to help elect each to office. \u201cWhen they did good things, we should applaud,\u201d the woman said in Haitian Creole. \u201cBut when they do bad things, we should denounce them because it is not good. And Hillary Clinton is not good.\u201dMr. Rodham and several partners also sought a $22 million deal to rebuild homes in the country while Mr. Clinton was leading the recovery commission. They were not successful.While there is no evidence that Mr. Rodham got preferential treatment, his ventures were quickly inflated into rumors, heard often on the streets and airwaves, that the Clintons had been busy buying land in Haiti for profit.Outspoken activists like Ezili Dant\u00f2, a human rights lawyer who founded the Haitian Lawyers Leadership Network, say they cannot help believing that Mrs. Clinton gave her brother a hand.\u201cShe is looked upon as a liberal and someone who respects human rights, workers\u2019 rights and so forth,\u201d Ms. Dant\u00f2 said. \u201cBut we haven\u2019t had that experience with her in Haiti.\u201dThe Rev. Philius Nicolas, 85, of Brooklyn, an elder statesman of the Haitian community in New York, said he had heard all the complaints and understood the frustration.But Mr. Nicolas, who proudly displays in his church office a photo of him and other Haitian-Americans standing with Mrs. Clinton during her 2000 Senate campaign, said he was going to vote for her again. He said he thought she would be the best leader for the United States, Haiti\u2019s biggest benefactor.\u201cWe can\u2019t vote for a president because of Haiti only,\u201d Mr. Nicolas said. \u201cIf things go bad in the United States, we are the first ones who are going to get hurt. First and foremost, we need something good for us and then for back home.\u201dFrances Robles contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "House Republicans Clash With Consumer Protection Unit Chief", "Date": "2016-03-16", "News": "Supported byBefore a presidential election that could decide its fate, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau remains squarely in Republican cross hairs.House lawmakers tangled on Wednesday with Richard Cordray, director of the bureau, accusing it of overstepping its bounds in overseeing areas as various as payday loans, mandatory arbitration clauses and discrimination in the auto market.\u201cCongress has made Mr. Cordray a dictator,\u201d said Representative Jeb Hensarling, Republican of Texas, the chairman of the House Financial Services Committee. \u201cAnd when it comes to the well-being and liberty of American consumers, he is not a particularly benevolent one.\u201dRepublicans pressed Mr. Cordray on a number of issues, including a proposal imposing federal standards on the payday loans market. The bureau released an outline of the proposal last spring, before sending it to the agency\u2019s small-business review panel for input. Officials had indicated the proposed rule could be released as soon as February, but additional delays are now expected.Some committee members expressed concern that new restrictions would undermine state laws governing the payday industry.\u201cAt issue are roughly 38 states that allow these products to be offered in some form and the federal pre-emption that will occur if your rule goes forward as outlined,\u201d said Representative Randy Neugebauer, Republican of Texas.Mr. Cordray played down the issue, saying \u201cwhatever we do in this area will coexist with state law.\u201dRepublican lawmakers were also critical of the agency\u2019s efforts to potentially limit the use of mandatory arbitration clauses in financial contracts, which can prohibit consumers from joining class-action lawsuits.The bureau released an outline of the proposal in October to be considered by its small-business review panel, after issuing a report on the topic last March.\u201cThe report was criticized by a number of academics and industry for completely ignoring major pieces of data,\u201d said Representative Bill Huizenga, Republican of Michigan, adding that more than 80 members of Congress asked the bureau to reopen the study last June.But Mr. Cordray defended his agency\u2019s steps, noting that the Dodd-Frank financial overhaul directed the bureau to study the issue.\u201cOur report has been widely recognized as the single most comprehensive and informative report on this issue ever done,\u201d he said. \u201cCongress asked us to do a broad, comprehensive study \u2013 we spent three years on it. We\u2019re now moving ahead with Congress\u2019s direction to engage in policy intervention based on that.\u201dCommittee members also had tough words for the bureau\u2019s work in uncovering unintentional discrimination in auto lending, raising doubts about the statistical methods the bureau has used to determine cases of discrimination in actions against Toyota Motor Credit, Ally Financial and others.Some Democrats raised questions about the bureau\u2019s efforts to oversee the indirect auto-lending market and the methods used to determine circumstances where lending policies led to higher interest rates for some minorities. The bureau does not have jurisdiction over auto dealers, but it does oversee indirect auto lending, where a dealer negotiates financing for a consumer with a bank or other lender. The House, including 88 Democrats, passed a bill last November that would require the agency to toss out its 2013 auto lending guidance.Still, Democrats were largely supportive of the bureau\u2019s work.\u201cRepublicans have turned the C.F.P.B. into a political punching bag, attempting to undermine its work at every turn,\u201d said Representative Maxine Waters, Democrat of California, the ranking member on the panel.Mr. Cordray also defended the consumer agency\u2019s actions and outlined several areas it was looking into, including certain credit card promotions and completing a rule on prepaid debit cards.\u201cWe\u2019re just trying to put consumers in a position so they can make choices that they won\u2019t regret later, so they can know what they really want to know at the time,\u201d he said. \u201cThat empowers consumers and promotes personal liberty.\u201dHe added that the bureau had \u201csignificant concerns\u201d with deferred-interest promotions for credit cards, where interest rates on a credit card balance are delayed for a period under certain conditions.\u201cIt\u2019s an issue we\u2019re looking at very carefully, and we\u2019re going to be taking actions as appropriate,\u201d Mr. Cordray said. \u201cI think that credit card issuers should be mindful of thinking about their deferred-interest products and the harm that\u2019s happening to a number of consumers who end up with back-end pricing that\u2019s very different than what was represented to them up front.\u201dThe bureau plans to complete its rule overseeing prepaid debt cards within months, he said. He cited an incident with the RushCard, a line of prepaid cards founded by Russell Simmons, an executive in the hip-hop music business, in which a technological breakdown froze consumer accounts for several days last year. He called it a \u201csignificant fiasco.\u201d\u201cMany, thousands of consumers had prepaid money on these cards and could not get access to that money,\u201d Mr. Cordray said. \u201cIf anything, that shows me we need strong consumer protections for prepaid cards, for which none exist today.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Her engrossing new memoir, \u201cLab Girl,\u201d is at once a thrilling account of her discovery of her vocation and a gifted teacher\u2019s road map to the secret lives of plants \u2014 a book that, at its best, does for botany what Oliver Sacks\u2019s essays did for neurology, what Stephen Jay Gould\u2019s writings did for paleontology.Ms. Jahren, a professor of geobiology at the University of Hawaii, conveys the utter strangeness of plants: these machines, \u201cinvented more than 400 million years ago,\u201d that create sugar out of inorganic matter \u2014 wondrous machines upon which human life itself depends.She describes the sound of plants growing in the Midwest: \u201cAt its peak, sweet corn grows a whole inch every single day, and as the layers of husk shift slightly to accommodate this expansion, you can hear it as a low continuous rustle if you stand inside the rows of a cornfield on a perfectly still August day.\u201dShe describes the miraculous ability of a cactus to sit, under a blazing desert sun, waiting years for rain: It sheds \u201cits roots to prevent the parched soil from sucking all the water back out of it,\u201d then begins to contract, until its spines \u201cform a dense and dangerous fur protecting what is now a hard, rootless ball of plant.\u201dShe explains why the leaves at the top of a tree are smaller than those below, allowing \u201csunlight to be caught near the base whenever the wind blows and parts the upper branches.\u201d And she explains why most forests have natural boundaries: Centimeters outside their borders, \u201cwe find too little water, too little sun, too much wind or cold for just one more tree.\u201dBy crosscutting between chapters about the life cycle of trees and flowers and other green things, and chapters about her own coming-of-age as a scientist, Ms. Jahren underscores the similarities between humans and plants \u2014 tenacity, inventiveness, an ability to adapt \u2014 but, more emphatically, the radical otherness of plants: their dependence on sunshine, their inability to move or travel as we do, the redundancy and flexibility of their tissues (\u201ca root can become a stem if need be, and vice versa\u201d).Ms. Jahren\u2019s own childhood in a small Minnesota town, where there was snow on the ground nine months of the year and where most residents worked for a huge slaughterhouse, was filled with silences. Her great-grandparents had arrived there from Norway, and she writes that \u201cvast emotional distances between the individual members of a Scandinavian family are forged early and reinforced daily.\u201d It was not unusual for her and her brothers \u201cto go days without anything to say to each other.\u201dHer sanctuary was the laboratory of her father, who taught introductory physics and earth science at a local community college. There she discovered the rituals and magic of science: She embraced its rules and procedures and the attention to detail it demanded. Science gave her what she needed: \u201ca home as defined in the most literal sense, a safe place to be.\u201dA workaholic who also had manic-depression, Ms. Jahren chronicles her progress through college and graduate school and a succession of teaching jobs, conveying both the obsessive fervor she brought to her work and the often absurd hoops that research scientists must jump through to obtain even minimal financing for their work.She communicates the electric excitement of discovering something new \u2014 something no one ever knew or definitively proved before \u2014 and the boring scientific grunt work involved in conducting studies and experiments: the days and weeks and months of watching and waiting and gathering data, the all-nighters, the repetitions, the detours, both serendipitous and unfruitful.For more than two decades, her co-conspirator in these adventures has been the steady, loyal and eccentric Bill Hagopian, her lab manager and alter ego. Together, the pair scour Salvation Army stores to find old camping equipment to use in their first lab, take students on some hilariously awful field trips, burrow through rotting leaves in the Canadian Arctic, and trek through Ireland ( a place \u201cso saturated with green that it is the things that are not green that catch one\u2019s eye\u201d), carefully gathering more than 1,000 moss samples that will be cavalierly dumped in the garbage by an airport security officer.She speaks of the \u201cgreat cosmic fire\u201d that overtakes her during manic episodes and her fears of navigating pregnancy without her usual medications. And she writes of her fears about balancing life and work, and the surprise of having \u201cthe truly valuable pieces\u201d of her life \u201cfall from the sky undeserved.\u201dAlong the way, she comes to realize that her work as a scientist is also part of a larger enterprise. She is not like a plant, but like an ant, \u201cdriven to find and carry single dead needles, one after the other, all the way across the forest and then add them one by one by one to a pile so massive that I can only fully imagine one small corner of it.\u201dAs a scientist, she goes on, she is indeed just an ant, \u201cinsufficient and anonymous, but stronger than I look and part of something that is much bigger than I am\u201d: She is part of the continuum of scientists who have each built upon their predecessors\u2019 work and who will hand down their own advances to the next generation.Lab GirlBy Hope Jahren290 pages.

I don\u2019t know how much of this is about principles and how much is just about the pursuit of profit. The efforts do seem pretty effective, though, and I think we should expect only more of this. The industry has long had disdain for Washington; now, with business booming and the companies as powerful as ever, it seems to have learned how to express the disdain for political ends. Where do you think this could manifest itself next?For instance, techies have been pushing for immigration reform for years; Mark Zuckerberg made it a signature issue earlier this decade. What happened? Nothing.And of course, what Mr. Carter and the F.B.I. consider a back door is not exactly what the tech industry does.

{"Headline": "Lawmakers Urge Greater Care With Sales of Distressed Mortgages", "Date": "2016-03-01", "News": "Supported byDozens of lawmakers sent a letter on Tuesday to housing regulators urging them to disqualify aggressive investors from the sales of distressed mortgages by the Federal Housing Administration, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, and asking them to provide more details about loan sales and their outcomes.Hedge funds and private equity firms have drawn fire from housing advocates as they swoop in to buy distressed mortgages that remain from the housing crisis nearly a decade ago. Critics say the investors are too quick to push loans into foreclosure rather than negotiate workable modifications that could keep owners in their homes.The letter, signed by 45 lawmakers, points to the distressed-asset specialty company Lone Star Funds, based in Dallas, and its subsidiary, Caliber Home Loans, which is under investigation by the New York attorney general over mortgage-servicing practices, particularly loan modifications that revert to original payments.\u201cEntities that pay lip service to legitimate loan modification requirements while engaging in unfair or abusive practices toward borrowers should not be able to use government programs to profit from the continuing legacy of the financial and foreclosure crisis,\u201d said the letter, which was addressed to the Housing and Urban Development secretary, Juli\u00e1n Castro, and the Federal Housing Finance Agency director, Melvin L. Watt.The lawmakers asked the agencies to consider loan buyers who commit to foreclosure prevention efforts instead, including direct sales of loans to nonprofit agencies. \u201cThe work these entities do to rehabilitate these properties and achieve favorable outcomes for neighborhoods should not be discounted as immaterial to the price that your agencies will accept.\u201dThey also asked for greater details about loan sales, including criteria used to decide which loans go into which pool of assets up for auction and how vacant properties are treated versus occupied properties.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Wall Street Bonuses Fell in 2015, and 2016 Isn\u2019t Looking Rosy", "Date": "2016-03-07", "News": "Supported byWall Street bonuses are down for the second straight year, and recent market volatility and cutbacks suggest that 2016 is shaping up to be a difficult year, according to the New York State comptroller.The average bonus paid in the securities industry fell 9 percent, to $146,200, last year, while the bonus pool for employees who work in New York City shrank 6 percent, to $25 billion.The finance industry is a crucial component of the state\u2019s annual tax revenue, contributing about 17.5 percent of the total last year. Wall Street\u2019s health reverberates throughout the city and state economies; profits are on the line for luxury retailers, restaurants, real estate firms and even auto dealers.Already New York State has cut its forecast for this year\u2019s bonus pool for finance and insurance jobs in the state, now predicting a 2.5 percent drop.Securities industry profit fell 10.5 percent last year, to $14.3 billion, the lowest since 2011.Thomas P. DiNapoli, the state comptroller, said recent job gains might not be sustainable, given the early weakness in the financial markets and increasing provisions for bad loans to energy sector companies. \u201cBoth the state and city budgets depend heavily on the securities industry, and lower profits could mean fewer industry jobs and less tax revenue,\u201d he said.A number of banks have been cutting jobs in trading as markets have become volatile, and pay trends reflect the relative strength of individual businesses. Incentive pay fell 10 to 20 percent for fixed-income division employees last year, according to estimates from Johnson Associates, and pay for equities employees rose as much as 10 percent, for example.Wall Street has also been adjusting to new regulations that force it to take on less risk, eating into profit margins.Mr. DiNapoli has released the numbers each year as lawmakers in the state capital take up budgeting for the next fiscal year. For every job on Wall Street, two are created elsewhere in the economy, according to the comptroller\u2019s office. The average salary, including bonuses, for securities industry employees in New York City rose 14 percent in 2014 to $404,800, which is a record. Data for 2015 is not yet available.The numbers, based on personal income tax withholding data, provide a snapshot of trends affecting Wall Street during the heart of its traditional bonus payout season, which runs from December through March. The securities industry accounted for 22 percent of private sector wages paid in New York City in 2014 even though it made up just 5 percent of private sector jobs.Over all, employment in the industry ticked up 2.7 percent last year, to 172,400, the second-consecutive year of growth and the highest number of employed people since the financial crisis, despite the fact that Wall Street as an industry is still 8 percent smaller than before 2008.The estimates do not distinguish between cash bonuses and stock-based awards that vest over multiple years. The numbers reflect cash bonuses and deferred compensation for which taxes have been withheld; they do not include stock options.The size of the average bonus had been on the rise in 2012 and 2013 before dropping 6 percent in 2014 and again last year. Still, they are far lower than the recent peak of $191,360 in 2006.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Starwood\u2019s Takeover Offer From Anbang Is Risky, but Worth It", "Date": "2016-03-29", "News": "Supported byBreakingviewsCall it the $4.64 question. That\u2019s how much more per share the Anbang Insurance Group of China has offered to entice Starwood Hotels and Resorts Worldwide away from a deal with Marriott International. Anbang\u2019s new $14 billion bid is about 6 percent sweeter, but it also comes with uncertainties. Heavy interest from rival hoteliers means Starwood can afford the risk and accept.Starwood, the owner of the Westin and W Hotel chains, finds itself the object of desire for two very different suitors. One is Marriott, a blue-chip competitor that can extract cost savings from a merger. Starwood stockholders would share in the upside; they would own about a third of the combined company after receiving Marriott stock, alongside $21 a share in cash, in the deal agreed upon last week, which was worth $78.11 a share in midday trading on Monday.Competing with it is a group led by Anbang, a relatively small insurance company based in Beijing. There would be no immediate synergies from buying Starwood, even though Anbang has been on a hotel-acquisition spree lately. Its $82.75-a-share offer is all cash, but the company is privately held so its finances are opaque. The backers of its bid aren\u2019t obviously instrumental to financing the deal.Marriott has tried to raise doubts, urging Starwood shareholders to \u201cgive serious consideration\u201d to Anbang\u2019s financing as well as to regulatory matters. Starwood\u2019s board can allay some concerns by putting protections in place. It might insist, for example, that Anbang produce clear evidence it has the money or even have it put into escrow.Mitigating government action would be tougher. The murky Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States is unlikely to stop Anbang from buying Starwood, but a review could be lengthy and force the sale of locations near places like the White House. In China, concerns that the domestic insurance regulator would block Anbang because of a rule that limits overseas holdings may be overblown. The British bank HSBC overcame similar worries a few years ago about a sale of its stake in Ping An Insurance to a Thai group.Most important, Starwood knows it has eager interest. Marriott already trumped Anbang once, and it also showed up at the 11th hour to steal the deal from Hyatt Hotels. Accepting Anbang\u2019s cash now is by no means a sure thing and could leave Starwood in limbo for a while. If the sale ultimately collapsed, however, Starwood would be a star mergers and acquisitions attraction again.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How Toothless Regulation Makes Raising Secret Campaign Money Easier", "Date": "2016-03-11", "News": "Considering the torrent of political money flowing through Washington, fundraisers from both parties must be rejoicing as the campaign finance industry feasts on the presidential contests. Particularly since two supposed watchdog agencies, the Federal Election Commission and Internal Revenue Service, have just presented fresh evidence of how feeble their oversight has become.The F.E.C., long a laughingstock among the political pros it supposedly oversees, announced it had finally gotten around to the five-year-old case of the mystery man who passed a $1-million contribution to the 2012 Romney presidential campaign without leaving a trace of his identity. Under the law, the donor should have been identified since the money went to a super PAC, but the funds arrived via a shadowy limited liability company that soon faded from sight. Complaints were filed with the F.E.C., and in the ensuing controversy the donor, Edward Conrad, a long-time Romney supporter, came forward, claiming he had only followed the advice of the very best campaign experts.Similar cases of shell company abuses were raised back then, and finally, five years later, the F.E.C. has cleared its throat and made its pronouncement that\u2026(drumroll) \u2026it won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t, after all, be able to look into such an obviously fishy way of bankrolling candidates. The commission was deadlocked by its own perverse twist on bipartisanship: With the three Democratic members favoring a full investigation, the three Republican commissioners, as usual, declined, blocking a majority needed for authorizing action.The I.R.S., on the other hand, was at least willing to hand down a firm decision recently. Unfortunately, that decision was a ludicrous exercise in political timorousness. The agency granted Karl Rove, the Republican political guru, a \u00e2\u0080\u009csocial welfare\u00e2\u0080\u009d tax exemption for his Crossroads GPS operation. This means he can keep the identities of deep-pocketed donors a secret part of this political machine.The tax law originally mandated that such groups should be engaged \u00e2\u0080\u009cexclusively\u00e2\u0080\u009d in social welfare, but subsequent I.R.S. standards have weakened this to require only 51 percent to be spent that way, thereby allowing opportunists 49 percent for politicking. It was later disclosed that the Rove exemption, which was approved without an explanation to the public, came after a review in 2013 by I.R.S. staff experts who found against an exemption. They concluded the Rove operation in an earlier campaign had spent 54, not 49, percent on politics.This didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t stop the I.R.S. \u00e2\u0080\u0094 battered lately by conservative political critics \u00e2\u0080\u0094 from issuing the exemption anyway. A full explanation of all this to taxpayers would seem increasingly necessary. The booming campaign industry, meanwhile, is drawing its own conclusion.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "As Coal\u2019s Future Grows Murkier, Banks Pull Financing", "Date": "2016-03-20", "News": "Supported byTens of thousands of miners were on strike and coal prices were skyrocketing in October 1902. Afraid of unrest, President Theodore Roosevelt sought the help of John Pierpont Morgan.The powerful banker, who held great sway over the coal industry, brokered a deal with the miners that ended the strike.\u201cMy dear sir,\u201d the president wrote to Mr. Morgan. \u201cLet me thank you for the service you have rendered the whole people.\u201dAmerica\u2019s coal industry is now facing another dark hour, but this time there are few financiers willing to save it.While coal has been declining over the last several years, Wall Street\u2019s broad retreat is an ominous sign for the industry.\u201cThere are always going to be periods of boom and bust,\u201d said Chiza Vitta, a metals and mining analyst with the credit rating firm Standard & Poor\u2019s. \u201cBut what is happening in coal is a downward shift that is permanent.\u201dPeabody has been trying to sell three of its mines in Colorado and New Mexico to raise cash. But the sale to Bowie Resource Partners appears to have stalled amid the difficult financing environment. Bowie did not comment. A Peabody spokesman said the company \u201cstands ready to complete the sale of assets to Bowie.\u201dCoal, like railroads, steel and other engines of the nation\u2019s industrial expansion in the 19th and early 20th centuries, helped drive Wall Street\u2019s profits for generations. More than a century later, the coal industry is in a free fall and the banks are pulling away.\u201cGiven the state of the coal industry today, I think Mr. Morgan himself might make the same decision,\u201d said Jean Strouse, a biographer of the banker.Some banks say they are trying to do their part to curtail climate change by moving away from coal projects and financing ventures that produce less carbon. But bankers also say there is a more basic reason for the shift: Lending to coal companies is too risky and could ultimately prove unprofitable.Coal companies are being squeezed by competition from less expensive energy sources like natural gas and by stiffer regulations \u2014 pressures that show no signs of letting up.As a result, even the most secure loans \u2014 like those made to companies emerging from bankruptcy, known as debtor-in-possession loans \u2014 are increasingly off limits for many banks, according to bankers and industry lawyers.But in the coal country of Appalachia, it is unclear whether many unprofitable mines can ever make money again.\u201cThere is certainly no $40 billion titan looking to make a big play in coal right now,\u201d said Marshall Huebner, co-leader of the insolvency and restructuring practice at Davis Polk & Wardwell who has represented several coal companies in recent bankruptcies.Despite the challenges, the coal industry still powers roughly a third of the nation\u2019s electricity. Industry officials say the business will eventually bounce back, once supplies burn off and demand for coal rebounds in places like China.\u201cCoal is part of our future, and I think the banks are taking a shortsighted view,\u201d said Mike Duncan, president of the American Coalition for Clean Coal Electricity, an industry group. \u201cThey are ignoring a huge market and buying into rhetoric that just doesn\u2019t work.\u201dEnvironmental groups, meanwhile, are hoping the banks\u2019 reluctance will hasten the collapse of coal. Groups like the Rainforest Action Network have been pressuring banks for months to reduce coal lending.\u201cWith much of the world committed to stabilizing the climate, we need the banks to follow quickly with measures to end coal financing altogether,\u201d said Ben Collins, a senior campaigner at Rainforest Action Network.But the banks\u2019 retreat could inflict collateral damage on an industry that employs tens of thousands of workers and needs financing not only to keep operating, but also to clean up coal mines after they close. If coal companies are unable to pay for the mine reclamation, taxpayers could be on the hook for the cleanup costs.In its latest annual corporate responsibility report, Deutsche Bank said it was phasing out financing for projects that employ so-called mountaintop removal mining, which environmentalists say is particularly harmful. But the bank\u2019s policy statement did not commit to the type of broad reduction in coal exposure that many American lenders have made in recent months.In a statement, a bank spokeswoman said that Deutsche Bank is one of the \u201cmost prominent banks when it comes to clean energy financing.\u201d She added that the bank \u201chas very strict guidelines governing any financing decisions. We conduct a thorough and detailed analysis on a case-by-case approach, drawing on a deep understanding of wider socioeconomic and environmental trends.\u201dEven most American banks are not cutting off funding to the industry overnight, saying that for the moment coal remains a major source of energy, particularly outside the United States.JPMorgan, for instance, is halting financing of new coal-fired plants in wealthy nations like the United States, but will continue to lend to such plants in the developing world, where in some places the coal market is still thriving. To receive financing, however, these plants need to use certain environmentally sound technologies, according the bank\u2019s new policy.Changes to the coal lending policy at Bank of America have created tension between senior leadership and rank-and-file bankers.Senior leaders wanted the bank\u2019s energy lending strategy to reflect \u201ca transition from a high-carbon to a low-carbon economy,\u201d said James Mahoney, who oversees public policy issues at the bank and worked on the new coal policy. It is part of Bank of America\u2019s current effort at \u201cresponsible growth\u201d \u2014 which entails not taking undue risks like lending to a troubled industry, Mr. Mahoney said.But the shift has been uncomfortable for some of the bankers serving the coal industry.\u201cIt put them in a difficult position to say to the companies they have worked with for years, \u2018We are pulling back,\u2019\u00a0\u201d Mr. Mahoney said. \u201cIt runs counter to everything we do as a client-focused company.\u201dSpeaking at an environmental conference at the United Nations in January, Bank of America\u2019s chief executive, Brian T. Moynihan, acknowledged the internal tensions around coal but said that the bank was trying to pull back gradually from the sector.\u201cWhen you have real clients involved, these decisions get difficult,\u201d Mr. Moynihan said. \u201cBut I think the view of the people working on it is: We have to help people make the transition.\u201dThat transition seemed to accelerate last week with the warning from Peabody that it would miss $71 million in interest payments.One of Peabody\u2019s best hopes for avoiding bankruptcy, analysts said, was the potential sale of three mines to Bowie Natural Resources.Bowie is a rare breed of coal company. It has been expanding its operations, focusing largely on Utah, a state that still relies primarily on coal to generate electricity. Still, Bowie in recent weeks has apparently had trouble raising the full $650 million in debt to acquire the mines.In many debt deals, banks would cover the shortfall. But Deutsche Bank and Citigroup agreed only to make their best effort to raise the debt for Bowie. The banks did not commit any of their own money, as a traditional underwriter might do.Those best efforts might not be enough.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Former Affymetrix Executives Seek to Break Up Deal With Own Bid", "Date": "2016-03-18", "News": "Supported byMonths after Affymetrix, a maker of advanced genetic analysis technology, agreed to sell itself for $1.3 billion, some of the company\u2019s former executives want to disrupt that deal \u2014 with the help of a Chinese financial backer.Those former employees, banded together as Origin Technologies, said on Friday that they had offered $1.5 billion to buy Affymetrix, topping an existing takeover proposal by Thermo Fisher Scientific.The new offer, which comes roughly a week before Affymetrix shareholders are scheduled to vote on the deal with Thermo Fisher, features financing from an unusual source: SummitView Capital, a Chinese private equity firm focused on technology investments. SummitView is providing debt financing to support the Origin bid.Under the terms of Origin\u2019s bid, Affymetrix shareholders would receive $16.10 a share in cash, up 15 percent from Thermo Fisher\u2019s offer of $14 a share. Origin would also be willing to pay the breakup fee to Thermo Fisher if the earlier deal were terminated.Shares of Affymetrix, which specializes in faster analysis of genes using so-called microarrays, have traded around $14 since Thermo Fisher announced its bid in January, suggesting that shareholders have not anticipated any higher offers.Though the new bid is coming from Origin, the true bidder in this case is Centrillion Technology Holdings, a newer genetics analysis provider created by the former Affymetrix employees. Should Origin prevail, those executives would then move to combine Affymetrix with Centrillion.Merging would unite \u201cthe two companies\u2019 highly compatible teams and shared values, better positioning Centrillion and Affymetrix to help scientists answer today\u2019s pressing genomics questions and push through breakthroughs in critical areas for human health and safety,\u201d Wei Zhou, Centrillion\u2019s chief executive and one of the former Affymetrix executives, wrote in a letter to his counterpart at Affymetrix.Making the offer through a special-purpose financial company like Origin, rather than Centrillion itself, is meant to allow a deal with Affymetrix to close faster, since such a transaction would require less regulatory review.Any government inquiries, including those tied to the involvement of SummitView, are expected to take place after Affymetrix shareholders are paid, leaving the Origin executives and SummitView bearing those risks.But Origin is likely to argue that Centrillion is also an American company and should not require a review by the panel known as the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Australia Turns Its Back on Climate Science", "Date": "2016-03-04", "News": "Supported byEditorialFor decades, Australia has run the most advanced and comprehensive atmosphere and ocean monitoring programs in the Southern Hemisphere, providing critical information not only for a nation that is already the driest on earth and fast getting drier, but also for a world in urgent need of such data to search for ways to cope with climate change.Larry Marshall, a Silicon Valley technology entrepreneur and venture capitalist who returned to Australia in January 2015 to take charge of Csiro, explained the change in the agency\u2019s mission by saying that climate change was now a settled question \u201cand the new question is what do we do about it and how do we find solutions for the climate we will be living with.\u201d The decision did not come entirely out of the blue: Australia\u2019s national climate policy has been in political flux for more than a decade, and in May 2014, Csiro\u2019s budget was severely cut and almost 1,000 positions were eliminated. But climate scientists were stunned by the severity and illogic of Dr. Marshall\u2019s decision.Certainly there are good reasons for research institutes like Csiro to cooperate with industry in the search for ways to adapt to a warming planet. But to do this at the expense of research and monitoring \u2014 undermining the search for commercially viable solutions that Csiro proposes to join \u2014 makes no sense. Long-term research on carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere, and on changing ocean and weather processes, is essential to learn what lies ahead and how to prepare for it. Moreover, as the open letter from the scientists put it, Australia is a \u201ccanary in the climate change coal mine,\u201d spanning different climate zones and experiencing steady decreases in rainfall.The cutbacks could also obstruct Australia\u2019s role in supporting the landmark climate agreement reached in Paris in December, which, among other things, calls on scientifically advanced countries like Australia to assist developing countries with advice and support.Lead scientists from major United States organizations, including the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and the NASA-sponsored Advanced Global Atmospheric Gases Experiment, have begun quietly urging the Australian government to reverse course. At the very least, the government should suspend the changes at Csiro and allow an independent review of whether they are in the best interests of Australia, the Southern Hemisphere or the earth.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Wall Street Scion Is Accused of Faking Investments", "Date": "2016-03-28", "News": "Supported byA 39-year-old Wall Street executive, Andrew Caspersen came from a life of privilege and opportunity: Groton, Princeton and then Harvard Law School, where the student center is named after his family because of a generous gift from his father.But the father had a secret that emerged only after he committed suicide in 2009: Finn M.W. Caspersen, a noted financier and philanthropist, was at the time being investigated by federal authorities, suspected of hiding tens of millions of dollars in a tax shelter.Now it appears that his son, a former Blackstone Group managing principal, may have had his own secret.Andrew Caspersen was arrested at La Guardia Airport on Saturday evening. On Monday, federal prosecutors working for Preet Bharara, the United States attorney for Manhattan, charged him in a criminal complaint with securities and wire fraud in what they called a \u201cbrazen\u201d scheme to defraud investors \u2014 including a foundation affiliated with a major New York hedge fund \u2014 of up to $95 million.The Securities and Exchange Commission filed parallel civil charges.The authorities contend the executive used a fraudulent investment vehicle and fake emails to dupe the unidentified hedge fund foundation to sink $25 million into the scheme last fall.Up until last week, Mr. Caspersen was still trying to persuade other institutional investors to give him money.So persuasive was his pitch that an employee at the hedge fund firm also invested $400,000 with Mr. Caspersen, who lives with his wife in a home they recently bought in Bronxville, N.Y.But the authorities said that he blew through most of that money \u201cas a result of aggressive options trading\u201d in his personal brokerage account.Daniel Levy, Mr. Caspersen\u2019s lawyer, declined to comment.Mr. Caspersen was a partner at the Park Hill Group, which specializes in raising money for private equity firms and hedge funds. The Manhattan firm fired Mr. Caspersen on Monday and promptly removed his profile from its website.The S.E.C. said that Andrew Caspersen, a partner at Park Hill, solicited $95 million to invest in a shell company.Until last fall, Park Hill was part of the sprawling empire of the private equity giant the Blackstone Group. It is now part of PJT Partners, the advisory firm that was spun out of Blackstone and is run by the investment banker Paul J. Taubman. PJT said in statement that it was \u201cstunned and outraged\u201d to learn of the allegations. The firm added that it was cooperating with the authorities.The case highlights the broader issue of how much research and checking institutional investors actually do when making an investment, and how much of it comes down to a personal connection and trust.\u201cThis action amply demonstrates that even sophisticated institutional investors are not immune to financial scams,\u201d said Andrew M. Calamari, director of the New York office of the Securities and Exchange Commission, which brought a civil complaint against Mr. Caspersen.It may also raise questions about the internal controls in place at Park Hill, given that the authorities say Mr. Caspersen\u2019s scheme went on for months before it was detected.Shares of PJT Partners plunged nearly 11 percent on the news of the charges. Late Monday, Block & Leviton, the securities litigation firm, said it was investigating whether PJT and its officers and directors violated federal securities laws. The firm represents large institutional investors.PJT said it believed Mr. Caspersen acted on his own. After learning of potential improper behavior, the firm conducted an internal investigation and reported the matter to federal prosecutors in Manhattan.Mr. Caspersen grew up mainly in an exclusive suburb in western New Jersey before attending the Groton School in Massachusetts, one of the most expensive boarding schools in the country. He was a captain of the football team and he also rowed.After graduating from Groton in 1995, he went to Princeton University where he met Catherine F. MacRae, who was the daughter of a founding partner of the law firm LeBoeuf, Lamb, Greene & MacRae, which later merged to form Dewey & LeBoeuf. The two dated for several years.Ms. MacRae, a research analyst at Fred Alger Management, was killed on Sept. 11, 2001, when terrorists crashed two planes into the World Trade Center. She had worked in Fred Alger\u2019s offices on the 93rd floor of the north tower.Together with Ms. MacRae\u2019s family, Mr. Caspersen created a memorial fund to benefit education programs for children from low-income families.Mr. Caspersen\u2019s father, Finn M.W. Caspersen, was a prominent philanthropist and the heir to the Beneficial Corporation fortune. The elder Mr. Caspersen was chairman and chief executive of the consumer finance company for nearly two decades before selling the firm in 1998 for $8.6 billion to Household International, which was later acquired by the London-based bank HSBC.In 2008, Finn Caspersen pledged $30 million to Harvard Law. A year later, he killed himself at age 67 with a single gunshot to the head. About 800 people attended his funeral in Morristown, N.J.Mr. Caspersen was known to be battling kidney cancer when he killed himself. But soon after it emerged that his name had surfaced in a federal government crackdown on overseas banks that were helping wealthy Americans shelter money to avoid paying taxes.Finn Caspersen was an active supporter of New Jersey Republicans like former Gov. Tom Kean. Mr. Caspersen was also well known in equestrian circles and was said to have competed with Prince Philip, the husband of Queen Elizabeth, in Windsor, England.The scheme of the younger Mr. Caspersen, federal authorities say, began last summer and ended only a few weeks ago. It is not clear why the executive, who arguably was successful and wealthy in his own right, may have needed the money.Still, last summer Mr. Caspersen, who had previously lived on the Upper East Side of Manhattan, set up a shell company called Irving Place III SPV LLC that he soon began seeking to raise money for from institutional investors, the authorities said.The shell company was similar to the name of a legitimate investment vehicle that Park Hill was raising money for at the time called Irving Place Capital Partners III SPV. Irving Place Capital was originally a private equity fund of Bear Stearns, the Wall Street firm that imploded in 2008.Mr. Caspersen, who previously worked for Coller Capital, a fund that buys private equity fund assets, never told prospective investors the shell company was controlled completely by him, the authorities said. Mr. Caspersen made up email accounts and invented employees and even went as far as to create a fake domain name to further the scheme, they said.The scheme began to fall apart this month when the foundation affiliated with the hedge fund asked for its $25 million plus interest to be returned, the authorities said. On March 11, Mr. Caspersen said the funds would be returned by the end of the month. The foundation has not yet received the money, the authorities said.A few days later, on March 14, Park Hill learned that Mr. Caspersen was raising money for his own investment vehicle when an unidentified firm complained about it. Park Hill then hired lawyers from Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison, including litigation partner Aidan Synnott, to conduct an internal investigation. The law firm notified federal prosecutors of its findings the next day.By March 18, authorities said the account where the hedge fund\u2019s foundation had wired its $25 million had a balance of roughly $40,000.Mr. Caspersen was released on Monday after he posted a $5 million bond co-signed by three people and secured by two residences.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "You\u2019ve Bought a Small Business. Now What?", "Date": "2016-03-16", "News": "Supported byIt was just six months ago that three venture capitalists, Trish, James and Palmer Higgins, took the biggest leap of their relatively young lives.After a year researching 1,000 businesses, holding 75 conference calls and visiting prospects coast to coast, they made a decision. They would put their money \u2014 and their hearts \u2014 not into some cool Silicon Valley tech upstart or e-commerce innovator but into a snow removal and landscaping operation in Portland, Me.So now, with a half-year and a comparatively mild winter behind them, how is it going? What might the difference be between expectations for a new business and the reality? The question is one new business owners face all the time.\u201cIt\u2019s easy to put together a grand strategy,\u201d said Ms. Higgins, 30, who bought the business with her husband, James, 31, and his brother, Palmer, 28. \u201cThe big challenge is executing the day-to-day operation.\u201dWhile most people tend to think of start-ups as a way to be your own boss, an increasing number of people \u2014 some fresh out of business school and others looking for a second career \u2014 are buying small businesses, or buying into them.Such small business may not be as trendy as start-ups, but for many eager to be their own bosses, they can be more rewarding than working in the corporate world.The Small Business Administration has no specific numbers of success rates among buyers of operating small businesses. However, Natalia Olson-Urtecho, mid-Atlantic regional director of the agency, said they were probably much higher than among owners of start-ups, because most businesses will not find buyers if they are not viable.\u201cIf you buy an existing successful business, it already has a client base,\u201d said Ed Pendarvis, founder of Sunbelt Business Brokers, a company that brokers deals between small-business buyers and sellers.If Entrepreneurship Through Acquisition, the class taught by Royce Yudkoff and Richard Ruback, professors at Harvard Business School, is any evidence, interest in small-business acquisition is growing rapidly. Five years ago, when they first offered the class, only a handful of students were interested. Last year 270 students took the course.The Higgins group invested between $5 million and $10 million in Seabreeze Property Services, but declined to disclose an exact price.The Kellys, who have owned the business for 20 years, run the day-to-day operation, while the Higginses are developing an overarching expansion strategy.The Kellys talked to dozens of people about a possible partnership over the years \u201cto get to the next level,\u201d Pete Kelly, 46, said. Then things clicked with the Higginses.\u201cThis was a marriage,\u201d John Kelly, 51, said. \u201cIf it wasn\u2019t the right fit, we never would have partnered up.\u201dMs. Higgins agreed. \u201cWe couldn\u2019t do what they do, and they couldn\u2019t do what we do,\u201d she said.And while the Kellys and Higginses speak enthusiastically of the partnership, even honeymoons have problems. For one thing, Seabreeze had no comprehensive database for properties it services.\u201cIt may sound easy, but most of the work is in a very tight circle around Portland,\u201d James Higgins said. \u201cThey kept track of properties via nicknames, and the senior people know what to do and have all the knowledge in their heads, so something as simple as an address isn\u2019t written down. We\u2019re plotting it out.\u201dPalmer Higgins said one of the first challenges was transferring a whiteboard system that specifies who is working on what property into a computerized system.\u201cI knew it would be a big project and, if done well, would be a huge boon, but it\u2019s not a simple thing,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you change this, you have to change that and this and this. It\u2019s like pulling a string.\u201dSo they have had to contain their eagerness to rush forward, and have postponed the new computer system.Acquiring a business and keeping the original owners on as partners is less typical than taking over completely, and has its advantages and disadvantages.\u201cThe positive is that you have someone deeply experienced in the business,\u201d Professor Yudkoff said. But owners have \u201coperated as entrepreneurs who are answerable to no one,\u201d he said. \u201cIt can be hard to change that.\u201dRandy Shayler, who bought a musical instrument rental company in Reading, Pa., took over the entire ownership of the 93-year-old business, Zeswitz Music, three years ago. He was a management consultant before attending Harvard Business School, and thought he would probably run his own company later.It was not until he took Entrepreneurship Through Acquisition that he realized it could be the next step in his career.After looking at about 200 possibilities and seriously considering six, he settled on Zeswitz, which he bought for several million dollars, using a Small Business Administration loan and investments from the very people who inspired his decision, Professors Yudkoff and Ruback. They have invested in the businesses of eight former students.Although the owner no longer helps run the company, \u201cshe is a great resource,\u201d Mr. Shayler, 31, said, as is the highly experienced work force.His business has grown significantly, he said, and he attributes that to spending several days a week doing sales calls at schools, and improving the quality of the instruments, their repairs and tracking the numbers.\u201cI know that 98 percent of repairs go back out in two weeks,\u201d Mr. Shayler said. \u201cI don\u2019t think that was tracked before.\u201dDevin Mackoff, 30, like the Higginses, was featured in The Times article six months ago, right after he bought a landscaping company, Landscape Cod, on Cape Cod. He put $150,000 down and guaranteed the sellers about 10 percent of the revenue over the next three years. After a hectic summer, the winter gave him much-needed time to regroup.He decided to shift his business more toward gardening and project work and away from landscape maintenance. After some employees left him in the lurch, he said he was seeking a better way to recruit and keep staff.\u201cWe grew the business 10 percent last year, which is good, but I really needed the break to step back and say, \u2018This is working and this isn\u2019t.\u2019 \u201d he said. \u201cI need to have more people on deck rather than scrambling for them if someone just quits by text. I want people who want to work.\u201dBuying a small business, unlike creating a start-up, means inheriting someone else\u2019s procedures, decisions and vision. And it may take a while not only to create a new vision, but also to determine the best way to get there.\u201cWe realize that even if we know where we want to go,\u201d Ms. Higgins said, \u201cwe still have to figure out the right pace.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Retirees Win Lengthy Pension Fight With Renco\u2019s Ira Rennert", "Date": "2016-03-04", "News": "Supported byThe retirees\u2019 victory is only the second time in 42 years that the federal Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation has required a company to unwind a pension \u201ctermination\u201d \u2014 a dreaded deal in which a bankrupt company cuts off a pension fund and leaves it for the government to take over. The government insures company pensions, but its insurance is limited, so retirees can face sharp losses.Tom Reeder, executive director of the pension insurer, called the settlement \u201can extraordinary outcome for plan participants\u201d because it is so rare for pensions to be cut and then restored to their original value.The settlement dates the restoration to November 2012, the termination date, and is meant eventually to make the retirees whole for the money they missed in the period when their benefits were reduced. Mr. Reeder also said Renco had agreed to reimburse the pension agency for its outlays.In a statement, the company denied any liability or wrongdoing. It said that the \u201csettlement with P.B.G.C. was the most sensible, economic and practical resolution to the dispute, and it puts an end to the significant expense and distraction of continued litigation.\u201dTypically, the federal agency takes over a failing pension plan if a judge rules that doing so is the only way a company can possibly restructure. The agency has taken that step for more than 4,600 pension plans since its founding in 1974. The retirees then typically get their checks from the agency for the rest of their lives.But the R. G. Steel bankruptcy was far from typical. R. G. Steel was more or less like the bankrupt offspring of a superrich parent. In cases like that, special rules kick in \u2014 in particular, a rule that the wealthy corporate parent and any brethren under the same corporate control are jointly responsible for the pension troubles of their bankrupt kin.In Mr. Rennert\u2019s case, that meant exposure, not just for his conglomerate of mines, smelters and assembly lines as far away as Peru, but also for his palatial home in Sagaponack on Long Island, reported to be the largest occupied single-family residence in the United States.The house, known as Fair Field, sprawls across 62,000 square feet on a 64-acre seaside plot. Its assessed value last year was $248 million \u2014 more than three times the shortfall in R. G. Steel\u2019s pension fund when the company went bankrupt. And Fair Field\u2019s legal owner, a private company, Blue Turtles, is also controlled by the Renco Group and thus jointly liable for the steel company\u2019s pensions.In what appears to be coincidence, the assessed value of Fair Field then was $185 million, almost exactly the amount the pension fund was short. But Renco eventually agreed to pay the WCI Steel retirees their pensions, even though it lost control of the bankrupt company. Its pension fears allayed, the government backed off.By 2012, something similar seemed to be happening at R. G. Steel. Renco bought it in 2011 for $1.2 billion. It had a pension that was underfunded by nearly $70 million. In 2012, it was declared bankrupt.Shortly before the bankruptcy, Mr. Rennert\u2019s company went looking for new financing for the subsidiary. The deal it eventually struck called for Cerberus, the private equity group, to buy a 24.5 percent equity stake in R. G. Steel.The Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation said the deal was intended not to revive R. G. Steel but to reduce Renco\u2019s ownership stake from 100 percent to less than 80 percent \u2014 the cutoff for being included in the so-called controlled group that is jointly responsible for pension obligations.The company denied that had been its intent, saying in its statement that it had \u201cacted appropriately and within its rights when it concluded a financing transaction that had the incidental effect of releasing Renco from liability for R. G. Steel\u2019s pension plans.\u201dIn addition, the statement said, \u201cThe singular purpose of Renco\u2019s efforts to obtain financing for R. G. Steel was to solve the company\u2019s liquidity problem and save it from bankruptcy.\u201dThe government also said that Renco had lied when asked about the transaction, to keep the pension insurer from finding out about the ownership change until it was too late. Once a controlled group has been broken, the pension agency loses its ability to go after the parent company\u2019s assets.When R. G.

{"Headline": "FIFA\u2019s Financial Disclosures Show That Scandal Has Affected Its Bottom Line", "Date": "2016-03-17", "News": "Supported byCaught up in international investigations and armed with top white-collar lawyers and consultants, FIFA made financial disclosures on Thursday that showed just how high the cost of scandal has been for world soccer\u2019s governing body.For the first time in 13 years, FIFA, a nonprofit association, reported a loss ($122 million) in 2015, a year in which it spent seven months reacting to a continuing corruption case in the United States and a parallel criminal inquiry in Switzerland.Since last summer, lawyers from Quinn Emanuel and consultants from Teneo Holdings have flown between the United States and Switzerland, steering FIFA and dealing with criminal authorities and the news media. Their services have come at a price: FIFA\u2019s expenses rose to $1.3 billion, $62 million of which was spent on legal fees, the report said.Issa Hayatou, the chairman of FIFA\u2019s finance committee, called 2015 \u201ca very challenging year that has shaken global football governance to its core\u201d in the report. He added, \u201cThere may be further challenges ahead, and it will take time for the new reforms to take effect, but we aim to establish a trusted, professional and fully accountable sports organization by the time of the 2018 FIFA World Cup in Russia.\u201dIn spite of last year\u2019s losses, FIFA is not hurting. The organization has $1.34 billion in cash reserves, something FIFA\u2019s new president, Gianni Infantino, called critical to FIFA\u2019s \u201cfinancial independence and to its ability to react to unexpected events.\u201dAnother event, perhaps not so unexpected for FIFA\u2019s current leadership, came on Thursday, when the office of Switzerland\u2019s attorney general announced that it had opened a criminal investigation into J\u00e9r\u00f4me Valcke, the former second-ranking official at FIFA. Prosecutors did so in response to two criminal complaints they had received.The Swiss authorities said their inquiry into Mr. Valcke, which centers on \u201csuspicion of various acts of criminal mismanagement,\u201d was informed by the work of FIFA\u2019s own ethics committee, which turned over information to the authorities earlier this year. On Thursday, the attorney general\u2019s office said, investigators conducted searches and interviews, but made no arrests.Both Mr. Valcke and his former boss, Sepp Blatter, FIFA\u2019s longtime president until last month, figured into Thursday\u2019s financial report, with their salaries publicly disclosed for the first time. Mr. Blatter\u2019s total compensation was revealed to be $3.6 million, and Mr. Valcke\u2019s $2.1 million.With Thursday\u2019s announcement, Mr. Valcke joins Mr. Blatter as a criminal suspect in Switzerland. Last September, Swiss authorities similarly trumpeted their investigation into Mr. Blatter. That inquiry has produced no charges to date.Because Mr. Valcke and Mr. Blatter have been named as suspects in Switzerland, the law allows them access to investigators\u2019 files on them, offering each man a window into the inquiries as they proceed.An article on Friday about financial disclosures made by FIFA, soccer\u2019s world governing body, misstated the amount of its cash reserves. It is $1.34 billion, not $1.34 million.Advertisement"}

Mr. Thorburn, a financial adviser in the bank\u2019s wealth management division, had not received approval before pursuing the hat endeavor.Goldman, according to people briefed on the situation but not authorized to speak on the record, put Mr. Thorburn on paid administrative leave last week after he was interviewed by company officials about details that appeared in The Times\u2019s article.These people say that Mr. Thorburn sought to distance himself from the website. Ultimately, the bank became concerned about apparent inconsistencies in Mr. Thorburn\u2019s story, and placed him on leave, they said.Mr. Thorburn did not respond to requests for comment. A person who answered his phone at Goldman said he was not expected at work on Monday. Andrew Williams, a spokesman for Goldman, declined to comment.Hope Hicks, a spokeswoman for Mr. Trump, a Republican, said, \u201cWe are not involved in any way and do not wish to be.\u201d She added that the Trump campaign did not know Mr. Thorburn and was not familiar with Goldman\u2019s personnel policies.In an email last week, Ms. Hicks speculated on the reason behind Mr. Thorburn\u2019s donation. \u201cIt is more than likely the $534 dollars was the result of him purchasing campaign merchandise, which is characterized as a campaign contribution by the F.E.C.,\u201d she wrote.Mr. Thorburn\u2019s contribution stands out as unusual, considering how active Wall Street has been elsewhere in the 2016 presidential race.As of last week, for instance, Goldman employees had contributed more than $199,000 to the campaign of Senator Marco Rubio of Florida, a Republican, and more than $94,000 to that of Hillary Clinton, a Democrat. By contrast, Mr. Trump, who is largely financing his own campaign, has not actively solicited donations from Wall Street.Because of an editing error, an earlier version of this article misstated the disciplinary action taken against a Goldman Sachs employee for his ties to a website selling hats that resemble Donald J. Trump\u2019s \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d caps. The employee, Luke Thorburn, was placed on paid administrative leave, not unpaid.Advertisement"}

Trump here, Bernie Sanders defended the demonstrators and pointedly attacked the city\u2019s mayor, Rahm Emanuel, for closing schools and firing teachers.The Vermont senator, in the midst of a tour across the Midwest ahead of Tuesday\u00e2\u0080\u0099s elections, spoke to reporters Saturday and called on Mr. Trump to denounce the increasingly aggressive behavior of his supporters at many of the Republican front-runner\u00e2\u0080\u0099s events. Mr. Sanders also took aim at his rival, Hillary Clinton.\u00e2\u0080\u009cHillary Clinton proudly lists Mayor Rahm Emanuel as one of her leading mayoral endorsers,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Sanders said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWell let me be as clear as I can be: based on his disastrous record as mayor of the city of Chicago, I do not want Mayor Emanuel\u00e2\u0080\u0099s endorsement if I win the Democratic nomination.\u00e2\u0080\u009dMr. Sanders went on to say that Mr. Emanuel was not the type of leader that he would want to be connected with because the mayor has closed schools and fired teachers while keeping close ties with Wall Street banks. Mr. Sanders also criticized the city for paying banks that  \u00e2\u0080\u009clured the school system into a risky investment in an exotic debt-financing scheme.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe city of Chicago should sue these banks for fraud and put public pressure on these wealthy bankers to protect Chicago\u00e2\u0080\u0099s most precious asset \u00e2\u0080\u0093 its children,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Sanders said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe reality is that there wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be a budget shortfall if Chicago had refused to pay Wall Street banks like Goldman Sachs and Bank of America over $500 million for risky financial schemes that were marketed as a way to finance the public school system.\u00e2\u0080\u009dThe senator stopped short of calling for Mr. Emanuel to resign. But he said that if he lived in Chicago, he would join the efforts to have him step down. Many Sanders supporters in Chicago have been demanding the mayor resign for months.Adam Collins, a spokesman for Mr. Emanuel, said in a statement Saturday night that Mr. Sanders\u2019s comments were \u201cthe kind of typical campaign rhetoric you get this time of year.\u201d \u201cThe Mayor is proud to have actually implemented a program to provide free college tuition in Chicago, instead of just talking about the idea,\u201d Mr. Collins said. \u201cOn Wednesday Bernie Sanders will leave town and take his empty promises with him, and Mayor Emanuel will be right here doing the hard work to move Chicago forward and create opportunities for our residents.\u201dMr. Sanders also defended his supporters who were protesting Mr. Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s rally on Friday, which was eventually canceled. The senator rejected claims that the protesters were  inciting violence, as some Trump supporters have suggested.\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat our supporters are doing is responding to a candidate who has in fact, in many ways, encouraged violence,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Sanders said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhen he talks about, you know, \u2018I wish we were in the old days when you could punch somebody in the head,\u2019 what do you think that says to his supporters?\u00e2\u0080\u009dMr. Sanders said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cDonald Trump has got to be loud and clear and tell his supporters that violence at rallies is not what America is about and to end it.\u00e2\u0080\u009dSoon after speaking to reporters, Mr. Sanders sat down with the Rev. Jesse L. Jackson at his civil rights organization, the Rainbow PUSH Coalition.

{"Headline": "Wave of Indigenous Suicides Leaves Canadian Town Appealing for Help", "Date": "2016-03-18", "News": "Supported byLeaders of an indigenous community in rural Canada have appealed to national authorities for help after a wave of suicides and attempted suicides set off a public health crisis in their remote town and revived a painful conversation about the relationship between the government and its native communities.Six people have killed themselves in the past three months, and more than 140 more have attempted suicide or expressed a desire to kill themselves in the Cree Indian community of Cross Lake, with a population of about 6,000.The area has been racked by an unemployment rate of nearly 85 percent, deep poverty and a profound sense of alienation from the wealthy, majority-white cities of southern Canada, officials said.The suicides began on Dec. 12, when a homeless woman in her early 20s hanged herself in a relative\u2019s home, said Donnie McKay, a local councilor. The death began a disturbing trend in Cross Lake, the hub of the Pimicikamak Cree Nation in the vast coniferous wilderness of Manitoba.\u201cIt\u2019s been very difficult for the people of our nation,\u201d Mr. McKay said. \u201cThere is a lot of grief and sorrow.\u201dFive more people in their teens, 20s and 30s have killed themselves since that first death, Mr. McKay said. Part of the problem, he said, is that the area has too few jobs and too little government investment.\u201cIf this was a suburb of Toronto, there would have been top-notch psychiatric services here right away,\u201d said Helga Hamilton, the town\u2019s health director.Ms. Hamilton said residents receive \u201cbare minimum\u201d services through Health Canada, the national public health department. The current crisis, like previous suicide epidemics in the town in 1999 and 1987, is the result of problems generations in the making, she said.\u201cAboriginal people are in crisis in Canada,\u201d said Cathy Merrick, the chief of the Cross Lake Band of Indians.Cross Lake is served by two doctors who commute on Monday and Friday from the capital, Winnipeg, 450 miles away, Mr. McKay said. A therapist also travels from Winnipeg to work a few days at a time, Ms. Hamilton said. No health care professionals live in the town seven days a week, officials said. The nearest pediatrician is a three-hour drive away, and the closest hospital is in Winnipeg, eight hours away.Ms. Hamilton said the town\u2019s only full-time mental health worker has no medical or psychological training, just a bachelor\u2019s degree in social work.\u201cShe is a godsend, but I wish we had 20 of her,\u201d she said. \u201cShe is still going, keeping it together, but she is only one person. We need professional psychological services.\u201dIn the absence of that, Mr. McKay said, people have adopted an all-hands-on-deck approach to the crisis, with local politicians being called upon to act as ad hoc suicide prevention counselors.\u201cA mayor in any other town doesn\u2019t have to worry about responding personally to an emergency call at 2 or 3 o\u2019clock in the morning, but we have to do that here because there are just no resources,\u201d he said. \u201cThe mayor of Toronto would never do that. They sleep peacefully at night, but we don\u2019t.\u201dDavid Muswaggon, a member of the Executive Council of Pimicikamak, and other leaders said the crisis also pointed to the lingering trauma of colonialism and prejudice, which he called \u201ccultural genocide.\u201d\u201cThe assimilation process did real damage, and Canada is just beginning to acknowledge that,\u201d Ms. Hamilton said. \u201cThe issue here is much deeper than just mental health.\u201dCarolyn Bennett, Canada\u2019s minister of indigenous and northern affairs, said in a statement that federal and provincial authorities were working to improve services to remote communities like Cross Lake. She said improving the lives of young indigenous people was vital for the country\u2019s future.Chief Merrick met in recent days with officials from the provincial government and Manitoba Hydro, a large local energy company, which together agreed to provide $1.1 million in the short term to finance expanded medical care, a crisis hotline and youth recreation activities, she said.Health Canada said in a statement that it responded to the string of suicides by providing additional mental health services to the town in February and March. It also said it allots more than $840,000 a year to the community, including $46,000 for a youth suicide prevention program.The town spent those funds on \u201ca community crisis line, a sweat lodge, traditional teachings, and traditional hunting activities,\u201d the statement said.But community leaders said more was needed given the scope of the town\u2019s problems, including sustained investment in job creation or expanded health care. Ms. Hamilton said the government\u2019s response to the suicides reminded her of how it handled the two earlier crises.\u201cNothing has changed since then,\u201d she said. \u201cThey did then what they\u2019re doing right now, but I want the long-term. What is going to impact our youth in a positive way?\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Letting (Some of) India\u2019s Women Own Land", "Date": "2016-03-22", "News": "This month, 600 women gathered under a huge blue-and-yellow-striped tent in Baripada, a small city in Odisha, a state in India\u00e2\u0080\u0099s east. They were among India\u00e2\u0080\u0099s most neglected people. Widowed, abandoned or divorced, many had ended up living like servants in the households of their fathers, brothers or in-laws.But on March 5, each woman clutched a single light-green sheet of paper that would change her life: a patta, or title to a small plot of land.The women were among 1,800 getting pattas that day across the district. The documents were hard-won. The battle for women\u00e2\u0080\u0099s land rights in India pits progressive law against oppressive culture \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and the culture has largely prevailed. But the pattas show that small victories for law are also possible.The consequences are enormous. Without title, female farmers acting on their own don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have access to credit, subsidies, government programs for seeds, irrigation or fertilizer. They cannot get loans and do not invest to improve their yields. They live in fear that someone more powerful \u00e2\u0080\u0094 which is everyone \u00e2\u0080\u0094 can kick them off their land.When women\u00e2\u0080\u0099s incomes suffer, so do their children. More than 40 percent of all children under 5 in India are malnourished. And India\u00e2\u0080\u0099s agricultural productivity is needlessly diminished.Landlessness also raises the risk of domestic violence, said Bina Agarwal, a longtime professor at the Institute of Economic Growth at the University of Delhi, and now a professor of development economics and environment at the University of Manchester in Britain. In 1994, Agarwal wrote \u00e2\u0080\u009cA Field of One\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Own,\u00e2\u0080\u009d arguing that landlessness is the single most important factor in the second-class citizenship of women in India.\u00c2\u00a0The book became the founding document of the women\u00e2\u0080\u0099s land-rights movement. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIf a woman owns land, the husband would know that the woman has an alternative place to go. It hugely increases women\u00e2\u0080\u0099s bargaining power within marriage,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cShe knows she has an exit option that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s credible.\u00e2\u0080\u009dLandlessness is both a cause and a product of women\u00e2\u0080\u0099s subjugation. In most of India, a bride becomes part of her husband\u00e2\u0080\u0099s family, living in his parents\u00e2\u0080\u0099 house. Her possessions pass to them. A son, by contrast, brings his wife to his parents\u00e2\u0080\u0099 house. So if parents want to keep property in the family and reward the child who supports them in their old age, they leave land to their sons. (Paying dowry to the daughter\u00e2\u0080\u0099s new family is the customary substitute for leaving her land.)Agarwal said that women owned a higher percentage of the land in places where local culture permitted a woman to bring her husband into her family, marry a cousin, or marry inside her village and stay there. That way, a daughter\u00e2\u0080\u0099s land stays in the family, or at least nearby.India\u00e2\u0080\u0099s attitudes toward women and land remain a bewildering mixture of progress toward modern standards and centuries of discrimination.Some land records don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t even have a place to enter a woman\u00e2\u0080\u0099s name, said Patnaik.To the state, these women were invisible. And there were a lot of them. Rajesh Patil, the administrative chief of Odisha\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Mayurbhanj district, said they turned out to be about 12 percent of the district\u00e2\u0080\u0099s population of rural women. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThey survive on the mercy of their in-laws or parents,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Patil. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt is a substandard life.\u00e2\u0080\u009dThen the government and Landesa established desks in local government buildings. They were called Women Support Centers, run by trained officials \u00e2\u0080\u0094 women, usually.About 5,200 of these invisible women so far have gotten pattas, mostly in ceremonies like the one March 5.\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0 And there are now 76 Women Support Centers.The program has helped to raise political awareness about these women, said Patil.\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe district is seriously thinking now about policies for single women,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s been possible because this program highlighted the issues.\u00e2\u0080\u009dHaving a patta brings the women into formal India. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt is a historical document for their residence in that locality,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Patil. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt is a residence certificate, a caste certificate. They can take out loans against the land to develop it.\u00e2\u0080\u009d They can start the process for a pension. School attendance increases among their children.Perhaps most important, the land gives them social status, autonomy and self-esteem. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThey have something of their own,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Patil.Read previous contributions to this series.Shilpa Vasavada, a longtime leader who is the organization\u00e2\u0080\u0099s convener, said that when the group conducted workshops with village women, \u00e2\u0080\u009c99 percent agreed there was no option of women owning land. Legally they had the right, but nobody knew about it.\u00e2\u0080\u009d That was relatively easy to solve. Much harder: Even when they knew, they were afraid to try.The group began training village women with at least a fifth-grade education to work as paralegals, to tell women about their rights and help them with their cases.\u00e2\u0080\u009cOriginally, we assumed that we\u00e2\u0080\u0098d have to work with the men to change their perception,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Vasavada. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThat was true. But it turned out we also had to work with rural women to change their perception.\u00e2\u0080\u009dIn Landesa\u00e2\u0080\u0099s three-state study, women wanted to own land. But they didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want to inherit it from their parents, because they didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want to incur the hostility of their brothers, whose help they might need if their marriages fell apart.Vasavada said that women often signed their land rights over to a brother. Sometimes this was under duress, but often no overt threat was needed: women understood the perils.\u00e2\u0080\u009cA woman who fights can be ostracized by her family,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Vasavada. \u00e2\u0080\u009cOne widow took six years to fight her case. She won. But during the battle it was hell, and she was living with, and dependent on, the people she was fighting.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00e2\u0080\u009cInitially, only a few people came,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Patnaik. \u00e2\u0080\u009cNow, more and more are coming and we have heard women claiming their rights. There are some examples of women who are not afraid of talking about land with their husbands.\u00e2\u0080\u009dThe state of Uttar Pradesh has initiated its version of the programs, and two others, Bihar and Jharkhand, are preparing to replicate part of what Odisha is doing.More From Fixes \u00bbMore From Private Lives \u00bbMore From Couch \u00bbMore From The Stone \u00bbMore From Moviegoers \u00bbMore From The End \u00bbMore From Draft \u00bbMore From Anxiety \u00bbMore From Menagerie \u00bbMore From Disunion \u00bbMore From Bedside \u00bbMore From The Conversation \u00bbMore From The Great Divide \u00bbMore From Errol Morris \u00bbFollowAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Brazen Heist of Millions Puts Focus on the Philippines", "Date": "2016-03-16", "News": "Supported byThe country\u2019s investigators are now looking into how the money came to be transferred to that Pacific nation \u2014 and what happened to it afterward. The trip, which appears to jump from Philippine banks to the country\u2019s lightly regulated casinos and then to points unknown, touches on a number of pressure points where United States officials and experts say the country is vulnerable to potential corruption and money-laundering.Specifically, they point to the country\u2019s increasingly flush casino industry, which is exempt from many of the anti-money-laundering requirements in the Philippines. The Philippines also retains what one United States official once called some of the world\u2019s toughest bank secrecy laws, recalling a time before the rise of concerns about terrorism financing and tax evasion, when countries promised privacy in the hopes of becoming financial hubs.\u201cThey picked us to launder this money because our system is full of loopholes,\u201d Sergio R. Osme\u00f1a III, a Philippine senator who leads a committee on banks and financial institutions, said in an interview on Wednesday. \u201cWe have been trying to amend these laws for decades, but we can\u2019t get it through congress.\u201dThe New York Fed has said that the transfer requests came through official channels and that any security breach most likely came from Bangladesh. Officials who run the global money transfer system known as Swift said its systems had not been breached and said the matter was an internal issue at Bangladesh\u2019s central bank.In the Philippines, lawmakers this week questioned employees of local banks that had processed the transfers. They expressed frustration during that hearing at bank employees who declined to answer questions and cited their rights against self-incrimination.At this point, it is unclear exactly what went wrong and where the system broke down. But the people behind the theft made mistakes and tripped alarms.In early February, they requested that more than $100 million in money that Bangladesh keeps at the New York Fed be transferred out. On one transfer request, they misspelled the word \u201cfoundation,\u201d as \u201cfandation,\u201d putting a halt to about $20 million they tried to move to Sri Lanka.It is not clear whether the New York Fed spotted the typos, or failed to spot them.The culprits appear to have made off with about $81 million transferred to the Philippines, raising broader concerns about the country\u2019s financial controls.The Philippines \u2014 a close American ally and a crucial part of Washington\u2019s efforts to counter China\u2019s growing regional might \u2014 has moved in recent years to bring its disclosure requirements around the movement of large funds into line with international standards. It has enacted legislation against money laundering and set up a dedicated regulatory body to handle violations.But experts and American officials say it remains a difficult place to catch money launderers.\u201cThe small number of prosecutions and convictions,\u201d the report said, \u201cis telling.\u201dMore recent concern has focused on the Philippines\u2019 casinos. They are exempt from the anti-money-laundering law, meaning they are not required to report suspicious transactions.\u201cA good reason for targeting the Philippines could be the unusual situation where casinos have not been required to comply with the same anti-money-laundering regime that governs the banking system,\u201d said Paul Bromberg, the chief executive of Spectrum Asia, an investigative and gambling industry consultancy. \u201cOmitting the gaming industry from the formal compliance regime has been quite controversial.\u201dBuilt to rival Macau and other Asian gambling hubs, the Philippines\u2019 casino sector has had some success in attracting large-scale foreign investment. Three huge casino hotels have opened on the outskirts of Manila in recent years. With a required minimum investment of $1 billion each, they are the first such properties in the country to approach the size and scope of Las Vegas-style resorts.The new casinos have helped to lure some high rollers, known as V.I.P. gamblers, from mainland China to the Philippines, increasing total gambling revenue to nearly $3 billion last year. That compares with about $30 billion in Macau and $5 billion in Singapore last year.Money from the Bangladesh central bank ended up being transferred to one of the Philippines\u2019 newer casinos, Solaire, lawmakers learned in the hearing on Tuesday.Mr. Xu\u2019s nationality was not clear, and he couldn\u2019t be reached for comment.Mr. Osme\u00f1a, the senator, said the operators of the casinos involved are being invited to testify at a Senate hearing on Thursday to try to trace the money.\u201cThe casinos here in the Philippines are a black hole,\u201d he said. \u201cOnce the money goes in there, it is gone.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "In the Bizarro World of Negative Interest Rates, Saving Will Cost You", "Date": "2016-03-05", "News": "Supported byStrategiesHere\u2019s a proposition for you: Hand over your money. I\u2019ll skim some off the top, hold it for a while and return whatever is left in a year or two.Until a few years ago, that\u2019s the kind of offer a gangster might have made. In the world as we\u2019ve known it, if you lend someone your cash you expect to receive something \u2014 typically, interest \u2014 in return.But something radically different is afoot today. It\u2019s called negative interest \u2014 and it is an inversion of the traditional relationship between lenders and borrowers.\u201cIt\u2019s all upside down,\u201d said Kathy A. Jones, chief fixed-income strategist at Charles Schwab. \u201cNegative interest is hard to even think about. Our whole financial system is built the other way, on positive interest rates. This is mind-boggling.\u201dThe central banks have been going negative to stimulate their relatively weak regional economies and raise inflation levels, which have been perilously low. They hope negative rates will accomplish these goals in three ways. First, the central banks want commercial banks to lend more money at very low interest rates. Second, they want commercial bank customers to borrow more, spend more and save less.There is a third reason, which central bankers rarely enunciate in public: Negative interest rates tend to drive down the value of a country\u2019s currency, making its exports cheaper and more competitive in global markets.In the United States, Federal Reserve officials say they might use negative interest rates in a future crisis, but they don\u2019t expect to install them here anytime soon. Nonetheless, global markets are tightly linked, and negative rates in Europe and Asia are already influencing financial markets here, in that way affecting the lives of ordinary people.The effects have been mixed: Negative rates on foreign debt have helped keep a wide range of interest rates in the United States unusually low, which translates into good deals for borrowers and bad for ones for lenders, including major banks, whose profit margins have been compressed. For older people trying to live on their bond investments, low rates result in paltry income and painful choices.The unusual conditions defined by negative interest rates also complicate matters for the Federal Reserve, which has begun to raise short-term rates in the United States, only to see longer-term rates decline. That unexpected development is occurring partly because below-zero rates in European and Japanese bond markets have created greater demand for American bonds, raising their prices and driving down yields, which move in an opposite direction. Negative rates have not been common for very long and their consequences aren\u2019t entirely understood.Still, grasping the basics of how negative rates work and how they may be affecting the United States is important for anyone with money in the markets.Negative rates appeared during the global financial crisis in 2008, when yields on some United States Treasury bills fell below zero for brief periods. That happened because so many panicky people wanted to buy Treasuries that their prices soared and their yields dropped into negative territory. In essence, investors were willing to lose a small amount of principal in exchange for the safety. Those negative interest rates were a sign that the financial world was in trouble.Today\u2019s negative rates are not a short-term market anomaly. To the contrary, central banks in Europe and Asia have made negative interest rates part of their official tool kit. The European Central Bank; the central banks of Switzerland, Sweden and Denmark; and, last month, the Japanese central bank have all deliberately set at least some short-term rates below zero \u2014 effectively penalizing commercial banks for depositing funds with them, and giving them a strong incentive to move their money elsewhere.Negative rates abroad have caused another problem for the United States, and, perhaps, created an opportunity.They make it difficult to determine why interest rates in the United States are so low \u2014 much lower than would be expected if the American economy were truly healed from the last recession. Those low rates are a bit of a puzzle given the Fed\u2019s stated intention of continuing to raise short-term rates.Jim Paulsen, chief investment strategist for Wells Capital Management, said in an interview that while these risks were real, barring an unforeseen shock, it was probable that the American economy would continue to strengthen. And if that happens, current American interest rates \u2014 particularly those for inflation-indexed bonds called TIPS \u2014 have been set low. TIPS may be a good investment now because their pricing assumes that the inflation rate will be only about 1.4 percent a year for the next five years \u2014 and, if an economic recovery is in place, inflation is bound to move higher than that, giving investors a tidy profit.A riskier bet could be made with investments in the domestic stock market, which would be likely to rebound significantly if it turned out that despite negative rates abroad, the economy was robust in the United States, he said. \u201cWe would see a rally in a range of risk assets,\u201d he said. \u201cThere would be some real money to be made.\u201d The possibility of significant losses was high, too, he said.Conservative, risk-averse investors find themselves in a hard place. As long as interest rates remain negative for the bonds of major countries like Germany and Japan, it will be difficult for American bond yields to rise much. The safest investments, like 10-year Treasury notes, are providing extraordinarily low yields \u2014 only about 1.9 percent. Junk bonds, with higher yields, are risky when the economy is under stress, Ms. Jones of Schwab says. \u201cWe\u2019re pointing our clients toward a middle ground \u2014 investment-grade corporate bonds,\u201d she said. They provide a modicum of safety and somewhat better yields than government bonds do.That\u2019s not a happy situation. But in some respects it is an upside-down world. Sometimes the best you can do is hold on to your money.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Russia, Light on Cash, Weighs Risks of a Heavy Tax on Oil Giants", "Date": "2016-03-23", "News": "Supported byMemo From RussiaBut the budget strains are worsening as the price decline grinds along, forcing the Kremlin to look for new sources of money \u2014 freezing pensions, withholding wages, raising some taxes, selling off chunks of state-owned companies, even reportedly trimming military outlays.Things have become so tight, insiders say, that the Kremlin is considering cracking open the one piggy bank that was always considered sacrosanct, one that carries long-term consequences for the Russian economy: taxing the funds that oil companies need to invest to ensure future oil production.That move would be the oil industry equivalent of eating the seed corn. The longer the government keeps extracting cash from the crucial oil sector, the greater the damage to the country\u2019s future economic prospects, even if oil prices rebound.\u201cThe only question is the slant of this line,\u201d he said. \u201cThe oil companies are not investing at all in exploration of new deposits because profits on these projects will only come in 10 years. Nobody will invest in these projects.\u201dOver the last two and a half years, the oil industry experienced its deepest downturn since at least the 1990s.This year, new taxes will cost oil companies about 200 billion rubles, or about $2.9 billion. But a far larger tax, reported by Russian news media to be up to $11 billion, is under consideration for the 2017 budget.There is little doubt that Russia needs the money now, and that the oil companies provide an enticing target. Because they are paid in dollars but conduct their domestic business in the battered ruble, Russia\u2019s oil majors have lots of cash. While globally most oil companies are deep in the red, cash reserves industrywide in Russia remain at an estimated $90 billion, a deep and tempting pool for the strapped Kremlin.But Mr. Putin, who personally oversees the energy industries, knows the dangers of taxing the companies too heavily and has long resisted the temptation. \u201cPutin faces a dilemma,\u201d Mr. Krutikhin said.The dilemma stems from the structure of Russia\u2019s oil tax system, which was designed for the state to capture the windfall of profits from high prices of oil and other commodities, rather than leaving them for the country\u2019s oligarchs.The higher the price, the more Russia\u2019s oil companies are paid in taxes. At an oil price of $100 a barrel, for example, the companies were paying taxes of $74, according to Renaissance, a Moscow investment bank. When oil prices collapsed, the government took most of the loss in diminished tax receipts. With oil at $35 a barrel, the tax is about $17, leaving $18 a barrel for the companies \u2014 not too much less than the $30 a barrel they made at the peak.The average cost of producing and transporting a barrel of oil is about $15. Adding a tax of $17 a barrel, when oil is selling for $35, leaves a profit of only $3, a margin that rapidly shrinks as the tax rises, leaving little or nothing to show for an investment.The quandary for the Kremlin is made worse by geology because oil deposits discovered and developed in Soviet times are nearing depletion. The country\u2019s oil future, like that of the United States, lies in offshore and shale projects that are more expensive to develop.Given oil\u2019s outsize role in Russia\u2019s economy, it is no surprise that a fierce fight has erupted over tax policies. The powerful industry and its allies in the Ministry of Energy are resisting tax increases, while equally powerful factions in government want to raise taxes to maintain spending at current levels, not least on the military.A study leaked from the Ministry of Energy, seen as allied with the oil industry, and published last week in the business daily Vedomosti, presented a doomsday scenario. Russia, the analysis predicted, could cease to be an oil power, with output plummeting to half the current level by 2035.The Ministry of Finance, in contrast, has pressed for new taxes on the oil industry as Russia prepares a revised budget for 2016, which is due in June. Vladimir Tikhomirov, chief economist at BCS Financial Group in Moscow, said the government was striving to keep the deficit within the legally required limit of 3 percent of gross domestic product.Even while piling up cash reserves, however, oil companies\u2019 investment rose at a rate of 11 percent, which was lower than inflation of 12.9 percent, last year. \u201cThe response from oil companies has been they will have to cut further into investment programs; otherwise, they will not be able to bring their books into balance,\u201d Mr. Tikhomirov said.Russian companies have not broken ground on a major new field here since the Trebs and Titov, a complex of oil fields in northern Russia, was tapped in 2014 just as Western sanctions took effect and oil prices slumped.Industry lobby groups have pushed back, so far as is possible in Russia\u2019s tightly coiled political system. It would not be the first time oil entered a spiral of declining volumes and rising demands from the state. Short of cash in an oil price downturn in the late Soviet period, the Kremlin squeezed the oil industry. It was deprived of capital, at the time, for such things as imported machines.A diminishing role for the oil industry is not so bad for Russia, politically or economically, Yevgeny G. Yasin, a former minister of economy, said in an interview. Russia should raise taxes on oil companies even if it diminishes the share of extractive industries in the economy in future years, and shift focus to other areas of Russian strength, such as education and science, he said. Instead, the revised budget proposes a 10 percent cut to nonmilitary outlays.\u201cThe United States is successfully developing shale oil so that even if prices go up, it will only lead to more shale oil production\u201d that would compete with new Russian output coming online years from now, Mr. Yasin said.\u201cIf we want Russia to be a developed country, we should orient ourselves toward the innovation economy,\u201d he added.\u201cThe fat years are over.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Tribunal Releases Journalist Held 5 Days in a Prison for War Criminals", "Date": "2016-03-29", "News": "Supported byPARIS \u2014 The United Nations war crimes tribunal for Yugoslavia released a French journalist from its prison in The Hague on Tuesday amid a growing clamor for her freedom by Western news media and human rights activists from the Balkans.The journalist, Florence Hartmann, a former correspondent for Le Monde who had also worked for the tribunal prosecutor, had spent five days in the prison, which is normally reserved for war crimes suspects and convicts.Ms. Hartmann was unexpectedly arrested by United Nations security guards on Thursday outside the court gates while talking with victims from the Bosnian war. The groups had gathered to hear the verdict against Radovan Karadzic, the former Bosnian Serb leader.Ms. Hartmann, 53, tried to resist arrest and was surrounded by Bosnian women trying to protect her. She was told that she had to serve a seven-day sentence because she had not paid a fine in a court judgment against her. She was convicted of contempt of court in 2009 for writing about how tribunal judges had issued confidential decisions ruling that parts of the records provided by Serbia could be used in closed sessions of the court but had to be kept out of the public eye.It meant that Serbia could black out parts of its military archives and minutes of wartime meetings that could prove the extent of Serbia\u2019s role in the Bosnian war in terms of financing, supplies and forces.Ms. Hartmann, in publishing the confidential decisions, had argued that victims had a right to know about the confidential agreement made between tribunal judges and Serbia. She had learned about them from Serbian sources, she said.Le Monde said her imprisonment was \u201cscandalous\u201d and called for her release.At least five other journalists have been convicted by the Yugoslavia tribunal for contempt of court. They were sentenced to pay fines of 7,000 to 10,000 euros, about $7,800 to $11,175, and in one case three months\u2019 imprisonment. The journalists \u2014 four from Croatia, one from Kosovo \u2014 were found guilty of publishing names of protected witnesses or of disclosing records from closed court sessions.Ms. Hartmann\u2019s case is different because she wrote about the judges themselves, disclosing legal reasoning and citing their names in two confidential decisions made by several judges.In a telephone interview from The Hague after her release on Tuesday, Ms. Hartmann said what had angered the judges most was that she wrote that they had acted \u201cunlawfully\u201d and had therefore made their decisions confidential.On Tuesday afternoon, the court freed Ms. Hartmann after her lawyer filed a motion for her release because she had served two-thirds of her sentence, as is customary at the tribunal.\u201cI\u2019m happy, but I\u2019m exhausted from all the emotions,\u201d Ms. Hartmann said. \u201cThe world had turned upside down.\u201dShe had covered the war in Yugoslavia for Le Monde and then became the spokeswoman for Carla del Ponte, then the chief prosecutor at the tribunal, for six years. After she left, she wrote three books about the wars, often highlighting the role of Serbia.\u201cThere I was, now behind the walls where the war criminals were kept,\u201d she said. Describing her conditions, she said she was detained in a segregated section and had no contact with other prisoners. \u201cEven though they knew there was no risk of suicide, I was under round-the-clock surveillance, which means you are checked every 30 minutes,\u201d she said. \u201cSo the guards said it would be best to keep the lights on, so they would not have to come in but look through the door window.\u201dAsked why she went to the tribunal, knowing of the arrest warrant, she said she had not planned to enter but wanted to be nearby on the \u201chistoric day\u201d of the verdict for Mr. Karadzic.She said there had been no reason to fear arrest. France had already told the tribunal that it would not surrender her. Last April, while she was briefly working in The Hague, the tribunal sent the warrant to the Dutch authorities asking for her detention, but it was ignored. \u201cThe Dutch knew where I was staying, but they did not try to arrest me,\u201d she said.Advertisement"}

But just how very far out of reach can still be surprising.The median price of a studio, long considered an entry-level apartment, in Manhattan is now $485,000, according to the Corcoran Group. If that price does not make your hair stand on end, consider that in the coveted submarket of Downtown Manhattan, the median price of a resale condo studio hit $863,000 in the last quarter of 2015.But back to the buyer in the half-million-buck bracket. What this will purchase in Manhattan is likely little more than a single room with a windowless kitchen.For those who absolutely must be in the city, the other boroughs are generally cheaper, and the offerings roomier. But the trade-off for that extra square footage might be limited shopping and dining options, so-so schools and long commutes.And if you require natural light while making breakfast, take heart: Many of the kitchens came with windows. Most of the places were an improvement over their Manhattan counterparts in some way.\u201cWe\u2019re the last of the Mohicans,\u201d said Charles Bludeau, a salesman with Douglas Elliman Real Estate who represents a two-bedroom condo on the water in Spencer Estates for $489,500. \u201cWhere else can you even go?\u201dIf a Brooklyn neighborhood has a \u201chill\u201d in the name, as in Boerum or Cobble or Vinegar, it is fair to assume it may be pricey. A \u201cheights,\u201d as in Brooklyn Heights, is probably not the place to hunt for bargains, either.But finding an apartment for less than $500,000 that improves upon a similarly priced Manhattan studio does appear possible in neighborhoods like these, although the upgrade may be slight.Then again, the 500-square-foot unit has an appealing layout, and the kitchen is not a wall of appliances. It\u2019s a separate, windowed room, which has, moreover, been renovated. The ceiling is beamed, and there is quite a bit of storage space. A better yardstick might be the one-bedroom median for the area, which was $549,000.And the yellow brick co-op building has a pedigree. Designed by Emery Roth and completed about 1929, it was once part of the massive Hotel St. George complex.The 30-story tower is not hemmed in by like-size structures, but looms over a low-slung neighborhood that is protected from development by a historic district. From Apt. 15A, views sweep south and east.What kept this $425,000 unit under the $500,000 mark was its relatively high maintenance fee of $1,005.95 a month, said Zelda Josephs of Zelda Josephs Real Estate, who is listing the unit, and who is a longtime resident of the co-op. The full-service building has an operating budget of about $5 million a year, according to the co-op\u2019s website.That maintenance bill may be about a couple hundred dollars higher than a typical studio in Brooklyn, but \u201cyou won\u2019t find this in Manhattan,\u201d Ms. Josephs said. \u201cAnd if you found it in Manhattan, it would be way, way more.\u201dIn the borough of Brooklyn in its entirety, the median sale price for a studio in the fourth quarter of 2015 was $426,000, according to Corcoran.But beyond the popular brownstone-lined neighborhoods close to Manhattan, brokers say, prices drop off, which means buyers who search slightly farther afield may be rewarded.Buyers who like historic details may incline toward the unit, one of 20 in a walk-up brick building completed in about 1921 by Finnish developers who constructed several co-ops in the area. Geometric inlays enliven the floors in the 725-square-foot space. Wallpaper also adds vintage charm, though few would preserve the dated kitchen, which still has an ice box, cooled solely by the outside air, tucked into a wall.Buyers hoping to finance the purchase should look elsewhere. The co-op prohibits bank loans, an obstacle that partly explains the low price. \u201cOtherwise, this apartment could sell for about $550,000,\u201d said Paul Hyun, an associate broker with Douglas Elliman, who added that, \u201cFinns didn\u2019t believe in debt, and the building prefers to keep it this way.\u201dIf cash deals offer opportunities for discounts, so does a lack of elevators, Mr. Hyun said. Had there been one in the building, which offers views of the Statue of Liberty, the price for this fourth-floor apartment might be a heftier $650,000, he said.Still, even if a buyer had to break the bank to land the unit, he or she would have a relatively easy time keeping current on the maintenance. It\u2019s just $311 a month.When thoughts turn to ownership, Manhattan residents might focus on apartments, but a house might offer smoother sailing in the other boroughs.The buyer of a house will encounter no persnickety co-op board to scrutinize his or her finances. Nor will house-buyers be subject to fees for condo-style amenities, like pet spas and tween rooms, that they would never use.With a finished basement and driveway, the 1,300-square-foot house was listed last month for $479,000, though its rooms, some of which sport pink or mirrored walls, might be in line for a makeover. On the other hand, 32 Cunard received a new furnace and hot-water heater last year, so the buyer won\u2019t have to worry about that for a while.Buyers likely won\u2019t mistake quiet Grymes Hill for a trendsetting \u2019hood. \u201cPeople always say, \u2018Why can\u2019t we become like a Hoboken or Williamsburg, because we have a waterfront, too?\u2019 \u201d said Christopher J. Long, an associate broker with Gateway Arms Realty Corporation, referring to the north shore in general. \u201cBut you\u2019ve got to have the restaurants, the shopping, the bars,\u201d added Mr. Long, who has the listing for 32 Cunard, and who grew up in nearby West New Brighton and lives there today.Several neighborhoods on Staten Island are the site of major investments in new retail. Meanwhile, buyers are hopping on board the ferry. The median sale price of houses on Staten Island in January hit $438,000, surpassing the prerecession peak in May 2005 of $435,000, according to the Staten Island Board of Realtors, which also noted that inventory is the lowest it has been in a decade.\u201cWhat I\u2019m seeing now,\u201d said Mr. Long, who has been selling homes since 2000, \u201cis something I\u2019ve never seen before.\u201dTo make your money go far, there may be no borough like the Bronx. Three hundred and ninety apartments and houses there were for sale for $500,000 or less on Feb. 26, according to StreetEasy, at a median list price of $215,500. And of that group, 18 listings could be picked up for less than $100,000.Spencer Estates, 12 miles from Midtown in the northeastern Bronx, where Mr. Bludeau has the listing for that two-bedroom $489,500 condo, may not register on the radar of many buyers. The condo itself is more than a mile from the nearest subway, so the unit\u2019s two dedicated parking spots may come in handy. On the bright side, the enclave faces Eastchester Bay and offers views of City Island and Long Island.Besides a pair of bedrooms, the 1,022-square-foot apartment has one bath, five closets and views of a marina from the master bedroom. Waves lap on the rocky shore a few steps away from the ground-floor unit. For a monthly common charge of $379, an owner has use of laundry facilities and an on-site fitness center.Trend-spotters have not planted a flag here just yet. First, wide-scale development needs to happen in the Bronx, to correct decades of disinvestment, according to Mr. Bludeau. Only then will the existing housing stock get the attention it deserves, he said, hazarding a guess that moment is five years hence. \u201cThat will be the time frame when it will really blow up,\u201d he said.Queens may be known for its stand-alone houses, but they\u2019re hardly the only style of housing available. And the others tend to be lighter on the wallet.In late February, the borough had 239 co-op apartments for sale for $500,000 or less, according to a search of nytimes.com/findahome listings. Single-family houses? Just 93 in that price segment.And those co-ops, which started at $53,000, weren\u2019t just found in urbanized Long Island City, but also in more suburban neighborhoods like Whitestone, Forest Hills and Bay Terrace. Jackson Heights, in central Queens, also packed them in, with 26.Listed at $488,000 with Teresa Reid, a saleswoman with Daniel Gale Sotheby\u2019s International Realty, and now under contract, the second-floor apartment has nine-foot ceilings, hardwood floors and a nicely flowing 1,150-square-foot layout, plus numerous eye-catching details.Built-in bookshelves line the living room. Both granite and wood were deployed for kitchen counters. And the bath, redone in 2015, gleams in white tile.The five-story building, which opened in 1915 and went co-op four years later, lacks the leafy central garden of many larger prewar buildings in the area. But it does have a small courtyard.The sellers, William Bryant, an architect, and his wife, Joanne Liou, who manages construction projects, moved to Jackson Heights from the Upper West Side in 2006 in search of more space. The unit cost $337,000, near the peak of that market, and it required a major renovation.Though property values have clearly appreciated, Mr. Bryant, who is moving to Long Island, said it is curious how Jackson Heights, which regularly tops lists of best-value neighborhoods, still seems to be waiting for its moment. \u201cI guess there\u2019s still a perception that Queens is Queens,\u201d he said.But based on the enthusiastic turnout for a recent open house for the apartment, he believes progress is being made. \u201cThe secret is out more than it was then,\u201d he said. \u201cBut your money still goes a long way here.\u201dA cover article last Sunday, about properties available outside of Manhattan for less than $500,000, misspelled the surname of a broker with Douglas Elliman Real Estate on second reference. He is Paul Hyun, not Huyn.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Murdered for Activism in Honduras", "Date": "2016-03-11", "News": "Supported byOp-Ed ContributorOakland, Calif. \u2014 It was always a relief to see my aunt Berta, whom we affectionately called Bertita. Not just because of the constant threats to her life, but because she was a \u201crayo de luna\u201d \u2014 a ray of moonlight \u2014 in any situation.She was just one more victim in the continuing war against activists in Honduras.The attacks and threats only strengthened her resolve.During my frequent visits as a child to Honduras and our large extended family, Bertita and I \u2014 she was only two years my elder \u2014 would chase each other and our cousins around the garden playing hide-and-seek, or play soccer in the dirt patches, always being careful not to crush my grandmother\u2019s red roses.Bertita had been working with indigenous groups on education and rights issues with Mr. Zelaya\u2019s support. She was already well known throughout the countryside and by international rights organizations in the region. Her opposition to the coup catapulted her into global recognition.On our first night in Tegucigalpa, the Honduran capital, I decided to profile her, but she warned me: \u201cWe need to go to a safe house. Come with us and we\u2019ll talk there.\u201d We set out in a taxi. One of her cellphones rang. After a quick conversation with another organizer, she said, \u201cWe need to switch taxis and someone will pick us up.\u201dThis had become her life in Honduras; there were no roses to worry about now.At our destination, we ducked between houses and walked down a corridor to the back of one. We were welcomed by \u201ccompa\u00f1eros en la lucha\u201d \u2014 companions in the struggle. They cooked us a meal while we sat down and began filming.Over the next few days I saw Bertita at rallies and leading protest marches. She spoke with vigor, clarity and force. She didn\u2019t mince words. It was a side of her I had not seen.\u201cLa lucha\u201d was in Bertita\u2019s blood. There was no other calling for her. We would never have tried to stop her because we all believed in what she was doing. Still, we knew that someday it would come at a cost.And so, she was silenced.But this could, at long last, become a turning point for one of Latin America\u2019s poorest and most violent nations. Berta C\u00e1ceres touched countless lives, and the outrage in Honduras and around the world is palpable.Much more international pressure can and should be leveled at the Honduran government \u2014 for an independent international investigation to uncover not just the triggermen, but also the highest-ranking authors of this attack and so many other killings of activists.Silvio Carrillo is a freelance film and news producer based in California whose work has included coverage abroad for CNN, Al Jazeera English and The South China Morning Post.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "If Starwood Makes a Deal With Anbang, Can It Be Done?", "Date": "2016-03-30", "News": "Supported byDeal ProfessorAmong the many issues Starwood Hotels & Resorts faces in negotiating a deal with Anbang Insurance Group, the secretive Chinese insurance giant, is a stark one: Any deal Starwood negotiates may not be worth the paper it is printed on.This is where the problem arises.If Starwood won a lawsuit in the United States, it would have to enforce the judgment in China, where Anbang and its assets are. Good luck with that.China is notorious for its weak rule of law, and whether or not a Chinese court would actually enforce a United States judgment against Anbang is unknown.This is a good lesson for anyone dealing with companies outside the United States: Having a great claim is meaningless unless you have a pocket to get money from.The treaty is viewed as a more certain way to enforce foreign judgments. Because of this, many deals with companies located in countries with weak rule of law use arbitration. Most cross-border deals with Russian companies, for example, are subject to arbitration in case of dispute rather than litigation in Russia itself.So, Starwood\u2019s lawyers are assuming that Starwood will really have no recourse in China to enforce its agreement if Anbang decides to breach it.All is not lost, however. Starwood\u2019s lawyers will look for Anbang to put up collateral \u2014 mainly American assets. These will secure any judgment so that Starwood would not have to turn to China.This leaves the last option. Starwood\u2019s lawyers will have to look for a deposit or a letter of credit. It is also possible to get commitments from Anbang\u2019s owners, though the problem is that they are unknown and are also very likely abroad.In that case, Smithfield\u2019s only remedy if the transaction failed was to collect a termination fee of up to $275 million, about 5 percent of the transaction value. Shuanghui funded this termination fee by putting it in escrow. Smithfield preserved the possibility of suing Shuanghui if it willfully breached the agreement, but the parties knew that this action would not go anywhere.But in a hostile bidding war a 5 percent deposit is weak brew. So this deal may set a new standard for how targets deal with the completion risk from Chinese bidders. Perhaps there will be a \u201csuper escrow\u201d here of multiple billions. And it may be funded by letters of credit or financing letters instead of cash deposits.Starwood should fight hard on this issue, though, because of the regulatory issues.The China risk on this transaction goes beyond the enforcement of the agreement. Approval of Chinese regulators is required for this deal and there are signs that the government may not approve, since the amount will exceed 15 percent of Anbang\u2019s assets, the limit on insurers\u2019 foreign investment under Chinese rules.That\u2019s the talk at least. The Chinese regulatory process is a bit opaque.But who knows? And that creates regulatory risk No. 1 for Starwood.Cfius will almost certainly not block the Starwood deal, but it may require divestments of hotels, like Starwood properties near the White House. This analysis will take a while since Starwood has about 1,300 properties. But this will only delay, not hold up, a deal.The final risk to this transaction is financing. Anbang will be looking to borrow billions to finance the deal with its partners J. C. Flowers & Company and Primavera Capital. But financing can fall through, particularly in today\u2019s markets in the United States and China.And so, the questions really are whether Starwood will take the risk here, and how the lawyers deal with it. There are no complete solutions \u2014 Starwood is unlikely to be able to get an agreement that it can enforce or collect the full acquisition price if Anbang walks away.Because of this risk, Marriott\u2019s bid is likely to be a better one even if Anbang is willing to pay more. This is because the bird in the hand of Marriott is a better bet.We learned this lesson in the financial crisis. Then, the chemical maker Huntsman terminated a deal with Basell to accept a higher offer from Hexion, but one with greater antitrust risk. The risk proved not to be worth it, as Hexion was unable to finance the deal and walked, paying Huntsman a fraction of what it lost.But if Starwood chooses Anbang, how it deals with these issues will very likely be the template for how American acquisition targets deal with Chinese issues going forward. After all, if Anbang can convert renminbi at inflated prices to pay inflated values for American properties, why can\u2019t other Chinese buyers?Many here in the United States are worrying about a whole different risk in this transaction. Which one will better honor those Starwood points: Marriott or Anbang?Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Valeant\u2019s Accounting Error a Warning Sign of Bigger Problems", "Date": "2016-03-28", "News": "Supported byValeant Pharmaceuticals International\u2019s accounting confession may have sounded like a rounding error.The embattled drug company said last week that it had wrongly booked $58 million of revenue, a relatively small sum compared with its nearly $10 billion in annual sales.But investors had more cause for concern over the accuracy of the financial statements. Valeant said a special committee it had formed determined that \u201ccertain other accounting issues required review.\u201d The company also said two senior accountants had acted improperly.The accounting admission may leave a persistent cloud over Valeant for another reason: It lends credibility to those who have long criticized Valeant\u2019s books. These critics have produced analyses that suggest that Valeant\u2019s accounting could be flawed in several other ways.Accounting is not, of course, the sole reason for Valeant\u2019s recent decline.When Valeant was the toast of Wall Street and ballooning in size, it relied on potentially unsustainable approaches. One was raising drug prices by large amounts, but that has now run into staunch political opposition. Valeant\u2019s eye-popping revenue growth also came from an acquisition binge that was financed by the $30 billion of debt that is now straining the company\u2019s balance sheet. These challenges go a long way toward explaining why the company recently cut its financial targets for 2016 and why its stock has plunged.Yet Valeant\u2019s accounting is likely to remain at the heart of the debate about the company\u2019s fate. The skeptics say aggressive accounting was central to Valeant\u2019s strategy, giving the company a misleading appearance of strength as it grew.\u201cAny and all methods were used to get reported sales up, including customer-burning price increases, channel-stuffing and hyperaggressive accounting,\u201d John Hempton, a hedge fund manager who has written about Valeant on his blog, said in an email. \u201cSoon, sustainable sales and cash flow will be revealed \u2014 and they are unlikely to be enough to service over $30 billion in debt.\u201dLaurie W. Little, an investor relations representative at Valeant, said the company\u2019s projected financial performance should enable it to stay in line with its debt agreements this year.Accusations of channel-stuffing, the term used by Mr. Hempton, have often been directed at Valeant, in part because it is a practice that has afflicted the pharmaceutical industry over the years.A channel-stuffing company may try to bolster revenue artificially by granting unsustainable or improper inducements to wholesalers and customers to get them to take its products. And a channel-stuffing company may also book revenue by transferring goods to an entity that is not totally separate.In explaining its recent revenue restatement, for instance, Valeant said it should not have booked some sales when it transferred products to a distributor called Philidor Rx Services, whose murky ties to Valeant were examined by the Southern Investigative Reporting Foundation, which reports on financial issues.But even before the Philidor revelations, large and sudden increases in sales of certain products raised suspicions about channel-stuffing.In the middle of 2014, for instance, Valeant posted large increases in sales for some products sold by Bausch & Lomb, the eye-care company that Valeant bought in 2013. Critics at the time wondered whether Valeant wanted to highlight strong gains at Bausch & Lomb because its acquisition strategy was coming under attack by Allergan, which was fiercely resisting an acquisition attempt by Valeant. In the fourth quarter of 2014, the sales gains in some Bausch & Lomb products were lower.One warning sign was that Valeant\u2019s profits were unimpressive under generally accepted accounting principles, the standard bookkeeping that all public companies must use. Instead, it emphasized earnings measures that left out hundreds of millions of dollars of costs, including expenses related to integrating its acquisitions.When such acquisition costs are consistently high, investors may worry that costs relating to a company\u2019s regular operations are somehow being included in the acquisition expenses to make operating earnings look stronger than they are.Perhaps in recognition of investors\u2019 concerns about the high level of acquisition integration costs, Valeant told investors in July 2014 that such expenses would be below $70 million in the third quarter of 2014, roughly half the $143 million recorded for such expenses in the second quarter of 2014. They did fall below $70 million, coming in at $63 million. But a Valeant filing later indicated that the target was met by changing where $20 million of restructuring expenses were booked in the income statement.Ms. Little of Valeant said in an email that these expenses, which related to stock options, were \u201cmore appropriately classified\u201d in a different part of the income statement, and the company has kept them there since.A heavy acquisitions strategy can also generate concerns about a practice known as spring-loading. When one company acquires another, there is usually period of several weeks between the announcement of the deal and the actual date at which the acquired company becomes part of the acquirer. In that interim, the acquirer may find a way to book a higher level of costs and lower revenue at the company being acquired.This process, which takes place before the acquired company\u2019s financial statements merge with those of the acquirer, is intended to suppress the profitability of the firm being bought, solely for the interim period. Once part of the acquirer, the costs and revenue of the acquired firm return to more normal levels, enabling its profit to surge once it can benefit the bottom line of the acquirer.Valeant\u2019s skeptics wondered whether this happened with Bausch & Lomb. In a special proxy filing, Valeant included an income statement for Bausch & Lomb for the period between the end of the second quarter of 2013, Bausch & Lomb\u2019s last full quarter as an independent firm, and Aug. 4, 2013, the day before Valeant acquired Bausch & Lomb.In the interim, Bausch & Lomb\u2019s revenue, expressed on a per-day basis to make it comparable, was 16 percent lower than in the first half of 2013, and then from Aug. 4, 2013, until Sept. 30, 2013, revenue surged to a per-day level that was higher than in the interim and in the first half of that year. Also, some costs rose, on a per-day basis, in the interim from the first half of 2013.For most of its growth period, Valeant has been led by J. Michael Pearson, who is now leaving, and Howard B. Schiller, the former chief financial officer. Valeant\u2019s board has asked Mr. Schiller to resign, but he has not done so. He said in a statement last week that he did not do anything improper in relation to the planned earnings restatement. And he added in the statement that he was told that Valeant\u2019s external auditors had reviewed certain transactions with Philidor.The auditor, PricewaterhouseCoopers, or PwC, will now play an even more crucial role in determining Valeant\u2019s standing. After missing a deadline for filing its annual report for 2015, Valeant said it was working to get the report out by April 29. PwC, however, may take more time to sign off on the financial statements, causing Valeant to miss its new projected filing date.Regulators may now also take a close look at Valeant\u2019s accounting. The company said last month that the Securities and Exchange Commission was investigating.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "What Liberals Can Learn From the N.R.A.", "Date": "2016-03-11", "News": "Supported byOp-Ed ContributorThe passion underlying such condemnations may be understandable, especially in the wake of the horrific mass shootings that often prompt them. But this rhetoric does little to change the gun debate, and most likely reinforces gun owners\u2019 worst fears about how liberals see them. Rather than demonize the N.R.A.\u2019s strategies, liberals should emulate them. The organization is, after all, the most effective civil rights group in the United States today.How did the N.R.A. do it? It did not litigate Heller itself. But its efforts over three decades paved the way for the court\u2019s decision.The story begins in 1977, when hard-line members of the N.R.A. took charge at its annual convention and formally committed the group to defending the right to bear arms. The N.R.A. first focused on the states, lobbying to change state constitutions and laws to protect the right to possess and carry guns. The organization realized that most gun laws were enacted by states, not the federal government, and that it could win substantial victories there, in part by mobilizing its members, in part by working with the local affiliates it had in every state, and in part because opposition at the state level was largely absent. (Gun-control advocates tended to focus unproductively on Congress.)The strategy paid off: By the time the Supreme Court took up Heller, most state constitutions protected an individual right to bear arms; nearly all states afforded citizens a right to carry concealed weapons unless they were specifically disqualified from doing so; gun makers enjoyed immunity from tort liability for illegal use of their guns; and the right to self-defense had been strengthened \u2014 all at the urging of the N.R.A. These changes made it much easier for the Supreme Court to recognize a federal right to bear arms, because for all practical purposes such a right already existed in so much of the country.The N.R.A. also enlisted the academy. Beginning in the 1980s, it offered grants and prizes designed to encourage scholarship that buttressed its view of the Second Amendment. With N.R.A. assistance, legal scholars transformed the academic understanding of the Second Amendment, so that by the time the Supreme Court ruled in Heller, the dominant view in the legal literature supported an individual right to bear arms. Justice Antonin Scalia\u2019s majority opinion closely tracked that scholarship.In addition, the N.R.A. succeeded in getting both Congress and the executive branch on record as endorsing the view that the Second Amendment protects an individual right to bear arms.In 1982, a Senate committee headed by Senator Orrin Hatch, Republican of Utah and an N.R.A. member, adopted the individual-rights view of the Second Amendment; Congress as a whole followed suit in gun rights legislation in 1986 and 2005. Later, the N.R.A. organized a friend-of-the-court brief in Heller on behalf of majorities in both the Senate and the House reiterating this position. And when John Ashcroft, another N.R.A. member, became attorney general in 2001, the N.R.A. prompted his decision to reverse the Justice Department\u2019s long-held position that the Second Amendment protects only the states\u2019 prerogative to raise a militia.Most significantly, the N.R.A. recognizes the importance of political pressure to the realization of constitutional rights. It grades every candidate for state and federal office on his or her commitment to gun rights, regardless of party affiliation, and urges its five million members to vote accordingly. The N.R.A. was one of George W. Bush\u2019s biggest backers in 2000 and 2004. When President Bush had the opportunity to appoint two justices to the Supreme Court in 2005, it was no surprise that both nominees \u2014 John G. Roberts Jr. and Samuel A. Alito \u2014 were supportive of gun rights. The vote in Heller was 5 to 4, with both Justice Roberts and Justice Alito in the majority.There is nothing nefarious about any of this. It\u2019s how constitutional law changes in America. In a similar fashion, advocates of same-sex marriage concentrated on bringing about change in the states before presenting the issue to the Supreme Court, and pursued a similarly multipronged advocacy strategy. Liberals who are unhappy with the state of constitutional law today \u2014 whether on voting rights, racial equality, campaign finance or, indeed, guns \u2014 would do well to stop condemning the N.R.A.\u2019s methods and start following in its footsteps.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Soros and Other Liberal Donors to Fund Bid to Spur Latino Voters", "Date": "2016-03-10", "News": "Supported byStrategists involved said the new spending would be the largest Democratic voter-turnout effort ever devoted exclusively to Latino and immigrant voters. Most of the money will be spent through organizations in Colorado, Florida and Nevada, states with large or growing Latino and Asian populations that will be pivotal in the presidential race and in the battle for control of the Senate.\u201cThis is really taking the gloves off,\u201d said Crist\u00f3bal Alex, the president of the Latino Victory Project, one of several national pro-immigration or Hispanic-oriented groups working with the super PAC. \u201cFrom the first day he attacked us, he called us rapists and thieves,\u201d Mr. Alex said of Mr. Trump. \u201cWe could have a giant wall built and millions of families broken apart. The country is on the precipice.\u201dBoth campaigns are unfolding against a demographic surge that is reordering American presidential politics, providing millions of new voters for Democrats while stirring an angry counterreaction on the right, where working-class white voters have rallied to Mr. Trump\u2019s promises to end illegal immigration, to build an enormous wall along the Mexican border, and to expel undocumented workers who are already here.For Mr. Soros, who will contribute $5 million to the super PAC, the effort represents a return to the large-scale political spending that made him a liberal hero \u2014 and conservative boogeyman \u2014 in 2004, when he helped organize a failed $200 million advertising and voter-mobilization campaign to unseat President George W. Bush. His contributions to super PACs and other explicitly political organizations this cycle will soon exceed $13 million, his largest investment since the 2004 election. Mr. Soros has committed another $5 million to a Democratic-led legal campaign to contest restrictive voting laws in states like Ohio, Wisconsin, and North Carolina.Mr. Soros, a financier who fled his native Hungary in 1947, fleeing Soviet dominance after enduring the Nazi occupation in hiding, has long funded less overtly political efforts to educate and organize immigrants. But in an email, Mr. Soros said he had been particularly struck by the tone of the 2016 race, in which Mr. Trump and other Republican candidates have also called to block Muslim refugees from entering the country.According to the Associated Press, Donald J. Trump and Hillary Clinton have each won enough delegates to claim their party\u2019s nomination for president.\u201cThe intense anti-immigrant and anti-Muslim rhetoric that has been fueled by the Republican primary is deeply offensive,\u201d Mr. Soros said. \u201cIt is harmful to our democracy and to our national interests. There should be consequences for the outrageous statements and proposals that we\u2019ve regularly heard.\u201dThose involved with the new endeavor said it was also a response to longstanding complaints among Latino organizers that liberal donors \u2014 including members of the Democracy Alliance, which Mr. Soros helped start after Mr. Bush\u2019s re-election \u2014 had been stingy with funding. In past elections, some local groups most active in turning out Democratic-leaning Latino and immigrant voters have not had enough money to fully participate in so-called \u201ctables\u201d where labor, abortion rights, and environmental organizations coordinate strategy in key states.\u201cOne reason we had lower turnout is because of historical underinvestment in our community,\u201d Mr. Alex said. \u201cFolks who want a progressive vision of the country have to match what is happening on the right. Now we are seeing a recognition by certain donors of the importance of our vote.\u201dRather than start new organizations, the new effort will mostly provide money and technical assistance to those already active in Latino and immigrant communities. The Center for Community Change Action, a Washington-based liberal organization, will develop a national field program with groups on the ground and will measure their performance.Organizers said they hoped to start as early as May knocking on doors, calling and sending mailings to reach 728,000 voters \u2014 mainly Latinos and Asians \u2014 in Colorado, Nevada and Florida. That timing will allow them to respond to the Supreme Court\u2019s decision, expected this June, on Mr. Obama\u2019s executive actions to shield millions of undocumented immigrants from deportation.Latinos are a large enough share of voters in those three states to sway the outcome of close races. Mr. Obama won all three in 2008 and again in 2012, while Republicans have won Senate and governor seats in the states during the same period.Deepak Bhargava, the center\u2019s executive director, said the organizers would be provided data to help identify likely voters and recruit local volunteers to remain in contact with them through November. America\u2019s Voice, which is active in lobbying for immigration reform in Washington, will conduct bilingual polling in Spanish and English.In recent years, the Service Employees International Union and other labor groups have backed an organization called Mi Familia Vota (\u201cMy Family Votes\u201d) Education Fund, which promoted naturalization and voter registration among Latinos. The group has helped drive up Latino voter numbers, but some believe its effect was limited because it could not engage in openly partisan voter turnout.The new campaign will be funded directly by individual donors, rather than by their foundations, allowing the money to be used for more overt political activity, including expressly advocating Democratic candidates.\u201cWe will be naming names,\u201d Mr. Bhargava said. \u201cIt seems to us that Trump\u2019s nativism has infected nearly the whole Republican Party, and we need to exact an electoral toll.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated the circumstances under which George Soros fled his native Hungary. He left the country and Soviet dominance in 1947, not during Nazi occupation.A picture caption on Thursday with an article about efforts of liberal donors to bankroll a campaign to encourage voting among Latinos and other immigrants misstated the name of a school that was a caucus site in Las Vegas. It is Rancho High School, not El Rancho.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Karaoke Night With Will Forte, Star of \u2018Last Man on Earth\u2019", "Date": "2016-03-03", "News": "Supported byEncountersThe two friends, former \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d cast members, play brothers on Mr. Forte\u2019s show, which is now in its second season and returns Sunday, after a 12-week break. \u201cBasically, the last year of my life has been waking up, going straight into work and then going home to bed,\u201d Mr. Forte said.During the eight years he spent as a performer and writer on \u201cSaturday Night Live,\u201d Mr. Forte did a lot of karaoke with his cast mates.\u201cIt\u2019s really less about the quality of your singing and more about your passion,\u201d he said. He punched in the numbers for Black Sabbath\u2019s \u201cFairies Wear Boots.\u201d After the lengthy guitar intro, he started howling.\u201cIt\u2019s so therapeutic to do this,\u201d he said. \u201cBlack Sabbath is wonderful.\u201dIn the hush that fell on the room after the song was over, he said: \u201cMy dad had some Doors tapes. To me, Jim Morrison had all this mystery around him. It\u2019s weird to think that I\u2019m about closing in on double his age.\u201dThe reporter asked him if he felt 45.\u201cMentally, I don\u2019t,\u201d Mr. Forte said. \u201cPhysically, I definitely feel more aches and pains than I used to. My bedroom is on the second story of the house, and it\u2019s harder and harder to walk down those stairs. A lot of times I\u2019ll walk down backward.\u201dMr. Forte has spoken publicly of his obsessive-compulsive-like tendencies.\u201cIt depends on how tired I am,\u201d he said. \u201cI still check the showers and stuff like that. For me, it used to be mainly about checking the sinks, in weird patterns, and the stove. I\u2019ve gotten better about that.\u201dMs. Vicente said she has known Mr. Forte for eight years. She described him as a sweetheart, but complicated.\u201cI\u2019m this weird mixture of confident and superfragile,\u201d Mr. Forte said.Orville Willis Forte IV (his full name) said he had a happy upbringing in the Northern California towns of Moraga and Lafayette. He got along with his parents. His mother was a teacher and artist, his father a financial broker who became a ski bum.During Mr. Forte\u2019s freshman year of high school, he was class president. In senior year, his class voted him Best Personality. The only time he got in any real trouble came when he served as the unwitting getaway driver for friends of friends who had squirted ketchup all over a Jack in the Box.\u201cI am not into that,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m like, \u2018Somebody\u2019s going to have to clean this up.\u2019 It bummed me out.\u201dSomeone noted his license plate number as he drove off. When he got home, the police were waiting. They took him to the station for questioning.\u201cI said I didn\u2019t know who was in my car,\u201d Mr. Forte said. \u201cAnd it was kind of the truth. I didn\u2019t know those people\u2019s names, so it was very easy to say, \u2018I don\u2019t know them.\u2019 And he\u2019s like, \u2018They were in the back of your car!\u2019 They spent all night trying. My mom was there, saying, \u2018Just tell them the names of these people.\u2019 And I never said anything.\u201dAt the University of California, Los Angeles, Mr. Forte joined a fraternity and majored in history. After graduation, he went to work in finance, but it wasn\u2019t a fit.In 1995, he wrote a humor book, \u201c101 Things to Definitely Not Do if You Want to Get a Chick,\u201d which led to a job at the \u201cLate Show With David Letterman.\u201dDuring his first week, staff members were asked to list their stupid talents. Mr. Forte\u2019s was cutting his own hair, and he showed off his talent in an on-air segment that ended with him pretending to stab Mr. Letterman\u2019s hand with the scissors. \u201cIt was the scariest thing,\u201d he said. \u201cI was terrified that I was going to go too far and stab him.\u201dMr. Forte left the show after nine months and ended up writing for \u201c3rd Rock From the Sun\u201d and \u201cThat \u201970s Show.\u201d He took classes with the Los Angeles sketch troupe the Groundlings before joining it in 2000. Lorne Michaels was in the audience on a night when Mr. Forte slayed.For his \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d audition, Mr. Forte did impressions of Martin Sheen and Joni Mitchell. He also portrayed a gold-painted human statue who sings an X-rated song detailing how he paid for body paint. He got the job, only to turn it down. A fear of failure went into the decision, Mr. Forte said, and he had regrets about it.When Will Ferrell departed from \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d in 2002, Mr. Forte left his writing job in Los Angeles and accepted a second offer to join the show. Many of his oddball sketches aired at 12:50 a.m., and he said he didn\u2019t feel confident until his seventh season.\u201cI think I drove myself crazy a little bit,\u201d Mr. Forte said. \u201cBut it\u2019s a great song. It was kind of a fun backdrop to writing. I don\u2019t know, I can eat the same meal every day for months. I have no problem with repetition.\u201dMr. Forte left \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d in 2010. \u201cI was proud of the stuff I did there, but there was no reason for me to think that I would ever have a major acting career,\u201d he said. \u201cI left thinking, \u2018If nothing happens, I\u2019ll just go back to writing.\u2019\u201dAround that time, the actor Val Kilmer, who played the villain in \u201cMacGruber,\u201d asked Mr. Forte if he could stay at his house while he looked for a new place. Soon, his assistant showed up, carrying two large duffel bags filled with books. Mr. Forte and Mr. Kilmer ended up being roommates for two months.\u201cI can\u2019t say enough good things about Val,\u201d Mr. Forte said. \u201cHe is a delight. I\u2019d come home and think nobody was home, because it was completely dark. Then I would see a little light coming out of his bedroom, and he\u2019d be reading with a little miner\u2019s lamp on his head.\u201dHe goes feral. He uses a swimming pool as a toilet and bathes in tequila. When he finally meets up with other survivors, he has trouble reconciling himself to civilized life.Mr. Forte resisted the suggestion that \u201cThe Last Man on Earth\u201d suits the current sociopolitical climate, which seems to have doomsday in the air. \u201cWe\u2019re just making a comedy show,\u201d he said.As if to avoid additional questions on the show\u2019s themes, he grabbed the microphone and started singing \u201cHelp Me\u201d by Joni Mitchell. It lay beyond his vocal range, but he fought gamely to the end.Don\u2019t you remember you told me you loved me, baby?You said you\u2019d be coming back this way again, baby.Baby, baby, baby, baby, oh, baby, I love you.Mr. Forte sang the song tenderly, when he wasn\u2019t screaming.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Bernie Sanders Consistent Over Decades in His Call for \u2018Revolution\u2019", "Date": "2016-03-25", "News": "Supported byIt was barely different from the speech he gave March 15, the day he lost five of five primaries, when he asked thousands of his adoring fans: \u201cAre you ready for a political revolution? Are you tired of a handful of billionaires running our economy?\u201dNor, for that matter, was it much changed from his address to a spaghetti dinner of the Addison County Community Action Group in 1984, when he called for a \u201cpolitical revolution\u201d and urged working people to take power from a \u201cvery small group of wealthy people.\u201dIt is a political score Mr. Sanders has been singing for the last 40 years, and he does not seem ready to stop anytime soon. Regardless of the results on the scoreboard, the state on the map, the year or even the decade, Mr. Sanders has talked with clockwork consistency about an economy rigged against the working class, a campaign finance system that corrupts politicians and a corporate media that obscures the truth.\u201cYou could take one of his speeches from 1981, play it in the campaign this year, and no one would know, except his voice sounds a little bit younger,\u201d said Terry Bouricius, a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of Mr. Sanders\u2019s who was elected with him to the city government here that year and who has followed his career closely since.While politicians constantly try to stay on message, Mr. Sanders is the king of message discipline. While other candidates have been lampooned for robotic redundancies or caricatured as cut-and-paste campaigners, Mr. Sanders has made oratorical consistency his calling card.Mr. Sanders is not opposed to emphasizing different notes depending on the venue. In the South he talks more about civil rights, in the Rust Belt he hits trade harder, and his campaign said that in Wisconsin, which votes on April 5, he will highlight campaign finance reform.But they are simply variations on a theme.Matt Motyl, a political psychologist at the University of Illinois at Chicago who is studying how the candidates speak, said that while most politicians will adjust their language, if not their message, to what they believe the crowd wants to hear, Mr. Sanders does not.\u201cHe\u2019s peculiar in that he doesn\u2019t really respond to that,\u201d he said.To his detractors, Mr. Sanders\u2019s repetition makes him a doctrinaire ideologue, a broken record who lacks intellectual flexibility and fails to see the world any differently now than he did as a 20-something radical firebrand.Asked if Mr. Sanders had ever been forced to change his thinking, his campaign said that he had cast a vote for the war in Afghanistan, but then called for the withdrawal of American troops when the war seemed to become a quagmire. Other than that, said Michael Briggs, his spokesman, the senator had been \u201cremarkably consistent.\u201d There have been rare moments in Mr. Sanders\u2019s career in which the two chief tenets of his socialist worldview \u2014 a critique of American militarism and exploitation of the working class \u2014 have come into conflict.According to the Associated Press, Donald J. Trump and Hillary Clinton have each won enough delegates to claim their party\u2019s nomination for president.In 1983, he found himself in a tight spot when his allies in the peace movement protested at a local General Electric plant that made Gatling guns used in El Salvador. Mr. Sanders had urged the protesters to leave the unionized workers alone, saying, \u201cNot everybody has the luxury of choosing where they are going to work.\u201dMr. Bouricius, who had a front-row seat to Mr. Sanders\u2019s anguish, said issues like war and militarism were important to him. \u201cBut they were all seen as one step down from what he saw as the fundamental issues, which was capitalism and the privilege of wealth,\u201d he said.That clarity has been critical to Mr. Sanders\u2019s aura of authenticity and has attracted millions of young voters. It has also provided a stark contrast with Mrs. Clinton, who has echoed him by saying \u201cthe economy is rigged in favor of those at the top\u201d but who still has trouble convincing voters she is trustworthy.In the 1970s, Mr. Sanders argued his message from the political fringe, and then, starting in 1981, from his perch as the Socialist mayor of Burlington. From that office he sent news releases like one that read, \u201cIf the working people and people of moderate income do not become increasingly involved in the contemporary political struggles then the political decisions will continue to reflect the interests of the small clique of money people who presently dominate state and national politics.\u201dThe Burlington Free Press highlighted a quotation of Mr. Sanders\u2019s from 1971 \u2014 \u201cthe real issue is who controls the wealth of this country\u201d \u2014 and observed that 14 years later, \u201cHe\u2019s still singing the same tune.\u201dIn 1988, he ran for Congress, sending a note on personal stationery inviting Vermonters to help him \u201cmake basic changes in an economic and political system in which 1% of the population owns over 50% of the wealth.\u201d In countless speeches and interviews and debates in Congress, the Senate and now on the presidential trail, Mr. Sanders has essentially said the same thing over and over. Mr. Bouricius worried, though, that Mr. Sanders had not done enough to actually build the political revolution he had spent 40 years calling for. \u201cIf Bernie gets hit by a bus,\u201d Mr. Bouricius said, \"a lot of this just goes away.\u201dMr. Sanders is now facing a speeding bus in the form of Mrs. Clinton\u2019s formidable delegate advantage.But Tad Devine, Mr. Sanders\u2019s top strategist, said his message would resonate strongly in coming contests.\u201cHillary has a lead with delegates so therefore he should change that message? Well, no,\u201d said Mr. Devine. He said that voters found Mr. Sanders credible precisely because his speeches never seemed cooked up for the occasion; instead, he \u201cdelivers it as dictum.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "What Happened When Venture Capitalists Took Over the Golden State Warriors", "Date": "2016-03-30", "News": "FeatureAfter racking up a historic N.B.A. season, the team\u2019s owners \u2014 most of them from Silicon Valley \u2014 think their management style deserves some of the credit. Are they right?Supported byLacob, who has worked in venture capital for three decades, has an open, expressive face and broad shoulders. He\u2019s six feet tall but seems taller. The previous night, he watched his Warriors play a home game in Oakland, and now he looked tired. \u201cThe Tuesday mornings after we play Monday nights are the hardest,\u201d he said. The basketball court, which is normally used by students and faculty members, has a tidy, corporate look: gleaming hardwood surrounded by plexiglass walls. In his Warriors T-shirt and shorts, Lacob pushed his hands against the glass and stretched his legs. \u201cHonestly, this is my favorite time of the week,\u201d he told me.One by one, other players arrived. Most have known Lacob for years, since early in his career at Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers, which is when he helped start this pickup game. There was no reason for anyone to be deferential to him. But owning a basketball team has cachet, especially when that team has come to rank among the best in N.B.A. history. Nobody mentioned his own business affairs, but everyone was eager to talk about Lacob\u2019s. \u201cJoe, good to see Barnes back,\u201d someone said, referring to Harrison Barnes, a Warriors player who had missed games with an injury.The group ran the court for an hour, playing games to 13 by twos and threes. Lacob, 60, was one of the older players there, and he had clearly thought through his strengths and limitations. He would head to a particular spot \u2014 often one on the right side, about a third of the way around the three-point arc \u2014 and wait. When he saw an opportunity, he called for the ball or cut along the arc toward it. If he received a pass, he would usually shoot. His shot was peculiar, fluttering like a knuckleball, rotating only a few times before it reached the basket, but it went in more often than not. The first game ended with his sinking a three-pointer, then raising his arms in triumph. A few minutes later, his team moved in position to win again. Lacob stood at the top of the key with the ball. \u201cHere comes the game-winner,\u201d he said to nobody in particular.After he finished playing, Lacob wiped the perspiration from his hands with a towel. Then he pulled out his championship ring and passed it around for examination. \u201cThey\u2019ve been asking to see it for two months,\u201d he explained. The ring had an extravagant and revealing design. One diamond had been inlaid for each of the 200-odd games the Warriors won from 2010, when Lacob and his investors bought the team, through last year\u2019s N.B.A. finals. \u201cHow much does this thing weigh?\u201d asked Tom McConnell, the managing director from Vanguard Ventures, lifting his hand up and down as if trying to estimate its value.Silicon Valley \u2014 the place itself, but also the society of smart, technologically savvy people who surround it \u2014 is full of basketball fans. Many of them made a lot of money in their 30s and 40s. Now in their 50s, they\u2019re looking for something gratifying to do with it. In 2002, Wyc Grousbeck, a principal at Highland Capital Partners who spent two years at Stanford\u2019s business school, bought the Boston Celtics along with a group of investors that included Lacob. In recent years, venture capitalists, private-equity investors and hedge-funders have been acquiring N.B.A. teams. The Detroit Pistons, Milwaukee Bucks, Philadelphia 76ers and Atlanta Hawks all belong to this new class of investor. The Sacramento Kings and the Memphis Grizzlies are both owned by Silicon Valley engineers. If you include Lacob\u2019s Warriors, that\u2019s more than a quarter of the league.Lacob was not the first venture capitalist to buy a franchise, but he is the first to operate one according to what might be called Silicon Valley precepts: nimble management, open communication, integrating the wisdom of outside advisers and continuous re-evaluation of what companies do and how they do it. None of that typically happens in professional sports. Most franchise owners of previous generations became wealthy mastering businesses that did one specific thing, if only because that was the way that people used to become wealthy in America. They\u2019ve run their teams, for better or worse, in the same autocratic, hidebound fashion that they ran those companies. As a manager, Lacob prefers to surround himself with expertise and exploit it.This season, Lacob\u2019s sixth as majority owner, the Warriors are on pace to break the league record of 72 wins in a season (which is just 82 games long). He and his partners bought a team that already had Stephen Curry, Golden State\u2019s best player and a transcendent talent who is having one of the most dominant seasons in league history. He would be hitting tongue-flick jump shots from 30 feet away from the basket no matter who owned it.But Lacob won\u2019t accept that what the Warriors have achieved is a product of anything but a master plan. \u201cThe great, great venture capitalists who built company after company, that\u2019s not an accident,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd none of this is an accident, either.\u201dAfter the pickup game, Lacob pulled on a sweatshirt and went to breakfast at a cafeteria on the ground floor. He goes there so often that one of the smoothies on the menu, involving orange juice, vanilla yogurt, bananas and strawberries, has been named for him. He pointed this out, then ordered one. When I asked him about the previous night\u2019s game, he could hardly contain himself. He boasted that the Warriors are playing in a far more sophisticated fashion than the rest of the league. \u201cWe\u2019ve crushed them on the basketball court, and we\u2019re going to for years because of the way we\u2019ve built this team,\u201d he said. But what really set the franchise apart, he said, was the way it operated as a business. \u201cWe\u2019re light-years ahead of probably every other team in structure, in planning, in how we\u2019re going to go about things,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to be a handful for the rest of the N.B.A. to deal with for a long time.\u201dWhat\u2019s happening with the Warriors as a business isn\u2019t something Kimmel is likely to mention, but it\u2019s equally impressive. The $450 million that Lacob\u2019s group paid to Chris Cohan, the former owner, seemed so laughably expensive because of the woeful state of the Warriors franchise. This wasn\u2019t just a bad team, but a team that seemed permanently stuck in a state of irrelevance. \u201cThe little engine that couldn\u2019t\u201d is how the investor Nick Swinmurn, the founder of Zappos and a lifelong fan of the Warriors, describes it. During Cohan\u2019s 16-year ownership, the Warriors had reached the N.B.A. playoffs only once. Sixteen of the league\u2019s 30 teams advance every season. \u201cSo on an odds basis,\u201d Lacob notes, \u201cyou\u2019re supposed to make it half the time. Something was very wrong.\u201dSuch ineptitude had eroded interest. There were only 7,000 season-ticket holders. The arena where the team played, in a vast parking lot beside a highway, was outdated. Its corridors were narrow, its catering facilities rudimentary. It didn\u2019t have rooms that could be leased for corporate meetings. While the league\u2019s newest facilities have been built with palatial home clubhouses the size of health clubs, the Warriors\u2019 was austere and cramped. One look at it during a road trip was said to discourage players around the league from considering the team when they became free agents.Other potential buyers perceived the institutional decrepitude as a drawback. Lacob and his partner, the Hollywood entrepreneur Peter Guber, believed it represented an opportunity. \u201cThat\u2019s what Joe does,\u201d says Chip Perry, the founder of Autotrader.com, a Kleiner Perkins investment that Lacob aided as a board member for 14 years. \u201cHe saw potential in what we were doing with Autotrader, even when others were dismissive. He\u2019s one of those rare people who can look around the corner and see something interesting.\u201d In the Warriors, Lacob saw a start-up disguised as an underperforming business, a sports franchise that had been run autocratically \u2014 and therefore ineptly \u2014 as the industry evolved around it.That $450 million investment is now worth around $2 billion. In 2019, the Warriors will move to a new, self-financed arena complex on the San Francisco waterfront that will include office buildings and commercial space. The move is estimated to add as much as $1 billion more to the club\u2019s value. And while there\u2019s only one Curry, the way Lacob and Guber run the franchise is replicable \u2014 at least in theory.Among this emergent generation of investment tycoons, that hasn\u2019t gone unnoticed. \u201cI knew what Joe had done,\u201d said Marc Lasry of Avenue Capital Group, a Moroccan-born billionaire who partnered with the private-equity investor Wesley Edens to buy the Milwaukee Bucks in 2014. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to do the same.\u201d Lasry insists he loves basketball, but the way he described his intentions sounded less like \u201cHoosiers\u201d than like \u201cThe Big Short\u201d: \u201cWe looked at it and said: \u2018The Bucks have huge potential. We think we can bring in the way we do business and do a huge turnaround.\u2019\u2009\u201dVenture capitalists make large investments in companies that they don\u2019t necessarily control. Lacob brought the same mind-set, if not the actual structure, to his basketball team. \u201cIn venture capital, I started 70 companies,\u201d he told me. \u201cI also watched my partners\u2019 deals, maybe 200 of them. That\u2019s a lot of companies. I thought about the way we design a board of directors, the way we design the financing. There\u2019s an architecture to it. And I started thinking about the architecture I would use when I owned and built my own team someday.\u201dLacob gave Guber, who owns a smaller share, all but equal standing because Guber brought four decades of connections in movies, music, sports and media to the deal. Together, they hired a general manager who had never worked for a team before, let alone run one, and two coaches who hadn\u2019t coached at any level. At the time, these moves were perceived around the league as rookie mistakes. But Lacob was no rookie, not at building companies. And it turned out that they were not mistakes.One evening this season, Lacob arrived late after fighting traffic from Menlo Park. He asked politely for a turkey burger, then found a seat at a high-top table. Between bites, he greeted a steady flow of friends and colleagues, most of whom are big names in Silicon Valley. John Walecka of Redpoint Ventures \u2014 whose current investments include companies called Moogsoft, Quantifind, Datameer and Qihoo 360 Technology \u2014 walked past. So did Mark Stevens, who was a partner at Sequoia Capital when the firm helped finance Google, PayPal and LinkedIn.The Bridge Club has become one of the best venues for venture-capital networking in the Bay Area. It\u2019s a perk for the minority owners, but it serves a purpose for Lacob. Before and after each game, he\u2019s accessible to any investors who want his ear. \u201cIt\u2019s the atmosphere of knowing you have a voice \u2014 knowing you\u2019re part of this,\u201d he explained. \u201cOne thing I didn\u2019t like when I owned part of the Celtics \u2014 was I really heard? I don\u2019t know. I wanted to make sure that when I did this, everybody got heard.\u201dThe N.B.A. demands that each franchise confer one owner, regardless of stake size, with nearly dictatorial power. Lacob wields his softly, just as he typically sits in the back of corporate board meetings without saying much, absorbing information, then guiding the discussion toward a decision. \u201cI\u2019m a professional listener,\u201d he told me. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of smart people in the world, you know. I\u2019m not the smartest. I\u2019m just an integrator. The N.B.A. isn\u2019t like the outside world. I can do whatever I want. But you don\u2019t treat people that way.\u201dEven teams in small markets cost hundreds of millions of dollars these days. Unless you\u2019re Steve Ballmer, the former Microsoft chief who spent $2 billion on the Los Angeles Clippers without the help of outside investors, most potential owners don\u2019t have the wherewithal, or the gumption, to finance a purchase themselves. But rather than money without strings attached \u2014 investors who would have little involvement beyond writing checks \u2014 Lacob and Guber purposefully sought out entrepreneurs and businessmen with attributes and access that complemented their own. \u201cEveryone he\u2019s partnered with has a strategic reason to be there,\u201d says Dennis Mannion, C.E.O. of the Detroit Pistons, who has held executive positions with teams in all four major American sports leagues. \u201cYou have this phenomenal bullpen of talent.\u201dSo after the shareholder Dennis Wong, the managing director of SPI Holdings, advised Lacob on the real estate purchase for the new arena, Walecka helped with the financing. When I spoke with Swinmurn, he reeled off rapid-fire opinions on the design of the Warriors\u2019 branded attire, the type of food sold at the concession stands and other disparate topics. Occasionally, minority partners can even influence what happens on the court.

And he\u2019s done it enough that it\u2019s just the course of things now. It\u2019s part of the process.\u201dSmall-percentage shareholders have always existed in sports, but they\u2019ve typically been local doctors or car dealers who\u2019ve thrown in maybe a few hundred thousand dollars. They get a trip to spring training or a playoff game, a handshake at the Christmas party, a nice profit when they sell their shares, and not much else. \u201cNothing is more limited than being a limited partner of George Steinbrenner\u2019s\u201d is a quip that is most frequently attributed to the former Yankees investor John McMullen.But sports isn\u2019t a small industry anymore. Playing the games and charging people to see them now constitutes only a fraction of the business. Franchises run gourmet restaurants and concert venues these days, and entire streets of retail outlets. They service fans in distant cities through audio and video streaming and proprietary content. Those owners who want to personally dictate everything \u201cdown to the color of the underwear,\u201d as Stevens puts it, can find themselves at a competitive disadvantage. \u201cIt\u2019s very hard when someone has had great success in another business \u2014 the fish-delivery business, the box-cutting business,\u201d Guber says. \u201cAnd then you come into this because \u2018I want to buy a sports team, and I know how to run a business.\u2019 That just isn\u2019t a formula for great success in today\u2019s world.\u201dLacob\u2019s experience in venture capital, building a diverse portfolio of businesses, prepared him well for the peculiarities of owning a franchise, which perhaps explained why spending time in the Warriors\u2019 front office often felt like hanging out at a software company. Soon after buying the team, Lacob supervised the removal of the walls inside its headquarters, which sit atop a parking garage in downtown Oakland. The various departments now share the same open-plan room; when I visited, I kept expecting to see a kegerator or some hoverboards. \u201cYou walk through there now, and it\u2019s young, and there\u2019s excitement,\u201d said Gib Arnold, a former University of Hawaii head coach, who spent several days observing the franchise last year. \u201cIt\u2019s Google in the N.B.A.\u201dCompetitive success is more elusive. Teams that win a sequence of titles, or even come close, need superior talent. That\u2019s especially true in basketball, where an extraordinary player \u2014 a Bill Russell, a Magic Johnson or a Michael Jordan \u2014 is one of only 10 on the court at any time. Put two or more together, uniting Kareem Abdul-Jabbar with Johnson or Jordan with Scottie Pippen, and you can create what in sports is hyperbolically called a dynasty.How much this ever has to do with the owner of the team is questionable. The Chicago Bulls amassed six N.B.A. titles with Jordan. But Jerry Reinsdorf, who bought the franchise in 1985, hasn\u2019t won since the last of those titles, in 1998. (He also has owned baseball\u2019s Chicago White Sox since 1981. The White Sox won the World Series in 2005 but otherwise have performed unmemorably.) Whatever magic Reinsdorf used to create the Bulls dynasty in the 1990s presumably remains at his disposal, yet the team has cracked .500 in just seven of the 17 seasons since Jordan departed. The determining factor there seems easy to identify.This isn\u2019t to say that owners have no impact. They choose how to spend their money \u2014 and how much of it to spend. They determine the goals of a franchise and how it will go about attaining them. But their attempts to directly influence the sports side of their operations have usually ended badly. \u201cThese people have been wildly successful in all their endeavors,\u201d says Jerry West, the N.B.A. Hall of Famer who spent 20 years as the general manager of the Los Angeles Lakers. \u201cBut being involved in a sports team is so much different than anything they\u2019ve done in their lives.\u201dIn Los Angeles, West worked for Jerry Buss, arguably the most successful owner in modern sports history. Buss presided over a franchise that reached the N.B.A. finals 16 times in his 33 seasons. He also invented or perfected club seating, luxury boxes and the glitzy showmanship that now seems an integral part of sporting events. \u201cJerry Buss was an innovator who thought basketball should have the cachet of a Broadway show,\u201d West told me. \u201cThe fun! The excitement! But what made that possible? It was winning the way we won. Magic Johnson played the game with a joy that everyone could see. And he played with maybe the greatest player ever in Kareem Abdul-Jabbar. And he had James Worthy. We had seven players you could put on an All-Star team. And Jerry Buss had nothing to do with that.\u201dAs West describes it, Buss regularly needed to be talked out of personnel moves that would have destroyed his team. \u201cYou don\u2019t know some of the things that he wanted to do,\u201d West said. He described one potential trade that Buss agreed to make: Worthy, the future Hall of Famer, to Dallas for Mark Aguirre and Roy Tarpley, who each had a reputation for being easily distracted. West found that idea so objectionable that he vowed to quit if Buss didn\u2019t renege. \u201cI went home to my wife and said, \u2018I\u2019m probably going to lose my job, but I can\u2019t have this happen,\u2019\u2009\u201d he says. In the end, West says, he was able to persuade Buss.When Lacob and Guber bought the Warriors, they hired West as a senior adviser. They hoped his reputation as a basketball genius could stave off criticism of any controversial personnel moves they might make \u2014 \u201cthe cover of darkness,\u201d as Guber termed it. \u201cPeter said, \u2018We\u2019re taking over this team, it\u2019s a disaster, it\u2019s going to be ugly, all these things will go wrong, we\u2019re not going to win for a while,\u2019\u2009\u201d Lacob recalls. \u201cIf we make a mistake, \u2018Well, Jerry West thought it was a good idea.\u2019\u2009\u201d But West was also promised a deeper role, one without decision-making power but with plenty of input. \u201cBringing in Jerry West is not just a V.C. move but a typical Kleiner move,\u201d says Vanguard Ventures\u2019 McConnell. \u201cThey always put Nobel laureates on their advisory boards. In basketball, that\u2019s West.\u201dWest is known for his spirited, and occasionally profane, defense of his strongly held opinions. But Lacob doesn\u2019t mind the shouting. His professional experience involved investing hundreds of millions of dollars in nascent businesses, some of them in categories that didn\u2019t yet exist, then relying on the judgment of the executives he hired to guide them to profitability. He doesn\u2019t just appreciate conviction; he relies on it.Since joining the Warriors, West has disagreed strongly with Lacob on several personnel moves. Each time, Lacob has deferred. \u201cNot everything you\u2019ll do as an owner will work,\u201d West says. \u201cSome things that you\u2019ll do, or might want to do, will not work. So you have to have the right people in place who can tell you that, not people who will crumble as soon as you express your opinion. That\u2019s the first part. And then you have to be willing to listen to them.\u201d With all the innovations that the ownership group has put into place, West seems to be saying, if Lacob\u2019s skin had been a little thinner or his need to assert his authority a little greater, the Warriors might still be struggling.Once he had his investors in place, Lacob treated the Warriors like another of his fledgling companies in need of adept management. In 2011, he hired Bob Myers as an assistant general manager. He promoted him to general manager a year later. Myers, now 41, lettered in basketball at U.C.L.A. as a walk-on, studied law at Loyola Marymount in Los Angeles, then started a career as an agent, representing athletes. \u201cThe reason I\u2019m sitting here now is because of that V.C. model,\u201d he told me. \u201cI had no track record. I had no past experience. If you only believed in past performance, you\u2019re talking to someone else. I mean, I wouldn\u2019t have hired me.\u201d Last season, Myers was named the N.B.A.\u2019s Executive of the Year.At Kleiner Perkins, Lacob was often forced to change entire management teams and restructure companies before he could make them profitable. He wasn\u2019t daunted by the challenge of turning around the Warriors. \u201cYou make highly contentious decisions in venture capital all the time,\u201d says Trae Vassallo, a former Kleiner Perkins partner who worked with Lacob. \u201cBut not everybody sees them.\u201dLacob understood that the Warriors, who had a losing record, needed to be dismantled before they could be rebuilt. He often had to implement a similar strategy with struggling companies. But the fans had been hearing about long-range plans for decades and had little confidence in them. And now they no longer had Ellis. The booing continued for so long that the former Warrior Rick Barry had to beseech the crowd to allow the ceremony to continue. By then, Lacob was shaking. The humiliation was so public, so raw, that Lacob\u2019s friends were moved to send messages of support. Many mention it now, four years later, as a rite of passage.That fall, the team had to decide whether to extend Curry\u2019s contract. The guard had shown flashes of exceptional talent, but he kept injuring his ankles. The previous season, which was shortened by a labor dispute, he missed 40 of 66 games. \u201cWe had to make a decision in the margins, in the gray area,\u201d Myers says. \u201cHe was hurt at the time \u2014 he\u2019d just sprained his ankle again.\u201d Lacob listened to both sides. Then he asked if anyone could recall an N.B.A. player whose career had ended because of ankle injuries. \u201cNobody could think of any,\u201d Myers says. \u201cAnd that kind of made the decision for us.\u201dWhat they did by offering Curry a four-year, $44 million extension, Lacob explained, was rely not on the future stability of Curry\u2019s anatomy so much as the composition of his psyche: his determination to push through nagging discomfort to make himself great. \u201cNow, if we were wrong, we\u2019d just committed $44 million to a player who can\u2019t play basketball,\u201d Myers says. \u201cSo the risk was there.\u201d Not only has Curry developed into the sport\u2019s best player, but his paltry \u2014 in terms of N.B.A. superstardom \u2014 $11 million annual compensation gives the Warriors ample salary-cap room to surround him with other talent.In 2011, Lacob and Guber chose Mark Jackson, the former St. John\u2019s and Knicks point guard, to be their team\u2019s head coach. Jackson was an unusual hire; he played for seven N.B.A. teams and worked as a commentator, but he had never coached. In his second and third seasons, he led the Warriors to the playoffs. \u201cWe were at the zero-yard line when Mark showed up here,\u201d Myers says. \u201cAnd he got us to the playoffs, and we won a round and became respectable.\u201d So when Lacob fired him in 2014, after a 51-31 season, and replaced him with Steve Kerr, the basketball world was shocked. But Lacob had decided that a different type of leadership was needed for the Warriors to make the leap from a playoff team to a championship team. Such noodling with success, replacing a leader with a limited strategic vision with another who is comfortable aiming higher, rarely happens in sports. But in venture capital it happens all the time.Lacob had known Kerr since the late \u201990s. They had been part of a group that traveled to Scotland on golfing trips. Kerr won N.B.A. titles as a player, first with Jordan and the Bulls and later with the Spurs. He ran the Suns\u2019 front office as their general manager. He had commentated on N.B.A. broadcasts. What he hadn\u2019t done, as the man in charge or even as an assistant, was coach a basketball team. But Lacob had an intuition that Kerr would do better in the organization\u2019s structure \u2014 in which department heads are expected to weigh in on matters outside their jurisdiction \u2014 than the more regimented Jackson.Kerr\u2019s willingness to at least consider suggestions from almost any source may have saved the Warriors during last year\u2019s championship series. They were behind Cleveland, 2-1, when Nick U\u2019Ren \u2014 Kerr\u2019s assistant, whose responsibilities include constructing the musical playlists used during practices and splicing highlight reels \u2014 happened to be watching a tape of the 2014 playoffs. Noticing how San Antonio defended LeBron James, he suggested that the Warriors replace Bogut in the lineup with Andre Iguodala, who is half a foot shorter but athletic enough to at least force James to work to get good shots. Kerr took the suggestion, and the Warriors didn\u2019t lose another game. Kerr publicly gave U\u2019Ren the credit.\u201cI\u2019ve played for nine different organizations,\u201d Shaun Livingston, a Warriors guard, told me, \u201cand I\u2019ve never seen anything like that. This wasn\u2019t even an assistant coach; it was a video coordinator. And Steve Kerr listened to him, and he did it. All the bridges are open here. There\u2019s an open forum of ideas. A good idea really can come from anywhere. And that kind of thinking has to start at the top.\u201dEven after winning the league\u2019s M.V.P. award last season, Curry has improved in virtually every trackable metric. He is averaging more than 30 points a game while making 51 percent of his shots, including a preposterous 46 percent of three-pointers. Still, there\u2019s no way to do statistical justice to those stretches on the court, sometimes a minute or two and sometimes an entire quarter, when Curry appears to have entered a freeze frame, running around while everyone else remains still.I saw it happen in Oakland this season. The Warriors were behind Phoenix in the second quarter. Curry hit a casually spectacular fadeaway from the foul line that ended with him sitting on the court. Then he brought the ball downcourt at speed and abruptly flipped it to another player, who was unguarded, without looking his way, creating an easy jumper. Finally, with the crowd at full roar, Curry launched the ball from several steps beyond the three-point line, and its parabola toward the basket seemed to last forever. It was impossible to watch the ball and Curry at the same time, but out of the corner of my eye I saw Curry turn and begin to run back downcourt, his arms spread wide, before his shot had even reached the top of its trajectory. For me, the moment seemed to crystallize the entire Warriors season.Lacob presents winning as an inevitable result of the way the team has been constructed. I couldn\u2019t argue with one of the best records in N.B.A. history. Yet I also couldn\u2019t shake the idea that the story could easily have gone a different direction. Since the start of the 2013-14 season, the Warriors have won 76 percent of their games. Playing without Curry, they\u2019re 3-6. And if he were sidelined for the playoffs tomorrow, it seems unlikely that the Warriors would be favored to win the championship. As with Jordan and the Bulls, a strong case can be made that Curry, not the ownership group, provides the point of difference. \u201cThey did what every really good organization should do with their star,\u201d the Bucks\u2019 Lasry said. \u201cThey nurtured him. But they got lucky in that Steph became far and away the best player in the league.\u201dStill, Curry\u2019s mere presence wouldn\u2019t have created the means to overhaul a franchise. It takes an extraordinary player to do it \u2014 but that isn\u2019t all it takes. LeBron James still hasn\u2019t won a championship for the Cavaliers; playing together, the perennial All-Stars Kevin Durant and Russell Westbrook haven\u2019t won in Oklahoma City. The decision to keep Curry, coupled with the good fortune that he remained healthy and grew into a transcendent player, gave Lacob and Guber\u2019s structural innovations the chance to have their desired effect. But as Lacob sees it, Curry\u2019s dominance on the court, though essential, is inextricable from everything else he\u2019s done with the franchise over the last few years, from knocking down the office walls to the Ellis trade. \u201cIt\u2019s not just Steph Curry,\u201d he told me once. \u201cIt\u2019s architecting a team, a style of play, the way they all play together. It\u2019s all extremely thought through.\u201dThis confluence of good planning and luck reminded me of a conversation I had with Lacob over a glass of wine one evening at the Bridge Club. He confided that he figures he\u2019s one of the 10 best blackjack players in the world. \u201cI shouldn\u2019t say this,\u201d he added, \u201cbut I\u2019ve won over $1 million at one sitting nine times.\u201d As in gambling, there are no certain outcomes in sports, which is exactly what makes them worth watching. Whether you\u2019re playing pickup basketball on a Tuesday morning or hoping to turn a substandard N.B.A. franchise into a champion, all you can do is try to increase your chances of getting the outcome you desire. It was easy to see that Lacob had a knack for doing just that. For everything he did, he had worked out a system.As an undergraduate at Irvine, Lacob took a calculus class from Edward Thorp, whose 1962 book, \u201cBeat the Dealer,\u201d proved that a blackjack player could gain a slight edge on the house by counting cards. Thorp was banned by casinos, so he taught his students the system, backed them on trips to Las Vegas and shared in the rewards. Lacob was one of those students. When he goes to a casino now, his blackjack sessions aren\u2019t certainties, but Lacob has far better odds of succeeding at them than anyone else at the table. His purchase of the Warriors, I realized, was the same way. He counted the cards and played the odds. And he won.Bruce Schoenfeld is a frequent contributor to the magazine.

{"Headline": "Why We Think We\u2019re Better Investors Than We Are", "Date": "2016-03-25", "News": "Supported bySpecial SectionFrom their earliest days, the loosely confederated research efforts that came to be known as behavioral economics spawned a large quantity of studies centered on securities investment. This was not because the field\u2019s pioneers were especially interested in stocks and bonds, nor was the early research commonly underwritten by financial services firms.Rather, the hive of activity that evolved into its own field \u2014 behavioral finance \u2014 reflected that investment markets provide unusually robust data sets for analyzing \u201cjudgment under uncertainty\u201d (the title of a seminal textbook co-edited by the winner of a Nobel in economic science, the behavioral economist Daniel Kahneman) and \u201cdecision under risk\u201d (a phrase in the subtitle of his Nobel-winning \u201cProspect Theory\u201d). Every day, global securities markets provide researchers with billions of data points for understanding how people make choices when resources are at stake and the outcome is unknown.Which, if you think about it, is a fair description of most decisions. Indeed, the majority of cognitive biases and shortcuts that influence everyday judgment and choice have analogues in investment behavior. Consider the \u201csunk cost fallacy,\u201d a primary reason an unhappy lawyer might struggle to leave the law and an unsuccessful investor might balk at selling money-losing shares.Both people are highly likely to obsess over their sunk cost \u2014 law school tuition and time served for the lawyer, the original investment amount for the stock picker \u2014 in a nonconscious desire to justify their earlier decisions. Both are also very likely to fall prey to \u201closs aversion,\u201d a key tenet of Prospect Theory, which tells us that humans typically respond to the loss of resources \u2014 be it time, effort, emotion, material goods or their proxy, i.e., money \u2014 more strongly than they react to a similar gain.What differentiates the typical lawyer and average investor, however, is their justification for engaging in their activity. Lawyers are trained to do what they do, while the majority of investors are not. Ask a random player in a law firm\u2019s basketball league whether he or she could compete with LeBron James, and the most common response will be laughter. Yet many of those lawyers would willingly compete with the billionaire investor Warren E. Buffett.Despite the spectacular growth of index funds \u2014 passive investment vehicles that track market averages and minimize transaction costs \u2014 millions of amateur investors continue to actively buy and sell securities regularly. This despite overwhelming evidence that even professional investors are no more likely to beat the market than monkeys throwing darts at securities listings.Money managers, at least, are paid to make investment bets. But why do amateurs believe they can outperform the professionals \u2014 or even identify those pros who will outperform? (Performance of individual mutual funds cannot be predicted with any greater degree of accuracy than individual stocks or bonds.) Many biases and cognitive errors contribute to this costly behavior, but a few deserve mention.Consider this pair of challenges:Give high and low estimates for the average weight of an empty Boeing 747, picking numbers far enough apart to be 90 percent certain that the true answer falls somewhere in between. Now, give high and low estimates for the diameter of the moon in miles. Again, choose numbers far enough apart to be 90 percent certain that the true answer falls somewhere in between.Come up with a range for each so you could confidently bet $9 against the prospect of winning $1.As it happens, an empty 747 weighs nearly 400,000 pounds, and the diameter of the moon is roughly 2,200 miles. But research involving these and similar problems suggests that these answers do not fall within your high and low estimates. That\u2019s because most people do not realize how little they know about the subjects or how difficult it is to bracket estimates as requested.Instead, people come up with what they believe to be logical estimates of the plane\u2019s weight and moon\u2019s diameter, then they adjust from those figures to arrive at their brackets. But unless you work for Boeing or NASA, your initial estimates are probably going to be wildly off the mark, so the brackets should be wider they probably are \u2014 say, from one pound to one billion pounds for the plane\u2019s weight and from one mile to a billion miles for the lunar diameter. That most people do not default to such broad ranges reflects a trait that behavioral economists call overconfidence. This is not run-of-the-mill arrogance, but rather the tendency we all have to overrate our abilities, knowledge and skill, at whatever level we might place them.Studies have revealed significant overconfidence in the judgments of scientists, lawyers, engineers, doctors and those in other professions. The University of Pennsylvania psychologists Philip Tetlock and Barbara Mellers collected more than 25,000 forecasts from people whose job it was to anticipate how the future would unfold. All demonstrated remarkable overconfidence. When they were 80 percent sure of their predictions, they were correct less than 60 percent of the time.Another example is shown in a 2012 study from the State Street Center for Applied Research, in which investors were asked about their financial acumen.\u201cNearly two-thirds rated their financial sophistication as advanced,\u201d said Mirtha Kastrapeli, a senior research analyst at State Street. \u201cThis seemed a little optimistic, so in our 2014 study, The Folklore of Finance, we ran a financial literacy exam. The average score was just 61 percent, barely a passing grade. This disconnect between actual and perceived financial sophistication, she explains, is evidence of how widespread the overconfidence bias is.\u201dOverconfidence is hard-wired into our brains because it is useful. Many of our mental biases evolved because they make us cautious or they otherwise protect us from harm, but overconfidence is part of a suite of cognitive traits that serve to propel us forward. Just as no one would think to write a children\u2019s book about a train engine that repeats, \u201cI think I can\u2019t,\u201d few explorers would venture into the wild \u2014 and few entrepreneurs would start new businesses \u2014 unless they believed that they would succeed in the face of long odds.A bias toward optimism helps to explain why many, if not most, smokers are confident that they will not develop cancer; why many drivers are certain that their texting will not lead to an accident; and why many investors believe they can outperform the market. \u201cWe are evolutionarily programmed to believe that things will work out,\u201d said David Hirshleifer, a finance professor at the University of California, Irvine.More confounding than the existence of investor overconfidence is its persistence: As markets teach us costly lessons, we should grow humble. But the fact that many do not reflects what Professor Hirshleifer describes as self-enhancing psychological processes. One of the biggest esteem builders is hindsight bias, or the tendency to rewrite our own history to make ourselves look good. In landmark experiments by the psychologist Baruch Fischhoff, then at Hebrew University, study participants were directed to make predictions about real-life events, then were asked periodically to recall the events and their predictions after the fact. His findings? Participants consistently misremembered their forecasts, in ways that made them look smarter. Too often we look back not in anger but in awe, at least of our own capacities.Of course, many people easily recall failures, which suggests that hindsight bias is not all that powerful. But even when our failures remain vivid memories, we remember them in a way that neutralizes their ability to inhibit our present-day decisions. When events unfold that confirm our thoughts or deeds, we attribute that happy outcome to our skills, knowledge or intuition. But when life proves our actions or beliefs to have been wrong, we blame outside causes over which we had no control \u2014 and thus maintain our faith in ourselves. The Harvard psychologist Ellen Langer describes the phenomenon as, \u201cHeads I win, tails it\u2019s chance.\u201dFinally, even if investors are not rewriting history or blaming outside forces, they are still highly likely to miss signs of their own incompetence. The culprit is confirmation bias, which leads us to give too much weight to information that supports existing beliefs and discount that which does not. And those existing beliefs need not be long held, explains Thomas Gilovich, a Cornell University psychology professor. \u201cOnce one entertains the idea that \u2018this seems like a good investment,\u2019 the processing of relevant information narrows considerably \u2014 and in a direction that leads to overconfidence.\u201dProfessor Gilovich, an author of \u201cThe Wisest One in the Room: How You Can Benefit from Social Psychology\u2019s Most Powerful Insights,\u201d warns that overcoming overconfidence is difficult. Common prescriptions include a meaningful period of diligently logging one\u2019s investment ideas, to keep track of hits and misses. Note the emphasis on ideas and not just actions. More often than not, the aforementioned biases lead us to recall investments that soared that we thought to make but did not \u2014 and to forget those that plummeted.Professor Hirshleifer advises a strategy of self-distancing, or considering the opposite side of any transaction before making it.Such a strategy was also recommended by Professor Gilovich, with a caveat. \u201cSomething more specific and guided is likely to be more effective, like conducting a \u2018pre-mortem,\u2019 \u201d he said. \u201cThe idea is to suppose that your idea bombed. What would you be saying to yourself right now about how or why you should have foreseen it?\u201dGary Belsky is an author of \u201cWhy Smart People Make Big Money Mistakes and How to Correct Them: Lessons From the Life-Changing Science of Behavioral Economics.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "MCC Theater to Kick Off Construction of Its New Home", "Date": "2016-03-21", "News": "Supported byIt has been a long journey from start to sledgehammer.On Tuesday, MCC leaders will finally hold a symbolic groundbreaking ceremony (they will take swings at a wall that is to be torn down), saying they plan to begin construction next month on a 27,000-square-foot home that will include two theaters, administrative offices and rehearsal space.The theater expects to mount works in the new spaces in 2018-19, five seasons later than initially anticipated. It plans to increase the number of works presented annually to six, from four, and to put on more musicals.The new complex, which MCC is to operate under a 99-year-lease, will be an improvement for the company in multiple ways. Control of the space will make longer runs for in-demand shows possible, higher stage heights will allow for more complex theatrical rigging, and a black-box space will offer flexibility in stage and seating configuration.Walking through the construction site last week \u2014 a series of cavernous spaces with architectural renderings on easels to help visitors imagine the plans \u2014 MCC\u2019s three artistic directors, Robert LuPone, Bernard Telsey and William Cantler, mused aloud about the new kinds of shows they would be able to do.\u201cMany times we\u2019ve done plays, and artists would say, \u2018I wish I could take the seats out,\u2019 or, \u2018I wish I could flip it around,\u2019 or, \u2018I wish I could build,\u2019\u201d Mr. Telsey said as he surveyed the future black-box theater. \u201cAll of that could happen here, with the one constriction that it\u2019s going to be intimate.\u201dMCC has budgeted the project at $35 million \u2014 $27 million for construction and an additional $8 million for expanded programming and operations. The city has contributed $25.5 million; the theater has raised $4.4 million during what it called a quiet phase of fund-raising and says it will now turn its efforts to raising the balance.\u201cI don\u2019t think we have any concerns about our ability to get to the finish line,\u201d said Blake West, the MCC executive director. \u201cWe\u2019ve been developing and cultivating relationships with donors. Now we will launch the public phase of this campaign.\u201dFor the last 10 years, MCC has been presenting its work in a rented 198-seat space at the Lucille Lortel Theater, in the West Village, and rents other spaces around the city for its offices, rehearsal spaces, youth company and other student programs. Once the new space is finished, the officials said, MCC will consolidate all of its functions there.With the larger space will come, inevitably, higher costs. MCC expects to expand the size of its staff, to 25 from 15, and its annual operating budget, to $5.25 million from $3.8 million, according to Mr. West.The company hopes the new space will also help it to build a stable audience: People who see shows at the Lortel don\u2019t always understand the MCC connection. The nonprofit plans to kick off a branding campaign to accompany the move uptown.\u201cWe\u2019ve never, in 30 years, had our own space,\u201d Mr. West said, \u201cand to have a space that is a destination helps cement your identity.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Two songs later he tossed away his jacket and he remained bare-chested through the rest of his two-hour set at the Moody Theater here. After he belted out the credo of \u201cFuntime\u201d \u2014 \u201cI just do what I want to do\u201d \u2014 he stage-dived into the audience. At 68, he was not holding back.Mr. Homme has long professed his admiration for Iggy Pop, but they collaborated as equals who spurred each other on. Iggy Pop\u2019s curt lyrics cackle about decadence and disillusionment, but also \u2014 in \u201cBreak Into Your Heart,\u201d which starts as a boast and ends as something like an apology \u2014 show grown-up compassion. Other songs face down the modern world, as he has since the 1960s. \u201cSunday\u201d contends with the pressures of work and the economy; \u201cAmerican Valhalla\u201d ponders the possibility of an afterlife earned by heroic warriors. In \u201cParaguay,\u201d he longs for a tropical haven and ends up ranting about information overload, still deeply cantankerous.The music melds Iggy Pop\u2019s primal riffs with the arching melodies and structural convolutions that Mr. Homme has brought to his own songs, embracing the richness of his baritone while forging a band sound that is at once brutally effective and utterly clear: a crystalline hammer.The tour band includes Mr. Homme and the other two musicians who made the album: Dean Fertita (from Queens of the Stone Age) on guitar and keyboards and Matt Helders (from the Arctic Monkeys) on drums, along with Troy Van Leeuwen from Queens of the Stone Age on guitar and Matt Sweeney from Chavez on bass.Old and new, the songs grew even more forceful onstage. The musicians, dressed in tuxedos like a Motown-era backup band, never tried to upstage Iggy Pop \u2014 not that they could have. They dug into the details of the original 1977 arrangements, like the guitar filigrees within \u201cLust for Life\u201d and the twin-guitar coda of \u201cChina Girl.\u201d And they gave the new songs more heft and swagger while revealing why every note mattered.But it was Iggy Pop\u2019s show all the way. He sang with full-throated conviction, utterly hard-nosed within the songs but grinning and thankful between them. He struck poses with every muscle clenched, he jittered across the stage, he repeatedly kicked around his microphone stand and a stool he barely used. \u201cWe\u2019re playing a long time,\u201d he said, \u201cbecause it\u2019s a long life.\u201d After the set ended and the band had exited the stage, Iggy Pop remained, twitching with energy, before he left with some final fist-pumping and a big wave goodbye. The songs, from \u201cTonight\u201d to \u201cAmerican Valhalla,\u201d had faced up to death with muscle and sinew; the life force had won. It was an Iggy Pop concert, after all.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Where Merrick Garland Stands: A Close Look at His Judicial Record", "Date": "2016-03-17", "News": "Supported byA look at a substantial sample of his opinions starts to supply some answers about how he managed this unlikely feat. His writings reflect an able and modest judge with a limited conception of his role working on a docket largely lacking in cases on controversial social issues.In more run-of-the-mill cases, he was apt to side with workers claiming employment discrimination and against criminal defendants who said their rights had been violated.Throughout, Judge Garland\u2019s opinions were models of judicial craftsmanship \u2014 unflashy, methodically reasoned, attentive to precedent and tightly rooted in the language of the governing statutes and regulations. He appears to apply Supreme Court precedents with punctilious fidelity even if there is reason to think he would have preferred a different outcome and even where other judges might have found room to maneuver.\u201cHe\u2019s been a lower-court judge and acted like one for these past 19 years,\u201d said Neal K. Katyal, a former acting United States solicitor general.But that also means that Judge Garland\u2019s opinions provide only glimpses of how he would vote and write if he overcomes Republican objections to fill the seat left vacant by the death of Justice Antonin Scalia.Judge Garland\u2019s court, the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, is prestigious but has a limited and idiosyncratic docket tilting toward administrative law. The court seldom confronts the volatile controversies that routinely engage the justices, like abortion, affirmative action, gay rights and the death penalty.Merrick B. Garland is a candidate who had support from Republicans in the past but would still move the court in a progressive direction.The D.C. Circuit does get a steady diet of cases on efforts to combat terrorism and on the role of money in politics, and they illustrate Judge Garland\u2019s moderate, case-by-case approach.\u201cThe government suggests that several of the assertions in the intelligence documents are reliable because they are made in at least three different documents,\u201d he wrote. \u201cWe are not persuaded. Lewis Carroll notwithstanding, the fact that the government has \u2018said it thrice\u2019 does not make an allegation true.\u201d\u201cThe new search procedures promote the safety of the guards and inmates by more effectively preventing the hoarding of medication and the smuggling of dangerous contraband,\u201d the opinion concluded.In campaign finance cases, too, Judge Garland followed Supreme Court precedent in ways that sometimes frustrated liberals and sometimes cheered them.Citizens United concerned only independent spending by corporations and unions, not rich people. But it said that there was only one justification for restricting political spending: quid pro quo corruption akin to bribery. It added that independent spending could never satisfy that standard.That both cases were unanimous suggests that the D.C. Circuit works hard to achieve consensus and confirms findings by political scientists that ideological voting is less common on federal appeals courts than on the Supreme Court.\u201cThe plaintiffs in these cases allege that they were beaten, electrocuted, raped, subjected to attacks by dogs and otherwise abused by private contractors working as interpreters and interrogators,\u201d he wrote, adding that both the Bush and Obama administrations, along with Congress, \u201chave repeatedly and vociferously condemned the conduct at Abu Ghraib as contrary to the values and interests of the United States.\u201dThe majority, Judge Garland wrote, had to ignore all of that to fashion \u201cthe protective cloak it has cast over the activities of private contractors.\u201dLaurence H. Tribe, a law professor at Harvard, said Judge Garland\u2019s dissenting opinion was \u201cparticularly admirable.\u201d\u201cThat dissent is a fine example of an opinion that combines impeccable legal analysis with a deep sense of humanity,\u201d he said.Even assuming Judge Garland\u2019s appellate decisions are a good indication of how he would vote on the Supreme Court, the key question is not where he stands in some abstract sense but where he would fit into the ideological array on the current court.Political scientists say the answer is clear. Judge Garland is well to the left of Justice Anthony M. Kennedy, the member of the court at its ideological center and the one who often holds the controlling vote. A Supreme Court including Judge Garland would contain a five-member liberal bloc and put either him or perhaps Justice Stephen G. Breyer, the most conservative liberal, in what had been Justice Kennedy\u2019s pivotal spot.Not all of the justices\u2019 votes are predictable, of course, and their alliances can shift. Judge Garland, a former prosecutor, leans slightly to the right in criminal cases, for instance. On the other hand, he appears to be more sensitive to press freedom than any member of the current Supreme Court.The ruling, Judge Garland wrote, would \u201croutinely succeed in putting reporters who receive whistle-blower leaks to the choice of testifying or going to jail.\u201d He said requests for reporters\u2019 sources should be granted only if the litigant\u2019s interest in learning the information outweighed the public interest in protecting reporters\u2019 access to information.\u201cIt strains credulity,\u201d Judge Garland wrote, \u201cto suggest that an agency charged with gathering intelligence affecting the national security does not have an \u2018intelligence interest\u2019 in drone strikes, even if that agency does not operate the drones itself.\u201d\u201cIt is undisputed,\u201d the opinion said, \u201cthat the government is withholding the images not to shield wrongdoing or avoid embarrassment, but rather to prevent the killing of Americans and violence against American interests.\u201dBecause of an editing error, an article on Friday about Judge Merrick Garland\u2019s judicial record and how it has earned him praise across the political spectrum referred imprecisely to his connection to the Citizens United campaign finance case. While he joined a panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit in a campaign finance decision that built on Citizens United, he was not involved in the Citizens United case itself.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Ethics Group Urges Inquiry of Mortgage Banking Lobbyist Who Led F.H.A.", "Date": "2016-02-29", "News": "Supported byA nonprofit watchdog group on Monday called for an investigation of David H. Stevens, chief executive of the Mortgage Bankers Association, arguing that he may have violated ethics laws relating to his previous position as commissioner of the Federal Housing Administration.An investigation, the center said, would determine whether Mr. Stevens had violated federal rules barring former government officials from \u201ccommunicating or appearing on behalf of persons or entities with respect to matters in which the former officials \u2018personally and substantially participated\u2019 during their government service.\u201dThe ethics group also asked the government officials to look into whether Mr. Stevens had violated the law by trying to influence matters of interest to the mortgage bankers for a brief period when he was still in the government but had accepted the lobbying post. He was the F.H.A. commissioner, a post within HUD, from mid-2009 through March 2011.Mr. Stevens declined to comment. John T. Mechem, a spokesman for the association, replied on his behalf.\u201cSince ending his government service, Dave has regularly consulted with attorneys inside and outside M.B.A. to make sure that he and the association are always in full compliance with the law,\u201d Mr. Mechem\u2019s statement said. \u201cOutside counsel to M.B.A. has specifically reviewed Dave\u2019s activities on behalf of M.B.A. and its members and has confirmed that Dave has operated fully within the letter and spirit of the lobbying laws and ethics rules.\u201dThe statement added that the \u201cunfounded allegations are part of a concerted campaign\u201d by those with an apparent financial incentive to discredit Mr. Stevens and his work at the lobbying group.The request for an investigation from the National Legal and Policy Center is the second such call for scrutiny of Mr. Stevens\u2019s activities after he left government.A spokesman for the accountability group said the Justice Department had acknowledged its request in December, but that it had heard nothing since.In seeking an investigation, the legal and policy center said it had identified more than 25 potential ethics violations by Mr. Stevens.Before Mr. Stevens announced that he was leaving his government post for the Mortgage Bankers Association, he was a participant in deliberations over the status of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, which were taken over by the United States in September 2008, just as the housing market collapse erupted into the worst economic and financial crisis since the Depression. The companies remain in conservatorship under the oversight of the Federal Housing Finance Agency.The legal and policy center contended that as head of the association, Mr. Stevens had lobbied on some of the same issues that he had worked on as the F.H.A. commissioner. It cited correspondence he had submitted to housing agencies as they deliberated new rules for the mortgage industry.In calling for investigations, the ethics group also noted numerous meetings Mr. Stevens had attended with top officials at HUD, the White House and the Federal Housing Finance Agency.Mr. Stevens\u2019s communications with federal employees on these matters may have violated ethics rules, the group said, because the government still directly oversees Fannie and Freddie, which operated before the takeover as quasi-independent government-sponsored enterprises to support the housing industry and encourage homeownership.The rule was intended to discourage mortgage issuers from dumping high-risk loans into pools and escaping responsibility when they failed. This practice generated billions of dollars in losses for unsuspecting investors during the credit crisis.In the email, Mr. Stevens warned Mr. Cordray that the rule, as proposed, \u201cwill likely cause significant contraction in new mortgage lending\u201d and could hurt the overall economy.\u201cLook, I know I head this M.B.A.,\u201d Mr. Stevens wrote in the email, \u201cbut I am also a 30-year veteran of this industry and someone who spent a couple of years inside working on policy as you both know.\u201dThe consumer bureau posted Mr. Stevens\u2019s email on its website as an ex parte communication, indicating that it had not been submitted publicly.\u201cEven by Washington\u2019s current low standards,\u201d Ken Boehm, chairman of the National Legal and Policy Center, said in a statement, \u201cStevens was particularly brazen in apparently ignoring the pertinent statutes and ethics regulations.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "China Sought Fed's Crash Notes", "Date": "2016-03-21", "News": "Supported byInside AsiaWASHINGTON \u2014 Confronted with a plunge in its stock markets last year, China\u2019s central bank swiftly reached out to the United States Federal Reserve, asking it to share its playbook from dealing with Wall Street\u2019s \u201cBlack Monday\u201d crash of 1987.The request came in a July 27 email from an official at the People\u2019s Bank of China, the central bank, with a subject line: \u201cYour urgent assistance is greatly appreciated!\u201dIn the email to a senior Fed staffer, the Chinese bank\u2019s New York-based chief representative for the Americas, Song Xiangyan, pointed to the day\u2019s 8.5 percent drop in Chinese stocks and said, \u201cMy Governor would like to draw from your good experience.\u201dIt is not known whether the People\u2019s Bank of China had contacted the Fed to deal with previous incidents of market turmoil. The Chinese central bank and the Fed had no comment when reached by Reuters.In a Reuters analysis last year, Fed insiders, former Fed employees and economists said that there was no official hotline between the Chinese central bank and the Fed, and that the Chinese were often reluctant to engage at international meetings.The Chinese market crash led to steep declines across global financial markets, and within a few hours the Fed sent China\u2019s central bank a trove of publicly available documents detailing the Fed\u2019s actions in 1987. Fed policy makers started their previously scheduled two-day policy meeting the next day and took note of China\u2019s stock sell-off, according the meeting\u2019s minutes. Several policy makers said a Chinese economic slowdown could weigh on America. Financial market contagion from China was one of the reasons cited by the Fed in September when it put off a rate increase that many analysts had expected, a sign of how important China has become both as an industrial powerhouse and as a financial market.The email exchange, which Reuters obtained through a Freedom of Information Act request, shows how alarmed Beijing has become over the deepening financial turmoil and offers a rare insight into one of the least understood major central banks.The exchange also shows that although the two central banks have a collegial relationship, they might not share secrets even during a crisis. \u201cCould you please inform us ASAP about the major measures you took at the time,\u201d Mr. Song asked Steven Kamin, the director of the Fed\u2019s International Finance Division, in the July 27 email.The message registered in Mr. Kamin\u2019s account just after 11 a.m. in Washington. Mr. Kamin quickly replied from his BlackBerry: \u201cWe\u2019ll try to get you something soon.\u201dWhat followed five hours later was a 259-word summary of how the Fed worked to calm markets and prevent a recession after the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index tumbled 20 percent on Oct. 19, 1987.Mr. Kamin also sent notes to guide Chinese officials through the many dozens of pages of Fed transcripts, statements and reports that were attached to the email.All of the attached documents had long been available on the Fed\u2019s website, and it is unclear whether they played a role in shaping Beijing\u2019s actions. Mr. Kamin\u2019s documents detail how the Fed began issuing statements the day after the Black Monday market crash, pledging to supply markets with plenty of cash so they could function. By the time Mr. Song wrote to Mr. Kamin, China had spent more than a month fighting a stock market slide, and many of the actions taken by the People\u2019s Bank of China and other Chinese authorities shared the contours of the Fed\u2019s 1987 game plan.China\u2019s central bank had cut interest rates on June 27 in similar fashion to the Fed\u2019s swift move to ease short-term rates in 1987.Mr. Song told Mr. Kamin that the Chinese central bank was particularly interested in the details of the Fed\u2019s use of repurchase agreements to temporarily inject cash into the American banking system in 1987. The People\u2019s Bank of China had increased cash injections in June and accelerated repurchase agreements in August as stocks continued to slide. The bank also eased policy on Aug. 11 by allowing a 2 percent devaluation in the renminbi. As Mr. Song and Mr. Kamin exchanged messages on July 27 and 28, other Chinese authorities were busy trying to contain the crash. The July 27 plunge in the Shanghai composite index was the biggest one-day fall since 2007. The Chinese market had lost nearly a third of its value over six weeks. China\u2019s securities regulator said on July 27 it was prepared to buy shares to stabilize the stock market and that authorities would deal severely with anyone making \u201cmalicious\u201d bets that stocks would fall.In 1987, the Fed contacted banks directly and encouraged them to meet \u201clegitimate funding needs\u201d of their customers, according to Mr. Kamin\u2019s email to Mr. Song.In addition to its pledges and cajoling, the Fed in 1987 eased collateral restrictions on Wall Street and tried to calm markets by intervening in trading earlier than normal. The United States economy continued to grow until a recession in 1990.The Chinese central bank does not have as free a hand to conduct policy as does the Fed, which answers to Congress but operates independently from the administration. The Chinese central bank\u2019s governor, Zhou Xiaochuan, implements policies ultimately decided by political leaders in Beijing and lacks the authority to lead debate or shed light on decision-making.China\u2019s vice finance minister told Reuters last year that Chinese supervisors needed to learn from countries like the United States.Premier Li Keqiang said last month that China\u2019s regulators did not respond sufficiently but that China had fended off risks to the system. United States central bankers say their relative transparency helps their effectiveness and legitimacy, but open records laws also make Fed officials cautious about their communications, much of which must be made public when requested. Stanley Fischer, the Fed\u2019s current vice chairman, has said that transparency makes it harder for policy makers to have informal discussions. Mr. Kamin pointed out in his email that everything he was sending was publicly available.\u201cI hope this is helpful,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Stern Message to North Korea", "Date": "2016-03-03", "News": "Supported byEditorialGoing beyond sanctions in place since 2006, the Security Council mandated that all North Korean cargo entering or leaving a country must be inspected by that country. Some 16 individuals and 12 companies have been added to the sanctions list, allowing for asset freezes and travel bans. North Korea is forbidden from selling gold and rare-earth minerals. But even under the sanctions, the North would still be able to buy oil, and also sell its coal and iron ore as long as the proceeds are not used to finance the nuclear program. This could be hard to track.No matter how tough on paper, the sanctions will be effective only if they are enforced. There are good reasons to doubt that every country will follow through. The burden falls heavily on China, the North\u2019s chief ally in providing food, fuel and political cover.Chinese leaders have long opposed the North\u2019s nuclear program, but until now they have been reluctant to tighten sanctions, fearing that doing so would destabilize North Korea and send refugees fleeing to China. It took pressure from Washington and the South Korean government to get China to shift course.North Korea\u2019s nuclear program, first detected nearly 30 years ago, has defied a long-term solution. In 1994, the Clinton administration signed an agreement that froze the North\u2019s plutonium program for nearly a decade before the deal fell apart. President Obama and his predecessor, George W. Bush, largely let the problem drift, as the North\u2019s nuclear arsenal grew to a currently estimated 10 to 16 warheads, most of them produced since 2003.Tougher sanctions, as important as they are, will not by themselves end this long-term threat. At some point, the Americans, along with China, South Korea, Japan and Russia, will have to find a way to revive negotiations with North Korea to shut down, or at least curb, its nuclear program. In recent months, secret contacts between the Americans and the North foundered on whether to focus on denuclearization or on replacing the current Korean War armistice with a formal peace treaty.Mr. Obama has little time left in his presidency to embark on complex, multiparty negotiations; experts say the North is more confident than ever of its nuclear achievements and less inclined to negotiate. But it is important to get a dialogue going.Advertisement"}

We have Republican support. We had a president willing to sign it. I voted for that bill. Senator Sanders voted against it.Just think, imagine where we would be today is we had achieved comprehensive immigration reform nine years ago. Imagine how much more secure families would be in our country, no longer fearing the deportation of a loved one; no longer fearing that they would be found out.So I am staunchly in favor of comprehensive immigration reform and have been so over the course of my public career.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)(END VIDEO CLIP)(CROSSTALK)Of course, that type of (inaudible) leads to a race to the bottom for all of our people. And I worked very hard on that issue. And of course, I supported the 2013 immigration reform bill. And what I believe right now is not only that we need comprehensive immigration reform, if the Congress does not do its job, as president of the United States I will use the executive powers of that office to do what has to be done, to do what President Obama did, and expand on that.(APPLAUSE)... if you\u2019re saying that you would expand on the executive actions, how do you that they\u2019re not going to end up in a legal battle just like Obama\u2019s executive actions?But to your point, we have to do the best we can. I applaud President Obama for his efforts on DAPA and DACA. And I think we have got to expand those efforts.(APPLAUSE) You know, I think it\u2019s very hard to make the case that Ted Kennedy, Barack Obama, me, La Raza, United Farmworkers, Dolores Huerta, leaders of the Latino community, would have supported a bill that actually promoted modern slavery. That was one of the many excuses used not to vote for the 2007 bill.And I will go back to what I said. If we had been able to get that passed, we would be so much further along now. I\u2019m committed to defending DAPA and DACA. I\u2019m committed to going even further to get more people deferred action, to go as far as I can under the law. And I am committed to introducing comprehensive immigration reform with a path to citizenship in the first 100 days of my presidency.SALINAS: Secretary Sanders (sic). Senator, would you like to respond?(APPLAUSE)When we talk about immigration, the secretary will remember that one of the great tragedies, human tragedies of recent years is children came from Honduras where there\u2019s probably more violence than almost any place in this country, and they came into this country. And I said welcome those children into this country, Secretary Clinton said send them back. That\u2019s a difference.First of all, that is something that is not fair about what I said. I did say we needed to be very concerned about little children coming to this country \u2014 on their own, very often \u2014 many of them not making it. And when they got here, they needed, as I have argued for, legal counsel, due process, to make a decision. We need to end private detention, we need to end family detention.And in 2006, when Senator Sanders was running for the Senate from Vermont, he voted in the House with hard-line Republicans for indefinite detention for undocumented immigrants, and then he sided with those Republicans to stand with vigilantes known as Minute Men who were taking up outposts along the border to hunt down immigrants.So I think when you were running for the Senate, you made it clear by your vote, Senator, that you were going to stand with the Republicans. When you got to the Senate in 2007, one of the first things you did was vote against Ted Kennedy\u2019s immigration reform which he\u2019d been working on for years before you ever arrived.(APPLAUSE)(APPLAUSE)And I went there on my own. Wasn\u2019t an issue really for the state of Vermont to expose the horrendous working conditions and the semi slavery, if you like, that those workers lived under. And the result of that hearing and the work that many, many people did was to significantly improve the wages and working conditions of those workers.(APPLAUSE)RAMOS (through translator): So this is the moment of talking about deportations. We\u2019re going to immigrants.SALINAS (through translator): (inaudible) Facebook page (inaudible). Tell us what you think of the debate in the comment section. We will come back after the break.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)RAMOS (through translator): We\u2019re back to the Democratic debate.Secretary Clinton, the last time we talked in January, in Iowa, I asked you if you could be the next deporting chief. And you told me, no, that you wouldn\u2019t be the next deporter in chief. However, you refused two times to say you would not deport children. This is what you said.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)(END VIDEO CLIP)(APPLAUSE)(APPLAUSE)Secretary Clinton did not support those children coming into this country. I did.Now I happen to agree with President Obama on many, many issues. I think he has done a great job as president of the United States. He is wrong on this issue of deportation. I disagree with him on that.(APPLAUSE)(APPLAUSE)When I was secretary of state, I worked to try to support many different approaches to ending the violence in Central America. I was there meeting with leaders, security leaders, and others. And I think the Congress should support the president\u2019s request to fund programs that would protect people and change the culture of criminality and violence in Central America, helping people be able to stay safely in their homes and countries.(APPLAUSE)And I worked very hard in improving the guest worker provisions so that in 2013 a bill I strongly supported, people who were in the guest worker program in America would not be treated like slaves. (APPLAUSE)They have proven to be right in the succeeding years. I only hope that we can put together a coalition to pass comprehensive immigration reform in the next Congress. And as I said earlier, in 2006, Senator Sanders supported indefinite detention for people facing deportation...So look, I think the goal here is to elect a Democratic Senate, elect a Democratic president and get to work immediately to get comprehensive immigration reform.(APPLAUSE)No, I did not oppose the bailout or the support of the automobile industry. No, I do not support vigilantes, and that is a horrific statement, an unfair statement to make.(APPLAUSE)I will stand (inaudible) of my career, political career fighting for workers, fighting for the poorest people in this country. Madame Secretary, I will match my record against yours any day of the week. (APPLAUSE)A month later, in January, a new piece of legislation was offered that contained the money that would be used for the auto rescue. Then President-elect Obama \u2014 before he\u2019d even been sworn in \u2014 sent word to all of us that he really hoped we would support it. He was still in the Senate, I was still in the Senate.And I voted for it. It was a hard vote. I\u2019ll tell you, it was a hard vote. A lot of the votes you make are hard votes. But the fact is the money that rescued the auto industry was in that bill.(APPLAUSE)(APPLAUSE)And I find it interesting that when Secretary Clinton, who was the former senator of New York, of course, when she defended her vote, she said, well, it\u2019s going to help the big banks in New York. Those are my constituents. And then you go to Detroit and suddenly this legislation helps the automobile workers. There was an article just yesterday...(APPLAUSE)Next question. Secretary Clinton, you recently said instead of building walls we need to tear down barriers. However, last November in New Hampshire, you openly said that as senator you voted numerous times to build the wall with Mexico. What\u2019s the difference between what you did, voting to build the wall, and what Donald Trump wants to do now?Apprehensions coming across the border are the lowest they\u2019ve been in 40 years, which just strengthens my argument that now it\u2019s time to do comprehensive immigration reform. CLINTON: The Republicans, the opponents no longer have an argument. And certainly, we hear a lot coming from the Republican side that is absolutely out of touch with reality. We raised money through the congressional appropriations process. We enhanced the border security. That part of the work is done.Everybody that I know has looked at it said, okay, we have a secure border. There\u2019s no need for this rhetoric and demagoguery that\u2019s still \u2014is carried out on the Republican side. You\u2019ve run out of excuses. Let\u2019s move to comprehensive immigration reform with a path to citizenship. And I think that makes a very strong argument in favor of doing it.(LAUGHTER)Right? A beautiful tall wall. The most beautiful tall wall, better than the Great Wall of China, that would run the entire border. That he would somehow magically get the Mexican government to pay for. And, you know, it\u2019s just fantasy. And in fact, if he cared to know anything about what members of Congress, like the senator and I have done, where it was necessary, we did support some fencing.Where it was necessary, we did add border patrol agents. We have done what by any fair estimate would have to conclude is a good job, quote, \u201csecuring the border\u201d. So let\u2019s get about the business of comprehensive immigration reform.(APPLAUSE)But to answer your question, the essence of what we are trying to do is to unite families, not to divide families.(APPLAUSE)That is beyond comprehension and policies that should not be allowed to exist. So, ma\u2019am, I will do everything that I can to unite your family. Your children deserve to be with their mother.(APPLAUSE)You are doing your very best to support your children. But it is time to bring families together. And I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any doubt that we must do more to let stories like yours be heard more widely so that more Americans know what the human cost of these policies are.And I will do everything I can to prevent other families from facing what you are facing. And I will do everything I can to pass laws that would bring families back together. And I hope that your children are all either citizens born in this country or eligible for the programs that President Obama has put into place, DACA and DAPA, because I will defend those and I will absolutely protect your children, yourself, and try to bring your family back together.(APPLAUSE)Secretary Clinton, they are U.S. citizens (inaudible).(APPLAUSE)Thank you.Now let\u2019s go back to Karen.Secretary Clinton, a Washington Post poll just yesterday found that only 37 percent of Americans consider you honest and trustworthy. Now, when you\u2019ve been asked about this in the past, you have said that this is the result of many, many years of Republican attacks upon you. But Americans have also had 25 \u2014 more than that \u2014 years to get to know you for themselves.Is there anything in your own actions and the decisions that you yourself have made that would foster this kind of mistrust?And I also have, you know, very much committed to the best of my ability my energies and efforts to helping people. That\u2019s something that I care deeply about. And I will continue to do that, to demonstrate by my past actions and my present levels of commitment and plans that people can count on me.That is certainly what happened to me in New York, where people got to know me. They saw me in action. And they did.Look, I have said before and it won\u2019t surprise anybody to hear me say it, this is not easy for me. It\u2019s not easy to do what I think is right, to help people, to even the odds, to hear a story like the woman\u2019s story we just heard. And to know that I can make a difference and I want to in every way possible.I am not a natural politician, in case you haven\u2019t noticed, like my husband or President Obama. So I have a view that I just have to do the best I can, get the results I can, make a difference in people\u2019s lives, and hope that people see that I\u2019m fighting for them and that I can improve conditions economically and other ways that will benefit them and their families.(APPLAUSE)Senator Sanders, you have demanded that Secretary Clinton release the transcripts of her paid Wall Street speeches. Why is this important? Do you have reason to believe that she says one thing in private and another in public?SANDERS: Well, what I have said is that when you get I believe it is $225,000 for giving a speech, and she gave several speeches to Goldman Sachs, one of the Wall Street financial institutions whose greed and illegal behavior helped destroy our economy a number of years ago, when you get paid $225,000, that means that that speech must have been an extraordinarily wonderful speech.(APPLAUSE)(LAUGHTER)(APPLAUSE)(CROSSTALK)(APPLAUSE)Now, the secretary says it doesn\u2019t influence her. Well, that\u2019s what every politician says who gets money from special interests.(APPLAUSE)(APPLAUSE)I went to the Orlando area during the \u201908 campaign to make the same case, visiting with families who had been defrauded by mortgages, these subprime mortgages that put them and their homes at risk.(APPLAUSE)(APPLAUSE)(APPLAUSE)(BOOING)(CROSSTALK)(LAUGHTER)(APPLAUSE)(APPLAUSE)But they did just put up a little video praising you for being the only Democrat who stood with the Republicans to try to eliminate the Export/Import Bank, which has helped hundreds and hundreds of companies here in Florida be able to export their goods and employ more Floridians. So from my perspective, you sided with the Koch brothers.(APPLAUSE)(APPLAUSE)(BOOING)(BOOING)(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)(END VIDEO CLIP)I and everybody in the administration, all the people she named, the president, the vice president, Susan Rice, we were scrambling to get information that was changing, literally by the hour. And when we had information, we made it public. But then sometimes we had to go back and say we have new information that contradicts it.So I testified for 11 hours.(APPLAUSE)And this is not the first time we lost Americans in a terrorist attack. We lost 3,000 people on 9/11. We lost Americans serving in embassies in Tanzania and Kenya when my husband was president. We lost 250 Americans, both military and civilian, when Ronald Reagan was president in Beirut.And at no other time were those tragedies were they politicized(APPLAUSE).(APPLAUSE)We have captured one of the lead terrorists and he admits it was both a terrorist attack and it was influenced by the video. This was fog of war. This was complicated. The most effective, comprehensive reports and studies demonstrate that.Look, as I said in the beginning, I deeply regret that we lost four Americans.And I wish that there could be an easy answer at the time, but we learned a lot, and the intelligence kept...Gadhafi was a brutal dictator, there\u2019s no question. But one of the differences between the secretary and I is I\u2019m not quite so aggressive with regard to regime change. I voted against the war in Iraq because I had a fear of what would happen the day after.(APPLAUSE)And Secretary Clinton talks about Henry Kissinger...(APPLAUSE)We\u2019re taking a break. (through translator) We\u2019ll continue with topics that are of interest to Spanish (inaudible) education, what to do with student debt. Two topics that we will deal in a moment in the Democratic debate.RAMOS (through translator): We remind you that you can download (inaudible) and we\u2019ll come back with the Democratic presidential debate.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)(UNKNOWN) (through translator): And we continue now, connected with Univision for you to send us (inaudible) first Democratic debate focusing in Hispanic topics. I have (inaudible) that supported (inaudible).Good evening, good evening.We heard a lot about immigration, about the deportations and race. In your opinion, who (inaudible) better and who presented the immigration proposal?The six months \u2014 that we have seen as immigration is concerned, and we see that they\u2019re moving towards. The community needs to not only immigration reform, but the raids have to stop. Families that we have seen that are suffering, they have to be reunited.(UNKNOWN) (through translator): We heard very emotional testimony of a mother that was brave enough to come here with her five children. How did you feel when you heard her story? And do you think that the candidates had empathy with the story?And this is what we see that is happening, that Republicans are doing not \u2014 by not approving a migratory reform, but also President Obama. So we need \u2014 we need not only words, but plans as well. And we need as a community to both stand up and support women as her.(UNKNOWN) (through translator): Thank you, Gabby (ph), and now the debate \u2014 the Democratic debate continues with Jorge Ramos and Maria Elena Salinas. Thank you.We\u2019ll continue with the debate now.Senator Sanders, you call your opponent Hillary Clinton an establishment politician. You yourself are a career politician. Why should voters prefer a career politicians over an establishment politician?I don\u2019t take money from the pharmaceutical industry because I believe they are ripping off the American people and charging us the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs.(APPLAUSE)I don\u2019t take money from the fossil fuel industry because they are destroying \u2014 they are destroying this planet through their emissions of carbon and creating the terrible climate change that we are seeing.So I think it is true that I have served in Congress for many years. But if you check my record, it is a record of strength for the environment, for workers, for seniors. Unlike the secretary, I believe we should expand Social Security benefits. It is a record of achievement for veterans, working with Republicans, helping to craft the most significant veterans healthcare bill passed in many decades.So I think the point is look at the record, and it\u2019s a record that I am proud of.(APPLAUSE)So, last week you tweeted that for the GOP, the economy is an after thought. Well, many Latinos feel that they are an after thought. Do you understand what the specific needs of Latinos are to improve their living conditions?And there are several things that need to be addressed. We do have to do more infrastructure spending. That will put many Americans to work. It\u2019s a good job that gets you on the ladder to the middle class. We need to improve the conditions for manufacturing in our country and punish those companies that want to export jobs. We need them to be incentivized to create jobs right here in America.We also do have to combat climate change, and no state has more at stake in that than Florida. And the best way to do that is not only enforcing the laws we have, but also the clean power plan that President Obama has put forth that I support, and the Paris agreement that I think was a huge step forward in the world, that Senator Sanders said was too weak, but I helped to lay the groundwork for that.CLINTON: But we need more clean energy jobs and we have to do more to help small businesses. You know, the fastest-growing segment of small businesses are minority and women-owned small business, and we need to help businesses get started.The very distinguished congresswoman from New York who\u2019s been on the Small Business Committee, Congresswoman Velasquez, knows exactly what we need to be doing to create more small businesses. We do need to raise the minimum wage and we have to guarantee equal pay for women.(APPLAUSE)Every child deserves a good teacher in a good school, regardless of the zip code that they live in. Following behind that is health care and how important it is to continue to build on the Affordable Care Act and provide access to health care. And then there are a number of other issues \u2014 comprehensive immigration reform certainly at the top.(LAUGHTER)One of the points that I\u2019ve been making, and media does not seem to pick up on it, is that we have a real crisis not only with real unemployment in America being close to 10 percent, but youth unemployment in this country.If you look at Latino kids between 17 and 20 who graduated high school, 36 percent of them are unemployed or underemployed...(APPLAUSE)We have got to raise the minimum wage to $15 an hour. The United States has got to join the rest of the industrialized world in guaranteeing health care to all people as a right.(APPLAUSE)We need to rebuild our crumbling infrastructure. And when we do that, under my plan, we create 13 million decent-paying jobs.(APPLAUSE)(APPLAUSE)We have got to go beyond first grade to 12th grade when we talk about public education.(APPLAUSE)So I do believe we should make public colleges and universities tuition-free, and I don\u2019t believe we should punish millions of young and not-so-young people with outrageous levels of student debt.The point is we are going to get to Donald Trump by raising the taxes on the top 1 percent and our millionaires and billionaires. But all of our people, in my view, regardless of income, should have a right to get a higher education. I want children in the third grade to know that if they study hard, no matter what the income of their families, my family didn\u2019t have any income, my parents didn\u2019t go to college, they didn\u2019t have good income. I want every kid to know if you do your school work, study hard, yes, you will be able to get a college education. (APPLAUSE)(APPLAUSE)And you can refinance your house to get a lower interest rate. You can refinance your car. Corporations can refinance their debt. Under my plan, you will be able to also lower your debt, move into a program to pay it back as a percentage of your income and more than that, my plan for debt-free tuition at public colleges and universities will eventually eliminate any student debt.But for people who have it, I\u2019m going to put a date certain that after a certain number of years, you no longer have to pay anything. The government has to quit making money off of lending money to young people to get their education.(APPLAUSE)(APPLAUSE)You know how I\u2019m going to pay for it? I\u2019m going to pay for it by imposing a tax on Wall Street speculation.(APPLAUSE)So, the Treasury was out nothing. Now that will no longer happen because we have Dodd-Frank and we will break up banks that pose a systemic threat to our economy.(APPLAUSE)And a lot of the answers say that this is going to be much more expensive than anything Senator Sanders is admitting to. This is going to increase the federal government dramatically. And, you know, my dad used to say, if it sounds too good to be true, it probably is.(APPLAUSE)(APPLAUSE)You may not think the American people are prepared to stand up to the insurance companies or the drug companies. I think they are. And I think we can pass...(APPLAUSE)But I just respectfully disagree. Between the Republicans trying to repeal the first chance we\u2019ve ever had to get to universal health care, and Senator Sanders wanting to throw us into a contentious debate over single-payer, I think the smart approach is build on and protect the Affordable Care Act. Make it work. Reduce the cost.(APPLAUSE)Many of you may have insurance, but you have outrageously high deductibles and co-payments. One out of five Americans cannot afford the prescription drugs their doctors prescribe. Elderly people are cutting their pills in half.I do believe that we should do what every other major country on earth does, and I think when the American people stand up and fight back, yes, we can have it, a Medicare for all health care system.(APPLAUSE)(APPLAUSE)Senator Sanders, is it possible to move forward on this issue if you do not get a bipartisan consensus, and what would you do?(APPLAUSE)(APPLAUSE)(APPLAUSE)You can see already what\u2019s happening in Miami, particularly in Miami Beach with tides rising. So we do have to invest in resilience and mitigation while we are trying to cut emissions and make up for the fact that this is clearly man-made and man-aggravated. CLINTON: And there are certain things that the president has done through executive action that I will absolutely support. All the Republican say they will, if they\u2019re elected, heaven forbid, repeal all of those executive actions. I will maintain them and act on them.The clean power plan is something that Senator Sanders has said he would delay implementing, which makes absolutely no sense. We need to implement all of the president\u2019s executive actions and quickly move to make a bridge from coal to natural gas to clean energy.That is the way we will keep the lights on while we are transitioning to a clean energy future. And when I talk about resilience, I think that is an area we can get Republican support on.(CROSSTALK)(CROSSTALK)(APPLAUSE)(CROSSTALK)(APPLAUSE)Let\u2019s be clear. You\u2019re looking at the senator who introduced the most comprehensive climate change legislation in the history of the United States Senate.(APPLAUSE)Now, I hope that Secretary Clinton would join me if we are serious about climate change, about imposing a tax on carbon on the fossil fuel industry and making massive investments in energy efficiency and sustainable energy. And by the way, while we are on the subject of energy, I hope you\u2019ll join me in ending fracking in the United States of America.(APPLAUSE)(CROSSTALK)Three of the last four Treasury secretaries appointed by Democratic presidents had ties to Citigroup. Do you agree with Elizabeth Warren\u2019s criticism that both your husband\u2019s administration and President Obama\u2019s have relied too heavily on advisers who represent the world view of the big banks?But I think it\u2019s important also to look at what we want to accomplish. You know, in the debates we\u2019ve had \u2014 maybe this is the seventh or so \u2014 Senator Sanders is always criticizing the two recent Democratic presidents \u2014 President Clinton and President Obama. And that\u2019s fine, but I wish he would criticize and join me in criticizing George W. Bush, who I think wrecked the economy and created the conditions for the great recession. You know, at the end of the \u201990s, we had 23 million new jobs. Incomes went up for everybody. We were talking earlier about what needs to be done for Latinos and African Americans. Well, we were doing it by the end of the \u201990s. Median family income went up 17 percent. For minorities, it went up even more.Along came the Republicans, trickle-down economics \u2014 one of the worst ideas since snake oil \u2014 was put back into place. And we ended up with the great recession. President Obama had to rescue the economy. And I don\u2019t think he gets the credit he deserves for doing that.(APPLAUSE)(LAUGHTER)Or followed my work in the Congress as very few people stood up to George W. Bush whether it was the war in Iraq or any other of his policies.(LAUGHTER)Now, when we talk about the policies of the 1990s, I worked closely and supported President Clinton. And obviously, I have worked very closely in supporting President Obama, who has taken our economy a very long way from where Bush left us.SANDERS: But when you go back to the 1990s, let\u2019s remember, that\u2019s when Wall Street deregulation took place.(APPLAUSE)(COMMERCIAL BREAK)(UNKNOWN) (through translator): We continue with the Democratic debate.Secretary Clinton and Senator Sanders, it will be my welcome to Miami question. So it goes as follows. President Barack Obama is going to Cuba in two weeks. Forty percent of Cuban Americans supporting to uphold \u2014 oppose a new White House policy towards Cuba.If you were president, would you meet with the dissidents in Cuba? Would you meet with Fidel Castro? And would you consider Raul Castro a president or a dictator? Welcome to Miami.So the more that we can have that kind of movement back and forth, the more likely we are to be able to move Cuba toward greater freedom, greater respect for rights.You know, I\u2019m looking forward to following the president\u2019s trip. I do think meeting with dissidents, meeting with people who have been voices, tribunes of freedom and opportunity is important.The Cuban people deserve to have their human rights respected and upheld, they deserve to be able to move towards democracy where they pick their own leads. And I think both Castros have to be considered authoritarian and dictatorial because they are not freely chosen by the people that are in Cuba.(APPLAUSE)I hope someday there will be leaders who are chosen by the Cuban people, and I hope that democracy will be deeply rooted in Cuban soil and that the people of Cuba will have every opportunity to fulfill their own dreams in their own country. That is my hope.(APPLAUSE)I believe that we should move towards full and normalized political relations with Cuba. I think at the end of the day, it will be a good thing for the Cuban people. It will enable them, I think when they see people coming into their country from the United States, move in a more democratic direction, which is what I want to see. So right \u2014 I\u2019m sorry.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)(END VIDEOTAPE)Throughout the history of our relationship with Latin America we\u2019ve operated under the so-called Monroe Doctrine, and that said the United States had the right do anything that they wanted to do in Latin America. So I actually went to Nicaragua and I very shortly opposed the Reagan administration\u2019s efforts to overthrow that government. And I strongly opposed earlier Henry Kissinger and the \u2014 to overthrow the government of Salvador Aliende (ph) in Chile.I think the United States should be working with governments around the world, not get involved in regime change. And all of these actions, by the way, in Latin America, brought forth a lot of very strong anti-American sentiments. That\u2019s what that was about.(APPLAUSE)...on the other hands, it would be wrong not to state that in Cuba they have made some good advances in health care. They are sending doctors all over the world. They have made some progress in education. I think by restoring full diplomatic relations with Cuba, it will result in significant improvements to the lives of Cubans and it will help the United States and our business community invest.(APPLAUSE)And what we see in Puerto Rico now is a lot of suffering. We see schools being closed, we see health care being denied and we see a thousand Puerto Rican families a month moving to the United States, mostly to Florida.Puerto Ricans are citizen of America.(APPLAUSE)I just couldn\u2019t disagree more. You know, if the values are that you oppress people, you disappear people, you imprison people or even kill people for expressing their opinions, for expressing freedom of speech, that is not the kind of revolution of values that I ever want to see anywhere.(APPLAUSE)And many of the bonds that they are paying off were purchased by vulture capitalists for 30 cents on the dollar. And what I have said in talking to the leaders of Puerto Rico, we\u2019ve got to bring people together. And it\u2019s not the people of Puerto Rico, or the children or the schools.Secretary Clinton, there is a vacancy on the supreme court at a very crucial moment. Among other things, the court is considering the most significant abortion restrictions in a generation.So I would like to share with you a question that we got from Facebook from Joshua Dansby, a law student in Washington, D.C. who wants to know what specific forms of qualifications you would look for in a Supreme Court justice?(APPLAUSE)(APPLAUSE)(APPLAUSE)And understand the balance of power that their decisions can disrupt one way or the other. So clearly, I would look for people who believe that Roe v. Wade is settled law and that Citizens United needs to be overturned as quickly as possible. (APPLAUSE)(CROSSTALK)SALINAS (through translator): We go to a commercial. And when we come back, conclusions (inaudible).RAMOS (through translator): (inaudible) which has heads of space and it\u2019s the candidates to the presidents (inaudible) that are the (inaudible).(COMMERCIAL BREAK)SALINAS (through translator): We come back with the Democratic debate, sponsored by Univision, Washington Post and Facebook. We are reaching the end, asking the candidates to give their last words.Secretary Clinton, you\u2019re first.So I am going to take on those economic barriers. I have a plan to create jobs and raise incomes. I\u2019m going to take on the education barriers that often leave too many children behind even after they have completed schooling. I\u2019m going to take on the healthcare barriers.I\u2019m going to do everything I can to make sure that we unite our country. I will find common ground, just as I have as first lady, as senator and secretary of state. I will also stand my ground wherever matters of principles are at stake.CLINTON: I would be honored to have your support in the upcoming primary on Tuesday, and hope to have the great honor of serving you as your president.(APPLAUSE)Is it acceptable that Wall Street and billionaires are spending hundreds of millions of dollars trying to buy elections? Is that democracy or this that oligarchy? Which is why I believe we\u2019ve got to overturn Citizens United and move to public funding of elections.Is it right that in the greatest, wealthiest country in the history of the world, so many of our young people can\u2019t even afford to go to college or leave school deeply in debt, in the wealthiest country in the history of the world? If we stand up, fight back, we can do a lot better. That\u2019s why I\u2019m running for president.(APPLAUSE)(APPLAUSE)RAMOS (through translator): We want to use these last moments, it\u2019s very important to go out and vote, remember next Tuesday, March 15th is elections in Florida, Illinois, Missouri, North Carolina, Ohio, all these states \u2014 in all these states the Hispanic vote is crucial (INAUDIBLE). Talk about the importance of Hispanic votes, how in very close races it is the Hispanic vote that can choose the next president of the United States. This is Hispanic power, but the only way that this can happen is if we all go out and vote.So you know it perfectly, who does not vote doesn\u2019t count.SALINAS (through translator): And as you know, nobody can reach the White House without the Hispanic vote. Remember, don\u2019t let others decide for you. The power is in your hands, you have to participate, you have to vote. Thank you for being with us this evening and thank you for trusting in Univision. Good evening.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "In Yahoo, Another Example of the Buyback Mirage", "Date": "2016-03-25", "News": "Supported byFair GameIt is one of the great investment conundrums of our time: Why do so many stockholders cheer when a company announces that it\u2019s buying back shares?Stated simply, repurchase programs can be hazardous to a company\u2019s long-term financial health and often signal a management that has run out of better ways to invest in the business.And yet investors love them.Not all stock repurchases are bad, of course. But given the enormous popularity of buybacks nowadays, those that are harmful probably outnumber the beneficial.Those who run companies like buybacks because they make their earnings look better on a per-share basis. When fewer shares are outstanding, each one technically earns more.But a company\u2019s overall profit growth is unaffected by share buybacks. And comparing increases in earnings per share with real profit growth reveals the impact that buybacks have on that particular measure. Call it the buyback mirage.But a good bit of that performance was the buyback mirage. Growth in Yahoo\u2019s overall net profits came in at about 11 percent annually.Given these figures, Mr. Colby reckoned that Yahoo, if it had invested that same amount of money in its operations, would have had to generate only a 3.2 percent after-tax return to produce overall net profit growth of 16 percent annually over those years.Some companies argue that the money they spend repurchasing stock is a shrewd use of their capital. And given Yahoo\u2019s track record in recent years, its management team seems to have had a hard time identifying profitable investments.But Mr. Colby pointed out that buybacks provide only a one-time benefit, while smart investments in a company\u2019s operations can generate years of gains.Yahoo declined to comment on its buybacks.This analysis may be of interest to Starboard Value, an activist investor that is a large and unhappy Yahoo shareholder. On Thursday, Starboard nominated nine directors to replace the company\u2019s entire board, saying its current members lack \u201cthe leadership, objectivity and perspective needed to make decisions that are in the best interests of shareholders.\u201dIn a statement, Yahoo said, \u201cThe board\u2019s nominating and governance committee will review Starboard\u2019s proposed director nominees and respond in due course.\u201dHe found that McDonald\u2019s was another problematic example. Since 2008, McDonald\u2019s has allocated almost $18 billion to buybacks. This has helped produce 4.4 percent increases in annual earnings per share over the period. To equal that growth in overall earnings, the company would have had to generate just a 2.3 percent return on the money it spent buying back stock, Mr. Colby estimated.Becca Hary, a McDonald\u2019s spokeswoman, said the company had a \u201cbalanced and disciplined capital-allocation strategy that promotes long-term value for our shareholders.\u201d She cited McDonald\u2019s plans to invest $2 billion to open a thousand new restaurants and \u201cto reimage 400 to 500 locations\u201d domestically.In an interview, Mr. Colby said his research \u201cconfirms my suspicion that while buybacks are not universally bad, they are being practiced far more broadly and without as much analysis as there should be.\u201dPerhaps the crucial flaw in buybacks is that they reward sellers of a company\u2019s stock over its long-term holders. That\u2019s because a company announcing a repurchase program usually sees its stock price pop in the short term. But passive investors, such as index funds, and other long-term holders gain little from the programs.Especially problematic are buybacks financed with borrowed money; repurchases of stock made at prices above its intrinsic value are also unwise.Another hazard: companies that spend billions to repurchase stock without substantially shrinking the number of shares outstanding. That\u2019s because in these circumstances, prized corporate cash is used to buy back shares that offset stock grants bestowed on company executives in rich compensation plans.And there are plenty of companies whose buybacks have simply left them with less money to invest in more promising opportunities.The proposals ask the companies to adopt a policy of excluding the effect of stock buybacks from any performance metrics they use to determine executive pay packages.\u201cWe\u2019re not against buybacks,\u201d said Adam M. Kanzer, a managing director at Domini. \u201cThe question is at what point do buybacks become excessive and when do they undermine the long-term value of the company?\u201dAt 3M, for example, research and development expenditures plus strategic acquisitions have totaled $22 billion over the last five years, Mr. Kanzer said. In the meantime, the company\u2019s buyback program has cost $21 billion.\u201cWhen the buyback almost equals all the other expenditures, it makes sense to ask questions about whether there\u2019s a more constructive way to invest that capital,\u201d Mr. Kanzer said.Asked about these questions, Lori Anderson, a 3M spokeswoman, referred me to the company\u2019s proxy filing, which stated, \u201cWe believe these concerns are unfounded, as demonstrated by our long-term track record and our balanced capital-allocation approach.\u201d\u201cYou really have to ask why a company\u2019s board decides to return a big chunk of capital instead of replacing managers with ones who can figure out how to develop the operations,\u201d said Gary Lutin, who oversees the Shareholder Forum.\u201cIf the board doesn\u2019t think it\u2019s worth investing in the company\u2019s future,\u201d Mr. Lutin added, \u201chow can a shareholder justify continuing to hold the stock, or voting for directors who\u2019ve given up?\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Breathing Life Into Spaces Well Beyond 6 Feet Under Beijing\u2019s Streets", "Date": "2016-03-21", "News": "Supported byBeijing JournalBEIJING \u2014 The Digua Shequ community center in Beijing is painted in cheery pastel tones and festooned with colorful paper dragons hung from the ceiling. Inside are a hair salon, a cafe and a gym \u2014 normal shops for a typical neighborhood \u2014 except that they are underground.All of the storefronts are two floors below the street, built inside a former bomb shelter designed to withstand a nuclear war.Digua Shequ, a start-up that turns unused basements into community centers and whose name is Chinese for Sweet Potato Community, has been renovating the shelter in northeast Beijing for the past year. It wants to reimagine the future of the city\u2019s underground spaces, once largely ignored but now contested by an unlikely combination of government, commercial and artistic interests.The center\u2019s founder, Zhou Zishu, a former designer at the National Museum of China, said he was inspired by the debate over what to do with Beijing\u2019s bomb shelters, which currently house well over 100,000 people.\u201cOur work is not just about renovating basement spaces and making them look better,\u201d Mr. Zhou said. \u201cIt\u2019s actually about improving the lives of residents and creating a new sense of community. We want to take these private spaces and make them public again.\u201dBut not everyone agrees with Digua Shequ\u2019s vision. The uncertain fate of the shelters, as well as the rules for their use, has drawn attention from several competing stakeholders.Beijing\u2019s more than 10,000 concrete bunkers, built over 40 years ago, were a crucial part of Mao\u2019s Cold War defense strategy. Some of the bunkers, which were handed over to neighborhood authorities in the 1980s, when the country\u2019s economy was liberalized, were turned into shops or offices. Most were converted into living spaces and rented out to migrant workers or residents trying to duck Beijing\u2019s soaring real estate prices.One pressing question facing the city is what to do with the people who still live in the bunkers. Estimates of their numbers range from 150,000 to a million. Nearly every apartment building in the Digua Shequ center\u2019s neighborhood has a former shelter or a basement. Most of the residential units in them are rented out for 500 to 900 renminbi a month, or roughly $77 to $138 \u2014 about one-third of what it would cost to live aboveground.\u201cWorkers\u2019 wages aren\u2019t rising as fast as the cost of living,\u201d said Xu Tong, who both rents out and lives in an underground space in eastern Beijing. \u201cIf you get rid of these basement units, where will the migrants live?\u201dGovernment data shows that migrant workers\u2019 wages increased about 14 percent in 2014 from a year earlier, compared with a nearly 22 percent increase in their cost of living. Mr. Xu\u2019s lease illustrates the uncertainty about how serious the government\u2019s ban on underground dwellings is: Although the new rule takes effect in 2017, his contract does not expire until 2019.Migrant workers\u2019 use of the former bomb shelters remains a delicate topic. After The New York Times submitted an interview request to the neighborhood committee, Mr. Zhou said, an official there who supports the project called him and recommended that he not mention the \u201cfloating population\u201d or \u201cnorthern drifters\u201d \u2014 two euphemisms for migrant workers.So far, Digua Shequ\u2019s work remains an exceptional case for having legally repurposed the spaces under the new rules. Currently, the Civil Air Defense Department of Beijing grants one-year leases on former bomb shelters to individuals and companies.The order to end residential use means that some stand to lose a source of revenue, as few local officials and landlords are willing to spend to transform the units into commercial spaces. As a result, many shelters and basements occupied before the ban was announced are still being quietly rented out as housing.\u201cIt\u2019s like a wave,\u201d said Wang Jinhui, who runs a hotel in a former bomb shelter near the Digua Shequ center. \u201cYou just put your head down and wait for it to pass.\u201dHe has rented out the space since 1998 and is optimistic that the political will to enforce the new regulations will dissipate.\u201cThey\u2019ve said they\u2019d clean out these underground spaces for years and not succeeded,\u201d Mr. Wang said. \u201cIt just might be that places like mine will survive.\u201dSubletting underground spaces can be lucrative. A lease for an entire basement or shelter typically costs about 150,000 renminbi a year, but subdividing the space can generate far more income. The shelter that Digua Shequ took over once housed more than 100 residents who together paid nearly 600,000 renminbi a year, Mr. Zhou said.\u201cA lot of landlords have spent money renovating the spaces they lease, so they don\u2019t want to stop renting out basements,\u201d said Guo Chengbao, a security guard who was once a basement landlord. He lives in an underground unit above the Digua Shequ center.Private investors have also been eyeing underground spaces. Renovating the basement that now houses the Digua Shequ center cost nearly 3 million renminbi, most of which was covered by Feng Lun, the founder of Vantone Holdings and its real estate subsidiary, Vantone Real Estate.\u201cWe\u2019ve constructed a lot of buildings,\u201d he said, \u201cbut there\u2019s no one today who is operating underground spaces like this. If other real estate developers came and saw your space, they might invite you to develop their underground spaces during construction.\u201dMr. Feng did not respond to a request for an interview.Mr. Zhou\u2019s project was noticed by a sympathetic official and partly financed by the local and municipal governments as a promising model for Beijing\u2019s other bomb shelters and basements. With the support of the neighborhood committee, Digua Shequ got a lease and is negotiating to turn another shelter in the Haidian district into a second community center.\u201cNo one had a very nuanced understanding of these places,\u201d Mr. Zhou said. \u201cEveryone thought only poor people lived in them and that they were dark and dirty.\u201dMr. Zhou tried several different models before arriving at his plan for the community center. At first, he ran a training program for young workers, but attendance was too inconsistent. He considered turning basements into libraries but then observed that residents used similar areas as restrooms rather than as places for borrowing books. After studying theories about the sharing economy, Mr. Zhou hit on the idea of transforming basements into community centers.The entrance to the Digua Shequ center is like that of any other bomb shelter: rusting metal gates at street level that open onto a ramp down into the chilly, subterranean darkness. The ramp ends at a bright orange steel door set into mottled concrete, behind which lies the center\u2019s warmly lit interior.Renovations began on the shelter in 2015, after three years of surveying residents about what they wanted in a community center. When the new space opens on Friday, it will feature a 3-D printing station, co-working spaces and a movie theater.Mr. Zhou said that underground dwellings might never be eliminated entirely because of the different interests at play, but that he hoped the Digua Shequ model would be replicated in other neighborhoods. He said he saw it as a chance to transcend differences in social class and origin.Mr. Guo, the security guard, likes what it has done so far. After work, he sometimes eats dinner in the community space.\u201cI\u2019ve lived in Beijing for 14 years. Before, I didn\u2019t know any of the people who lived upstairs,\u201d he said, laughing. \u201cNow, we\u2019re all familiar with each other.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Does a Carbon Tax Work? Ask British Columbia", "Date": "2016-03-01", "News": "Supported byEconomic SceneBut those views are not widely shared by conservatives elsewhere around the world. Indeed, not that long ago in a not too distant country, a right-leaning party that shares many of the antitax, pro-business beliefs of Republicans in the United States did exactly what its unbelieving candidates so fear.In 2008, the British Columbia Liberal Party, which confoundingly leans right, introduced a tax on the carbon emissions of businesses and families, cars and trucks, factories and homes across the province. The party stuck to the tax even as the left-leaning New Democratic Party challenged it in provincial elections the next year under the slogan Axe the Tax. The conservatives won soundly at the polls.Their experience shows that cutting carbon emissions enough to make a difference in preventing global warming remains a difficult challenge. But the most important takeaway for American skeptics is that the policy basically worked as advertised.British Columbia\u2019s economy did not collapse. In fact, the provincial economy grew faster than its neighbors\u2019 even as its greenhouse gas emissions declined.\u201cIt performed better on all fronts than I think any of us expected,\u201d said Mary Polak, the province\u2019s environment minister. \u201cTo the extent that the people who modeled it predicted this, I\u2019m not sure that those of us on the policy end of it really believed it.\u201dThe tax made fuel more expensive: A gallon of gas, for example, costs 19 United States cents more. It encouraged people to drive somewhat less and be more careful about heating and cooling their homes. Businesses invested in energy efficiency measures and switched to less polluting fuels.\u201cWe were not very happy when it was first announced,\u201d said Jock A. Finlayson, head of policy at the Business Council of British Columbia. Now, \u201cwithin the business community there is a sizable constituency saying this is O.K.\u201dChristopher Knittel, an expert on energy economics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, said a properly calibrated carbon price in the United States could effectively replace all the climate-related regulations businesses hate so much, including renewable fuel mandates and President Obama\u2019s Clean Power Plan.That would create a clear incentive for businesses and consumers to use less fuel, invest in efficiency and switch to cleaner energy. The only other necessary action, in Professor Knittel\u2019s view, would be more government support for research and development to accelerate the quest for new energy technologies.Here in British Columbia, however, it wasn\u2019t the efficiency argument alone that won people over. The pioneering legislation provided critical political cover by ensuring every single carbon tax dollar would be returned to families and businesses through a variety of breaks.That \u201cis the thing that saved us,\u201d said Carole Taylor, the provincial minister of finance at the time the tax was introduced. \u201cIf I had said, \u2018Give us the carbon tax and trust us,\u2019 I knew it would have been a failure.\u201dThe corporate income tax was cut to 10 percent from 12 percent, to stimulate a flagging economy in 2010. Though it is back to 11 percent, it is still the lowest among Canada\u2019s provinces. The bottom two personal income tax rates were also cut. Low-income families got a tax credit.All in all, the government will return about 1.7 billion Canadian dollars to businesses and families this year, more than the 1.2 billion dollars it expects to collect though the carbon tax, which amounts to roughly 5 percent of the province\u2019s total tax revenue.With few exceptions, British Columbia\u2019s tax is the steepest and broadest in existence. While that sets British Columbia apart as a leader on the cutting edge, it is also part of its problem. For the policy to work best, it needs the rest of the world to catch up.Nobody in British Columbia is talking about going that far. But to hit its long-term target, the advisory panel concluded that the tax must start increasing again in 2018, at a rate of 10 Canadian dollars a ton a year, perhaps all the way to midcentury.And that\u2019s where the support from business starts to break down. If British Columbia were to proceed on its own without providing some form of protection to its energy intensive industries, Mr. Finlayson argued, they would simply lose markets to producers outside its borders that pay no carbon tax.The advisory panel recommends unspecified adjustments to protect such trade-exposed industries. Still, the Business Council of British Columbia opposed an increase.British Columbia could do with some help from its neighbors. Four other provinces have carbon prices either pending or in place, though they are generally much lower. If more embraced a carbon tax, they would mitigate many of the concerns over competitiveness.The new Canadian government, headed by Justin Trudeau, seems ready to come on board, imposing some pan-Canadian minimum price. If the United States embraced a carbon tax as part of a comprehensive overhaul of its tax system, the path would be much easier.That, however, would require Republicans in Washington to recognize that the threat of climate change is not simply a left-wing fantasy. If they do, British Columbia underscores there is a market friendly way to do something about it.An earlier version of this article gave an incorrect attribution for a study of Canada\u2019s carbon tax. It was by economists at Duke University and the University of Ottawa, not the University of Ontario.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Columbia Professor Files Sexual Harassment Suit Against University", "Date": "2016-03-23", "News": "Supported byBut then, she said, the comments started. The professor told her about watching pornography and his sexual exploits, she said. He started making advances toward her, calling her \u201csexy.\u201d And, she said, he had the ability to have that crucial data set taken away.In a lawsuit against the university filed on Tuesday in Federal District Court, Ms. Ravina said she complained repeatedly to Columbia officials about the situation, but that they only dismissed and belittled her. The suit claims Ms. Ravina was subjected to gender discrimination and sexual harassment, and asks for more than $20 million in damages. She also wants more time to apply for tenure.\u201cI never really wanted to be in this position, but this was the only thing I could do,\u201d Ms. Ravina, 40, an assistant professor of finance and economics at the business school since 2008, said in an interview on Tuesday. \u201cI felt really betrayed. I thought the university should have solved this.\u201dBeginning in May 2014, Ms. Ravina brought her complaints to senior faculty members and administrators at the business school, the lawsuit says. One dean, the lawsuit says, called her circumstances a \u201csoap opera.\u201d Others told her to forget her complaints and to walk away from her research project. In November 2014, the lawsuit says, the office that ensures the university is in compliance with Title IX, which prohibits gender discrimination in educational institutions, found no violation.University officials told Ms. Ravina in June that she would be put on paid academic leave for the 2015-16 academic year, a period during which no action was expected to be taken regarding her tenure, the lawsuit says. By September, it claims, the leave was revoked, and in December she was told her tenure process would begin and \u201crun on an accelerated basis,\u201d the lawsuit says. With less time to prepare, Ms. Ravina feels she has little chance of getting tenure.The university declined to discuss Ms. Ravina\u2019s case because of the pending litigation, but said in a statement on Wednesday that \u201cthe university treats allegations of harassment with the utmost seriousness.\u201dAs part of her research, Ms. Ravina examines data sets to track the personal finance decisions of individual households.In the 2009-10 academic year, the lawsuit says, Geert Bekaert, a professor of finance and economics at Columbia since 2000, told Ms. Ravina that he could help her get access to a large set of data because of a relationship he had with the company that owned it. In the contract with the data\u2019s owner, Ms. Ravina said, the company had the right to revoke access, and Mr. Bekaert could influence it to do so.Ms. Ravina spent more than two years preparing the data for her research. Once she reached the point where taking the data away would have derailed her project, the lawsuit says, the harassment by Mr. Bekaert began.She claims that he retaliated against her when she rebuffed his advances by delaying and impeding her work. At one point, the lawsuit says, he told her that if \u201cshe were \u2018nicer\u2019 to him, he would allow her work to proceed faster.\u201dMs. Ravina has filed a separate lawsuit against the professor.On Wednesday, Mr. Bekaert denied the allegations, and argued that the claims had been investigated by the university and found to be baseless.\u201cI am sickened that a colleague \u2014 I was never Prof. Ravina\u2019s supervisor or superior \u2014 would manufacture false stories, statements and events and attempt to destroy my reputation,\u201d Mr. Bekaert said in an emailed statement.\u201cIn reality,\u201d he added, \u201cthis is a sad example of no good deed goes unpunished: We collaborated for years doing research with a unique data set I had obtained from a company I worked for, and in return she fabricated a series of completely false allegations about me, some today for the first time.\u201dMs. Ravina said the ordeal has been damaging to her professional reputation but also to her well-being. The lawsuit says her \u201cemotional distress is so severe that, for the past two years, she has seen a psychiatrist weekly to cope with her symptoms.\u201d The psychiatrist said she had a \u201cgeneral anxiety disorder.\u201d\u201cI think my story is awful, but my sense is that many women go through this,\u201d Ms. Ravina said. \u201cThe school has failed me, and it might have failed other people as well.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Guatemalan Soccer Scandals Drain Fans\u2019 Interest in Game", "Date": "2016-03-25", "News": "Supported byThe corruption scandal that has rocked FIFA has hit soccer in the Americas especially hard, and perhaps nowhere are the problems as endemic as here. It is hard to find anyone involved in soccer who has been untouched: players, executives, owners and even journalists, 10 of whom were exposed by FIFA investigators as being on the payroll of an indicted former federation president.So when Guatemala played the United States here Friday night \u2014 the teams will meet again Tuesday in Columbus, Ohio \u2014 the objective of maintaining its faint hopes of qualifying for the World Cup had the feel of a first-world problem. Corruption, including three national team players who were barred for match-fixing in 2012, and mismanagement are viewed as so pervasive that even this soccer-loving country has begun to turn away from the game.The Friday night crowd at Estadio Mateo Flores, the 27,000-seat national stadium in the capital, was expected to be about one-third short of capacity. That could be in part a result of the game\u2019s being played on Good Friday in a largely Catholic country, but it also mirrors the trend in Guatemala\u2019s domestic league, where attendance has plummeted. The country\u2019s two most popular jerseys are no longer the red of Municipal and the cream of Comunicaciones, but those of Real Madrid and Barcelona.\u201cWe lost our colors as Guatemalans,\u201d said Carlos Ruiz, the former M.L.S. most valuable player, who is Guatemala\u2019s career scoring leader. \u201cWe lost that because we lost the trust in the federation, we lost the trust in the league. That\u2019s the problem.\u201cThe people don\u2019t follow the soccer in Guatemala because they say, O.K., the federation steals money, the league sucks, the players are not professionals, the pitch on the stadiums are terrible. So you have to fix that.\u201dInitial steps to do so have begun in recent months.As auditors have begun to examine Fedefut\u2019s finances, several top officials \u2014 including the general secretary, his deputy and the finance manager \u2014 have been swept out, vendor contracts have been reopened for bidding, and some payments have been halted while they are being examined. Other reforms are being penciled out, with the objective of giving a voice to a broader constituency, among them male and female players, referees, regional associations and lower divisions. The committee appointed Walter Claveri as the national team coach in January, the first time in nearly a decade that the position has been held by a Guatemalan.\u201cIt\u2019s important to give it some teeth,\u201d Torrebiarte said Thursday of the reform process, in an interview at her home in a gated community. A slender 66-year-old with tightly cropped white hair, Torrebiarte chuckled at the suggestion that, in her, Guatemala had its own Margaret Thatcher.\u201cSports and politics are very complicated in Guatemala,\u201d she said. \u201cStill, you buy votes, promise things to people and gain money \u2014 that\u2019s corruption. I hope we can open the congress to a lot more people so it becomes more transparent, democratic, open. I hope with these reforms and the changes FIFA makes, we can motivate people to get involved.\u201dStill, she acknowledged that if it were not for outsiders stepping in \u2014 either the United States government\u2019s investigators or FIFA \u2014 the old way of doing business was not likely to change.\u201cIf we don\u2019t have support from somebody else who is stronger, we\u2019re not going to be able to do it for now,\u201d Torrebiarte said. \u201cPeople might think, Oh, the U.S. is too involved, but at least somebody did something. It was not a secret what was going on.\u201dThe swift housecleaning in soccer has been the latest challenge to Guatemala\u2019s most powerful institutions. A former president, Otto P\u00e9rez Molina, and a former vice president, Roxana Baldetti, have been in jail since their arrests last year and are awaiting trial on corruption charges that were uncovered by a United Nations-backed investigative unit. And a former army general, Efra\u00edn R\u00edos Montt, is awaiting retrial after his 2013 conviction for genocide during the country\u2019s 36-year civil war was tossed out on procedural grounds.Juan Carlos Zapata, the chief executive of the Guatemalan Development Foundation, said that it was increasingly clear that reducing corruption would be vital for development in a country where 75 percent of people live below the poverty line.\u201cThere might be skepticism, but the country demonstrated last year to the world that things can be different, and that powerful politicians that most people saw as untouchable are now in prison or being investigated.\u201dMore than 40 defendants have been charged by the United States Justice Department in the continuing corruption case focused on international soccer. In all, the charges encompass 24 nationalities, most in North, Central and South America.Soccer officials see a similar awakening in their sport.\u201cPeople are tired, and everything that has happened has given them a voice,\u201d said Mario Monterroso, the Guatemalan general secretary of Uncaf, the soccer confederation of seven Central American countries. \u201cPeople don\u2019t feel like sheep any more. They\u2019re starting to ask questions: Where is the money going? Where is the money coming from?\u201dMonterroso said that mismanagement had been a companion to corruption and that in many federations, the youth levels and the women\u2019s programs had been neglected. Guatemala\u2019s under-20 team, for example, has a regional tournament in July but does not have a coach.Ruiz, 36, said that he planned to retire at the end of the season to run for president of the federation in September in elections mandated by FIFA. He said he would run to give players a voice in the federation, something they have rarely, if ever, had because few ascended through the ranks once their playing days ended.\u201cAs players, we are not fighting just against an opponent we are playing, we are fighting against many things that are happening right now with the federation,\u201d Ruiz said. \u201cThey don\u2019t understand that you have to build something from the ground. Look, our government in the last year gave to the federation $1.5 million. Also, we have sponsors to pay a lot to be part of the national team. If you use that money to send coaches to different countries to prepare and bring them back to teach the kids how to play, and to have friendly games in Europe, in South America, so they aren\u2019t scared to play against those players, you\u2019re going to make a huge change.\u201dThere have been some encouraging signs since Claveri took over the team two months ago, including victories over El Salvador and Honduras. But playing against the United States, which has dominated the region along with Mexico, presents formidable problems. Then there are the others, the ones that are self-inflicted.\u201cAs soccer players, we enjoy playing soccer for a living, it\u2019s what we love to do, and every time we play for the national team, it\u2019s an honor,\u201d said midfielder Marco Pappa, who plays for the Colorado Rapids and is the anchor of the Guatemalan team. \u201cBut it\u2019s hard for the soccer players to continue to be positive because there\u2019s a lot of corruption, a lot of negative energy. Sometimes all the negatives is normal, and you worry about it, it\u2019s a big thing on your shoulders.\u201dPappa, speaking before practice Thursday, motioned toward the gates and noted that the players were not alone in this way. \u201cThe people outside,\u201d he said. \u201cThey don\u2019t really trust anymore.\u201dTorrebiarte said she planned to address the team before Friday\u2019s game. Though Guatemala has not beaten the United States in 21 consecutive games, she wanted the players to believe in themselves.\u201cWhen you don\u2019t have hope, you have nothing,\u201d she said. \u201cI want them to fight. I don\u2019t play soccer, but I know the importance of soccer in this country. This feeling that we can\u2019t do things right has to end.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "John Gutfreund, 86, Dies; Ran Wall Street Investment Firm at Its Apex", "Date": "2016-03-09", "News": "Supported byJohn H. Gutfreund, whose aggressive leadership of Salomon Brothers and extravagant lifestyle personified the meteoric rise and fall of Wall Street moguls in the heady 1980s, died on Wednesday in Manhattan. He was 86.His son J. P. Gutfreund confirmed the death, at New York Presbyterian-Cornell Hospital, saying the cause was pneumonia.As chairman and chief executive of Salomon, the giant investment firm, Mr. Gutfreund (pronounced GOOD-friend) was called \u201cthe king of Wall Street\u201d for having transformed his company into one of the world\u2019s largest securities traders. He was hailed as one of Wall Street\u2019s most brilliant and innovative players.Under his guidance, Salomon became the leading dealer in United States Treasury bonds, the predominant underwriter of corporate securities and a pioneer in turning ordinary home mortgages into tradeable securities.Women\u2019s Wear Daily regularly referred to the voluble Mrs. Gutfreund as \u201cSocial Susie\u201d and to her dour-looking husband as \u201cSolemn John.\u201dAt work, Mr. Gutfreund, a short, stocky balding man, was known for a gruff demeanor, foul language and an ever-lit cigar \u2014 fitting the stereotypical image of securities traders who made their fortunes shouting orders and cursing at one another across the trading floor. His advice to novice traders \u2014 to wake up each morning \u201cready to bite the ass off a bear\u201d \u2014 became a Wall Street dictum.Mr. Gutfreund liked to roam Salomon Brothers\u2019 cavernous trading room firing questions at startled employees on their bond deals, especially those that were souring.Once his 12-hour workday was over, though, Mr. Gutfreund shed the blunt, coarse manner. Wearing large, owlish eyeglasses, he was a smartly tailored dresser who affected a near-British accent as he spoke wistfully of his decision earlier in life to forgo a career as a literature professor.Invited to join numerous blue-blood charities, he opted for a lower-profile appointment to the board of the Montefiore Medical Center in the Bronx, where he occasionally volunteered to prepare meals and wash dishes. He was content to show up regularly at black-tie charity fund-raisers.For Mr. Gutfreund\u2019s 60th birthday, his wife threw a bash at the Mus\u00e9e Carnavalet in Paris and bought two seats on the Concorde so that the cake and its baker could be flown over from New York.But only two years later, Mr. Gutfreund\u2019s business reputation and social standing were in tatters. He seemed powerless to control infighting at Salomon, which led to the departure of talented senior executives. Other Wall Street firms outdistanced Salomon after its profits declined and its costs spun out of control.\u201cNo apologies to anybody,\u201d he told Salomon\u2019s stunned managing directors in announcing his resignation in August 1991. \u201cWhat happened, happened.\u201dJohn Halle Gutfreund was born in Manhattan on Sept. 14, 1929, to Manuel and Mary Gutfreund. His father, originally a butcher, became a meat wholesaler and distributor and was able to move his family to affluent Scarsdale in Westchester County. John attended Lawrenceville, the boarding school in New Jersey, and then Oberlin College in Ohio, where he majored in English. Drafted into the Army, Mr. Gutfreund served in the Korean War.Returning to civilian life, he briefly considered pursuing a scholar\u2019s career in literature but in the end opted for finance and joined Salomon Brothers, recruited by William R. Salomon, a family acquaintance whose father had helped found the firm and who became a managing partner.Mr. Gutfreund started in 1953 as a $45-a-week trainee on the municipal bond desk. In 1958, he married Joyce Low, daughter of a Wall Street financier, and they had three sons. By 1963, Mr. Gutfreund had become Salomon\u2019s youngest nonfamily partner.In those days, Salomon, despite its more than 50-year existence, was little known outside of Wall Street because its clients were in the wholesale trade \u2014 banks, insurance companies and pension funds for whom Salomon acted as a broker, buying and selling stocks and bonds. Investment firms at the time had none of the cachet they would later acquire. In the 1960s, more than half of Salomon\u2019s partners did not have college degrees.But by the time Mr. Gutfreund became managing partner in 1978 on Mr. Salomon\u2019s retirement, investment firms were attracting the brightest university graduates with bountiful salaries.Mr. Gutfreund made more than $35 million and earned $3 million more in annual salary as chief executive of Salomon Brothers, which became the financial subsidiary of the new parent company, Phibro Salomon. At the time, that was a whopping compensation package for a Wall Street executive.By 1985, Mr. Gutfreund was at the top of the financial world. Business Week labeled him the \u201cking of Wall Street.\u201d American consumers, corporations and governments, from municipal to federal, were borrowing enormous quantities of money, causing an explosive growth in bonds. And no Wall Street firm knew more about the valuation, trading and sale of bonds than Salomon.Salomon\u2019s competitive advantage over rivals was demonstrated by its early dominance in mortgage securities. Mortgages had never been considered tradeable securities until Mr. Gutfreund appointed a young Salomon executive, Lewis Ranieri, as head trader of a new mortgage security department \u2014 Wall Street\u2019s first \u2014 in 1978. Under Mr. Ranieri, Salomon began buying home loans and repackaging them as bonds backed with government guarantees.Mr. Gutfreund, who lived in Manhattan, married Susan Kaposta in 1981; both of their first marriages had ended in divorce. She survives him. Besides his son J. P., from his second marriage, he is also survived by three other sons, Nicholas, Owen and Joshua, from his first marriage; and four grandchildren.As Mr. Gutfreund rose on Wall Street, so did his profile in New York society. Susan Gutfreund was an inveterate party-giver, an enthusiastic antiques collector and a lover of high fashion. Friends quoted her as lamenting, \u201cIt\u2019s so expensive being rich.\u201dThe couple\u2019s growing reputation for private extravagance soon fed rumors that Mr. Gutfreund was uncharacteristically failing to rein in spending at Salomon Brothers.For some Wall Street observers, ballooning expense accounts were only a small symptom of a wider problem at Salomon. \u201cAt times it was as if we had no management at all,\u201d Mr. Lewis wrote in \u201cLiar\u2019s Poker.\u201d \u201cNo one put a stop to the infighting; no one gave us a sense of direction.\u201dThe strategy worked, and Mr. Perelman beat a hasty retreat. But Mr. Buffett drove a hard bargain: His investment firm, Berkshire Hathaway, bought $700 million of convertible preferred stock \u2014 equivalent to 9 percent of Salomon\u2019s common shares if Mr. Buffett chose to convert his holdings. And he was given two seats on Salomon\u2019s board. At the time, the deal amounted to buying Salomon stock at a large discount.For the next few years, Mr. Gutfreund seemed to steady Salomon\u2019s keel. Though the firm failed to achieve the growth levels of the first half of the 1980s, it managed to bounce back from the bond and stock market crashes of 1987. But then, in 1991, an unforeseen and badly managed episode involving the purchase of Treasury bonds spelled doom for Mr. Gutfreund and almost sank Salomon.According to government regulations, no single purchaser could bid more than 35 percent of the Treasury bonds up for sale at an auction. The limit was designed to prevent a single company from cornering the market for a Treasury bond. An investment firm was allowed to exceed this percentage, however, if it was acting as a broker for customers.Paul W. Mozer, Salomon\u2019s chief government bond trader, far exceeded the 35 percent limit in a February 1991 auction of Treasury bonds, and compounded the illegality of this action by putting in bids in the name of customers who had never asked to purchase the bonds.Although Mr. Gutfreund and other Salomon executives were told of Mr. Mozer\u2019s transgression, they did not report it to the federal government for four months. When the government was finally informed, Salomon admitted that it had purchased substantially more than the 35 percent limit in several other Treasury auctions.Traders and analysts on Wall Street feared the scandal would discredit the American securities market worldwide and raise the government\u2019s cost of financing its debt.Mr. Gutfreund resigned as chairman and chief executive of Salomon, as did the firm\u2019s president, Thomas W. Strauss, and the vice chairman, John W. Meriwether.With fears rising that the government might shut down Salomon, the firm\u2019s board invited Mr. Buffett, a man with a sterling reputation both in the financial community and among government regulators, to become chairman and chief executive on an interim basis. Mr. Buffett quickly agreed to cooperate with government investigators.In May 1992, Salomon paid $290 million in fines to the government, acknowledged that it had on occasion submitted bogus bids to buy more Treasury securities than regulations allowed, and admitted that its senior executives, including Mr. Gutfreund, had known about the fraudulent bids but had failed to make them public or report them to government officials.Mr. Gutfreund\u2019s troubles were not over. In settling government charges against him, he agreed never again to run a securities firm and to pay a $100,000 fine. For years he battled a $300 million suit filed by private lawyers on behalf of Salomon shareholders who felt that the bidding scandal had caused the value of their stock to decline. Mr. Gutfreund spent more than $5 million of his own money on legal fees trying to get Salomon to pay him more than $15 million, which he insisted the firm owed him in retirement and option plans.But an arbitration proceeding ruled entirely in Salomon\u2019s favor, apparently accepting the firm\u2019s contentions that it had almost perished as a result of Mr. Gutfreund\u2019s actions, that he had deceived Salomon\u2019s board and that he should have been fired for cause, thus making him ineligible for the compensation he was claiming.\u201cWhat I have learned, or at least belatedly remembered, is that there is the possibility of a satisfying life that is broader than the Street,\u201d he said. \u201cI never thought of myself as a king. People really want you to be their deity. They forget the fact that you are a person who has feelings and doubts.\u201dAn obituary on Thursday about John H. Gutfreund, a former chairman and chief executive of the investment firm Salomon Brothers, misstated the legal ramifications of a 1991 bond-trading scandal that led to his resignation. Criminal charges were brought against a bond trader, Paul W. Mozer, who spent four months in prison and settled a federal government civil suit that resulted in a fine and a ban from the securities industry. It is not the case that \u201cno one was arrested or indicted.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Big-Donor Money Has Not Worked in the 2016 Campaign. Yet.", "Date": "2016-03-01", "News": "Supported byEditorialNo matter who comes out on top on Super Tuesday, this round of presidential primaries has been turning conventional notions about campaign finance upside down. For the time being.On the Democratic side, Bernie Sanders has made himself an emblem of grass-roots campaign finance whose run is paid for by small donors and boasts no super PAC support. He has mounted such a surprisingly robust challenge to the super PAC-backed Hillary Clinton that many of her wealthy donors have already given her the maximum legal contribution of $2,700 each (although they can still contribute to her super PACs).So what\u2019s the problem? The general election.With only two nominees to back, tens of millions more from big donors will come sweeping into the race. Big Republican backers like the Koch brothers and Sheldon Adelson will come off the sidelines; other millionaires and billionaires will step up their super PAC giving. The Democratic National Committee just lifted the ban on lobbyist contributions; that means that if Hillary Clinton becomes the Democratic nominee, individual lobbyists will be able to contribute more than $300,000 each to the Hillary Victory Fund, a joint fund-raising committee established in partnership with the national committee. And those maxed-out donors? Come the general election, they\u2019ll all be able to kick in another $2,700.\u201cIf you look at the primary you can get the false impression that the super rich are losing,\u201d says Fred Wertheimer of Democracy 21, who has worked for campaign finance reform for three decades. \u201cBut all these people are going to double down in the general election.\u201dThe result: one winner who most likely will emerge in a position of obligation and dependency on big-money donors. For those who think it\u2019s a step toward campaign finance reform that a businessman, who won\u2019t release his tax returns, is running his campaign as a quasi-profit-making venture, there\u2019s somebody out there who\u2019d like to sell you a Trump University diploma.Mr. Wertheimer and a coalition of similar groups are backing a bill in Congress that would match small contributions six to one with government money. For example, a candidate who received $250 from an individual could get another $1,500 in public funds. But the candidate must agree not to accept individual contributions of more than $1,000 per election, as opposed to $2,700.This would not stem the rise of super PACs, which can spend unlimited contributions on behalf of a candidate, as long as that spending is not overtly coordinated by the candidate. But the hope is that this public financing would make the campaigns less dependent on super PAC support, as well as on agenda-driven wealthy individuals.This measure will likely take years to pass \u2014 after all, most members of Congress finance their campaigns from the same trough this proposal would drain. Still, the watchdogs remain optimistic. \u201cThis system is so unacceptable that at some point it\u2019s going to collapse and the country is going to say, enough,\u201d Mr. Wertheimer says. That day can\u2019t come soon enough.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Top Start-Up Investors Are Betting on Growth, Not Waiting for It", "Date": "2016-03-13", "News": "Supported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 For the last few years, the spotlight in start-up investing has largely shone on those who poured money into a company when it was already well along on a growth path. It turns out that spotlight may have been misdirected.While some investors are throwing giant sums into more mature start-ups like Uber and Airbnb at soaring valuations, it is the venture capitalists who identify a promising company at its infancy and bet on its growth who often come out on top.CB Insights generated the list using criteria such as how big a return an investor was able to produce when his or her investments went public or were acquired. CB Insights focused on the performance of investors since 2008 for the list.The idea that early-stage investors can generate much larger returns has long been a core principle of venture capital: Get in early and grab a bigger stake in a company, with more opportunity for a larger return later, the thinking goes.Early-stage investments have accounted for the lion\u2019s share of the venture industry\u2019s gains since 1994, according to Cambridge Associates, a research firm that studied the quarterly financial reports of dozens of venture firms. Since the dot-com boom of the late 1990s, between two-thirds and three-quarters of the industry\u2019s returns have been generated by early-stage investments in any given year.\u201cWhen you write bigger checks, it\u2019s more natural that people will notice,\u201d said Anand Sanwal, chief executive of CB Insights. In contrast, early-stage investing tends to involve smaller checks and puts an investor into just one of scores of start-ups, making it harder to stand out immediately.Rebecca Lynn, a managing director and co-founder of Canvas Ventures who is on the CB Insights list, said early-stage investments generally pay off more because \u201cinvestors can get more of an ownership stake and you\u2019re also part of the team.\u201dTo identify today\u2019s top venture investors, CB Insights, a research firm that tracks the venture capital industry, created a data-driven list.Yet there is more risk in early investing, since unproven start-ups can easily fail.Early-stage investing has changed in recent years. The top-returning venture-capital investments in any given year were once dominated by just a handful of brand name, early-stage venture firms. That has shifted: Over the last decade, new venture firms have contributed to an increasing share of the best investments, according to Cambridge Associates.From 2000 through 2012, 70 venture capital firms were each involved in at least one of the 10 deals that created the most value for investors. Before 2000, only 25 firms had invested in at least one top 10 deal, according to Cambridge Associates.Mr. Rimer said there was \u201cno question\u201d that \u201cthere are more folks putting money to work at earlier-stage investments than, say, 10 years ago.\u201dNew players have been successful partly because they have been more willing to put money into companies outside Silicon Valley, especially in China, where start-up success stories have been abundant over the last decade, Cambridge Associates said in a report last fall.That has benefited venture capitalists including Ms. Lee and Neil Shen of Sequoia Capital, who made names for themselves by investing early in Chinese start-ups that went public: Ms. Lee in the social network YY.com, and Mr. Shen in the Internet security company Qihoo 360. Mr. Shen is also on CB Insights\u2019 list of top 20 investors.\u201cThe tech market has massively expanded, and tech is now far more accessible all around the world,\u201d said Theresa Hajer, a managing director at Cambridge Associates.As more venture firms have snagged pieces of the top deals, more have also taken pieces of the return pool, lowering the overall gains for the venture industry as a whole. Before the dot-com bust of the early 2000s, huge returns of 25 times the original investment amount were the norm for the top investments. Since that period, it has been much rarer for the top investments in any given year to yield a 25-fold return, according to Cambridge Associates data.For the foundations, endowments and pension funds that have poured billions into venture capital funds, finding the right early-stage investor remains a challenge. Scott C. Malpass, the chief investment officer at the University of Notre Dame, said he could count on two hands the number of venture investors who could successfully identify which young start-ups would make the transition to lasting companies.\u201cI just want to be in the top two to three companies, not the top 100, because that\u2019s where the next Google or LinkedIn will be,\u201d Mr. Malpass said about his philosophy of working with early-stage venture capitalists. \u201cIt\u2019s still a home run game.\u201dNeal Graziano, director of investments at the W. K. Kellogg Foundation, an $8 billion nonprofit foundation that places money with venture investors, says three-quarters of his venture portfolio is invested with people who put money into companies at their earliest stages.\u201cYou see some of your worst performers in the early stages, but this is where you get your biggest investment returns,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}

(Ms. Epstein died in 1998.) \u201cThere is something amusing about the idea of going traveling in search of a button. But what we did, we tried to do well.\u201dThe shop, at 143 East 62nd Street, deals mainly in modern buttons, ranging in price from $2.75 for a classic four-hole horn button to $30 for a crystal evening-wear piece. They sit in cardboard boxes tucked into one wall, color-coded and bearing evocative titles chosen by Ms. Safro, like Engraved Waterlily in Metallic Color and Architectural Swirl c. 1950.In the cabinets are collectible buttons, too, some of which are valued in the thousands of dollars. There have been George Washington inaugural buttons and Civil War buttons, and humorous sets made after the Depression known as \u201cgoofies,\u201d depicting things like pickles.The shop opened in an old button store, slightly farther uptown, in 1964. The owners hung their button at the current address in 1968. Since then, customers have included Gay Talese (seeking horn buttons for his suits), Julie Andrews (pearls), Joan Collins (rhinestones with glass), Lynne Cheney (green rhinestones) and Nora Ephron (she bought a set of card suits in red Bakelite).On a recent rainy afternoon, a customer appeared at the counter and recited a phrase heard every day in the shop. \u201cI lost a button,\u201d said Jennifer K. Zimmons, who works in international finance. \u201cOpal, antique, oval,\u201d she said, presenting the more loyal buttons on her blouse.Barbara Stoj, who has worked in the shop for more than two decades, went in search of a match. \u201cI could close my eyes and know where the chair is, where to go,\u201d she said. She produced two buttons. Ms. Zimmons said, \u201cGo with your first instinct.\u201dAt a table, Lori Canter, who lives in the neighborhood, debated between a Perfect Classic Horn Toggle and a Unique and Exciting Jurassic Horn Tip for a sweater. Two tourists from Tokyo bought buttons labeled Voodoo Charms, having been directed to the shop by a tour book.Connie McSeain came in, shaking off rain. She needed buttons for a double-breasted jacket for her employer, Ted Hartley, the C.E.O. of the Hollywood studio RKO Pictures and an actor who appeared in films with Cary Grant and Robert Redford. A sonata was playing, and Ms. McSeain said she wished her parents had insisted she learn to play the piano as her sisters did.\u201cPeople say things in the button shop they wouldn\u2019t say elsewhere,\u201d Ms. Safro said later.

{"Headline": "China\u2019s National People\u2019s Congress: Key Points", "Date": "2016-03-04", "News": "Supported byMr. Li said China\u2019s economy would grow by 6.5 percent to 7 percent this year. He gave a picture of a government facing some trying times, including \u2014 implicitly \u2014 problems left by his predecessors.\u201cDomestically, problems and risks that have been building up over the years are becoming more evident,\u201d he said in his report. \u201cDownward pressure on the economy is increasing.\u201dStill, with the right changes, Mr. Li said, it would be possible for China to achieve an average annual growth rate of 6.5 percent from 2016 to 2020.China\u2019s economy is faltering, prompting concerns that are now shaking global stock markets.Mr. Li devoted a big part of his report to the potentially painful adjustments to industries that will be needed to shore up growth.Gluts of coal, steel, cement and other industrial commodities have been generating heavy pollution but dwindling profits. Mr. Li indicated that China would need to lay off millions of workers in failing factories and mines. But the government will set aside about $15.3 billion to support laid-off workers, he said.\u201cWe will focus on addressing the overcapacity in the steel, coal and other industries facing difficulties,\u201d he said. \u201cWe will address the issue of \u2018zombie enterprises\u2019 proactively yet prudently by using measures such as mergers, reorganizations, debt restructurings and bankruptcy liquidations.\u201dA big reason the government needs to reduce excess production was laid out by the Ministry of Finance in a report issued Saturday: the income of many state-owned corporations is plunging. The ministry forecast that in 2016 the operating income of China\u2019s biggest, centrally managed state conglomerations \u2014 built to be pillars of the socialist economy \u2014 would fall by more than 13 percent. The main reason, it said, was \u201cthe falling profits in the oil and petrochemical, steel, coal and other sectors.\u201dEven as the Chinese government is trying to shore up economic growth, it is attempting to reduce smog, polluted water and contaminated soil, topics that have stirred popular anger.But reducing the pollution blighting many parts of China depends on cutting back on the heavy industry, mining and coal use that underwrite much of the economy.The government\u2019s next five-year plan, which was issued along with Mr. Li\u2019s report, laid out goals to cut pollution from this year to the end of 2020. The carbon intensity of the economy \u2014 the amount of carbon dioxide pollution released to create each unit of growth \u2014 would fall 18 percent over those years, according to the plan.For many Chinese citizens, industrial toxins that have soaked into the water and soil are equal, if not greater, worries than smoggy skies. They worry that heavy metals and other pollutants have contaminated so much of the countryside that food is unsafe.The five-year plan includes proposals to expand monitoring of polluted soil, and to set up hundreds of model farming and construction sites to show how toxic earth can be cleaned up. But a lasting solution may be a long way off.China surprised many experts when its military budget for the year grew by 7.6 percent, far below the double-digit increases that have become the norm. But the Ministry of Finance report shows that the growth of government revenue is slowing down, along with the general economy. This year, revenues for the central and local governments are projected to grow by 3 percent, about half of last year\u2019s rate of 5.8 percent.China has been feverishly piling sand onto reefs in the South China Sea, creating seven new islets in the region and straining already taut geopolitical tensions.China has come a long way from the period in the 1950s when it absorbed ideas and expertise from the Soviet Union. But a few legacies persist, including a liking for grand five-year plans, and on Saturday the government released its next blueprint, which will guide the country through to the end of 2020.But there is an important aspect to this old-fashioned planning device where climate change and the planet\u2019s future are concerned. In the latest plan, the government elaborated on its goals to cut carbon dioxide pollution from coal and other fossil fuels, and to expand construction of nuclear power plants, hydropower dams, and solar and wind power.Owen Guo and Adam Wu contributed research.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Program That Lets Foreigners Write a Check, and Get a Visa, Draws Scrutiny", "Date": "2016-03-15", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The easiest way to gain entry into the United States is not to walk across the border in the dead of night. It is to write a check.A visa process enacted by Congress in 1990 to create jobs and pump billions of dollars into the economy has evolved into a program that federal investigators and some prominent lawmakers say has become a risk to national security and an easy mark for abuse, particularly from China.But EB-5 has been the subject of increasing scrutiny since investigators uncovered numerous cases of fraud, discovered individuals with possible ties to Chinese and Iranian intelligence using fake documents and learned that international fugitives who have laundered money had infiltrated the program.\u201cIt\u2019s no secret that the program has long been riddled with corruption and national security vulnerabilities,\u201d said Senator Charles E. Grassley, Republican of Iowa and a frequent critic of the program.A number of Democrats echo his criticism, in large part because while most visa applicants must meet education or work requirements, the primary requirement for the EB-5 program is a \u201clawful source of investment income,\u201d one Department of Homeland Security memo said.\u201cI don\u2019t believe that America should be selling visas and eventually citizenship,\u201d said Senator Dianne Feinstein, Democrat of California, who wants to terminate a part of the program that allows foreign applicants to invest through regional development centers that pool investor money. \u201cThe right to immigrate should not be for sale.\u201dThe Department of Homeland Security, led by Secretary Jeh Johnson, said it was taking steps to address the issues raised by senators like Mr. Grassley and Ms. Feinstein. \u201cThe secretary intends to do all he can within his legal authority to do so,\u201d said Marsha Catron, a spokeswoman for the department.The foreign investor visa has defenders. One is Senator Chuck Schumer, Democrat of New York, along with some in the Obama administration who say it has delivered billions of dollars into the American economy: $8.7 billion and 35,140 jobs since Oct. 12. But federal auditors have found that in many cases, those numbers are \u201cnot valid and reliable.\u201dSupporters of the EB-5 program, including real estate developers, spent as much as $3 million to help defeat legislation sponsored by Mr. Grassley and Senator Patrick J. Leahy, Democrat of Vermont, intended to address fraud and national security concerns.Mr. Schumer, who opposed the Grassley-Leahy legislation, said he supported national security and fraud reforms to the EB-5 program.New criticism of the program surfaced recently when a former federal investigator, Taylor Johnson, a special agent with Immigration and Customs Enforcement, said she was fired after raising questions about the vetting of individuals involved in a development project in Las Vegas. She filed a complaint with the Merit Systems Protection Board, a quasi-judicial agency that protects whistle-blowers, saying she was fired because she exposed national security concerns. Immigration and Customs Enforcement said Ms. Johnson\u2019s termination was unrelated to her EB-5 investigation.But her accusations have prompted investigations by the Office of Special Counsel, an independent agency that protects federal employees from reprisal, and the Department of Homeland Security\u2019s Office of the Inspector General.Foreign investors can gain green cards by investing $1 million in a new business or $500,000 through one of nearly 800 regional development centers across the country that pool EB-5 money and are certified by the federal government. Most EB-5 visa seekers \u2014 about 95 percent \u2014 invest through these regional centers, which are largely unregulated. In some cases, the investors can also gain citizenship.The program has grown rapidly, to nearly 9,000 conditional visas last year, of which 80 percent were issued to Chinese investors, from 64 EB-5 visas in 2003. Investigators have found that security risks have risen rapidly with the growth.A Government Accountability Office report released in August found that the agency could not be sure that money used for the visas was not coming from \u201cthe drug trade, human trafficking or other criminal activities.\u201dOfficials at Homeland Security Investigations, a division of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, said they were concerned that those who prepare overseas documents \u201cmay try to use increasingly sophisticated methods to circumvent\u201d the program. In a 2013 memo, the agency suggested that the EB-5 regional center program end because \u201cthere are no safeguards that can be put in place that will ensure the integrity\u201d of the regional center model.Court records and law enforcement documents show that several individuals with questionable backgrounds have used the program to launder money and gain entry to the United States.A growing concern among United States intelligence and law enforcement officials is that foreign government agents might be trying to infiltrate the program to conduct economic espionage or gain access to technology that is banned from export.A 2013 Homeland Security investigation found that an individual involved in the EB-5 program who was later arrested in connection with exporting electronics to Iran had ties to Iranian intelligence operatives who might try to abuse the programs to enter the United States.Officials from Citizenship and Immigration Services acknowledged that the EB-5 program has had problems, but they said the agency had made a number of changes to address them, including shutting down 35 troubled centers since 2014.And Homeland Security officials said they were being more proactive in tracing the sources of foreign investor income, including establishing working relationships with Chinese government officials and conducting overseas visits to verify applicants\u2019 sources of income.Mr. Grassley, the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, said he was not convinced the changes were enough.An earlier version of this article stated incorrectly the type of visa that was granted to Hector Javier Villarreal Hernandez, the former treasurer of the Mexican state of Coahuila. He did not receive a visa under the EB-5 program, which allows wealthy foreign investors to receive a visa for a price ranging from $500,000 to more than $1 million; he received a visa under a different program.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Pop-Up Stores Thrive in a World of Failing Retailers", "Date": "2016-03-30", "News": "Supported byDuring trips to war-torn countries like Afghanistan, Jane Mosbacher Morris discovered, to her alarm, that women had little control over their finances. Some were forbidden to work or even touch money. The antidote, she decided, was starting an online market stocked with artisan works made by survivors of war, genocide, human trafficking and other abuses. The site To the Market would put much-needed money into their hands.Each handmade piece on the site has a powerful back story, such as the deka necklace, which is made of recycled paper by female survivors of war in Northern Uganda.\u201cPeople want to know where something is made,\u201d said Ms. Morris. \u201cA piece may be spun in a leper colony or crafted in an AIDS shelter.\u201dBut in cyberspace, goods can\u2019t be touched. So Ms. Morris, who was a counterterrorism adviser for the State Department, turned to pop-up stores as a way to sell the jewelry, handbags and other items that carry these powerful stories.She began pitching her pop-up stores at conferences, such as one for refugees put on by the Red Cross. Others are held in yoga studios or women\u2019s homes. These places are usually free, and she can walk away with tens of thousands of dollars of sales, putting more money into the hands of survivors.Entrepreneurs like Ms. Morris are helping revitalize pop-up stores, a decades-old retail concept. More party than hard sell, this new breed of pop-ups is becoming increasingly innovative and fun \u2014 far more than the seasonal pop-ups that once prevailed. And they are also increasingly profitable, experts say, since consumers crave these new experiences.Using pop-ups does, of course, still help entrepreneurs stay nimble and lean. They do not need to sign long leases, stash away much cash or carry big credit lines. For their part, consumers can meet the designers and touch and feel their works, which cannot be done online. In the process, brands can be built more quickly, sales can be increased and new products can be tested.\u201cPop-up stores are a tremendous format,\u201d said Burt Flickinger III, managing director at the Strategic Resource Group. \u201cThey are exponential ways to build a brand.\u201dThese stores, and e-commerce, are putting big dents in older retail chains, Mr. Flickinger said. They are going through a \u201cretail ice age,\u201d he said, as once-reliable retail anchors like JC Penney and Sports Authority sputter. They are weighed down by high costs and long production schedules, he added.\u201cConsumers are looking for new ways to shop and new brands,\u201d he added. \u201cThey want better quality at better prices. Legacy stores, though, have a harder time changing their mixes.\u201dIn a Darwinian sales environment, pop-up stores are winning.The hip eyeware maker Warby Parker helped push pop-up stores into a year-round, fun event. The company turned a school bus into a traveling eyewear shop, tricking it out with leather couches, wood paneling and even vintage books, and then took it on the road trip across the country.\u201cThe bus was visual and out of the box,\u201d said Melissa Gonzalez, author of the book \u201cThe Pop-Up Paradigm: How Brands Build Human Connections in a Digital Age\u201d (Lionesque Media, 2014). \u201cAnd it showed that you don\u2019t need a store.\u201dPop-up entrepreneurs are continuing to innovate. Events are, well, popping up in garages, around pools and even in locked storage spaces. Some retailers are even doing 3-D pop-up printed jewelry, say experts. And one artist opened a gallery in a giant Christmas tree.\u201cThey\u2019re risk takers,\u201d said Jeremy Baras, chief executive of PopUp Republic. \u201cPop-up stores are temporary so you can be more creative.\u201d The event, he warns, should blend in your product or service, though, rather than being a distraction.Catherine Nicole, who has an online jewelry boutique of the same name, has even ditched trade shows for pop-ups. She tries to hold two pop-ups sales a month, where she sells her jewelry, which is made of semiprecious gemstones that were inspired by travels to Spain and Africa. This strategy, she adds, is in keeping with her business model of staying lean and agile.\u201cIt\u2019s more lucrative to stay out of the game and approach it in an artisan style,\u201d said Ms. Nicole, who studied apparel design at Parsons School of Design. \u201cIt leads to sticky customers.\u201dFor one pop-up, she set up shop in the lobby of the software developer Ceres Logic, which many people passed through. And for Valentine\u2019s Day, she sold her jewelry during men\u2019s happy hour at a bar in Austin, which did not cost her anything, either. She also worked with flower vendors, chocolate sellers and a massage therapist for that event.\u201cI can\u2019t compete with Forever 21\u2019s prices or David Yurman\u2019s notoriety,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I can show my customers that I value them. They don\u2019t want to walk into a store and be treated like nobodies.\u201dLike Ms. Nicole, other entrepreneurs are also forging partnerships with food makers and other artisans. And these events may be held at hotels, malls or other high-traffic locales. Successful pop-ups should ignite the five senses, Ms. Gonzalez explained, because they are selling lifestyle events.Sense-bolstering is exactly what Paul Trible, a co-founder of the luxury men\u2019s wear company Ledbury, aims for with pop-ups. To build popularity, he has been throwing partylike events, which have included bourbon tasting, local breweries and DJ\u2019s who spin funk and soul music.One pop-up party in Atlanta drew a crowd of more than 350. And Steven Yeun, a star of \u201cThe Walking Dead,\u201d even brought Scott Gimple, a noted television show and comedy writer, who bought a blazer.\u201cWe\u2019re all about fit and quality, and that\u2019s our mantra,\u201d said Mr. Trible, who studied shirt making with a London master tailor after his dreams of going into finance evaporated during the financial crisis. \u201cAnd that\u2019s very tactile. You have to feel it. So these pop-ups are great introductions for customers.\u201dFor Mr. Trible, pop-ups fuel sales. And typically, his best e-commerce customers spend the most money. He also uses pop-ups to test retail locations, such as the Georgetown area of Washington, where one pop-up store lasted for three months. The team looked at foot traffic, repeat buys and other variables. \u201cWe\u2019re opening a permanent store in the same neighborhood,\u201d he saidMr. Trible added that organizing a pop-up event in one week can be stressful. \u201cYou need a staff that\u2019s a SWAT team to execute,\u201d he said.Lack of planning, though, can doom the event. Retailers may not fully evaluate a location, said Ms. Gonzalez, or invest enough time in telling a story. \u201cUnderstand the goal of a pop-up,\u201d she advised.During the early days of the Thursday Boot Company, pop-ups were held at a co-founder\u2019s apartment in the Flatiron section of Manhattan. \u201cWe did fittings,\u201d said Connor Wilson, Thursday Boot\u2019s other co-founder. \u201cGave out free beer. And it was a chance to connect with customers.\u201dAnother free pop-up was held at The Garret, a woodsy bar in Manhattan\u2019s West Village, on a Saturday afternoon. It helped spur Thursday Boot\u2019s Kickstarter campaign, which ended up raising $276,610 in one month, one of the most-financed footwear campaigns ever.These days, Thursday Boot events are more formal. One three-month pop-up event was held at a retail space, which was part of Union Market in Washington Its handcrafted boots were displayed on industrial cable spools and the specially designed Thursday Boot flag was flying. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to keep it fresh and fun,\u201d said Mr. Wilson.Shopping in person for handcrafted items is a nice change from buying online, said Ms. Morris. \u201cAnd I love being part of the process,\u201d she said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Samsonite to Buy Tumi for $1.8 Billion", "Date": "2016-03-03", "News": "Supported bySamsonite agreed on Thursday to buy one of its most prominent competitors in the luggage industry, Tumi Holdings, for about $1.8 billion in a deal that unites two of the biggest companies to cater to business travelers.Under the terms of the deal, Samsonite will pay $26.75 a share in cash, 32 percent higher than the closing price of Tumi\u2019s stock on Wednesday.Buying Tumi, founded four decades ago by a veteran of the Peace Corps and named after a kind of ceremonial Incan knife, will give Samsonite an entryway into high-end luggage.Tumi\u2019s roller bags have a cult following among travelers who covet the sleek, and expensive, black ballistic-nylon models for which the brand is known.Tumi reported $548 million in sales last year, up 4 percent from the previous year.Samsonite has a market capitalization of about $4.3 billion.In its announcement, Samsonite said that it planned to market Tumi luggage through its own sales network and expand the brand\u2019s reach in Asia and Europe.Samsonite will finance the deal through loans from Morgan Stanley, HSBC, SunTrust and Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group, the company said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Starwood Says Rival\u2019s Counteroffer Tops Bid from Marriott", "Date": "2016-03-18", "News": "Supported byStarwood Hotels & Resorts Worldwide says a $13.2 billion takeover offer led by a Chinese insurer is superior to the one that was all but sealed by Marriott International \u2014 a deal that would have created the world\u2019s largest hotel company.But Marriott is not ready to walk away quite yet. The lodging company, with more than 4,400 properties, is \u201creviewing the Anbang consortium\u2019s proposal and is carefully considering its alternatives,\u201d Marriott said in a statement.\u201cMarriott continues to believe that a combination of Marriott and Starwood is the best course for both companies and offers the best value to Starwood shareholders,\u201d Marriott said in the statement.The offer from Anbang, along with J. C. Flowers & Company and Primavera Capital, would represent the biggest Chinese takeover of an American entity, according to Dealogic. The Starwood board said in the statement that the binding and fully financed proposal \u201cprovides a high degree of closing certainty.\u201dUntil this week, the deal between Starwood and Marriott was nearly complete. The companies agreed in November to combine after a competitive process also said to involve Hyatt Hotels Corporation. Shareholders were disappointed when the deal was announced, sending Starwood\u2019s stock lower \u2014 the opposite of what typically happens to a seller\u2019s stock. Since then, Marriott\u2019s offer was weakened by a decline in the acquirer\u2019s shares.Cash represented an unusually small proportion of Marriott\u2019s original offer. Marriott will need to increase the cash component as well as the overall value of the offer to prevail over Anbang, said Anthony Sabino, a professor of business law at St. John\u2019s University.\u201cIf Starwood\u2019s shareholders agree with their board, then they will be bought out completely,\u201d Mr. Sabino said. \u201cThey won\u2019t care about what is inarguably Marriott\u2019s stellar record of hotel operations, because they will just be pocketing the cash and moving on to other things.\u201dAnbang\u2019s desire for Starwood appears to coincide with its interest in acquiring Strategic Hotels from the Blackstone Group for $6.5 billion. Strategic Hotels owns high-end hotels throughout the United States, such as the Four Seasons in Scottsdale, Ariz., and the JW Marriott Essex House hotel in Manhattan. Two years ago, Anbang agreed to acquire the Waldorf Astoria for $1.95 billion.Under either proposal, Starwood shareholders would also receive about $5.67 a share from the previously announced spinoff of its time-share business, Vistana Signature Experiences, which will merge with the Interval Leisure Group. Including the spinoff, the Anbang offer represented value of $83.67 for each Starwood share, compared with $73.67 a share from the Marriott bid.Terminating the agreement with Marriott would require Starwood to pay a $400 million breakup fee to Marriott. Marriott can revise its own offer with Starwood until 11:59 p.m. on March 28. That day was supposed to be Marriott\u2019s special meeting of stockholders, which the company said it may reschedule.Michael J. de la Merced contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Transcript of the Democratic Presidential Debate in Flint, Mich.", "Date": "2016-03-06", "News": "Supported byFollowing is a transcript of the Democratic debate, as transcribed by the Federal News Service.And now we want to welcome the Democratic candidates for president of the United States, please welcome Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont.(APPLAUSE)(APPLAUSE)(APPLAUSE)And now will you please rise for our national anthem performed by the Flint City Wide Choir, conducted by Darnell Ishmel. (MUSIC PLAYING, \u201cTHE STAR-SPANGLED BANNER\u201d)(APPLAUSE)Candidates take your positions behind the podium. Before we begin as the candidates take their positions, I just want to set out some ground rules as moderators, I\u2019ll ask questions, I\u2019ll ask follow- ups and guide the discussion. The candidates will have one minute and 15 seconds to answer questions. They\u2019ll have 30 seconds for follow- ups. CNN\u2019s Don Lemon will join me in the questioning, as will members of our audience here tonight. The members of our audience are Democrats and independents from Flint and elsewhere in Michigan. We\u2019ve reviewed their questions just so they don\u2019t overlap.COOPER: Now we\u2019ve come to Flint because this is a city in crisis, a city where, as you probably know, the tap water is toxic. Public servants, public institutions not only failed to prevent the crisis, their decisions created this crisis. The state of Michigan, in an effort to save money, switched Flint\u2019s water source to a cheaper, but riskier alternative, the Flint River. Safeguards were ignored. That river water corroded residential pipes, and for nearly two years, lead leaked into the water used in people\u2019s homes. Now, for much of that time, the state downplayed the danger, even in the face of growing complaints and physical evidence.For 100 days, the federal government knew about it, and yet in all that time nobody told the people of Flint. They bathed in the water, they drank it, and so did their kids. Even today, lead is still present in some of the water.Tonight the Democratic candidates are here to answer questions about what they would do for Flint, as well as about other issues facing their country right now.Each candidate has one minute for an opening statement, Senator Sanders is first. We begin with him. Senator Sanders?Over the last several weeks I had the opportunity to meet with a number of residents of Flint at a town meeting in Flint, and I have to tell you what I heard, and what I saw literally shattered me. And, it was beyond belief that children in Flint, Michigan in the United States of America in the year 2016 are being poisoned.That is clearly not what this country should be about.As Anderson indicated, there\u2019s a lot of blame to go around, and one of the points that I have made is that I believe the Governor of this state should understand that his dereliction of duty was irresponsible. He should resign.(APPLAUSE)(APPLAUSE)(APPLAUSE)We are here in Flint, I\u2019m very grateful that my request that we hold this debate be held here so we can continue to shine a very bright spotlight on what has happened in this city.I agree, the Governor should resign, or be recalled...(APPLAUSE)I support a hundred percent the efforts by your senators and members of congress to get the money from the federal government in order to begin the work that must occur to fix the infrastructure. The state should also be sending money immediately to help this city.(APPLAUSE) (CHEERING)(APPLAUSE)Your government at all levels have let you and your children and the people of Flint down. So I think that there are there several things. All the repair work that is being done \u2014 and Mayor Weaver program that we support to begin to help train people in Flint to be able to do this work to distribute the water. Everything that is done has to be triple checked to regain your trust and to hold those who are responsible for fixing the pipes and delivering the clean water which has you said, you bathe in it and drink it and wash food in it. You do everything with it.Every one of us should have to run through in our minds how we use water every single day to understand the pressures and the real pain that families are going through. So I will make sure as President that I double and triple check. I will work with elected officials who I trust like your mayor and like your senators and member of Congress so that we can assure you that when it\u2019s fixed, you can trust it. You deserve nothing less.When it comes to the water itself, we are supporting a program that Mayor Waver announced through Flint Waterworks to pay people in Flint, not outsiders, but people here to deliver the water while we are fixing the pipes. I would do even more of that. As president, what we were able to put together was a beginning. As president, I would concentrate resources on the city for economic development for more jobs as we fix the water and provide the health and education, interventions that children need. COOPER: Senator Sanders for Ms. Wade specifically?(APPLAUSE)What is absolute incredible to me is that water rates have soared in Flint. You are paying three times more for poison water than I am paying in Burlington, Vermont for clean water.First thing is you say, people are not paying a water bill for poison and that is retroactive.(APPLAUSE)Second of all, to ease anxiety, CDC has to come in and examine every child and adult in this community in terms of the amount of lead they may have. Thirdly, the wealthiest country has to rebuild the crumbling infrastructure, our water systems. I have a bill for a trillion dollars, it creates 13 million jobs rebuilding flint, Michigan and communities all over the country.(APPLAUSE)We will have more on the infrastructure shortly but I want to follow up with you.This crisis in flint as you know, as everybody in the room knows was created by the government. Your policies are about expanding government. Why should people from flint trust that more government is the answer?Listen, I suppose they can trust the corporations who have destroyed Flint by a disastrous trade policy which have allowed them to shut down plants in flint and move to China or Mexico. We could trust them I\u2019m sure.(APPLAUSE)(APPLAUSE)... because we know their honesty and integrity has done so much for the American people. Look, we live in a democracy, and I\u2019m not in (ph) the last person to deny that government is failing in many respects.But at the end of the day, I will trust the people to create a government that works for them, rather than Wall Street or corporate America.(APPLAUSE)It\u2019s easy to blame the Republican governor, Rick Snyder. But the federal government also dropped the ball here. According to Section 1414 of the Safe Drinking Water Act, the EPA has to step in and take action when a state is informed at (ph) \u2014 about water problems and doesn\u2019t do anything for 30 days, as the state here didn\u2019t do.The EPA knew for months and months, never warned the people of Flint not to drink the water. As president, would you fire the head of the EPA?So I would have a full investigation, determine who knew what, when. And yes, people should be fired. How far up it went, I don\u2019t know. But as far as it goes, they should be relieved, because they failed this city.But let me just add this, Anderson. This is not the only place where this kind of action is needed. We have a lot of communities right now in our country where the level of toxins in the water, including lead, are way above what anybody should tolerate.(APPLAUSE)We have a higher rate of tested lead in people in Cleveland than in Flint. So I\u2019m not satisfied with just doing everything we must do for Flint. I want to tackle this problem across the board. And if people know about it and they\u2019re not acting, and they\u2019re in the government at any level, they should be forced to resign.(APPLAUSE)(APPLAUSE)And President Sanders would make the point that, how does it happen, in the wealthiest country in the history of the world? What are our priorities when, among others, Republicans today are fighting for hundreds of billions of dollars in tax breaks for the wealthiest people?How did we have so much money available to go to war in Iraq and spend trillions of dollars...(APPLAUSE)... but somehow not have enough money \u2014 not just for Flint, the secretary is right. There are communities all over this country \u2014 it\u2019s not just infrastructure, it is education. Detroit\u2019s public school system is collapsing.(APPLAUSE)She says she\u2019s undecided, and has a question for both of you to answer, but we\u2019ll start with Senator Sanders. Ms. Walters?(APPLAUSE)So, I want to do exactly what you said. We will commit to a priority to change the water systems, and we will commit within five years to remove lead from everywhere.We were making progress on this in the 1990\u2019s. I worked with then Senator Obama to get more money, more support to do more to remove lead.(APPLAUSE)If it leads to civil penalties, if it leads to criminal responsibility. There has to be an absolute accountability, and I will support whatever the outcome of those investigations are.Imagine this for a second, imagine a mother who had a bright seven-year-old gregarious girl doing well in school. Two years later, that child is now in special education, intellectual capabilities significantly deteriorated. That is a crime against that child, and the people of Flint. And, clearly, people are going to have to be held accountable.(APPLAUSE)I want to turn now to Bryn Mickle, the editor of the Flint Journal, he\u2019s our local partner in this debate. He has our next question.Bryn?And, this problem is one that is particularly outrageous and painful at the same time.So, when I heard about it I immediately sent people here to find out what was going on. It was almost unbelievable. We have this problem in other places, but we don\u2019t say that it was actually caused by decisions made by public officials in positions of authority, as this one was.Then, when I talked to the mayor I basically said, \u201cWhat can I do to help?\u201dThen, when I came here, and I met with some of the mothers, and met their children, and heard their stories \u2014 I\u2019m just determined to do whatever I can. So, I have put together resources from the private and philanthropic communities to help provide a bridge because you\u2019ve got to get the federal money, you\u2019ve got to get the state money, but I\u2019m going to do everything I can. And, I will be with Flint all the way through this crisis in whatever capacity I am.And, if I\u2019m president, it will always be a priority for action from me.(APPLAUSE)And the second thing I did is hold a town meeting, which was as nonpolitical as I could make it for hundreds of people to tell me and the world through the media exactly what was happening here in Flint. I think the fear and the legitimate fear of the people of Flint is that a certain point the TV cameras and CNN will disappear.(APPLAUSE)And people are going to be left struggling in order to live in a safe and healthy community. All I can say is if you check my record going back a long time, I have stood with those who are hurting. I have stood with those who have no money, and I have taken on virtually every powerful special interest in the United States of America. That\u2019s my record and I\u2019m proud of it.This city is also facing a jobs crisis, 75 percent of Flint\u2019s manufacturing jobs have been lost in the last 25 years and about the same amount of time, Michigan lost 230,000 manufacturing jobs.I want to go to Tanisha Motron, she grew up in flint and now works in Detroit at the Shinola watch factory which as you know, is often held up as the blueprint for how to save American industry jobs. She says she\u2019s leaning towards secretary Clinton and has a question for her.We\u2019re also going to invest more on infrastructure as we both have said, \u201cit\u2019s woefully under resourced.\u201d That will put a lot of people to work. I want to do more to help small businesses, they are the source of two thirds of our jobs and we have to help them start and grow, particularly minority and women-owned small businesses.We need to do more to help create clean energy as a source of good jobs but I am also going to go after companies. You know, when a company decides to leave like Nabisco is leaving and they have gotten tax benefits from Chicago and Illinois to stay there, I will claw back the benefits. They will have to pay them back if they are leaving a place that actually invested in them.I am also going to go after companies like Johnson Controls in Wisconsin. They came and got part of the bailout because they were an auto parts supplier and now they want to move headquarters to Europe. They are going to have to pay an exit fee. We are going to stop this kind of job exporting and we are going to start importing and growing jobs again in our country.Secretary Clinton supported virtually every one of the disastrous trade agreements written by corporate America.(APPLAUSE)NAFTA, supported by the Secretary cost, us 800,000 jobs nationwide, tens of thousands of jobs in the Midwest. Permanent normal trade relations with China cost us millions of jobs. Look, I was on a picket line in early 1990\u2019s against NFATA because you didn\u2019t need a PhD in economics to understand that American workers should not be forced to compete against people in Mexico making 25 cents an hour.(APPLAUSE)(APPLAUSE)... should not be forced to compete against people in Vietnam today making a minimum wage of $0.65 an hour. Look, what we have got to do is tell corporate America that they cannot continue to shut down. We\u2019ve lost 60,000 factories since 2001. They\u2019re going to start having to, if I\u2019m president, invest in this country \u2014 not in China, not in Mexico.(APPLAUSE)The money was there, and had to be released in order to save the American auto industry and four million jobs, and to begin the restructuring. We had the best year that the auto industry has had in a long time. I voted to save the auto industry.(APPLAUSE)He voted against the money that ended up saving the auto industry. I think that is a pretty big difference.(APPLAUSE)(CROSSTALK)When billionaires on Wall Street destroyed this economy, they went to Congress and they said, \u201cplease, we\u2019ll be good boys, bail us out.\u201d You know what I said? I said, \u201clet the billionaires themselves bail out Wall Street.\u201d It shouldn\u2019t be the middle class of this country.(APPLAUSE)But ultimately, if you look at our records, I stood up to corporate America time and time again. I went to Mexico. I saw the lives of people who were working in American factories and making $0.25 an hour.I understood that these trade agreements were going to destroy the middle class of this country. I led the fight against us (sic). That is one of the major differences that we have.(APPLAUSE)... to set the record straight, I voted against the only multinational trade agreement that came before me when I was in the Senate. It was called CAFTA. I came out against the TPP after it was finished. I thought it was reasonable to actually know what was in it before I opposed it. I oppose it.(APPLAUSE)Now let me get back to what happened in January of 2009. The Bush administration negotiated the deal. Were there things in it that I didn\u2019t like? Would I have done it differently? Absolutely.But was the auto bailout money in it \u2014 the $350 billion that was needed to begin the restructuring of the auto industry? Yes, it was. So when I talk about Senator Sanders being a one-issue candidate, I mean very clearly \u2014 you have to make hard choices when you\u2019re in positions of responsibility. The two senators from Michigan stood on the floor and said, \u201cwe have to get this money released.\u201d I went with them, and I went with Barack Obama. You did not. If everybody had voted the way he did, I believe the auto industry would have collapsed, taking four million jobs with it.(APPLAUSE)(APPLAUSE)And what I proposed \u2014 and I had an amendment that was defeated \u2014 it was defeated by a voice vote on the floor of the Senate \u2014 that said to those people on the top who benefited from Wall Street greed \u2014 I said, \u201cyou pay for the bailout. Don\u2019t go to my constituents, who are struggling to make ends meet.\u201dIn terms of the auto bailout, of course that made sense. In terms of the stimulus package, of course that made sense, and I strongly supported President Obama\u2019s position on that.SANDERS: But let us be clear, one of the major issues Secretary Clinton says I\u2019m a one-issue person, well, I guess so. My one issue is trying to rebuild a disappearing middle class. That\u2019s my one issue.(APPLAUSE)He sent a letter, an authorized letter, asking us to support that to save the auto industry. Yes, were there things in it that you and I would not have necessarily wanted? That\u2019s true. But when it came down to it, you were either for saving the auto industry or you were against it. I voted to save the auto industry. And I am very glad that I did.(APPLAUSE)(APPLAUSE)Well, let\u2019s have some facts instead of some rhetoric for a change. I went to Wall Street when I was a United States senator. I told them they were wrecking the economy. I asked for a moratorium on foreclosures. I asked that we do more to try to prevent what I worried was going to happen. I also called for closing loopholes including the carried interest loophole. I also called for changes in CEO pay. I have a record. And you know what, if you were going to be in some way distrusted or dismissed about whether you can take on Wall Street if you ever took money, President Obama took more money from Wall Street in the 2008 campaign than anybody ever had.And when it came time to stand up to Wall Street, he passed and signed the toughest regulation since the Great Depression with the Dodd-Frank regulations.Second of all, when we talk about being tough on Wall Street, and this galls me and the American people. Recently Goldman Sachs, among many other major financial institutions on Wall Street, as you know, reached a settlement with the federal government for $5 billion because they were selling worthless packages of subprime mortgages, $5 billion settlement.You know how many people, executives on Wall Street have gone to jail? If you are a kid caught with marijuana in Michigan, you get a police record. If you are an executive on Wall Street that destroys the American economy, you pay a $5 billion fine, no police record.If I am elected president, we are going to bring justice back to a broken criminal justice system.(APPLAUSE)Because we now have tools, laws that we didn\u2019t have before. And I am very happy we did. Because there does need to be accountability, including criminal accountability if it is called for.COOPER: Senator Sanders, I just want to show the audience, you sent a tweet, I want to return to trade.You sent a tweet on Thursday, this is the tweet, I\u2019m showing it to viewers. It says the people of Detroit know the real costs of Hillary Clinton\u2019s free trade policies. It shows pictures of crumbling buildings. It seems like you\u2019re blaming her for the situation in Detroit.Do you know...(APPLAUSE)Those trade policies, as much as any other set of policies, has resulted in the shrinking of the American middle class. And, I\u2019ll tell you what else it did. It\u2019s not only job loss by the millions, it is the race to the bottom so that new jobs in manufacturing, in some cases today, pay 50 percent less than they did 20 years ago. How stupid is that trade policy?(APPLAUSE)There had been a net increase of 54,000 manufacturing jobs. There had been a net increase of 653,000 jobs overall.And, one of the ways jobs were brought to, and grown here in Michigan was through something called the Export-Import Bank which helped a lot of businesses, particularly small businesses, be able to export around the world.Senator Sanders opposes that. I think we\u2019re in a race for exports. I think China, Germany, everybody else supports their businesses. Here in Michigan there\u2019s been $11 billion dollars in recent years used to support exports, primarily from small businesses.I favor that, he\u2019s opposed it. I want to do everything I can for us to compete and win in the global economy...The Export-Import Bank, it\u2019s a federal agency, it gives loans to companies that export American products. Senator Sanders, you do oppose it. The vast majority of the bank\u2019s customers are small businesses, 176 right here in Michigan. What do you say to small business owners....Seventy-Five percent of the funds going from the federal government, the Export-Import Bank, goes to large, profitable corporations. Many of these corporations have shut down in America, and have gone abroad to exploit poor people.You know what? I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a great idea for the American taxpayer to have to subsidize through corporate welfare profitable corporations who downsize in the United States of America.(LAUGHTER)I just believe that Senator Sanders took that lonely position because most of us who saw the results \u2014 I saw it as a senator from New York. Your Senators saw it here in Michigan. They can give you the names of 240 companies in Michigan that have been helped.There is a company in Levonia being helped, there are companies all over this state. I know, if we are going to compete and win in the global economy, we can\u2019t let every other country support their companies and we take a hands off approach. I will not agree with that.I did go in many places around the world to sell American products because the alternatives were usually European, Asian, primarily Chinese products. That to me was an unacceptable concession. So yes, Boeing and other big companies get support just like their competitors do from the companies that they are from in the countries that provide the support.Senator sanders?Second of all.(APPLAUSE)Second of all, secretary Clinton traveled the world, she has been to Europe. And let\u2019s talk about Europe versus the United States. I\u2019m sure that when you were in Europe, and France, and Germany and the U.K., and all of the other countries; you noticed something and that is every one of those countries guarantees health care to all of their people as a right.(APPLAUSE)And I am sure you know as you know you do that in countries like the U.K. compared to America, we are spending almost three times as much as they spend in the U.K. for health care for our people. We are spending 50 percent more than the French. When we talk about Europe and their pluses and minuses, one thing they have done well that we should emulate and that is guaranteed health care for all people for a better care for all.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)As most of you know, two weeks ago, an Uber driver in Kalamazoo, which is two hours from where we are tonight, went on a shooting rampage, killing six people, injuring two people.One of the injured was a 14-year-old girl. Her name is Abigail Kopf. She was shot in the head, her heart stopped, she was on life support \u2014 looked like she might \u2014 might not make it. But amazingly, Abigail pulled through. Her father...(APPLAUSE)... her father Gene Kopf is here tonight. And I know, Gene, you have a question. But before you ask your question, I just want to ask, how is Abigail doing tonight?(APPLAUSE)What do you plan to do to address this serious epidemic? I don\u2019t want to hear anything about tougher laws for mental health or criminal backgrounds, because that doesn\u2019t work.(APPLAUSE)I think we have to try everything that works to try to limit the numbers of people and the kinds of people who are given access to firearms. The Brady Bill, which has been in effect now for about 23 years, has kept more than two million purchases from going forward. So we do have to continue to try to work on that because not every killer will have the same profile.But the comprehensive background checks, closing the gun show loophole, closing the online loophole, closing what\u2019s called the Charleston loophole, where you get a gun at the end of three days, even if the background check is not completed which is what the killer in Charleston did. And then they found out later, he shouldn\u2019t have gotten the gun when he killed nine people at Mother Emmanuel Church.I also believe, so strongly Gene (ph), that giving immunity to gunmakers and sellers was a terrible mistake.(APPLAUSE)And then I do think we have got to have a public...(APPLAUSE)Any lunatic tomorrow, any person can walk into a theater and do something horrific. And you know what? For us to tell you that that absolutely will not happen would be untrue. But what the president said, he said look, this is a tough issue. But we have got to do everything we possibly can to minimize the possibility of these mass killings.You are looking at a guy who comes from a rural state with no gun control. I have a D minus voting record from the NRA. You are looking at a guy who in 1988 lost a statewide election for Congress because I was the only candidate who said you know what, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a great idea in this country to be selling military-style assault weapons which are designed to kill people.(APPLAUSE)Right now, families of Sandy Hook victims announced that they are going to sue Remington, who made the AR-15 which was used in the Newtown massacre.(APPLAUSE)Now, they believe \u2014 those families believe that \u2014 that Remington, the distributors, the sellers \u2014 should be held legally responsible for how that gun \u2014 how their product is used.Now, the lawsuit may not go anywhere because of the bill you voted for \u2014 legislation that prevents gun makers from being sued. Tonight, what do you say to those families?If that is the point, I have to tell you I disagree. I disagree because you hold people \u2014 in terms of this liability thing, where you hold manufacturers\u2019 liability is if they understand that they\u2019re selling guns into an area that \u2014 it\u2019s getting into the hands of criminals, of course they should be held liable.But if they are selling a product to a person who buys it legally, what you\u2019re really talking about is ending gun manufacturing in America. I don\u2019t agree with that.(APPLAUSE)Because of the proliferation of guns, because of the epidemic of gun violence in our country, there were a group of cities, states, and other concerned people who, in the late 90s and in the early 2000s, were working on legal theories that they thought would force gun makers to do more to make guns safer and force sellers to be much more responsible.The NRA saw this happening, and they said, \u201cwe\u2019ve got to stop it. Last thing in the world we want is to have guns that you can only shoot with your fingerprint, or to have guns with such strong safety locks on them that they may not be sellable.\u201dSo the NRA went to the Congress, and the head of the NRA has said this was the most important NRA legislation in more than 20 years...(CROSSTALK)(APPLAUSE)As I understand it \u2014 and maybe I\u2019m wrong on this, but what you were essentially saying, and what people are saying, is that, if somebody who is crazy or a criminal or a horrible person goes around shooting people, the manufacturer of that gun should be held liable.And if that is your position, then what you are saying, essentially \u2014 if that is the case, as I understand it \u2014 it\u2019s not what Secretary Clinton is talking about. I agree with what she said.But if that is the case, then essentially, your position is there should not be any guns in America, period.(CROSSTALK)And you can \u2014 there are people who hold that view. And that\u2019s fine, if you hold it. I think what you do is you hold those people who have used the gun accountable. You try to make...Now, they are trying to prevent that from happening to any other family.But, as I understand what your question is \u2014 and, you\u2019re not the only person whose heart was broken. I know, I was there in the Senate when we learned about this killing. It is almost unspeakable to talk about some lunatic walking into a \u2014 I mean; it is hard to even talk about it.We all feel that way. But it, as I understand it, Anderson, and maybe I\u2019m wrong, what you\u2019re really talking about is people saying let\u2019s end gun manufacturing in America. That\u2019s the implications of that, and I don\u2019t agree with that.As a black man in America, if I were born today I\u2019d have a one in three chance of ending up in prison in my life. Secretary Clinton, on the campaign trail, you are calling for an end to the era of mass incarceration, but a lot of folks in the black community blame the 1994 Crime Bill, a bill you supported for locking up a generation of black men.Given what\u2019s happened since 1994, why should black people trust you to get it right this time?Now, my husband said at the NAACP last summer that it solved some problems, but it created other problems, and I agree. And, one of those problems was, unfortunately, a move to expand the reasons why people would be incarcerated, not just at the federal level which is what this bill about, but in states and localities as well. And, that\u2019s why the very first speech that I gave in this campaign was about criminal justice reform, and ending the era of mass incarceration because I believe absolutely that too many families were broken up, too many communities were adversely affected. So, we\u2019ve got to do a bunch of things.On the criminal justice side, look, we\u2019ve got to have better policing. That means body cameras, that means ending profiling, that means doing everything we can to make sure there\u2019s respect between the community and the police.And, when it comes to incarceration...(APPLAUSE)Now, if I have voted against that bill, Secretary Clinton would be here tonight and she\u2019d say, \u201cBernie Sanders voted against the ban on assault weapons. Bernie Sanders voted against the violence against women act.\u201d Those were provisions in the bill, as the Secretary just indicated. So, in that bill there was some good provisions, I have been a fierce fighter against domestic violence ever since I was mayor in Burlington.Violence against women act has protected millions of women in this country, it was in that bill. The ban on assault weapons, that\u2019s what I have fought for my whole life. It was in that bill.Now, what you are reading though is I went to the floor, as I recall, and that\u2019s what I said. I tried to get the death penalty aspects in that bill out. Secretary Clinton have a disagreement. I was then, and I am now opposed to the death penalty.(APPLAUSE)But where we are right now is having more than 2.2 million people in jail \u2014 more than any other country on earth. This is a campaign promise, at the end of my first term, we will not have more people in jail than any other country.(LAUGHTER)(APPLAUSE)I think the most important that happened to me was a combination of my church and youth minister when I was a teenager, insisting that we go in to inner-city Chicago because I lived in a suburb and have exchanges with kids in black and hispanic churches. It was also important for me to be a baby-sitter for the children of migrant workers and to learn more about their lives, and to hear Dr. King speak in Chicago when I was about 14 years old. That got me thinking about what I needed to do to try to fulfill my faith.When I was in law school, I had the opportunity to mead a visionary woman, named Mary Right Adelman, who worked with Dr. King who was the first African-American woman who passed the Mississippi bar. I asked her for a job and she said she didn\u2019t have any money. I was working my way through law school and she said if I could get a job and get myself paid, she would give me a job. So I got law students a Civil Rights Research Council Grant.The first thing she did was send me to look at South Carolina, to investigate juveniles being sent to adult jails. The second thing she did was to send me to Alabama to investigate segregated academies. So from that moment until today, I am so grateful for my experiences as a very young woman driven by my church and my experiences working for the Children\u2019s Defense Fund which have given me some insight and have lit a fire inside me to do everything I can to address systemic racism.(APPLAUSE)That is what I will try to do to deal with what I know is the racism that still stalks our country.(APPLAUSE)Senator Sanders, on a personal front, what racial blind spots do you have?He said, no, I don\u2019t get cabs in Washington, D.C. This was 20 years ago. Because he was humiliated by the fact that cabdrivers would go past him because he was black. I couldn\u2019t believe, you know, you just sit there and you say, this man did not take a cab 20 years ago in Washington, D.C. Tell you another story, I was with young people active in the Black Lives Matter movement. A young lady comes up to me and she says, you don\u2019t understand what police do in certain black communities. You don\u2019t understand the degree to which we are terrorized, and I\u2019m not just talking about the horrible shootings that we have seen, which have got to end and we\u2019ve got to hold police officers accountable, I\u2019m just talking about every day activities where police officers are bullying people.So to answer your question, I would say, and I think it\u2019s similar to what the secretary said, when you\u2019re white, you don\u2019t know what it\u2019s like to be living in a ghetto. You don\u2019t know what it\u2019s like to be poor. You don\u2019t know what it\u2019s like to be hassled when you walk down the street or you get dragged out of a car.And I believe that as a nation in the year 2016, we must be firm in making it clear. We will end institutional racism and reform a broken criminal justice system.(APPLAUSE)So how would you be more effective in tackling racial issues than President Barack Obama?(APPLAUSE)But here\u2019s what I would do. I would end \u2014 I would make sure that the Department of Justice investigated every killing of a citizen of this country when they are under apprehension from a police officer or when they are killed in police custody.I would end the militarization of local police departments.(APPLAUSE)(APPLAUSE)Secretary Clinton, in 1996, you used the term super predators to describe some young kids. Some feel like it was racial code. Was it and were you wrong to use that term?Because my whole life, to go back to what I was saying to Mr. Mcgee (ph), is, you know, really, ever since I went to work for the Children\u2019s Defense Fund, is to try to figure out ways to even the odds for people that are left out and left behind.And I know very well that we have too many kids in our country right now who are living in poverty, who are going to schools like the ones in Detroit that have mold and rodents in them. I saw that in South Carolina. It\u2019s unfortunately across America. So what we have got to do is provide more opportunities earlier in the lives of every child.That\u2019s why I believe in supporting families, early childhood education, universal pre-kindergarten, help kids be successful. And here is Flint, we\u2019ve got to do more to mitigate against the effects of lead, because too many kids are having the experiences I\u2019ve been told about, where they\u2019re falling back in school, where they are having headaches because of the lead exposure.And what that legislation ended up doing is increasing extreme poverty, the poorest people in this country have become much poorer as a result of that \u2014 really a bill that was written by Republicans. Bad bill.But if we are going to talk about the \u201990s, let\u2019s talk about 23 million new jobs, incomes went up for everybody. The median African- American income went up 33 percent at the end of the \u201990s and we lifted more people out of poverty than at any other time in recent history.So we were on the right path. More jobs, rising incomes.(APPLAUSE)(APPLAUSE)We passed NAFTA and other disastrous trade agreements which had a horrendous impact on African-Americans in particular, in Flint, in Detroit and all across this country. So when we talk about the \u201990s, you\u2019re right. A lot of good things happened, but a lot of bad things happened.In nearby Detroit, the public schools have become a national symbol of neglect and failure. That school system is $3.5 billion in debt. Officials say they could run out of money by April.I want to bring in Shoniqua Kemp. She\u2019s right here \u2014 Ms. Kemp. Her 14-year-old daughter Imani is a student in Detroit. Shoniqua is one of ten parents suing Detroit public schools \u2014 not for money, she says, but to improve conditions.She says she\u2019s currently leaning towards Senator Sanders. Her question will go to both of you, but we\u2019ll start with Senator Sanders. Ms. Kemp?Not only that \u2014 in our schools, as you\u2019ve stated, we have issues with rats, mold, no working water fountains, not to mention non- certified teachers, lack of accountability around transportation and special education, and so much more.QUESTION: With that said, our students can no longer suffer due to lack of these things, or having these dilapidated issues take place. So, my question is who\u2019s going to step up? Who\u2019s going to ensure that the policies procedures are put in place that will ensure, and bring forth a successful future for our students because my daughter cannot wait eight more years for success to take place at your hands. At the leader\u2019s hands.(APPLAUSE)And, let me be very honest with you, hard thing to say, but it is true. A great nation is judged not by how many millionaires and billionaires it has, but by how it treats the most vulnerable amongst us, and that is the children, and that is the elderly. And, do you know what?We should be ashamed of how we treat our kids and our senior citizens.(APPLAUSE)Somehow we can\u2019t make sure that there are summer programs for your children, and after school programs for your children. Somehow we cannot do what other countries around the world, is provide quality childcare and pre-K. We have got to change our national priorities, no more tax breaks for billionaires, and large corporations.We are going to invest in our children, and have the best public school system in the world.(APPLAUSE)(APPLAUSE)(APPLAUSE)(APPLAUSE) (CHEERING)(APPLAUSE)Secretary Clinton, you\u2019ve been endorsed by two of the biggest teachers\u2019 unions. There\u2019s an awful lot of great teachers in this country. It\u2019s an incredibly difficult job, one of the most difficult jobs there is but union rules often make it impossible fire bad teachers and that means disadvantaged kids are sometimes taught by the least qualified. Do you think unions protect bad teachers?A lot of what has happened and honestly it really pains me, a lot of people have blaming and scape-goating teachers because they don\u2019t want to put the money into the schools system that deserve the support that comes from the government doing it\u2019s job.You know, teachers do so much good, they are often working under most difficult circumstances. So anything that could be changed, I want them to look at it. I will be a good partner to make sure that whatever I can do as president, I will do to support the teachers of our country.So starting with the top, now I know some people think it\u2019s a radical idea, I don\u2019t. I believe that every public college and university in this country should be tuition free.(APPLAUSE)So that your child regardless of the income of your family knows that if she\u2019s studies hard, she is going to be able to go to college. And you know what else we do? We invest in child care. Right now, you\u2019ve got child-care workers making McDonald\u2019s wages, that is crazy.Secretary, I want to turn now from the state of our nation\u2019s school to the state of our nation\u2019s crumbling infrastructure, which you talked a little bit about in the beginning of this debate. But beyond the Detroit schools and Flint water crisis; pipes, roads, and bridges are in need of repair. It would take trillions of dollars to fix it all. Senator Sanders has proposed a one trillion dollar plan but yours is only a quarter of that, is your plan big enough to fix the crumbling infrastructure in this country?I want to put 250 billion dollars additional, on top of what Congress has done. That gets us to a half a billion. I want to start a National Infrastructure Bank. I want to capitalize it with 25 billion that I believe will leverage 10 times that, that\u2019s another 250 billion.So I\u2019m trying to do this in a way that will gain support and be affordable but there\u2019s no doubt, we have to do more on our roads, our bridges, our tunnels, our ports, our airports. And as we\u2019ve talked in the beginning here, under our ground, our water systems, our sewer systems. We have pipelines that are leaking and that are dangerous. We have so much work to be done and if we can put millions of peoples to work, I think my plan is a very good way to begin doing that work and get people out there doing it.We have suggested a trillion-dollar investment. Now, you know how we\u2019re gonna pay for that? I\u2019ll tell you how we\u2019re gonna pay for that. Right now, this country is losing $100 billion every single year because profitable corporations are stashing their profits in the Cayman Islands, Bermuda and in other tax havens...(APPLAUSE)... and in some cases, not paying five cents in federal income tax. I will eliminate that outrageous loophole, and we will raise $1 trillion. And by the way, not only do we rebuild our crumbling infrastructure \u2014 $1 trillion over five years creates 13 million decent-paying jobs.(APPLAUSE)The issue of climate change has been a major talking point for both of you. I wanted to bring in Sarah Bellaire, she\u2019s a student at the University of Michigan at Dearborn who says she\u2019s currently undecided.Ms. Bellaire has a question on fracking, which, for viewers, is a process of oil and gas drilling that\u2019s led to a significant increase in American energy production and jobs, but also raises serious environmental concerns.Sarah, your question is for Secretary Clinton, but you\u2019ll both be able to weigh in. Sarah?So by the time we get through all of my conditions, I do not think there will be many places in America where fracking will continue to take place. And I think that\u2019s the best approach, because right now, there places where fracking is going on that are not sufficiently regulated.So first, we\u2019ve got to regulate everything that is currently underway, and we have to have a system in place that prevents further fracking unless conditions like the ones that I just mentioned are met.(APPLAUSE)And by the way \u2014 by the way, Anderson, I\u2019m glad you raised the issue of climate change, because the media doesn\u2019t talk enough about what the scientists are telling us, and that is, if we don\u2019t get our act together...(APPLAUSE)... the planet that we\u2019re gonna leave our children may not be healthy and habitable. I have introduced the most comprehensive climate change legislation in the history of the Senate, which, among other things, calls for a tax on carbon, massive investments...(APPLAUSE)... in energy efficiency, wind, solar and other sustainable energy.(APPLAUSE)... to Secretary Clinton\u2019s point, there are a number of Democratic governors in many states who say that fracking can be done safely, and that it\u2019s helping their economies. Are they wrong?(APPLAUSE)You know \u2014 you know, one of the differences \u2014 look, Secretary Clinton \u2014 and I\u2019ve said this before, and I admit it \u2014 she has the support of all the governors \u2014 Democratic \u2014 all the Senators, all the Congressmen. I don\u2019t. I am not part of that establishment. I plead guilty.(APPLAUSE)I happen to be a member of the Environmental Committee. I have talked to scientists all over the world. And what they are telling me \u2014 if we don\u2019t get our act together, this planet could be 5 to 10 degrees warmer by the end of this century \u2014 cataclysmic problems for this planet.This is a national crisis. And I talk to scientists who tell me that fracking is doing terrible things to water systems all over this country. We have gotta be bold now. We gotta transform our energy system to energy efficiency and sustainable energy. We\u2019ve gotta do it yesterday.(APPLAUSE)Are you suggesting that she\u2019s in the pocket of the fossil fuel industry? SANDERS: No, what I am suggesting is that we have a corrupt campaign finance system. And instead of standing up to that finance system...(APPLAUSE)(LAUGHTER)(APPLAUSE)Secretary Clinton?What I am looking at is how we make the transition from where we are today to where are today to where we must be. I worked with President Obama during the four years I was secretary of state to begin to put pressure on China and India and other countries to join with us to have a global agreement which we finally got in Paris.So I am committed to and focused on how we make that transition. I\u2019ve already said we are taking away the subsidies for oil and gas, but it is important that people understand that a president can\u2019t go ordering folks around. Our system doesn\u2019t permit that. I am going to set the goals. I will push everybody as hard as I can to achieve those goals. We will make progress on clean renewable energy and create millions of jobs through that.And I just want to make one point. You know, we have our differences. And we get into vigorous debate about issues, but compare the substance of this debate with what you saw on the Republican stage last week.(APPLAUSE)(LAUGHTER)(APPLAUSE)The question the American people have to ask is, why are these people putting millions of dollars into candidates if it\u2019s not going to make a difference?(APPLAUSE)(APPLAUSE)(APPLAUSE)(COMMERCIAL BREAK)(APPLAUSE)Democrats want to know, your supporters want to know, if you\u2019re the nominee, how are you going to take him on?(APPLAUSE)So, I will look forward to engaging him because, you know, I don\u2019t think we need to make America great again. America didn\u2019t stop being great, we have to make it whole again. We have to knock down the barriers, we have to end the divisiveness, we have to unify the country.And, if I\u2019m fortunate enough to be the nominee that\u2019s exactly what I will do.(LAUGHTER)For a start, but almost \u2014 not all, but almost every poll has shown that Sanders versus Trump does a lot better than Clinton versus Trump.(APPLAUSE)(APPLAUSE)(APPLAUSE) (CHEERING)I think we are exciting working class people, young people who are prepared to stand up and demand that we have a government that represents all of us.(APPLAUSE)I am here tonight, and I\u2019m running for president. I\u2019m a United States Senator from my great state of Vermont because I believe that, because I believe morally and ethically we do not have a right to turn our backs on children in Flint, Michigan who are being poisoned, or veterans who are sleeping out on the street.(APPLAUSE)(APPLAUSE)Look, my father\u2019s family was wiped out by Hitler in the Holocaust. I know about what crazy and radical, and extremist politics mean. I learned that lesson as a tiny, tiny child when my mother would take me shopping, and we would see people working in stores who had numbers on their arms because they were in Hitler\u2019s concentration camp.I am very proud of being Jewish, and that is an essential part of who I am as a human being.(APPLAUSE)I pray for the will of God to be known that we can know it and to the best of our limited ability, try to follow it and fulfill it. I have said many times that, you know, I am a praying person, and if I haven\u2019t been during the time I was in the White House, I would have become one. Because it\u2019s very hard to imagine living under that kind of pressure without being able to fall back on prayer and on my faith.So I do pray for people in authority. I try to think about what they are going through, even when I disagree with them. Trying to find some common ground, some common understanding that perhaps can make me more empathetic. I don\u2019t always succeed. I will tell you that.So I pray on a pretty regular basis during the day, because I need that strength and I need that support. And especially when you are in the position that I\u2019m in and that Senator Sanders is in, where you are asking people to vote for you, to give you the most important job, not only in our country, but I would argue in the world.I think humility is one of the most important attributes that you bring to both that seeking and then if you\u2019re fortunate enough, to that holding of office and that\u2019s what I will try to do.(APPLAUSE)But it\u2019s not just in Flint, Michigan. We are have 29 million people who have no health insurance. We\u2019re the only major country on earth that doesn\u2019t provide paid family and medical leave. We have school systems around America that are collapsing. And yet we are the wealthiest country in the history of the world. But most people don\u2019t know that because almost all of the new incoming wealth is going to the top one percent.I believe, and with all due respect to my good friend, Secretary Clinton, that it is too late for establishment politics and establishment economics. It is too late for a corrupt campaign finance system and super-PACs that raise enormous amounts of money from special interests.We need in this country a political revolution where ordinary people stand up and reclaim the government that men and women fought and died for. Thank you.(APPLAUSE)We have barriers to education. That\u2019s why I want to start early and provide debt-free tuition, and deal with student debt so it is no longer the burden that weighs down so many young Americans. And I do want to take on the barriers of systemic racism. I may not have experienced them, but I see the results every single day.So I\u2019m asking for your support in the primary here in Michigan on Tuesday. I\u2019m asking for it, and I will do whatever I can as the Democratic nominee to run a campaign you\u2019ll be proud of.I don\u2019t intend to get into the gutter with whoever they nominate, but instead to lift our sights, to set big goals, to make it clear that America\u2019s best days can be and are ahead of us.(APPLAUSE)I want to thank the candidates, the Democratic National Committee...(APPLAUSE)... our hosts here at the Flint Cultural Center, and most of all, the people of Flint. Just two days from now, it\u2019s another Super Tuesday, when Michigan and three other states have primaries. We\u2019ll have all-day coverage.On Wednesday we\u2019ll simulcast the next Democratic presidential debate. We\u2019ll air on CNN in English, and then on Univision in Spanish. And on Thursday, CNN hosts a Republican presidential debate in Miami \u2014 the last one before the critical Florida and Ohio primaries.We\u2019ll have full analysis of tonight\u2019s debate in one hour. Right now, please stay tuned for the premiere of a brand-new CNN original series about great American presidential races. Here is The Race for the White House.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Presidential Plot Thickens", "Date": "2016-03-08", "News": "Supported byThe ConversationBut then the plot thickened. On Saturday, Cruz had massive wins in Kansas and Maine, and only narrowly lost to Trump in Kentucky and Louisiana. As of now, Cruz is closely trailing Trump in the delegate count \u2014 Trump is up 384-300. Rubio is a distant third at 151.The Democrats, on the other hand, have gotten enviably boring. At this point, the Clinton campaign\u2019s grim march to victory is looking inevitable, right?I wanted to ask your thoughts on an under-reported factoid that caught my eye this week: Sanders actually took a slightly larger percentage of Democratic votes cast on Super Tuesday than Trump took on the Republican side (39 percent versus 38 percent). They were dead even in places like Virginia and Massachusetts. Yet the media reported Super Tuesday as a humiliation for Bernie and a huge, huge win for Trump.I continue to maintain that Trumpmania is as much a press phenomenon as a popular phenomenon, and supply is in large part creating its own demand. What do you think?Here\u2019s something I always meant to ask you. As a loyal fan of your regular column, I sense that you were a bit more optimistic about some of the mainstream Republican candidates early on, but then soured on all of them. What happened?Then it turned out all the fresh faces were terrible candidates. Just take the way Marco Rubio turned into a Trump Mini-me \u2014 the man who gave the Republican campaign the new theme of undersized genitals. Geesh.You know, there\u2019s more to this story than a lack of quality opposition to Trump. The Republicans have also lost contact with their people. The degree of alienation between the party and its voters is way, way more than on the Democratic side.Imagine what the Republicans would give now for a completely qualified, mainstream leading contender, whatever the downside.But you\u2019re way better at numbers than I am. What\u2019s your bet?But if it\u2019s Trump, what then? Here\u2019s a multiple-choice quiz for you:Republicans fall in line and support Trump; the party fractures, with a big percentage overtly disavowing their nominee and staying home; a movement takes shape to start a new party or support a third-party candidate; we all wake up and say, \u201cI had the weirdest dream last night.\u201dI doubt Romney expected to move the race, but I\u2019m sure he felt it was the right thing to do to speak up publicly about what he sees as a major threat to his party and country. Perhaps it came too late, but at least he went on record with his views.So what can we expect in the coming week? We hear from Michigan today, but afterward, the primary schedule gets remarkably quiet. We\u2019ll have to content ourselves with returns from the Guam primary on Saturday. Also, I hear the District of Columbia holds its Republican caucus in Room 308 of the Capitol Hilton, if anyone shows up. Last I heard, the D.C. Republican Party membership was down to approximately eight.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Alabama Governor, Robert Bentley, Denies Having Affair With Aide", "Date": "2016-03-23", "News": "Supported byMONTGOMERY, Ala. \u2014 Gov. Robert Bentley of Alabama acknowledged Wednesday that he had made inappropriate and sexually charged remarks to one of his closest aides, but he denied an accusation that he and the woman had pursued a physical relationship.\u201cAt times in the past, have I said things that I should not have said? Absolutely, that\u2019s what I\u2019m saying today,\u201d Mr. Bentley said at a State Capitol news conference, when he said he had apologized for \u201cany conversations and behavior that was inappropriate.\u201d He insisted that he had broken no laws during his friendship and professional partnership with his senior political adviser, Rebekah Caldwell Mason, who holds such power in Alabama that Spencer Collier, a former state law enforcement secretary, on Wednesday referred to her as the \u201cde facto governor.\u201dMr. Bentley\u2019s public demonstration of remorse came nearly seven months after Dianne Bentley, to whom the Republican governor was married for 50 years, sought a divorce, and just hours after Mr. Collier, the recently ousted leader of the Alabama Law Enforcement Agency, described what he saw as a history of improper conduct between the governor and Ms. Mason. Mr. Collier said that Mr. Bentley had, in 2014, effectively acknowledged an affair, and that it appeared to be continuing as recently as last month.Mr. Bentley, 73, repeatedly signaled that he had no intention of resigning. Although the governor\u2019s personal behavior has long been a subject of speculation here in the capital, it was not clear Wednesday how his admission would affect his standing among his constituents in this socially conservative state, where he easily won a second term less than two years ago.\u201cBentley rode a white horse,\u201d said Steve Flowers, a former state legislator who is now a political columnist. \u201cThe thing that has been so novel about this is that Bentley won the governor\u2019s office and had high approval ratings because it appeared he was this First Baptist Church of Tuscaloosa deacon who looked like somebody\u2019s grandfather and, frankly, someone\u2019s great-grandfather.\u201dNow Mr. Bentley\u2019s reputation and legacy are at risk, in large part because of his communications with Ms. Mason, a political impresario who helped engineer and maintain his rise to power. In a statement that Mr. Bentley\u2019s office distributed Wednesday, Ms. Mason did not address the nature of her relationship with the governor, but said she was \u201cproud of what I have accomplished in my professional career.\u201d She accused Mr. Collier of \u201cclear, demonstrated gender bias\u201d and said, \u201cThere is no way that man would have said what he did today about another man.\u201dMs. Mason is a controversial figure here in Montgomery, and one with seemingly unrivaled influence with Mr. Bentley. She is no longer on the state\u2019s payroll \u2014 many details about her compensation are unclear \u2014 but she is a frequent presence in Mr. Bentley\u2019s suite at the Capitol.Amid Wednesday\u2019s wave of criticism and questions, the governor and Mr. Collier offered deeply divergent accounts of Mr. Bentley\u2019s relationship with Ms. Mason, who is married.Mr. Collier, who served with Mr. Bentley in the Legislature, said he first became aware of the relationship in August 2014, after a member of the governor\u2019s security detail observed \u201ca text that was sexual in nature.\u201d (The security officer, Stan Stabler, who succeeded Mr. Collier as law enforcement secretary, called that account \u201cfalse.\u201d) Within days, Mr. Collier said he heard a recording of \u201can inappropriate sexual conversation.\u201dMr. Collier said he ultimately learned that someone in Mr. Bentley\u2019s family had made the recording he heard, and he confronted the governor in August 2014, as they traveled to an event in Greenville, Ala.\u201cI told Governor Bentley that I loved him like a father and that there was nothing I wouldn\u2019t do for him, except lie to a grand jury,\u201d Mr. Collier said Wednesday, his left hand sometimes trembling. \u201cI made Governor Bentley aware of the recording that I heard. I told Governor Bentley there was no need to try and explain it for anything other than it was. It was very obvious that it was sexual in nature.\u201dMr. Bentley, Mr. Collier said, \u201csimply hung his head and asked for advice on how to get out of it.\u201d According to Mr. Collier, he warned the governor that using state resources to facilitate an affair amounted to a crime. Mr. Collier said Mr. Bentley assured him that he had violated no laws.Joseph C. Espy III, a lawyer whom Mr. Collier said represented Mr. Bentley in some personal matters, did not respond to a phone call or an email. (Mr. Bentley\u2019s campaign paid Mr. Espy\u2019s law firm nearly $25,000 last year, according to campaign finance records.)A spokesman for the Alabama attorney general declined to comment, and a spokeswoman for the United States attorney in Montgomery said she could neither confirm nor deny whether federal officials were investigating the governor.Mr. Bentley and his supporters moved swiftly to discredit Mr. Collier, whom Mr. Bentley fired after an internal review \u201cfound a number of issues, including possible misuse of state money.\u201d Mr. Collier has denied any wrongdoing. The dismissal was announced after the men clashed last month about Mr. Collier\u2019s intention to submit an affidavit related to the pending ethics case against Michael G. Hubbard, the speaker of the state House of Representatives. Mr. Collier said the governor had asked him to lie; Mr. Bentley denied doing so.Mr. Bentley, who appeared shaken when he stood before reporters on what he described as \u201ca difficult day,\u201d was similarly unequivocal as talk of potentially criminal conduct swirled: \u201cI can assure the people of Alabama that, as their governor, I have never done anything illegal.\u201dHe said that Ms. Mason had not asked him to refrain from the remarks for which he expressed contrition, but he said he had apologized to her and others.\u201cIt\u2019s not just one family,\u201d the governor said. \u201cThere have been a lot of people who have been hurt by all of this, and the entire state of Alabama has suffered during this time.\u201dBut there were some details, it seemed, that the governor wanted to remain out of public view. He would not, for instance, describe the extent, length or contents of his inappropriate contacts with Ms. Mason.Asked if he had only erred when he was being recorded, the governor replied with a single word: \u201cNo.\u201dDaniel Victor contributed reporting from New York.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Bernie Sanders Faces Tougher Terrain After a Big Week", "Date": "2016-03-29", "News": "Supported byThe 2016 RaceBernie Sanders had a great week. He won big in five Western caucuses: Washington, Alaska, Idaho, Utah and Hawaii. It was enough to whittle Hillary Clinton\u2019s pledged-delegate lead to around 230, despite her own solid win in Arizona.To get to a majority, not counting superdelegates, Mr. Sanders now needs more than 56 percent of the remaining pledged delegates.It might not look too daunting after he just won at least 70 percent of the vote in five states. But the remaining states aren\u2019t especially welcoming for him. Mrs. Clinton\u2019s delegate advantage seems likelier to grow over the rest of the contests than to shrink. The remaining states force Mr. Sanders to confront his big weaknesses: affluence, diversity, establishment-friendly areas and closed primary contests.To get a sense of how the rest of the Democratic race plays out, consider how the remaining states might vote if they follow the same demographic patterns of the first half of the primary season. The patterns include the results for all of the states where The Associated Press has reported the results by county.Our model estimates that Mrs. Clinton would win around 54 percent of the remaining delegates, not including nonstate contests like Puerto Rico. She loses in a bunch of predominantly white, working-class states where Mr. Sanders is hoping to fare well: Wisconsin, Wyoming, North Dakota, Kentucky, Oregon, Indiana and West Virginia. But she holds on in the affluent and diverse states along the coasts. Mr. Sanders will need to win these states \u2014 and probably by a comfortable margin \u2014 to overtake her delegate lead.It\u2019s important to note that this type of a model is not a prediction. It merely supposes that the rest of the campaign follows the same demographic patterns of the first half. And sometimes voters go another way. The model put Mrs. Clinton on track for a big win in Michigan, which she ultimately lost. After Michigan, the same approach predicted a close race in demographically similar Ohio, where she got a big win.Just this last week, Mr. Sanders beat the expectations of this model in all five caucus states (but underperformed by more in Arizona). There\u2019s no reason he can\u2019t do it again. But this approach does give a broad sense of what\u2019s left, and it doesn\u2019t suggest a great opportunity for Mr. Sanders.Mrs. Clinton has fared much worse in caucuses and open contests \u2014 those that allow voters who aren\u2019t registered as Democrats \u2014 than she has in primaries or closed contests.So far, she has done about nine percentage points better in primaries than in caucuses, and three points better in closed contests than in open ones.The five big wins for Mr. Sanders all came in open caucuses.There\u2019s only one open caucus left, North Dakota, and one closed caucus, Wyoming.Mr. Sanders, conversely, has fared worse in closed primaries, like Arizona and Florida. These primaries tend to exclude the independent-leaning voters who most often support Mr. Sanders. Registered Democrats also tend to be older; the young, especially young whites, are most likely to register as independents.There are a lot of closed contests left, including New York, Pennsylvania, Maryland, Connecticut, New Mexico, Delaware, Kentucky and Oregon. Mr. Sanders has not yet won a closed primary.Mr. Sanders will have the benefit of open or semi-open primaries in just California, Montana, Wisconsin, Indiana and West Virginia.Mrs. Clinton tends to do best in affluent areas. It was even true in Mr. Sanders\u2019s big wins this last week \u2014 she fared better in places like Seattle\u2019s King County and Park City\u2019s Summit County in Utah.The model estimates that Mrs. Clinton would fare 27 points better in a county where 100 percent of households made more than $100,000 a year than she would in a demographically similar county where no households were so well off. She also does better in places where the finance industry is strong.That\u2019s good news for her in the Bay Area and the Northeastern corridor \u2014 two of the most affluent regions of the country. There has already been a sneak preview of her strength there: She won decisively in Northern Virginia and the Boston metropolitan area.Mrs. Clinton fares best in areas with large numbers of Hispanic or black voters. She does better among these voters in the South than in the North, but it\u2019s nonetheless an advantage for her in California and along the Acela Corridor, where there is an above-average percentage of nonwhite voters.The model picks up on Mrs. Clinton\u2019s strength among nonwhite voters in a few ways, but the bottom line is that she has won every primary where white voters represent a below-average share of the electorate. She has won all but one county where nonwhite voters represented a majority of eligible voters in a primary \u2014 as is now the case in California as a whole.Her big win in Arizona might be particularly indicative of her likely strength in Southern California and the state\u2019s Central Valley.Mr. Sanders has fared best in areas known for supporting anti-establishment politics \u2014 going all the way back to Teddy Roosevelt, Robert La Follette and Henry Wallace.This model uses the last three major third-party candidates as a proxy for anti-establishment sentiment: John Anderson in 1980, Ross Perot in 1992 and Ralph Nader in 2000. It has another variable for the \u201cNader Democrats\u201d \u2014 the share of Nader voters in 2000 as a percentage of the total of Al Gore and Nader voters.These are very powerful predictors of Mr. Sanders\u2019s strength. Alaska, for instance, has the highest number of Nader Democrats and was the best state for Mr. Sanders outside his home state, Vermont.It bodes well for Mr. Sanders in Oregon, Montana and Wisconsin. But it won\u2019t go very far for him in California or the Northeast.One thing Mr. Sanders has going for him are the anti-Obama Democrats.Mr. Sanders has generally fared poorly in the South and Appalachia, but he has tended to do better in a surprising spot: areas where there are large numbers of the old registered Democrats who vote Republican in presidential elections, but nonetheless find themselves trapped in a Democratic primary thanks to a closed or semi-closed system.These conservative voters appear to be choosing Mr. Sanders in big numbers. You can see the traces of it in the stark increase in Mr. Sanders\u2019s support when you cross from Georgia into the Florida Panhandle, a state with a closed primary and party registration. You can see it along the borders of Oklahoma, and along the North Carolina border as well. It shows up in another way: the large numbers of voters who are voting for \u201cuncommitted\u201d or a minor candidate.It\u2019s not entirely clear whether these voters actually support Mr. Sanders. The exit polls in Oklahoma showed Mr. Sanders winning big \u2014 59 percent to 24 percent \u2014 among the large number (28 percent) of voters who wanted the next president to change to less liberal policies. That doesn\u2019t necessarily mean they don\u2019t support Mr. Sanders; perhaps they think of liberalism in cultural terms, like racial issues or guns. But it does raise doubts. Mr. Sanders won easily among the 17 percent of voters who trusted neither candidate in an international crisis.The pattern is good news for Mr. Sanders in West Virginia and Kentucky, with the model putting him over the top there, even though Mr. Sanders has lost almost all of the counties bordering these two states. Without this variable, Mrs. Clinton would be favored in both states.Mr. Sanders has the potential to win several states with more than 56 percent of the vote, like North Dakota, Wyoming, Montana \u2014 and even Oregon, South Dakota and Wisconsin. But these states are worth just 13 percent of the remaining delegates.Mrs. Clinton could easily win many of the contests along the more diverse and affluent East Coast in primaries in Connecticut, Delaware, Maryland, New Jersey, New York and the District of Columbia.Even if Mrs. Clinton doesn\u2019t fare as well as the projections suggest, Mr. Sanders is very unlikely to win by a double-digit margin. He will have to make up for those delegates elsewhere.Mr. Sanders has better opportunities to win in California, Indiana, Kentucky, New Mexico and Rhode Island. But he is not a clear favorite in these states, and may be considered an underdog in the biggest prize: California.But Mr. Sanders needs more than merely a win in California. He needs to win there by at least 20 percentage points, considering that he is unlikely to win at least 56 percent of the vote along the Acela Corridor.So far, Mr. Sanders has won only two of the 21 primaries by more than 16 points: Vermont, his home state, and neighboring New Hampshire.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Right Wing\u2019s Casting Agency, and Its Agent", "Date": "2016-03-06", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Over the last year, the Lynde and Harry Bradley Foundation, a Milwaukee group that has financed decades of research into curbing the power of public sector unions, hired three new staff members: a fund-raiser, an administrative aide and a program officer.It enlisted a recruiting outfit called Talent Market, which helps staff free-market advocacy groups, think tanks and foundations. In two of those cases, the Bradley Foundation, whose efforts Gov. Scott Walker of Wisconsin drew on, hired candidates whom Talent Market\u2019s executive director, Claire Kittle Dixon, had recommended.\u201cShe has a personal knowledge of the conservative movement and lots and lots of contacts,\u201d said Michael W. Grebe, who is stepping down as the foundation\u2019s president this year. Such is the foundation\u2019s confidence in Ms. Kittle Dixon that it asked her to assist in finding Mr. Grebe\u2019s successor.Unlike many long-established job placement services on the right and the left, which devote most of their efforts to posting ads or advising job-seekers, Talent Market is essentially a full-time recruiting operation.In the case of the Bradley Foundation, Mr. Grebe said, Ms. Kittle Dixon was involved at every step, from writing the job description to unearthing candidates and encouraging them to apply. She is, in effect, the visible hand for those who worship the invisible hand.Libertarian groups and activists backed by deep-pocketed conservative donors have been successful in recent years in pushing beyond Washington into dozens of states. They have provided the intellectual and political muscle for elected officials who have rolled back regulations, cut taxes and tried to remake public education.Perhaps most significantly, they have helped pass anti-union legislation in once heavily unionized states and embarked on well-organized campaigns to discourage workers from paying union dues and fees in liberal bastions like Washington State.\u201cAt the state level, some of these so-called think tanks are beginning to do the real organizing work against unions,\u201d said Steve Rosenthal, a former A.F.L.-C.I.O. political director who now tracks the flow of conservative money into anti-union efforts.The strategy depends on a cadre of committed recruits, which is where Ms. Kittle Dixon and Talent Market come in. The firm\u2019s reason for being, according to its website, is to ensure that the \u201cfree-market nonprofit sector has the talent it needs to defend liberty.\u201dIn this vein, Talent Market says it has helped over 160 organizations find personnel since its founding in 2009, including prominent ones like the Cato Institute, the Competitive Enterprise Institute and the Charles Koch Foundation.But it has also been active among more obscure players, ensuring a level of quality control and ideological cohesion at free-market groups across the country. In many ways, Ms. Kittle Dixon is the casting director for the so-called liberty movement.Talent Market, he said, \u201chelps take a lot of the mystery out of hiring.\u201dAfter earning a master\u2019s degree in public policy from Georgetown, she worked on talent development at the Koch Foundation in suburban Virginia, where she ran an internship program along with a fellowship known as the Koch Associate Program. She later became research director of a free-market think tank in Ohio. She has crossed paths with hundreds of libertarian wonks and activists over the years and stayed in touch with many of them.\u201cShe is a known quantity, \u2018persona grata,\u2019 \u201d said Jonathan Rick, who runs a public relations firm and met Ms. Kittle Dixon when he interviewed for the Koch Associate Program in 2006.Job-matching networks that serve a particular ideological niche have been around since at least the 1980s, when the Heritage Foundation created what became a widely trafficked database of jobs with conservative organizations and politicians. Another group called the Leadership Institute has long hosted a job bank and advised young conservatives on how to find entry- to middle-level positions.The left has created a similar infrastructure, with a variety of email lists and message boards connecting activists and operatives with prospective employers. One, called JobsthatareLEFT, started in 2002 \u201cas a way to help a few unemployed campaign staffers seek lefty jobs,\u201d according to its Google group page. It says it has shared over 20,000 positions with 25,000 members since then.Another group, called Inclusv, has helped progressives of color land jobs.Paul Oyer, a labor economist at Stanford University\u2019s Graduate School of Business, said there are two characteristics that make niche matchmaking services successful: If the niche can claim a lot of members, and if not being in the niche is a \u201cdeal breaker\u201d for those who are in it.Talent Market gives every indication of serving such a niche. To upload a r\u00e9sum\u00e9 or sign up for the site\u2019s newsletter, a candidate must first answer three questions on \u201cthe best way to solve societal problems,\u201d \u201cthe proper function of government,\u201d and the prospect\u2019s \u201cview of how markets function.\u201d (Sample option: \u201cFree markets almost always lead to the most efficient allocation of resources.\u201d)Like most of the organizations it advises, Talent Market is a nonprofit. It charges clients no fee, subsisting instead on contributions from donors, foundations and other nonprofits.It appears to be a bargain. Talent Market received at least $120,000 a year from 2011 to 2013 from DonorsTrust, a so-called donor-advised fund provider that helps wealthy people contribute anonymously to free-market causes, according to Internal Revenue Service filings. Other conservative and free-market groups, like the State Policy Network and the Vernon K. Krieble Foundation, have contributed over the years.Clients say Talent Market excels at finding hard-to-attract fund-raising staff members and at time-consuming searches for senior officials. But its greatest value may be in connecting far-flung organizations with talent they might not otherwise find.\u201cWashington, D.C., is one giant high school campus \u2014 everybody knows each other,\u201d Mr. Caldara, the Denver activist, said. \u201cBut those of us fighting for limited government in the states are spread apart. Sometimes the best person for a job is not someone in our current state.\u201dMr. Caldara said his organization recently hired a fund-raiser from the Washington area whom Talent Market brought to its attention.By contrast, Sherry Ettleson, a full-time recruiter for progressive nonprofits who may be the closest counterpart of Ms. Kittle Dixon on the left, says her efforts focus almost entirely on Washington, New York and San Francisco. Ms. Ettleson says this is because she does not have connections outside those cities, and because the network of progressive think tanks and advocacy groups is not as well developed in other regions as it is on the right.\u201cThe left was slow to that game,\u201d she said.There is almost no corner of the country where Ms. Kittle Dixon has not dispatched conservative crusaders. Since late 2014, according to its monthly newsletter, Talent Market has placed people at the Freedom Foundation in Olympia, Wash.; the Beacon Center of Tennessee in Nashville; the James Madison Institute in Tallahassee, Fla.; and the Ashbrook Center in Ashland, Ohio.Until recently, Michael Schaus lived in Colorado, where he was a freelance writer and the host of a local talk-radio show. Last autumn, he contacted Ms. Kittle Dixon, who encouraged him to pursue his interests in the policy world.Ms. Kittle Dixon, he said, alerted him whenever she came across an opening that fit his ambitions and skills. After the first interview she brokered, Ms. Kittle Dixon contacted him again to see how it had gone and whether she could refine the search further.But in this case, it was unnecessary. The Nevada Policy Research Institute offered him a job as its communications director, and he accepted, attracted by the organization\u2019s focus on taxes and education reform. The whole process lasted roughly one month.\u201cShe was good at what she does,\u201d Mr. Schaus said. \u201cI love the job. I\u2019m doing the type of stuff I like. It\u2019s been a good success.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Naked Lady Politics", "Date": "2016-03-26", "News": "Supported byCampaign StopsSince they were old enough to understand words, I\u2019ve been trying to teach my daughters the nature of permanence, as it relates to the World Wide Web. The Internet is forever, I tell them; the public is brutal, and they need to keep their clothes on whenever a camera-equipped device is around. Those spring break pictures on Facebook will be the first thing the Senate Judiciary Committee sees when it\u2019s deciding whether to approve their nomination.At least, that\u2019s what I grew up believing. After all, Miss America Vanessa Williams was forced to give up her crown in 1984 after nude photos of her appeared in Penthouse. Nudity had consequences and, for women, they weren\u2019t good ones.But now, in the worlds of politics and pop culture, boudoir shots and even sex tapes have gone from guaranteed embarrassments to occasional assets to, sometimes, barely mattering at all. Watching the events of the past few weeks unfold, I wonder if maybe I\u2019ve gotten it wrong. When is a naked picture a problem for a woman? Maybe never \u2014 so long as she\u2019s the one wielding the camera, or she looks good, and her husband\u2019s not upset.And what do those images say, exactly? Oh, right: Mr. Trump is obviously better qualified to run our country, because his wife was a professional model.In this strangest of primary seasons, women exist primarily in terms of their relationships to the men they marry or question or critique. They can either be beauties or beasts or \u201cthe love of my life.\u201d They can be \u201ccrazy\u201d or \u201closers,\u201d \u201cfat pigs\u201d or \u201cdogs.\u201d They can be mothers and daughters. They can be the currency with which you buy voters\u2019 belief in your machismo and alpha-maleness, or they can be the sand you kick in the face of a \u201cNew York bully.\u201d In every case, whether they are assets or liabilities, they are objects. In no case are they people.What\u2019s the political significance of a naked lady? When the Utah ad went public, it wasn\u2019t long before the predictable calls to leave candidates\u2019 families out of the fray were joined by charges of slut-shaming, and the insistence that a grown woman can pose as she wishes; that as long as it\u2019s her choice, it\u2019s empowering.Melania Trump might have chosen to pose for GQ, but there\u2019s nothing empowering about the way her husband\u2019s opponents have repurposed her modeling portfolio as revenge porn. Which is precisely what Mr. Trump has done with Megyn Kelly\u2019s GQ shots. Neither woman deserves to suffer for having made the choice to get in front of a camera.MY guess is that neither one will. Twenty years ago \u2014 or even as recently as 2004, when the Federal Communications Commission fined CBS $550,000 after Janet Jackson\u2019s Super Bowl halftime \u201cwardrobe malfunction\u201d \u2014 to be female and naked was to be afraid. But now, our biggest reality TV star is Kim Kardashian, a woman who spun a sex tape into gold, a woman who posts nude selfies, then twirls on her haters, while her fans come roaring to her defense, claiming that she has subverted the male gaze because she\u2019s the one creating the image and she\u2019s the one sharing the shot.When a collection of naked celebrity pictures were spirited out of the cloud, then leaked to the public in 2014, it was the hacking that shocked people, not the existence of the pictures. Not even a Disney princess like Vanessa Hudgens had her career derailed by repeated leaked nudes.The would-be first ladies will survive nudity, and mockery, but both of them have been diminished, stripped of their personhood and reduced to objects. They have been flattened into human baseball cards, to be rated and traded, compared and assessed, and their worth depends not on who they are or what they do, but on how good they look and how much their husbands love them.It\u2019s enough to make a liberal feminist, a mere spectator to the Republican debates, long for the days of Carly Fiorina. At least then the Republican primary could boast one woman who was a candidate, not just a wife and a mother, or a face and a figure \u2014 a person, instead of a thing.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Obama Steps Up U.S. Effort to Fight Abuse of Heroin and Painkillers", "Date": "2016-03-29", "News": "Supported byThe administration announced an array of new measures to expand drug treatment centers and increase the use of drugs, like naloxone, that reverse the effects of overdoses from opioids, ranging from illegal narcotics like heroin to brand-name painkillers like OxyContin and Percocet. These modest steps built on the $1.1 billion in additional funding that the White House requested this year to fight opioid addiction.But the president said that \u201cthis is still an area that\u2019s grossly underresourced.\u201dMr. Obama cast the opioid scourge as having transcended economic and social boundaries. \u201cIf there\u2019s a market for heroin in an inner city in Baltimore,\u201d the president said, \u201cit\u2019s not going to take that long before those drugs find their way to a wealthy suburb outside Baltimore.\u201dThe president listened as two fellow panelists recounted their struggles with drug addiction and a treatment process that often stigmatized them as criminals. Crystal Oertle, a 35-year-old mother of two from Ohio, described how she progressed from the recreational use of the painkiller Vicodin to OxyContin and then, finally, to heroin.\u201cThey are pretty much like heroin,\u201d she said of Vicodin and OxyContin. \u201cWhen it came to the point when I couldn\u2019t find those pills, I had to go to the street. That\u2019s how I got into using heroin after the pills.\u201dJustin Riley, 28, said he had begun experimenting with painkillers in third grade to compensate for a feeling of emotional emptiness. \u201cI used to take Benadryl to sleep through the night,\u201d he said. Mr. Riley, who has been in recovery since 2007, runs a nationwide organization that helps young people combat addiction.Treating addiction, Mr. Obama said, has been hindered because the public has long viewed opioid use as a character flaw, common to people in poor and minority communities. That has changed, he said, because opioid addiction has spread so widely.Mr. Obama again spoke about these drugs in starkly personal terms. \u201cWhen I was a kid, I was\u2014 how would I put it? \u2014 not always as responsible as I am today,\u201d Mr. Obama said to laughs. \u201cI was lucky because, for whatever reason, addiction didn\u2019t get its claws into me, with the exception of cigarettes.\u201dMr. Obama said he was not certain why he had not strayed into drug use. He referred to friends who had battled drug addiction and \u201cwere not more morally suspect than me.\u201dThe last time Mr. Obama traveled outside Washington to dramatize the scourge of opioid addiction \u2014 to West Virginia in October \u2014 his administration won praise for drawing attention to the problem but was criticized for not doing enough to combat a public health epidemic that worsened greatly during his presidency.\u201cThe only thing I would fault them for is that they waited too long to do this,\u201d said Dr. Carl R. Sullivan, the director of addiction services at the West Virginia University School of Medicine. \u201cThis has been able to idle along for a long time.\u201dDrug deaths have surged in nearly every U.S. county.In particular, Dr. Sullivan said, the national guidelines issued by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention provide a \u201ccompass point\u201d for the treatment of patients and the education of medical residents and even practicing doctors. \u201cThe situation is so dire that we had to do something,\u201d he said.Josh Earnest, the White House press secretary, denied that the administration had waited too long to address the crisis. The Affordable Care Act, he noted, provides funding for expanded treatment of mental health problems, a key cause of drug abuse. By doing so, Mr. Earnest said, the president shifted the focus from purely law enforcement to medical treatment.He said the coming presidential election had thrown a harsh spotlight on the extent of the problem. The Democratic front-runner, Hillary Clinton, after stressing that addiction was a recurring theme in her campaign swings, has proposed $7.5 billion in federal funding to help states expand treatment programs. Senator Ted Cruz, Republican of Texas, has spoken emotionally of the death of his older half sister, Miriam, from a drug overdose at 49.Opioids played a part in 28,648 deaths in the United States in 2014, a record number, according to the C.D.C., and opioid painkillers like OxyContin, Percocet and Vicodin generate nearly $2 billion a year in sales.Part of the problem for the Obama administration in combating these drugs is that the epidemic was fueled in part by doctors who prescribed the medicines indiscriminately, but regulating doctors has historically fallen to the states. Massachusetts, Vermont and Maine are among states that have moved in recent months to limit the ability of doctors to prescribe these pills. But patient and doctor groups, some funded by the pharmaceutical industry, have resisted state and federal efforts.To underscore the role of the states, Mr. Obama invited two lawmakers to join him on the trip: Senator Edward Markey, Democrat of Massachusetts, and Representative Hank Johnson, Democrat of Georgia. Mr. Markey is pushing legislation that would remove all federal caps on the ability of doctors to prescribe buprenorphine, an opioid derivative that is used to treat people addicted to opioids.\u201cComing from a state that is disproportionately impacted by this scourge,\u201d Mr. Markey said in a statement, \u201cI believe we should do as much as we can, as soon as we can, to expand treatment to those who need it most.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misspelled the surname of a recovering addict who met with President Obama. She is Crystal Oertle, not Oerle.Gardiner Harris contributed reporting from Washington.Advertisement"}

If a woman needs more than that, she may request them or buy them at her own expense at the commissary. The bill calls for eliminating the formula and providing either pads or tampons as requested.Ms. Ferreras-Copeland called the formula \u00e2\u0080\u009cridiculous,\u00e2\u0080\u009d and said that every woman had different needs. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t ration toilet paper or ask for permission for more toilet paper,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou shouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have to for these products.\u00e2\u0080\u009dThe expanded pilot program Ms. Ferreras-Copeland announced last week to install tampon and pad dispensers in 25 public middle and high schools was estimated to cost $160,000 for a year, including the cost of replenishing the supply of products, according to Ms. Ferreras-Copeland\u00e2\u0080\u0099s office.Women \u00e2\u0080\u009ccannot participate in society without some sort of menstrual product,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Jennifer Weiss-Wolf, a writer and lawyer from Maplewood, N.J., who is a leading advocate for lifting tampon taxes and providing sanitary supplies in public restrooms and schools and coined the term \u00e2\u0080\u009cmenstrual equity.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cAs a society, we have an interest in ensuring that girls don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t fall behind in school and women aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t unproductive at their jobs simply because they can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t afford these products,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said.Ms. Meng has also introduced legislation that would allow employees to use flexible spending account funds to buy feminine hygiene products.

{"Headline": "Port Authority Pledges Billions for Airport Upgrades and New Bus Terminal", "Date": "2016-03-24", "News": "Supported byThe Port Authority of New York and New Jersey voted on Thursday to spend tens of billions of dollars on transforming La Guardia Airport, enhancing Newark Liberty International Airport and building a new central bus terminal in Midtown Manhattan.\u201cWhat you witnessed today is the most important board meeting in Port Authority history,\u201d said Patrick J. Foye, the authority\u2019s executive director. Mr. Foye said he thought it represented \u201cthe single largest allocation of capital\u201d by the authority in one day.While the agency\u2019s capital spending plan already included major projects at La Guardia and Newark, it did not factor in a new bus terminal. So the decision to finance a new terminal before a final cost had been determined or before a plan or location for the facility had been approved came as something of a surprise.It reflected the friction and divided priorities to which the authority\u2019s bistate structure can lead \u2014 something captured in heated exchanges between John J. Degnan, the chairman of the board, appointed by Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey, a Republican, and Mr. Foye, appointed by Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo of New York, a Democrat.At one point, as a motion to finance construction at La Guardia was being discussed, Mr. Foye noted that no dollar amount had been attached to the new bus terminal and suggested it could cost $15 billion.Mr. Degnan said that number had been raised in a private meeting between the two men and that it was \u201cpreposterously\u201d high. He then told Mr. Foye to be quiet.\u201cThe motion has passed,\u201d he said. \u201cKeep it to yourself.\u201dThe board also approved spending $70 million for another major transportation infrastructure project: a new rail tunnel under the Hudson River to ease congestion for travelers from New Jersey. The cost of the tunnel, called the Gateway Project, will be divided between the authority and the federal government.Despite the bickering, the commitment to spend so much money on vital infrastructure was viewed positively, if a bit warily, by many transportation advocates who had long pressed for improving crumbling, outdated and generally miserable facilities.In fact, a point of agreement among the fractious board members was that all the major transit hubs under discussion were the equivalent of \u201ccircles of hell,\u201d in Mr. Degnan\u2019s words.The plan there calls for replacing multiple, disconnected terminals with one main, architecturally unified terminal.The building that houses Terminal B would be demolished and replaced with a larger structure closer to the Grand Central Parkway. It would include new terminal space, feature a new central arrivals and departures hall and link to Terminals C and D.Mr. Cuomo has also boasted about the way the redevelopment would be carried out \u2014 by establishing the largest public-private infrastructure project in the country.New York officials estimate that the cost of the project will be $4 billion, with the majority of it paid for by private firms leading the development.The vote on Thursday allows construction to begin this year.But as the authority board approved the La Guardia plan, some officials, including Mr. Degnan, said the project\u2019s true cost would actually be $5.3 billion.Mr. Degnan arrived at that figure, in part, by including the cost of work that had already been done at the airport over the past 12 years.This calculation drew the ire of Mr. Foye, who accused Mr. Degnan of playing games with the numbers and using a standard for the La Guardia project that had not been applied to other infrastructure projects.For instance, he said, a $2.3 billion renovation of a main terminal at Newark that the board approved on Thursday did not include the cost of recent renovations.But the dispute was about more than an accounting disagreement: It underscored a constant struggle between New York and New Jersey for money and primacy.It was also a not-so-subtle effort from those on the New Jersey side to encourage approval of the bus terminal but on terms they could support.They opposed an idea the board had proposed to build a new bus terminal in New Jersey, arguing that doing so would strain an already overburdened New Jersey Transit system.Some New Jersey lawmakers attended the board meeting to make their case.The current bus terminal, which opened in 1950 in Midtown Manhattan, is the second-busiest in the world \u2014 after one in Tel Aviv \u2014 with more than 66 million people passing through it annually.It is widely considered about as appealing as an open lesion.Last year, five options for replacing it were presented to the board, three of which were projected to cost at least $10 billion.None could be completed before 2027.Still, on Thursday, the board voted to approve financing a new terminal whatever the ultimate cost, even though it was unclear how the authority would pay for all the projects included in its capital budget.When a board member noted that the agency had committed to financing about 400 projects and would have to make difficult decisions about which to abandon, Mr. Degnan made it clear that Thursday\u2019s resolution on the bus terminal was binding.But he worried that the authority might be taking on too much.\u201cWhat can\u2019t happen is another project again jumping the line and putting airport modernization on the back burner,\u201d he said. \u201cA better bus terminal matters, but we have already had decades of siphoning off airport money to fund other projects, which has left New York area airports behind their competitors.\u201dNoah Remnick contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Souq, Online Retailer in Middle East, Gets a $275 Million Boost", "Date": "2016-02-29", "News": "Supported byDUBAI, United Arab Emirates \u2014 Souq.com, an online retailer based in the United Arab Emirates, said on Monday that it had raised $275 million from international investors. It was a vote of confidence for digital commerce in the Middle East, which has made little headway compared with elsewhere.Souq, the largest e-commerce company in the Middle East, was founded in 2005 on an eBay-like online auction model, but it subsequently evolved into more of an Amazon-style set-price retailer. It has been a rare success story in a region where online businesses face logistical problems, political challenges, stifling bureaucracy and regulations that vary greatly from country to country.Souq\u2019s latest round of funding included money from the New York-based investment firm Tiger Global Management, as well as from Standard Chartered Private Equity and the International Finance Corporation, which is an arm of the World Bank.Souq, which means market in Arabic, did not provide details on what the funding round meant for its overall valuation, and it has not released details on its annual sales or profit. The $275 million funding round was, however, the largest ever disclosed by a technology start-up in the Middle East and North Africa, according to Wamda, a research firm based in Dubai, the United Arab Emirates.Even after multiple fund-raising rounds, the Jabbar Internet Group \u2014 which sold Maktoob, a news site, to Yahoo for more than $150 million in 2009 \u2014 still holds a majority stake.\u201cThe start-up scene has changed so much since Souq launched over 10 years ago,\u201d Ronaldo Mouchawar, the chief executive of Souq, said in an interview, \u201cand the size and scope of this kind of funding is encouraging for entrepreneurs.\u201dMr. Mouchawar said the company would use the funds to bolster its technology, such as payment processing, and to help increase the scale of its operations by improving logistics. Souq also hopes to introduce new product categories, particularly related to beauty and fashion, and to recruit employees, he said.In particular, it will look to improve its mobile application; Mr. Mouchawar noted that 70 percent of purchases from Souq in Saudi Arabia, the Middle East\u2019s second-biggest market, were made on phones.Souq, now the largest online retailer in the Arab world, ships hundreds of thousands of products across the six countries of the Gulf Cooperation Council: Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. It also has operations in Egypt.\u201cMost local retailers \u2014 whether they will openly admit it or not \u2014 are fully aware that customers can find products cheaper online, whether locally or on global sites,\u201d said Alexandra Tohme, an independent e-commerce analyst with more than a decade of marketing experience in the region. \u201cIn some cases, even heavy items with shipping charges still generate savings of up to 50 percent compared to brick-and-mortar stores.\u201dMs. Tohme said Souq\u2019s particular success was driven by competitive prices compared with other retailers in the region, and by its reputation for reliable delivery.Several other online retailers have tried, and failed, to overcome the myriad difficulties of e-commerce in the Middle East.Barriers to trade across the region remain high and include tariffs, varying national laws and different currencies. Political instability can also be an obstacle in countries like Egypt, whose population of nearly 90 million has endured heightened levels of violence since an uprising in 2011. The high costs associated with online retail can also discourage start-ups.As a result, several major online retailers have struggled: Joob, an online travel website started by the Jabbar Internet Group, folded with little explanation a year after its introduction in 2011; the German start-up fund Rocket Internet closed Mizado, an Amazon copycat, in 2012, after just five months of operation, to concentrate on the online shoe retailer Namshi, it said. That same year, the online daily deals website LivingSocial abruptly exited the Middle East.The market\u2019s potential remains attractive, however.\u201cBy the end of the decade, two-thirds of the region will have smart devices \u2014 supercomputers in their pockets \u2014 which means increased innovation, problem-solving and purchasing power,\u201d said Christopher M. Schroeder, an American venture capitalist.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "On Trade, Angry Voters Have a Point", "Date": "2016-03-15", "News": "Supported byEconomic SceneWere the experts wrong about the benefits of trade for the American economy?The nation\u2019s working class had another opportunity to demonstrate its political clout Tuesday, as primary voters went to the polls in Illinois and Ohio, Rust Belt states that have suffered intensely from the loss of good manufacturing jobs. Last week, the insurrection handed Michigan\u2019s Democratic primary to Bernie Sanders while continuing to buoy the insurgent Republican candidacy of Donald Trump.They examined the experience of American workers after China erupted onto world markets some two decades ago. The presumed adjustment, they concluded, never happened. Or at least hasn\u2019t happened yet. Wages remain low and unemployment high in the most affected local job markets. Nationally, there is no sign of offsetting job gains elsewhere in the economy. What\u2019s more, they found that sagging wages in local labor markets exposed to Chinese competition reduced earnings by $213 per adult per year.\u201cThese results should cause us to rethink the short- and medium-run gains from trade,\u201d they argued. \u201cHaving failed to anticipate how significant the dislocations from trade might be, it is incumbent on the literature to more convincingly estimate the gains from trade, such that the case for free trade is not based on the sway of theory alone, but on a foundation of evidence that illuminates who gains, who loses, by how much, and under what conditions.\u201dStill, though trade may be good for the country over all \u2014 after netting out winners and losers \u2014 the case for globalization based on the fact that it helps expand the economic pie by 3 percent becomes much weaker when it also changes the distribution of the slices by 50 percent, Mr. Autor argued. And that is especially true when the American political system has shown no interest in compensating those on the losing side.The impact of China\u2019s great leap into the market economy \u2014 which drew hundreds of millions of impoverished peasants into the manufacturing sector, mostly making goods for export to the United States and other wealthy nations \u2014 is waning. China\u2019s wages are rising fast. Its exports and economy are slowing.The Chinese export onslaught, however, left a scar on the American working class that has not healed. That disproportionate impact suggests Washington officialdom might do well to reassess its approach to future trade liberalization. Most important, it points to reconsidering how policy makers deal with trade\u2019s distributional consequences.It doesn\u2019t mean walling off the United States from the rest of the world, but it does mean learning from the experience of other advanced nations that had a much healthier response to China\u2019s rise.Mr. Autor suggests that Americans\u2019 low savings rate was a big part of the story, coupled with foreigners\u2019 appetite for accumulating dollar assets, which helped keep American interest rates low and the dollar strong, in that way fueling a persistent trade deficit.The United States might have leaned against China\u2019s export-led strategy, they argue, perhaps by insisting more forcefully that Beijing let its currency rise as its trade surplus swelled. It might have tried to foster the cutting-edge industries of the future, as government had done so many times before, encouraging the shift from textiles to jumbo jets and from toys to semiconductors.What Washington did, instead, was hitch the nation\u2019s future to housing and finance. But Wall Street, instead of spreading prosperity, delivered the worst recession the world had seen since the 1930s. Even at best, they write, the transformation of banking and finance has \u201cproduced nothing (or exceedingly little) of value.\u201dSo where should policy makers go from here?There are no easy answers. Tearing up existing trade agreements and retreating behind high tariff barriers \u2014 as Mr. Trump, and perhaps Mr. Sanders, would have it \u2014 would be immensely unproductive. It would throw a wrench into the works of a wobbly world economy. And reneging on international treaties would vastly complicate the international coordination needed to combat climate change.But in any future trade liberalization \u2014 including the Obama administration\u2019s pending Trans-Pacific Partnership deal, if it is to go forward at all \u2014 policy makers must be much more careful about managing the costs. Mr. Autor suggests any further deals to increase trade should be gradual, to give much more time for exposed companies and their workers to retool and shift into other jobs and sectors.Perhaps most important, the new evidence from trade suggests American policy makers cannot continue to impose all the pain on the nation\u2019s blue-collar workers if they are not going to provide a stronger safety net.That might have been justified if the distributional costs of trade were indeed small and short-lived. But now that we know they are big and persistent, it looks unconscionable.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Man Accused in Anti-Islam Cartoon Attack Awaits Verdict", "Date": "2016-03-11", "News": "Supported byPHOENIX \u2014 Jurors on Friday began deliberating the fate of a Muslim convert accused of financing, training and motivating the two men who tried to attack an exhibit of anti-Islam cartoons last year in Texas. The assault was thwarted, leaving the gunmen dead after a shootout with the police.Abdul Malik Abdul Kareem, a Phoenix resident whose name was originally Decarus Thomas, is accused of transporting guns across state lines, arming the attackers and training them to use the weapons, conspiring to support Islamic extremists and lying to federal agents. Mr. Kareem, 44, who served time in prison on a drunken-driving conviction, is also charged with being a felon in possession of a firearm.On May 3, Elton Simpson, 30, and Nadir Soofi, 34, drove from Phoenix to Garland, Tex., and opened fire outside the Curtis Culwell Center, targeting an exhibit of images that lampooned the Prophet Muhammad, an event meant to denigrate Islam. The gunmen injured a security guard.Mr. Kareem was not with the attackers. Still, Joseph E. Koehler, an assistant United States attorney, said during closing statements in Federal District Court here on Friday, \u201che was the motivator, he was the bankroller, he was the trainer and an intended participant.\u201dMr. Kareem\u2019s lawyer, Daniel D. Maynard, argued that the federal government was trying to cast his client as guilty by association.\u201cWhat the government has done in this case is try to deal with your fears, the fears that we have about the unknown, about homegrown terrorism,\u201d Mr. Maynard said.Earlier this week, Mr. Kareem spent two days on the witness stand, asserting his innocence and denying any knowledge of the plans or of the cartoon exhibit. He told jurors about his past: He was born into a Baptist family in Philadelphia, his father worked as a police officer. Mr. Kareem, who owns a moving company, said he met Mr. Simpson and Mr. Soofi at Mr. Soofi\u2019s pizzeria in West Phoenix in 2011. He said the three men prayed together and attended the same mosque.Mr. Kareem converted to Islam as an early adult, changing his name in 2013, after serving time in prison. Mr. Maynard said his client had an open-door policy at his home, inviting friends over after evening prayer or taking in those who needed a place to stay.Mr. Simpson lived with Mr. Kareem for several months, but he said they fought over Mr. Simpson\u2019s use of Mr. Kareem\u2019s laptop to watch promotional videos for Al Qaeda.\u201cI did not want it in my house,\u201d Mr. Kareem told jurors, though he said he and Mr. Simpson had eventually reconciled.For three weeks, witnesses presented a contrasting image of a man who seemed at once kindhearted and angry.Sergio Martinez-Chavez, a friend of Mr. Kareem\u2019s who testified for the prosecution, described him as \u201cpushy.\u201d Mr. Kareem called repeatedly one week, he said, asking if Mr. Martinez-Chavez could take him and his friends, Mr. Soofi and Mr. Simpson, target-shooting in the desert.Another government witness, a 13-year-old boy who lived across the street from Mr. Kareem and converted to Islam because of him, remembered hearing him say that \u201cif he had to hurt a kafir\u201d \u2014 a derogatory term for a person who is not Muslim \u2014 \u201che would.\u201dA defense witness, Daniel Van Hook, a Christian friend of the defendant\u2019s, said that Mr. Kareem had at times used the term \u201ckafir\u201d in a \u201cjoking context.\u201d \u2014 Terrorism experts said that this was the first case to go to trial for an act of violence inspired or ordered by the Islamic State. The group\u2019s precise role in the attack, if any, remained unclear.Mr. Maynard acknowledged the existence of a conspiracy \u2014 but one that did not involve Mr. Kareem. \u201cSimpson and Soofi were in a conspiracy,\u201d Mr. Maynard said.Prosecutors said Mr. Kareem had bought weapons and ammunition for Mr. Simpson and Mr. Soofi. Mr. Soofi\u2019s brother, Ali, described Mr. Soofi in court as \u201cvery gullible, very easily influenced.\u201d It was Mr. Kareem, Ali Soofi said, who taught the men to assemble and care for the weapons.On Friday, Mr. Koehler said, \u201cIt\u2019s not just one thing, it\u2019s a series of things\u201d that attest to Mr. Kareem\u2019s intentions. For example, Mr. Koehler said, Mr. Kareem inquired about the amount of explosives needed to blow up a football stadium and a mall.Mr. Koehler reminded jurors of testimony from a witness who had heard Mr. Kareem saying he was so angry about the cartoon exhibit that he \u201cwanted to go there and just shoot them.\u201dBut Mr. Maynard said that prosecutors were conflating Mr. Kareem\u2019s story with that of Mr. Simpson and Mr. Soofi, whom he described as \u201cradicalized.\u201d Mr. Kareem, Mr. Maynard said, \u201cmight have been a knucklehead,\u201d but his association with the Garland attackers \u201cdoes not make him part of the conspiracy.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Killing of Italian Student, Giulio Regeni, Puts Focus on Egypt\u2019s Stability", "Date": "2016-03-18", "News": "Supported byEgyptian news media accounts, lawmakers and government officials have variously blamed an auto accident, sexual misadventure, drugs, espionage, a mystery assassin, the outlawed Muslim Brotherhood \u2014 everything, it seems, except the scenario that Washington, Rome and other European capitals think is most likely: that Mr. Regeni was abducted, gruesomely tortured and killed by an element of Egypt\u2019s own security forces.The case is still headline news in Egypt and Italy, and Western officials say the furor has crystallized their concerns about a much broader problem. They worry that escalating political repression and human rights abuses in Egypt are signs of weakness in President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi\u2019s grip on power, potentially threatening the stability of a key Middle Eastern ally.Reports of abductions, torture and brutality by Egypt\u2019s security forces have surged in recent months, prompting debates in several Western countries about how to deal with Egypt. Secretary of State John Kerry met with senior State Department officials last week to consider the issue.Egypt\u2019s human rights record has come in for considerable criticism since Mr. Sisi came to power in 2013, but things have gotten worse recently. Advocacy groups say that hundreds of people have disappeared into detention centers where torture is common, and anger over police brutality is growing. A protest erupted in one Cairo neighborhood recently after a policeman shot and killed a taxi driver over a fare.\u201cThe United States is deeply concerned about the human rights situation in Egypt,\u201d said Ned Price, a spokesman for the National Security Council.\u00a0That resolution carries only symbolic force, and most Western countries remain careful in their public criticism of Egypt, mindful that even the mildest rebuke can draw an angry reaction from a country where the West has deep strategic, economic and counterterrorism interests.\u201cWe have to try and work and thread a needle carefully,\u201d Mr. Kerry said last month.Attempts to press Egypt by putting restrictions on the $1.3 billion a year it receives in American military aid have achieved little. One State Department official said that part of the problem was that other agencies like the C.I.A. and Pentagon had not made human rights a priority in dealing with Egypt.\u201cWe\u2019re concerned about some mixed messaging coming from the U.S. government,\u201d said the official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to discuss private conversations with foreign officials. Still, the outcry over Mr. Regeni, a doctoral candidate at Cambridge University who had come to Egypt to research its labor unions, has brought a new focus to the rights problem.The nature of the injuries led many Italian officials to conclude that the Egyptian security forces were involved. They also noted some troubling coincidences. On the day the body was found, Mr. Sisi was receiving an Italian trade delegation and Alberto Manenti, Italy\u2019s foreign intelligence chief, was meeting with his Egyptian counterparts in Cairo.Western officials have puzzled over whether some element of Egypt\u2019s security apparatus purposely dumped Mr. Regeni\u2019s body on that day to send a message to Italy, or even to Mr. Sisi.The inner circle surrounding Mr. Sisi is notoriously opaque, but many analysts say they believe he operates as first among equals, a leader whose power is circumscribed by some fiercely autonomous elements of the Egyptian security services.\u201cThere are plenty of signs of disorder in the security apparatus,\u201d said Ms. Dunne of the Carnegie Endowment. \u201cAfter 2011, they were unified for a time against the Muslim Brotherhood. But now they are squabbling among themselves again.\u201dThe investigation into Mr. Regeni\u2019s death could hinge on an Italian autopsy report, not yet released, which could answer whether he was tortured over an extended period, which would point to detention by a state security agency.For now, Italian officials are relying on Egyptian cooperation. After a visit to Cairo this week by the chief prosecutor of Rome, Giuseppe Pignatone, Egypt agreed to provide Mr. Regeni\u2019s cellphone records and surveillance footage from the area where he disappeared, the Italian news agency ANSA reported.\u201cThis is not just about Regeni,\u201d Ms. Dunne said. \u201cThere\u2019s a sense the Egyptians are determined to crush a human rights community that has been there for 30 years. And if they close them down, nobody will know what\u2019s going on.\u201dMark Mazzetti contributed reporting from Washington, Gaia Pianigiani from Rome, and Nour Youssef from Cairo.Advertisement"}

Both of them also supported the Senate attempt in 2007 to revive the Equal Rights Amendment for women, which passed the House and Senate in 1972 but fell three states short of the 38 state legislatures needed for ratification.There is a basic difference between the constitutional aims of Republicans and those of Democrats.

He calls himself the \u201coutside-the-Beltway, big-time underdog\u201d (\u201cI\u2019ve never seen such a well-financed underdog,\u201d Ms. Matthews said) and dismisses Mr. Raskin as a \u201ccareer politician.\u201dWhether that approach will work in a district where politics is the local business remains to be seen. Mr. Raskin called Mr. Trone\u2019s assertion \u201ccomical,\u201d and sniffed: \u201cI can\u2019t think of two bigger insiders in the world than David Trone or Kathleen Matthews. They regularly appear at parties I\u2019ve never been invited to.\u201dThe district is no stranger to high-profile candidates. Mr. Van Hollen, now running for Senate, won in 2002 after beating Mark Shriver, a member of the Kennedy family, in the Democratic primary. The district has since been redrawn (it now stretches through two rural counties to the Pennsylvania border) but remains heavily Democratic, so the winner of the April 26 primary is all but certain to join the House of Representatives.In the meantime, the crowded field \u2014 which also includes two other state lawmakers, a nonprofit executive and a former biotech executive who once ran for Congress in Indiana \u2014 is testing friendships here.\u201cI\u2019ve got six good friends running!\u201d exclaimed Ralph Neas, who has led national civil rights and health care organizations and once ran for the seat himself \u2014 and used to work with Mr. Jawando\u2019s wife. He made a round of polite calls to say he backs Mr. Raskin. Mr. Jawando shrugged it off.\u201cI think he was conflicted,\u201d Mr. Jawando said. \u201cAnd you know what confirmed it for me? A few days later, I got a contribution from him.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Oakland District at Heart of Drive to Transform Urban Schools", "Date": "2016-03-04", "News": "Supported byOAKLAND, Calif. \u2014 The 70 teachers who showed up to a school board meeting here recently in matching green and black T-shirts paraded in a circle, chanting, \u201cCharter schools are not public schools!\u201d and accusing the superintendent of doing the bidding of \u201ca corporate oligarchy.\u201dThe superintendent, Antwan Wilson, who is an imposing 6-foot-4, favors crisp suits and Kangol caps and peers intensely through wire-rimmed glasses, has become accustomed to confrontation since he arrived in this activist community from Denver two years ago. One board meeting last fall reached such a fever pitch that police officers moved in to control the crowd.Mr. Wilson is facing a rebellion by teachers and some parents against his plan to allow families to use a single form to apply to any of the city\u2019s 86 district-run schools or 44 charter campuses, all of which are competing for a shrinking number of students.How he fares may say a great deal not only about Oakland, but also about this moment in the drive to transform urban school districts. Many of them have become rivalrous amalgams of traditional public schools and charters, which are publicly funded but privately operated and have been promoted by education philanthropists.Mr. Wilson is trying to bring the traditional schools into closer coordination with the charters. \u201cIf he gets it right, it\u2019s a model for moving past the polarized sense of reform that we have right now,\u201d said Robert C. Pianta, dean of the Curry School of Education at the University of Virginia.But Mr. Wilson has emerged as a lightning rod partly because he is one of a cadre of superintendents who have been trained in an academy financed by the Eli and Edythe Broad Foundation. Like Bill Gates and Mark Zuckerberg, Mr. Broad, a Los Angeles billionaire who made his fortune in real estate and insurance, is one of a group of businessmen with grand ambitions to remake public education.Unique among the education philanthropists, his foundation has also contributed more than $60 million over 15 years to a nonprofit that trains superintendents and administrators, convinced that they are key to transforming urban school systems.When Mr. Broad first announced the initiative in 2001, he noted that the average urban schools leader lasted just over two years and had little preparation in finances or management.Regardless of training, any leader of a large school district faces daunting challenges. Superintendents \u201cdeal with a very unusual stew of people who are often divided by race and language and income and religion,\u201d said Michael Casserly, executive director of the Council of Great City Schools, a coalition of urban districts where the average chief now lasts just over three years. Those diverse groups, he said, are \u201call fighting over the one thing that they care most passionately about: their children.\u201dBroad-trained superintendents currently run districts in two dozen communities, including Boston, Broward County, Fla., and Philadelphia. They have lasted an average of four and three-quarter years, delivering incremental academic progress at best. Like others in the field, they have run up against the complexities of trying to improve schools bedeviled by poverty, racial disparities, unequal funding and contentious local politics.Some prominent academy alumni have resigned after tumultuous terms. Mike Miles, the Dallas schools superintendent, quit last June after just three years, during which he battled teachers over new evaluation criteria and performance-based pay.Still, Mr. Broad said his money is well spent. \u201cWhen I look at how many students are educated in public school systems where our alumni are and have worked,\u201d he wrote in an email, \u201cthere is no question that this has been a worthwhile investment.\u201dOakland is the kind of place where philanthropists hope to make a difference. Here, across the Bay Bridge from San Francisco, close to three-quarters of the 37,000 students in district-run schools come from low-income families. About 30 percent of the students are African-Americans, and more than 40 percent are Latino.In 2003, the state appointed the first of a string of Broad-trained administrators to run the district, free of local school board authority. Randolph Ward, who was then a state administrator of a troubled district in Compton, near Los Angeles, arrived as Oakland was embarking on an initiative to open a series of small public schools of 250 to 600 students apiece, depending on grade levels \u2014 several hundred fewer than at typical campuses.During his time here, Mr. Ward opened two dozen small schools but also closed 14 schools. New charter schools were also opening, cutting into enrollment at district schools.Mr. Ward was succeeded briefly by two other Broad alumni, Kimberly Statham and Vincent Matthews. All three declined to comment for this article. Meanwhile, the district is still paying back its debt.The Broad-trained superintendents \u2014 along with other non-Broad state-appointed administrators \u2014 had modest success in raising student achievement. Between 2004 and 2010, scores on standardized reading and math tests grew more than in any other California district with population similar in size.Still, less than a quarter of students met standards on tests last spring, below state averages. At the charter schools, by contrast, about a third met math standards and close to 40 percent met reading standards \u2014 although the charters educate fewer students with disabilities, an element that can depress test score averages.Mr. Wilson arrived as the first Broad-trained superintendent to be hired by a re-empowered and elected school board. It voted for him unanimously, attracted by his record in Denver. There, he had been an assistant superintendent and worked with several struggling schools.During Mr. Wilson\u2019s tenure, Denver \u2014 also led by a Broad-trained superintendent \u2014 combined charters and more traditional schools in one enrollment system, as Mr. Wilson now proposes in Oakland.Mr. Wilson, who is African-American, describes growing up poor and being raised by a single mother and said he entered education because of a commitment to social justice. He said he had a \u201cvisceral reaction\u201d when he heard arguments about children in poverty \u201cand how we need to fix that first before we can educate them. I am thinking that it\u2019s actually educating them that gives them a chance to fix some poverty.\u201dBy the time he arrived in Oakland, residents were frustrated by a history of financial mismanagement and persistently low test scores and graduation rates. Many educators in district schools felt as if they were fighting for their professional lives as charters took more and more students \u2014 and public funding \u2014 away.Today, charters account for about a quarter of public school enrollment in the city, while the combined population of students in Oakland\u2019s district and charter schools has declined by about 13 percent since 2000.While the teachers\u2019 union and some parent groups worry that district-run public schools will ultimately be eviscerated by competition from charters, other parents are voting with their feet, sending their children to the newer schools.Kenetta Jackson, a housing administrator and a mother of two, decided the local school in her East Oakland neighborhood was \u201cnot up to my personal standards.\u201d Her daughter, now 16, and son, 13, have attended charter schools in the Aspire Public Schools network since they were in kindergarten.Ms. Jackson said she did not understand the debates about the merits of charter schools. \u201cIt\u2019s a lot of politics beyond my reach,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m more concerned about my children\u2019s education. I personally think that Aspire came and saved Oakland public schools because if they didn\u2019t come, I would be paying an arm and a leg for my kids to go to some private school somewhere, and who can afford that?\u201dFor his part, Mr. Wilson says he is neither for nor against charters. \u201cI want effective schools,\u201d he said in an interview in his offices in downtown Oakland.Since he arrived, Mr. Wilson has focused on sending more tax dollars away from the central office and directly to schools, and he negotiated a contract giving teachers a 14 percent raise, their largest in 15 years, although Oakland teachers are still paid less on average than educators in surrounding counties. Mr. Wilson is also overhauling five of the city\u2019s most troubled campuses, moving principals and introducing new academic and enrichment programs.He is working with both district schools and charter leaders to negotiate an agreement to meet the same standards for academics, discipline and enrollment criteria.Although he retains a solid bloc of support on the board, some members question whether he is pushing too hard and overriding community input. \u201cYou can\u2019t change overnight,\u201d said Roseann Torres, a board member. \u201cDoes he understand that? I hope so. I know he feels a deep sense of urgency.\u201dTeachers, parents and other activists regularly turn out at board meetings to attack him. Take the furor over a plan he introduced last fall to help more students with disabilities enter mainstream classrooms.At a meeting in October, teachers, students and parents lined up before a microphone, warning that the proposals did not provide enough funds for teachers\u2019 aides and would lead to oversize classes, prompting an exodus of more students into charters.At one point, the anger at Mr. Wilson boiled over and police officers helped quell the unrest. Yvette Felarca, a local activist, denounced Mr. Wilson, saying he was undermining special education \u201cto make the charter schools more competitive with a degraded public school system.\u201d\u201cWhen Eli Broad trained Antwan Wilson,\u201d she shouted, \u201che trained him to come in here and privatize the schools!\u201dA few weeks ago, at another board meeting, teachers protested the proposal to unify district schools and charters under one enrollment process.Mr. Wilson says that a single application form, where parents rank their choices among all schools and students are assigned through a computer algorithm, will reduce the ability of well-connected parents to place their children in the most desirable schools and force charters to be more open about how they admit students. Similar systems have been put in place in Washington and New Orleans and are being considered in Boston.Opponents fear the proposal would simply hasten an exit of more students from district schools to charters. On a recent Sunday, Kim Davis, co-founder of a new parent group, explained her concerns to 19 people crowded into the living room of a fellow parent. If district schools are diminished, \u201cteachers will be laid off, students displaced, and schools will close,\u201d Ms. Davis warned, \u201cwhich just adds to the downward spiral of the district as a whole.\u201dThe school board is to vote on the common enrollment plan in June, while the special education plan is already going ahead.Mr. Wilson said he sympathized with some of the anger directed at him. \u201cIt\u2019s \u2018you\u2019re the superintendent of Oakland schools and a power structure that has not served us well, in many cases, for decades,\u2019\u201d he said.But he scoffed at allegations that he is a puppet of the Broad Foundation. \u201cPeople can connect all kinds of dots,\u201d he said, adding that \u201cno Broad agenda has ever been shared with me.\u201dThe foundation has given to the school district in other ways: it has granted about $6 million for staff development and other programs over the last decade. The Broad Center, which runs the superintendents\u2019 academy, has subsidized the salaries of at least 10 ex-business managers who moved into administrative jobs at the district office.But it is the leadership turnover that has left teachers wary. \u201cIt\u2019s just a different face at the top,\u201d said Leona Kwon, who teaches ethnic studies at Castlemont High School. \u201cI have not personally experienced a significant increase of support or resources at our school, so I\u2019m skeptical that that\u2019s ever going to happen.\u201dSome educators give their schools chief high marks for his attention to detail. At Frick Middle, one of five previously struggling schools that the district is trying to overhaul, Ruby Detie, the administrator appointed to lead the changes, recalled that after she told Mr. Wilson that a mouse had run over the foot of a teacher interviewing for a job, an exterminator appeared the next day.After observing several classrooms at Acorn Woodland Elementary recently, Mr. Wilson pulled aside the principal, Leroy Gaines, to praise two fourth-grade teachers for how often they invited students to hash out problems aloud. But in bilingual kindergarten and first-grade classes, Mr. Wilson told the principal he was concerned that the teachers were speaking too much during lessons.\u201cI was struggling to really see the degree to which the students were really doing the thinking,\u201d Mr. Wilson said.At other schools, some teachers point to missteps. At Fremont High, another school being revamped, some teachers complain that Mr. Wilson replaced a bilingual principal with a leader who does not speak Spanish, though close to 60 percent of the students are Hispanic. The school redevelopment \u201cfeels almost like a takeover,\u201d said Jasmene Miranda, a graduate of the high school who is now a media teacher there.Mr. Wilson said that he has appointed \u201cthe best possible leaders.\u201dHe said he understood some of the community criticism. \u201cI think that is just, \u2018Hey we\u2019re really concerned this guy might really want to sell the farm,\u2019 \u201c he said.\u201cWell, I don\u2019t,\u201d he added. \u201cI do want to improve it, though.\u201dSarah Cohen contributed reporting from New York.

{"Headline": "At Trump University, Students Recall Pressure to Give Positive Reviews", "Date": "2016-03-11", "News": "Supported byRobert Guillo gave a glowing evaluation to his instructor at Trump University because, he said, the teacher pleaded for the best possible score, warning that without it, \u201cMr. Trump might not invite me back to teach again.\u201dJeffrey Tufenkian offered excellent ratings because his Trump University-assigned mentor refused to leave the room until he did so, standing \u201cright in front of me\u201d as he filled out the evaluation form, he said.John Brown tried to give his Trump University teacher a poor review \u2014 but said he was talked out of it by employees of the program, who called him three times, hounding him to raise his original scores.\u201cTired of the continuing phone calls,\u201d he later testified, \u201cI finally gave in.\u201d His dismal marks changed to top scores, Mr. Brown said.But hundreds of pages of legal documents, as well as interviews with former students and instructors, suggest the surveys themselves were a central component of a business model that, according to lawsuits and investigators, deceived consumers into handing over thousands of dollars with tantalizing promises of riches.Interviews and documents show that employees of Trump University at times applied pressure on students to offer favorable reviews, instructed them to fill out the forms in order to obtain their graduation certificates, and ignored standard practices used to ensure that the surveys were filled out objectively.\u201cIt\u2019s absolutely a con,\u201d said Mr. Guillo, who spent $36,000 on Trump University classes and later requested a refund. \u201cThe role of the evaluations were a defense against any legal actions. They anticipated those actions.\u201dIn an interview, a lawyer for Mr. Trump, Daniel M. Petrocelli, said the experience of students who felt manipulated \u201cis not representative of what happened across the board.\u201d\u201cFolks were not coerced,\u201d he said of the positive evaluations. \u201cIt\u2019s completely implausible to suggest that the 10,000 reviews from the students and their guests were the result of pressure or coercion. They gave overwhelmingly positive reviews because they were being honest about their assessment.\u201dThough the business no longer operates, Mr. Trump has vowed to bring it back, giving it to his children to run if he is elected president.As he campaigns across the country boasting about the Trump University success story, he and his lawyers have deployed the evaluations to try to undercut the claims of former students who say they regret paying for the courses, posting their reviews online and, in one instance, waving them in front of a camera.In court papers, a lawyer for Mr. Trump argued that another student suing the university \u201cwas either dishonest in his evaluations of Trump University, or the allegations in the complaint are false.\u201dBy all accounts, student evaluations held a crucial place inside Trump University, where students signed up for real estate training programs with escalating costs that promised to teach the mogul\u2019s techniques and wisdom. At free 90-minute introductory sessions, Trump University representatives marketed three-day workshops starting at $995; at those, more intensive programs were pitched, like \u201cTrump Gold Elite,\u201d whose price reached $35,000.At the conclusion of every program, teachers instructed attendees to complete surveys, rating the experience on a scale of 1 to 5. But, in what academics and experts said were unusual practices, Trump University did not explicitly offer students anonymity on the forms, often asked them to complete the documents in the presence of instructors and, according to internal Trump University documents made public in litigation, asked students to submit the surveys in exchange for their graduation certificates.\u201cDoes the word coercion come to mind?\u201d asked Howard E. Haller, a former Trump University consultant who has worked in the education world for decades. In normal academic settings, he said, \u201cNo one knows if you even filled it out. The professor sure doesn\u2019t know.\u201dLawyers for Mr. Trump said students could elect not to put their names on the surveys, as some did. But they said the documents did not specify that doing so was an option.Most evaluations, the lawyers added, were handed out by staff members and completed in large classrooms where it was not possible for a teacher to influence the outcome.Tad Lignell, a mentor in the more personalized, $35,000 program, said that a number of his students achieved financial success from the lessons he had taught them.But he conceded that the evaluation system made it uncomfortable for students to register their disapproval.Assigned to demonstrate how to buy and sell real estate in places such as Las Vegas, Mr. Lignell routinely asked students to fill out the evaluations in front of him at restaurants or coffee shops, he said in an interview.At that moment, he said, vulnerable students still needed and expected his guidance. \u201c\u00a0\u2018I want this guy to be my friend, I need his help,\u2019\u00a0\u201d he said, summing up their mind-set as they filled out the forms.Virtually all his students, he said, gave him the top rating of 5. Had they not, his income ($5,500 per student, and later $4,500) could have been in jeopardy.He said that Trump University managers made clear that teachers with low ratings would be passed over in favor of those with high scores. \u201cThat puts an emphasis on getting 5,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you wanted more students, you knew you needed those.\u201d(Mr. Lignell said that Trump University had failed to pay him for several students; the company\u2019s lawyer did not comment on the claim. \u201cIf Trump wins the presidency,\u201d Mr. Lignell said, \u201cI\u2019ve got a president who owes me $50,000.\u201d)Mr. Tufenkian, who enrolled in the $35,000 \u201cTrump Gold Elite\u201d program with his wife, Sona, to jump-start a career in real estate, said his mentor was adamant that he needed all 5s on his evaluation.\u201cHe even said something like, \u2018I won\u2019t leave until you give me all 5s,\u2019\u00a0\u201d recalled Mr. Tufenkian, who lives in Oregon. \u201cWhen it was time to fill the evaluation out, he put it in front of me \u2014 right between the two of us on the table \u2014 and reiterated that he expected all 5s while he watched me.\u201dMr. Tufenkian, who had just finished a three-day visit with his mentor, said he obliged because the program was supposed to be the start of a productive yearlong relationship. \u201cAm I supposed to upset the guy who\u2019s supposed to be helping me be successful?\u201dNot every student felt compelled. In court filings, lawyers for Mr. Trump introduced the testimony of students such as Amy Hinderer, who participated in the \u201cTrump Gold Elite\u201d program.\u201cEvery rating I gave my mentor was always positive, and I still agree with what I said to this day,\u201d she wrote.Mr. Trump has dismissed the criticism that Trump University\u2019s evaluation system encouraged positive reviews. Asked about the lack of anonymity, he said under oath in a January deposition, \u201cI think it\u2019s much better when a student puts their name on it.\u201d Without names, he said, \u201cthey don\u2019t mean anything, actually.\u201dPressed on whether students might fear repercussions, Mr. Trump rejected the notion. \u201cOnly a lawyer could think of that,\u201d Mr. Trump said, continuing, \u201cYou mean that\u2019s why they said such great things about the school?\u201dHe added: \u201cI think they meant it was very good. Until they found out they could get their money back.\u201dBut experts said such practices were designed to influence the evaluations.\u201cPeople don\u2019t want a fight. People don\u2019t want to be mean. People want to be nonconfrontational,\u201d said John T. Reed, who was hired as a potential paid expert witness for the plaintiffs in one of the Trump lawsuits, but has no current role in the cases. \u201cSo they write a seminar evaluation, and hand it in, face-to-face.\u201d\u201cThat,\u201d Mr. Reed added, \u201cis where you get your 98 percent.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Democrats Turn to Hillary Clinton After Flirting With Bernie Sanders", "Date": "2016-03-01", "News": "Supported byThe time had come, several said, to end their romance with Bernie Sanders and settle down with Mrs. Clinton.\u201cBernie Sanders\u2019s odds of getting the nomination are maybe not that great,\u201d said Mitchell Westall, 19, of Suffolk, Va., who added that he had been intrigued by the Vermont senator\u2019s vision. \u201cSo I\u2019m looking at the other Democrat.\u201dMrs. Clinton, the former first lady, senator and secretary of state, is not used to being \u201cthe other Democrat.\u201d But as voters cast ballots Tuesday in 11 states that could give her a prohibitive lead in the race for the party\u2019s presidential nomination, she seemed to be enjoying something of a homecoming: After eyeing, enjoying and encouraging Mr. Sanders\u2019s insurgency for months, Democrats seemed ready to restore to Mrs. Clinton and her candidacy the air of inevitability with which she began her campaign in April.Across the country, from the crucial swing state of Virginia to deeper-blue Minnesota, from the Sanders strongholds in New England to the Clinton redoubts of the South, many Democratic voters said that despite being aware, and sometimes wary, of Mrs. Clinton\u2019s trust issues, they were more than ready to support her. Often, they said they were swayed as much by the arguments of Mrs. Clinton\u2019s most persuasive surrogates \u2014 delegate math, and \u201cFear of a Trump Presidency\u201d \u2014 as by the candidate herself.Seeing Donald J. Trump as an existential threat to American values, many Democrats said in interviews that they were ready to eschew the dreamy Sanders revolution for the heavy artillery of Mrs. Clinton and her battle-tested campaign machine.\u201cIf this country gets a Republican, we are in big trouble, especially with Trump,\u201d Flor Giraldo, 59, an unemployed emergency room technician, said Tuesday outside of a polling place in Chelsea, Mass. \u201cIf he gets chosen, this will be an impossible country, and I think Hillary is going to save us.\u201dIn the Boston neighborhood of West Roxbury, where Mayor Martin J. Walsh and former President Bill Clinton campaigned for Mrs. Clinton on Tuesday morning, her supporters acknowledged grappling with whether they could trust Mrs. Clinton and worrying that something explosive, and destructive to her candidacy, could still come to light.\u201cI hope there\u2019s nothing in those speeches that she made,\u201d said Adrienne Vaughan, an immigration lawyer, referring to Mrs. Clinton\u2019s speeches to Goldman Sachs and other financial firms, for which she was paid handsomely but has not released transcripts.Similar concerns echoed in Decatur, Ga., where Dana Calleja, 47, said she had voted for Mrs. Clinton while admitting that she had reservations. \u201cI wish there weren\u2019t all of the questions around the emails and Benghazi,\u201d Ms. Calleja said, \u201cbut it all came down to qualifications.\u201dIn dozens of interviews, voters said their desire for an experienced candidate who would be favored to win in November had played a greater role in their decisions than enthusiasm for Mrs. Clinton.\u201cI don\u2019t vote with my emotions,\u201d said Bridget Coughlan Hermer, 54, a teacher and Clinton supporter from Madison Lake, Minn. \u201cI vote with my head.\u201dThrough such a pragmatic frame, Ms. Hermer saw a silver lining to Mrs. Clinton\u2019s ties to Wall Street, which Mr. Sanders has assailed as emblematic of a rigged campaign finance system: \u201cShe knows how to earn money and keep her campaign running,\u201d Ms. Hermer said.One thing nearly all of Mrs. Clinton\u2019s supporters agree on is that her r\u00e9sum\u00e9 is without compare in the primary contest.In Austin, Tex., Donald Goertz, 76, a former classics teacher, said he had voted for Mrs. Clinton because \u201cI can\u2019t imagine anybody more knowledgeable than Hillary.\u201d But he said he had to fight the tug of Mr. Sanders\u2019s message: \u201cI like his populism.\u201dAnd when his wife, Donna Bryant Goertz, 76, a founder of Austin\u2019s oldest Montessori school, professed her affection for Mrs. Clinton, it was in the form of tough love: \u201cI love Hillary,\u201d she said. \u201cI think what she needs is a strong dose of Bernie.

{"Headline": "Colombia\u2019s Second-Largest Rebel Group Joins Peace Talks With Government", "Date": "2016-03-30", "News": "Supported byBOGOT\u00c1, Colombia \u2014 The National Liberation Army, Colombia\u2019s second-largest rebel group, said Wednesday that it would begin negotiations with the government, strengthening hopes that the end of a 50-year rebellion in Colombia could be at hand.In a joint news conference in the Venezuelan capital, Caracas, Colombian rebel and government leaders said the two sides would begin talks in Ecuador. While the details of what might eventually be decided were vague, the leaders said they sought to \u201cend the armed conflict and to agree on changes that seek a peaceful and equal Colombia.\u201dThe Colombian conflict is Latin America\u2019s longest-running war, having taken the lives of an estimated 220,000 people and displaced more than five million people.Much like the FARC, the E.L.N. was founded in the 1960s and financed itself through kidnappings and taxes on the lucrative cocaine trade. Yet recent years of clashes with the government have reduced the ranks of both groups: The E.L.N. could have as few as 1,500 fighters, while the FARC is estimated to be down to 7,000.On Wednesday, President Juan Manuel Santos of Colombia, who has staked his presidency on signing a peace deal with the rebels, asked the public to join him in supporting the talks. He said that while the government had spent years trying to defeat the E.L.N., the time had come to negotiate directly with them, much as with the FARC.\u201cJust as we have fought the E.L.N. in the battlefield, we believe that they can and must play a role in the peace process,\u201d Mr. Santos said.Opponents of the negotiations countered with skepticism on Wednesday.Federico Hoyos, a conservative Colombian legislator who has criticized the talks with the FARC, said he believed that members of the E.L.N. would drag out negotiations for years in an effort to escape prosecution. Fighters who had committed war crimes, he said, might eventually try to enter the political realm without facing justice.\u201cThe challenge is not to repeat the errors we had with the FARC,\u201d Mr. Hoyos said, adding that the government had not pursued a hard enough bargain.Wednesday\u2019s announcement is likely to give new momentum to FARC and government negotiators who have spent the last three years in talks in Havana but missed what was meant to be the final deadline for a deal on March 23. The talks are set to continue, and negotiators say the agreement could come in late spring.The FARC negotiations could offer a preview of an eventual accord with the E.L.N.So far, negotiators in Havana have agreed to a transition that would reduce sentences for those who admit to crimes and require the guerrillas to lay down their arms. But many of the details, like when disarmament would take place and who would collect the weapons, continue to bedevil negotiators.Carlos Velandia, a former E.L.N. fighter who demobilized in 2004, said the group\u2019s participation removed the last stumbling block to ending the rebellion.\u201cIt was now or never,\u201d he said. \u201cTalks with the E.L.N. was the factor that was lacking to get a complete peace deal. With the arrival of the E.L.N. to the peace process, the war is going to end.\u201dSusan Abad contributed reporting from Bogot\u00e1, and Patricia Torres from Caracas, Venezuela.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Centers to Treat Eating Disorders Are Growing, and Raising Concerns", "Date": "2016-03-14", "News": "Supported byTheir websites show peaceful scenes \u2014 young women relaxing by the ocean or caring for horses in emerald pastures \u2014 and boast of their chefs and other amenities.One center sends out invitations to a reception with cocktails and hors d\u2019oeuvres. Another offers doctors and therapists all-expense-paid trips to visit and experience their offerings, including yoga classes. Several employ staff who call mental health professionals, saying they would love to have lunch.The marketing efforts by these for-profit residential care centers are aimed at patients with eating disorders and the clinicians who treat them. The programs have proliferated in recent years, with some companies expanding across the country.The rapid growth of the industry \u2014 there are more than 75 centers, compared with 22 a decade ago, according to one count \u2014 has been propelled by the Affordable Care Act and other changes in health insurance laws that have increased coverage for mental disorders, as well as by investments from private equity firms.But the advertising and the profusion of centers, which typically cost $1,000 a day but can run much higher, is raising concerns among some eating disorders experts, who worry that some programs may be taking advantage of vulnerable patients and their families.In the companies\u2019 rush to expand, they argue, quality of treatment may be sacrificed for profit. And they question whether the spalike atmosphere of some programs is so comfortable that it fosters dependency.\u201cBut it\u2019s a slippery slope,\u201d she said. \u201cMoney can cloud your view.\u201dMany eating disorders specialists agree that some patients require the supervision of residential programs and benefit from the treatment. But studies showing the programs\u2019 effectiveness are scant, Dr. Guarda and other experts said. The methods of the handful of studies that exist have been criticized.The quality and form of treatment varies widely across centers, and in some cases includes approaches \u2014 equine therapy, for example, or \u201cfaith-based\u201d treatment \u2014 with little or no scientific evidence behind them. Some programs have full-time psychiatrists and medical doctors on staff, but others lack the expertise to handle emergencies or treat patients with coexisting medical or psychiatric problems.The perks offered to outside clinicians who might refer patients, the experts say, include free trips, restaurant meals, educational seminars and small gifts like pens and key chains dispensed at professional meetings. Critics liken them to pharmaceutical industry tactics that led to laws and policies requiring financial disclosure, though on a smaller scale. Studies had shown that even small gifts from drug companies, like free medication samples, affected doctors\u2019 prescription practices.\u201cThe effect of these clinician inducements, which are aimed at building a program\u2019s patient referral base, may not be fully recognized by the professionals they target,\u201d wrote Dr. Attia and her colleagues, who included Dr. Guarda.Several industry representatives said that while they had not seen the journal article, they agreed that more data on patient outcomes and stricter standards were needed. But, they said, the trips and seminars offered to clinicians were primarily educational. \u201cI don\u2019t think anyone in the eating disorders world is giving out swimming pools and trips to Europe and things like that,\u201d Dr. Bunnell said.Jillian Lampert, president of the Residential Eating Disorders Consortium, a group that represents about 85 percent of the centers, said, \u201cHealth care\u2019s always been a business,\u201d adding that quality and profit were not mutually exclusive. If there are concerns, she said, \u201cwe are incredibly open to having those conversations.\u201dEating disorders are among the most difficult mental illnesses to treat.Anorexia, in particular, has stymied many of psychiatry\u2019s best treatment efforts. The illness has the highest mortality rate of any mental disorder, with patients dying from the medical complications of starvation or from suicide. And patients often resist treatments that make them feel uncomfortable.The most severely ill patients \u2014 the prognosis is grimmer the longer someone has anorexia, studies suggest \u2014 require hospital treatment just to stay alive. But even after being stabilized, many patients need continual supervision for a time to regain weight and learn new behavior. The length of stay in residential centers ranges from two weeks to a year. A 2006 study found that the average stay was 83 days.In the past, health insurance companies placed strict limits on coverage for eating disorders, treating them differently from other medical illnesses. Few insurers were willing to pay for 24-hour care after a patient was out of immediate danger.But the passage of the Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act in 2008 and the Affordable Care Act two years later mandated equal treatment. Lawsuits brought by the families of patients who were denied coverage added to the pressure on insurers. In 2012, a federal appeals court ruled that health plans must cover residential treatment for anorexia under California\u2019s parity law. The higher reimbursement rates offered some relief to families, who had often mortgaged their houses or drained their savings to pay for critically needed care.As the industry has expanded, larger centers have acquired smaller ones and some programs, flush with private equity investments, have expanded across the country.For example, Monte Nido, a treatment program founded by Carolyn Costin, a former teacher who recovered from an eating disorder, began with a center in Malibu.\u201cI believe that the Monte Nido\u2019s [sic] approach to eating disorder treatment is what you and others like you have been waiting for,\u201d Ms. Costin wrote in a letter to potential patients on the company\u2019s website, which includes images of beaches, mountains and the Boston skyline on its home page.With a need to fill more beds, marketers for some centers make cold calls to psychiatrists, psychotherapists, medical doctors and others who treat eating disorders, offering to inform them about a program\u2019s advantages and inviting them to visit.Craig Johnson, a well-known eating disorders specialist, joined the company in 2010 and has seen it through its expansion to 24 treatment programs in seven states, including three residential centers. He said when therapists visit, the focus is education, not entertainment. \u201cWe\u2019re delivering lectures,\u201d Dr. Johnson said.Some therapists see the offer of free trips as a chance to view the facilities that they might recommend to patients.Ann Jacob Smith, a family therapist in Chevy Chase, Md., said that last year, she accepted an invitation to visit the Oliver-Pyatt eating disorders center in Miami. (The center is now part of Monte Nido).\u201cIt was absolutely promotional,\u201d she said, \u201cBut it was actually really educational. They took us in depth into what they did.\u201dHer later referrals were not influenced by the visit, she added. \u201cI\u2019m not impressed by being romanced.\u201dBut Adrian Brown, a psychiatrist in Virginia, said that therapists who had not gone through the \u201cbattle phase\u201d with drug companies might not even realize they were being swayed by financial interests.Dr. Brown recalled being offered a \u201cV.I.P.\u201d trip to a treatment center, with the representative telling her, \u201cWe will pay your way, put you up in a really nice hotel, all expenses paid, yoga and whatever.\u201dDr. Brown responded, \u201cNo, that\u2019s not ethical.\u201dThe representative replied, \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d Another invitation arrived the next year.Many reviewers have spent time in more than one residential center and the opinions on any particular program vary widely, a range reflected in interviews with former patients over the last several months.Tina Klaus, a 51-year-old artist who has struggled with bulimia since she was 10, said residential care was initially useful.\u201cResidential treatment is vital when you are at your ultimate rock bottom\u201d she said. But once home, her illness worsened because \u201cyou\u2019re going back into your life, you\u2019re going back into all the emotions you used your eating disorder to hide from.\u201dMelissa R., 28, who asked that her last name not be used for reasons of privacy, said after several hospitalizations for anorexia, beginning when she was 21, she found a residential center in the Southwest on the Internet and spent six weeks there. The center, which she described as \u201cmore like a resort,\u201d was \u201csomewhat helpful,\u201d she said, but not worth the time and money.\u201cPeople were nice, and the food was really good,\u201d she said. \u201cI had fun, I enjoyed rock climbing and stuff, but that\u2019s not why I was there. I\u2019m paying a lot of money to get well, not to rock climb.\u201dLast year, she spent two months at Eating Recovery Center in Denver, moving from residential care to day treatment, and began to gain control of her illness. \u201cE.R.C. was the best place I\u2019ve been,\u201d she said about the center. \u201cThey were very individualized.\u201dAshley Bilkie, 29, had a different experience with E.R.C. When she returned home in February 2015 after about six months in the Denver program \u2014 her fourth stay in an inpatient program for treatment of anorexia and her second at E.R.C. \u2014 \u201cI was getting sicker and sicker,\u201d she said. She lost the weight she had gained back at the center. \u201cI had to buy children\u2019s clothing,\u201d she said.She was evasive with her parents. At the recovery center, she said, \u201cIt was kind of like they set up a battle between myself and my parents.\u201d For their part, Ms. Bilkie\u2019s parents, who for years had watched their daughter\u2019s health decline, grew frantic. Ms. Bilkie would disappear, her father, Robert Bilkie, said, and he would find her wandering the aisles at Kroger or Target. Driving through the neighborhood, he half-expected to see her hanging from a tree.\u201cIt\u2019s a parent\u2019s worst nightmare,\u201d he said.It was also expensive. Mr. Bilkie, a financial adviser in Michigan, calculated that over three years, he paid at least $350,000 for unreimbursed inpatient care for his daughter. The Eating Recovery Center, he said, sent him bills for $30,000 each month. Mr. Bilkie paid willingly \u2014 he was desperate to see Ashley get well, he said \u2014 but no program seemed to produce lasting results.\u201cWe spent an outrageous amount of money for what really amounted to ineffectual treatment,\u201d Mr. Bilkie said.Last fall, Ms. Bilkie entered the eating disorder center at the Johns Hopkins Medical Center, a university affiliated program.The staff there gradually weaned her off some drugs she had been taking taking at the center in Denver, including high doses of Xanax, a tranquilizer, and Adderall, an attention deficit drug and a stimulant.She was discharged in November and continues to do well.\u201cI hated every single solitary second of it,\u201d she said of the experience. \u201cBut that\u2019s a good thing, because I was not comfortable, and it meant that something was working.\u201dDr. Ovidio Bermudez, the chief clinical officer of Eating Recovery Center, said that other patients have fared poorly at academic centers and then done well at E.R.C. Despite Ms. Bilkie\u2019s perception, he said, therapists at the program did not try to divide patients from their families. (Ms. Bilkie gave Eating Recovery Center permission to discuss her case.)\u201cWe would have to filter this through 20/20 hindsight,\u201d Dr. Bermudez said. \u201cIt\u2019s really hard to know what somebody\u2019s frame of mind is and the degree of fragility they bring to any treatment experience.\u201dDr. Anne Marie O\u2019Melia, a psychiatrist at the recovery center, said Ms. Bilkie was on Xanax when she arrived and was fearful of reducing the drug\u2019s dosage, though the center tried. She was switched to Adderall from another stimulant at E.R.C., Dr. O\u2019Melia said, to treat \u201csignificant impulsivity.\u201dMs. Bilkie\u2019s history of ups and downs is not unusual for patients with eating disorders.\u201cIn many cases, you see one step forward, two steps back,\u201d said Dr. Mark Friedlander, the chief medical officer for Aetna Behavioral Health.His company, Dr. Friedlander said, considers residential care essential for treatment of some patients. But, he said, a lack of outcome studies, an absence of industry standards and a patchwork licensing system across states make it difficult for Aetna or other insurers to evaluate care.\u201cWe would love to see greater consistency and higher standards,\u201d he said.Dr. Lampert, president of the consortium, said the centers in the organization were also collecting data on patient outcomes, lengths of stay and other variables, with each center collecting data on 15 consecutive admissions of adults and adolescents.In the meantime, many patients and families will continue to rely on word of mouth and any information they can find online.\u201cThese are black boxes,\u201d Dr. Scott Hadland, an adolescent medicine specialist at Harvard Medical School, said of the residential centers. \u201cPeople get the idea that these are places that can heal just based on what they see on a website or in the photos.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Airbnb Pits Neighbor Against Neighbor in Tourist-Friendly New Orleans", "Date": "2016-03-05", "News": "Supported byTalk to the locals in certain New Orleans neighborhoods \u2014 from the historic and genteel Garden District uptown to the dense and increasingly trendy Bywater downriver \u2014 and you can be pretty sure that one topic will come up eventually: Airbnb.With crime, potholes and the Saints, the home-sharing economy has become one of the city\u2019s default topics, bickered about in countless informal conversations, through snarky signs (\u201cWon\u2019t You B&B My Neighbor?\u201d) and increasingly in public forums where city officials, and the citizenry, argue over what to do about it.Everybody has an opinion. Some are distraught at revelers leaving \u201cfloors covered with vomit\u201d in residential buildings and \u201cshort-term strangers\u201d squeezing out long-term residents. But just as passionate are people who say renting rooms on Airbnb has brought them enough cash to rehabilitate properties or cover the mortgage after a layoff or after Hurricane Katrina. All of those arguments were made in September at a planning commission hearing on the subject \u2014 a meeting that lasted more than two hours despite a time limit on comments.Like some other cities, New Orleans has laws that make a lot of short-term rentals illegal. In most circumstances, renting property for less than 30 days is prohibited without a special permit that few individuals have obtained, and it is punishable by fine or possibly jail time. But city officials acknowledge that New Orleans simply does not have the resources to enforce this rule \u2014 given the 2,400 to 4,000 short-term rental listings on various services. Whether short-term rentals will be permitted in some form is not in question; the numbers have already settled that. It is up to the city to adjust accordingly, and figure out how they will be allowed.Representatives of the larger home-sharing companies have met with New Orleans officials, but they are seldom heard from in more public forums. Officials of Airbnb and VRBO (Vacation Rentals by Owner, a HomeAway brand that is popular in New Orleans) point out that they operate in so many places they cannot possibly get into the specifics of local policy; they are merely private businesses offering services to consumers. So it is up to New Orleans and other cities to devise their own regulations, and up to users to follow them. The upshot is a curious mix of ubiquity and absence: a public debate that seems to involve everyone except the parties who started it.For the time being, the platforms operate in \u201ca regulatory Wild West,\u201d wrote Jeffrey Goodman, a New Orleans design consultant and self-described \u201cplanning nerd,\u201d in the February issue of the American Planning Association magazine Planning. And while cities scramble to adjust, Mr. Goodman wrote, these companies \u201cmake money without proper oversight and without proper accountability.\u201dThe surprise is that, despite the bickering and contention, the various constituencies in New Orleans have a lot of common ground. Even the most ardent proponents of short-term rentals agree that the practice should be regulated: There ought to be mechanisms to collect taxes, restrict the density of short-term rentals in certain areas, and deal with absentee owners who offer property for rent and allow rowdy guests to become neighborhood nuisances.The trick is that the most efficient way of achieving those ends might require the services to change how they operate. A technological fix that would permit only licensed owners to list their properties online, for example, could satisfy many complaints. But the services have been unwilling to pursue those possibilities. So New Orleans will have to find another answer.Rob White lives in the French Quarter. Thick with 18th-century structures, the dense grid is the oldest neighborhood in New Orleans and its biggest tourist magnet. New hotels or bed-and-breakfasts have been tightly restricted or banned for many years, to preserve some degree of the residential character that is part of the attraction. Regulations for short-term rentals are even tighter here (nothing under 60 days, in theory), but the online services have provided an easy workaround to that rule, in Mr. White\u2019s view. He says it seems that he is the only full-time resident on his block. \u201cYou know who comes in and out of there?\u201d he said at a community meeting about a condominium building nearby. \u201cPeople with their luggage.\u201d The tourists roll in on Thursday or Friday and roll out a few days later. \u201cIt\u2019s a rogue hotel,\u201d he complained.Mr. White is a member of the Short-Term Rental Committee, not an official city entity, but a vocal coalition of preservationists, neighborhood activists, owners of traditional bed-and-breakfasts and residents of various historic New Orleans neighborhoods. Its criticism of short-term rentals predates the rise of home-sharing services, but it has become steadily louder since Airbnb\u2019s arrival in the city in 2009, and it has included bitter complaints about the city\u2019s failure to enforce the relevant code, which dates from the 1950s.Deputy Mayor Ryan Berni concedes that enforcement of the short-term rental law has been \u201clax and difficult.\u201d Listings on home-sharing platforms do not reveal specific names and addresses, and identifying and building cases against violators would involve considerable time and money, city officials say. In fairness, New Orleans, like most cities, has more urgent priorities \u2014 including an understaffed police force and road and infrastructure problems that would cost billions to fix. \u201cWe just didn\u2019t feel like we had the tools to do it,\u201d Mr. Berni said.Stopping scofflaws would be easier if the services identified those using their tools to break the law, an argument made by critics of short-term rentals. Representatives of Airbnb and VRBO counter that turning over such information would violate their users\u2019 privacy. A VRBO spokesman says that its users essentially pay to advertise a property, and the platform is not directly involved in resulting transactions. Mr. Rivers, of the planning commission, and a former lawyer for the city, says it is not even clear that the city has the legal standing to demand such information, and that ultimately it needs a solution involving its own data.In recent months, Airbnb has released limited information about use of its site. For instance, it says that 92 percent of New Orleans\u2019s hosts booked property for fewer than 180 days in the previous year, a statistic that suggests users are regular people occasionally supplementing their income. But this data release left out other important numbers \u2014 such as listings per host, which might have illuminated the multiple-property power users who may account for significant booking volume.Airbnb declined to comment in detail about specifics of the debate in New Orleans. But Max Pomeranc, an Airbnb public policy manager whose focus includes New Orleans, responded to criticism about compliance with local laws by saying that its service is available in 34,000 municipalities around the world, making deep local involvement everywhere impractical. Mr. Pomeranc also noted that anyone signing up to be a host in New Orleans encounters a \u201cResponsible Hosting\u201d page encouraging compliance with local laws and various links to official city sources.Even the alliance, a relatively sophisticated operation that is financed by dues and has its own lawyers, favors regulation. Mr. Galvin said the group expected that developing rules to legalize short-term rentals would take seven or eight months. \u201cJust tax it, and let\u2019s go about our day,\u201d he said. \u201cWhy is it dragging on?\u201dDespite the polarization around the issue, many, including lawyers for the Alliance for Neighborhood Prosperity, have endorsed a simple-sounding idea: require short-term rentals to obtain some sort of official license or permit number (for a fee) and enter it in a field on the web. Enter your license number, or you are not permitted to list. Mr. Goodman, the planning activist, agreed that the platform databases were \u201cthe choke point in the system,\u201d and tweaking them to function only with a municipal license would amount to a genuine partnership with cities. \u201cIt requires the city to keep a good database, and these listing companies to honor that database,\u201d he said.For the home-sharing services, however, this appears to be a nonstarter. According to Mr. Rivers, Airbnb and VRBO told his staff that it would be too onerous to adjust their software to accommodate every regulatory arrangement for thousands of municipalities around the world. Spokesmen for Airbnb and VRBO confirm that rewriting their platforms in this way is not practical.The planning commission seems to have accepted that argument, and its study recommends instead that license information, with the address of an advertised property, should be included in the \u201cnarrative\u201d section of a listing. To critics, that means people without licenses could still rent, and it would still be up to the city to ferret out those who do not follow the rules. In the few cities that have enacted analogous policies, compliance has been estimated at less than 15 percent.Mr. Berni, the deputy mayor, while emphasizing that the planning commission report is merely a starting point, says this recommended strategy has potential. Compliant users paying for licenses could generate revenue to begin funding enforcement. Going after a \u201cbad operator\u201d is a complaint-driven process, he says, and a listing that lacks a license number could give the city cleaner legal leverage.Perhaps that will work. Even Mr. Goodman expresses optimism. He notes that Airbnb in particular seems to be moving toward accepting that it is not just a responsibility-free enabler \u2014 adding more robust insurance options and, increasingly, tax-collection tools. So maybe all the local contention will lead to a productive resolution after all. \u201cI just want to have New Orleans win on this,\u201d Mr. Goodman says.An article last Sunday about sharply differing views in New Orleans regarding Airbnb and other short-term rental services misstated part of the name of a group that supports short-term rentals. It is the Alliance for Neighborhood Prosperity, not the Alliance for Neighborhood Progress. Advertisement"}

TerraForm Power would sell stock in the market to finance this acquisition.This is where things started to go awry.David Tepper\u2019s Appaloosa Management protested about the acquisition, asserting that SunEdison had used its control position to force TerraForm Power into this deal.SunEdison is already highly leveraged, with $11 billion in debt, and it runs losses, giving it little room to maneuver. More important, the two TerraForm stock prices declined precipitously, making it difficult for TerraForm Power to raise money to purchase Vivint assets.SunEdison had a case of buyer\u2019s remorse while the TerraForm Power board openly talked of trying to get out of the deal. Moreover, a still-unexplained delay occurred when SunEdison announced that it could not complete its annual financial statements. A delay in completing audited financial statements always creates trouble and often ruins a stock. But in this case, the problems were worse, since SunEdison needed those financial statements to register with the Securities and Exchange Commission the shares being issued to Vivint shareholders. Meanwhile, oil prices kept going down, taking SunEdison and its yieldcos with it.Vivint was now faced with a hard choice: whether to sue SunEdison or renegotiate. In the face of a declining market, Vivint decided to cut the price its shareholders would receive. Blackstone, the owner of 77 percent of Vivint, also agreed to offer financing. The deal was adjusted so that S.E.C. registration was not required.But unfortunately, for whatever reason, SunEdison has not finished its financial statements. Its lenders, now skittish, pulled their financing. Left with no funds and no current financial statements, SunEdison went dark. Its stock now trades in the $2 range, down from about $31 a share at the time the acquisition was announced.A representative of SunEdison declined to comment. Representatives of Vivint did not respond to requests for comment.Now Vivint, left waiting, has terminated its agreement and sued SunEdison for damages in a Delaware court. It\u2019s a good case for Vivint. The agreement allows for Vivint, in the case of a willful breach, to sue for the full benefits of the transaction, which in this case are well over a billion dollars. While SunEdison can argue that this was not a willful breach, it will have a hard time.What is SunEdison\u2019s strategy? No doubt it is the bankruptcy one. With so much debt and little equity \u2014 its market capitalization is only $600 million despite having $2.4 billion in cash \u2014 if SunEdison declares bankruptcy, Vivint will face a drawn-out process and may find that the cash evaporates. Meanwhile, Greenlight is desperate to salvage its investment and has taken a board seat.SunEdison is looking to settle this, no doubt for a few hundred million dollars.What a mess.It is important to place blame here. As for the hedge funds, like Valeant they can be dismissed for chasing a bubble deal and yield yet again. (After the Valeant crash, this is a worrying trend.)But five large investment banks were involved in advising the parties here. Bank of America Merrill Lynch was the main adviser to SunEdison, while Goldman Sachs was also an adviser and provided financing. Barclays and Citibank advised TerraForm Power, while Morgan Stanley advised Vivint.Even with all this firepower, it appears no one said at the beginning that such a highly leveraged acquisition with so many moving parts might create a problem. This is the old Wall Street, where someone can move a percent on the spreadsheet in terms of leverage and it is all fine. But no one, it appears \u2014 not the bankers who financed this, let alone the companies\u2019 officers \u2014 took a step back and said that maybe this type of structure did not make sense in a post-financial crisis world.The oil collapse might have been unforeseen. But looking at the SunEdison structure \u2014 three public companies, enormous debt and the use of various securities to buy this company \u2014 one should have questioned the arrangements. This is even before addressing the issue that Vivint is in consumer solar, an industry very different than that of SunEdison, which builds massive plants. It was a risky transaction across the board.Will Wall Street and corporate America ever learn?An article on the DealBook page on Wednesday about the financial troubles of the solar company SunEdison misidentified the SunEdison affiliate that the hedge fund Appaloosa Management claimed was forced to acquire assets from SunEdison. It is TerraForm Power, not TerraForm Global.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Wounded Marco Rubio Falls Back to Florida", "Date": "2016-03-03", "News": "Supported byHe talks of driving around the country asking for votes in his pickup truck if it comes to that.After a string of middling finishes in the Super Tuesday contests, the Rubio campaign\u2019s expectations are catching up with the hard and dire realities of delegate math, a fractured vote and the seemingly unstoppable force that is Mr. Trump.Now, Mr. Rubio, a Florida senator, is facing the possibility of a humiliating and likely campaign-ending loss in the state, where Mr. Trump leads in polls. Mr. Rubio is redirecting his time and resources to Florida, where aides say he will spend most of his time between now and the March 15 winner-take-all primary.A campaign that has played a cautious expectations-setting game is now making brash predictions, saying there is no way it will lose in Mr. Rubio\u2019s home state. He himself left no room for error, declaring Wednesday, \u201cWe will win in Florida.\u201dMr. Rubio\u2019s biggest threat in the state, Mr. Trump, has come under an unrelenting assault from the party establishment, with the most extraordinary shot yet coming from Mitt Romney, a former Republican presidential candidate. On Thursday, Mr. Romney urged party members to rally around one of Mr. Trump\u2019s rivals, without saying which one.Mr. Rubio\u2019s allies say his big bet in Florida is reflective of his tough predicament.\u201cIs it threading the needle?\u201d said Tim Griffin, the lieutenant governor of Arkansas, a state Mr. Rubio lost on Tuesday. But he noted that with unexpected developments like the withdrawal of Ben Carson from the race on Wednesday, there are still a lot of unknowns. \u201cWe all talk about how difficult it is to thread a needle,\u201d Mr. Griffin said. \u201cBut there are a lot of people walking around with clothes on. Which means there\u2019s a lot of needles being threaded.\u201dThe defiance coming from Mr. Rubio and his campaign brings new attitude to a candidate always better known for his precision and predictability. Adjusting to that new role has not been without its complications.In finally making their move against Mr. Trump, Mr. Rubio and his advisers honed a critique of him they believed could cut away at the core of his appeal to the white, blue-collar voters he attracts at the polls: that over the course of his career, Mr. Trump has actually hurt the working class. So Mr. Rubio went on the attack over the lawsuits against Mr. Trump\u2019s education business, Trump University, and over his hiring of foreign and undocumented workers instead of Americans.But then he veered into taunts about the size of Mr. Trump\u2019s hands \u2014 a thinly veiled jab at his manhood \u2014 and his apparent preference for aggressive self-tanning. And he implied that Mr. Trump was not tough, saying that for all his bluster, \u201cThis guy has never punched anyone.\u201dIt alarmed some donors, who emailed campaign advisers saying they thought the senator had gone too far.Even Mr. Rubio seemed to sense that he had overdone it. At a rally in Oklahoma on Monday, someone in the crowd shouted out to him to do his bit on Mr. Trump\u2019s hands. Mr. Rubio sheepishly declined. \u201cWe\u2019re not talking about that today,\u201d he said.Even his best result of Tuesday night \u2014 winning the Minnesota caucuses in his first outright victory in any state \u2014 was not exactly commanding. He received just four more delegates than Mr. Cruz, who finished second. And in Ohio, the Rubio campaign and its allied \u201csuper PAC\u201d have reserved no advertising time, according to a Republican advertising executive unaffiliated with any campaign.With just one outright victory, the campaign has been telling skeptical supporters that it is in the race to stay. At briefings over the last week with supporters and donors, Mr. Rubio\u2019s campaign manager has been delivering a message that seems improbably optimistic: Book your tickets to the convention in Cleveland in July.But winning the nomination on a second or third ballot at the convention \u2014 which could happen only if Mr. Trump faltered and was unable to win a majority of delegates \u2014 would be a potentially explosive event that could tear the party apart.\u201cIt could be 1968 all over again,\u201d said Russ Schriefer, a Republican strategist who has worked for George W. Bush, Mitt Romney and Chris Christie. \u201cThere will be riots in the streets of Cleveland. All these Trump people are so whipped up, and then you have the party establishment giving the nomination to the person with the second- or third-most delegates?\u201dAnd Mr. Rubio\u2019s performance on Super Tuesday was not exactly encouraging enough for him to be able to make a strong case that he is entitled to delegates he did not win the first time. Because he failed to reach 20 percent of the vote in Alabama, Texas and Vermont, he was ineligible to receive the bulk of the delegates awarded. He won four in Texas, one in Alabama and none in Vermont. The loss in Alabama was especially stinging. He had campaigned in the state at the last minute and even ribbed Mr. Cruz for skipping an event there they had both committed to. Mr. Rubio did not win a single county.The loss in Virginia on Tuesday also hit especially hard. It would have been a symbolic victory proving that Mr. Rubio was capable of winning in an important swing state. In the final days before the vote there, the campaign watched with growing confidence as private polling showed its candidate closing in on Mr. Trump. They were two points behind. Then suddenly, they were tied.They tore up their schedule and added four last-minute stops, one in every corner of the state. Aides began telling a close circle of supporters what sounded like a fantasy: They believed they could actually win.Fantasy it was.An earlier version of this article misstated the percentage of votes a candidate needs to get in Alabama, Texas and Vermont to pick up delegates. It is 20 percent, not 25 percent. It also misstated the number of delegates Mr. Rubio won in Texas and Alabama. While those states have a 20 percent threshold that made him ineligible to receive the vast majority of the delegates at stake, the rules there also made it possible for him to receive a small number even if he did not hit 20 percent statewide.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A New Spin on Senior Living", "Date": "2016-03-25", "News": "Supported by The New Old AgeRam and Geeta Chandran had always planned to move into a senior community after they retired. The couple had no children, and \u201cwe knew we had to move to a retirement community so we wouldn\u2019t be lonely in a huge house,\u201d said Geeta Chandran, 72, a family physician.The Chandrans, who had emigrated from India in 1970, found the prospect of aging with others from their home country appealing.Indian immigrants who came to the United States in the 1960s and \u201970s for educational and work opportunities have begun to downsize and contemplate their postcareer years, said Iggy Ignatius, 60, ShantiNiketan\u2019s chairman. \u201cMany people were thinking they\u2019d go back to India, but pragmatically, it\u2019s not possible,\u201d he said. \u201cOur children are here. Our grandchildren are here.\u201dIn Florida, from the architecture that reminds Dr. Chandran of Chennai, India, to the vegetarian meals and Bollywood dance classes, \u201cwe have created a mini-India, a piece of India,\u201d Mr. Ignatius said.The Chandrans moved into their three-bedroom condominium in 2011, paying $250,000, and now they lead yoga classes in ShantiNiketan\u2019s meditation room.Mr. Chandran, 77, a former corporate vice president, conducts Hindu prayers each weekday morning in a small on-site temple. For festivals, Dr. Chandran puts on the silk saris she found few occasions to wear in Newport News, Va.\u201cYou feel more at home here,\u201d she said.In addition to those established by and for members of religious groups, they include retirement communities for military officers, for gays and lesbians, and for the alumni of particular colleges and universities.Facilities for specific ethnic groups have appeared more recently, but \u201cI think we\u2019ll see more of them,\u201d Mr. Kramer said. \u201cWe\u2019re such a polyglot culture.\u201dAmong those already in operation:Monthly rents are likely to start at $5,300, executives said, not including help with the activities of daily living.\u25a0 ShantiNiketan began with 54 apartments when the Chandrans moved in. Now it has 174, with 120 more condos for Indian-Americans under construction, and Mr. Ignatius plans an initial public offering to finance similar developments near Los Angeles, Dallas and Chicago.\u201cThere\u2019s a Catholic Charities senior center two blocks away, but they would not go there,\u201d because nobody on the staff speaks Bengali, said Lakshman Kalasapudi, India Home\u2019s program manager.As for Latinos, \u201cI expect to see the first Hispanic facilities in Southern California and the Southwest,\u201d said Mr. Kramer of the National Investment Center.Though Chinese-American families (like most American families) try to keep older relatives at home as long as possible, \u201ca lot of my residents have said it\u2019s very lonely if your children are at work, your grandchildren are at school, and you\u2019re alone with a caregiver, dozing in front of the TV,\u201d said Emily Poon, the general manager of Aegis Gardens in Fremont.In standard assisted living, they might feel even more disconnected. \u201cThe majority can\u2019t speak English well,\u201d Ms. Poon said. \u201cThey couldn\u2019t communicate effectively with the staff or the other residents.\u201d They might find the food unpalatable, the activities unengaging. Isolation breeds its own physical and psychological dangers.Alice and George Louie, 90-year-old Chinese immigrants, moved to Aegis Gardens in 2012 to be near their daughter and son-in-law. The staff helps Mr. Louie, who has dementia, with his medications. Mrs. Louie, who has diabetes and uses a walker, practices tai chi and calligraphy. They eat meals with other Cantonese speakers.\u201cFor the Chinese New Year, you never saw a place so extravagantly decorated,\u201d Mrs. Louie said. The festivities included traditional lion dancers, jugglers and gymnasts; the dining room served dim sum.For administrators, ethnic facilities can pose special challenges. Aegis executives had to petition to change the Fremont community\u2019s street address, Mr. Clark said, because it contained the numeral 4, considered unlucky in Chinese culture. Inside the facility, apartment numbers jump from 103 to 105 and 239 to 251.Days before the opening, a feng shui practitioner decreed that the fountain in the courtyard be torn out because its outer rim contained points; he was mollified when workers hastily sawed off the points.A larger challenge: How long will the market for ethnically specific senior housing and programs last? Immigrants\u2019 more assimilated offspring may care less about traditional cooking or a Gujarati-speaking staff. \u201cFor first-generation Indians, this is working out great,\u201d Mr. Ignatius said of ShantiNiketan. \u201cI\u2019m not sure my children will come here.\u201dBut if the need 40 years hence looks uncertain, the demand right now is pressing, said Dr. Vasundhara Kalasapudi, the executive director of India Home. The group wants to establish day programs for South Asians with dementia, as well as assisted living facilities and nursing homes.\u201cThis is a common topic for all of us, how difficult it is to take care of families with medical problems,\u201d she said.Or nonmedical problems. Dr. Kalasapudi, a geriatric psychiatrist, recalled being pressed into service to talk to a hospitalized Indian immigrant who suffered, the staff believed, from depression. Her mother tongue was Telugu, but they managed to communicate in Hindi.\u201cI\u2019m not depressed,\u201d the patient told her. \u201cI just don\u2019t like the food.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Hillary! Bernie! Debate!", "Date": "2016-03-09", "News": "Supported byLet\u2019s give a hand to Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders. After all we\u2019ve been through with the Republicans, it\u2019s nice to hear presidential candidates go at each other\u2019s throat while they\u2019re talking about where they stood on immigration issues in 2007.This was Wednesday\u2019s Democratic debate \u2014 the second one in a week, not counting the back-to-back town halls in between. People, do you remember when we used to complain that there weren\u2019t going to be enough debates? Ah yes, long ago. Dinosaurs roamed the earth and Marco Rubio was a hot ticket.Clinton held up well, given that her first three questions involved why she lost the Michigan primary, her emails and whether she\u2019d drop out if she was indicted. (\u201cOh, for goodness \u2014 that is not going to happen. I\u2019m not even answering that question.\u201d) It was a tough evening. Sanders accused Clinton of cruelty to Honduran children. She claimed he had sided with the Minutemen.Since the debate was on Univision, there was a strong emphasis on immigration, which provided a kind of mirror image of the Republican debates. Clinton and Sanders bickered long and hard about who had been less in favor of deportation, going back more than a decade. (\u201cMadam Secretary, I will match my record against yours any day of the week!\u201d)In truth, immigration is not an issue that actually separates these two people. The real gulf is between the grand vision and the practical plan. Sanders thinks he can provide free public college tuition and Medicare-like health coverage for all. \u201cMy dad used to say, If it sounds too good to be true, it probably is,\u201d Clinton rejoined.And then there\u2019s the auto industry bailout. One of the biggest moments in the Democrats\u2019 Week of Endless Debates came Sunday when Clinton caught Sanders off guard by accusing him \u2014 in Michigan! \u2014 of refusing to support Detroit during the economic crisis.\u201cHe voted against the money that ended up saving the auto industry,\u201d Clinton claimed while Sanders looked stunned.What followed was the most quoted moment of the encounter:Sanders: \u201cIf you are talking about the Wall Street bailout, where some of your friends destroyed this economy \u2014\u2014\u201dClinton: \u201cYou know \u2014\u2014\u201dSanders: \u201cExcuse me, I\u2019m talking.\u201dAudience: \u201cOooooh\u201dIt\u2019s certainly a tribute to the general decorum with which the Democrats have conducted themselves that this was enough to draw a gasp from the crowd. The bar is so high on the Republican side that to get a real response one of the candidates would have had to hit the other with a hammer.But let\u2019s look at the bailout issue for a minute. Sanders did vote for a bill to lend money to the auto industry. But it got blocked in the Senate. Then during the stupendously complex end-of-the-Bush-administration negotiations, the bailout got mooshed into a huge, messy bill that did indeed involve helping Wall Street. When the only choices were nothing or a big, unappetizing legislative stew, he refused to bite.That pretty much sums up his career in Congress. Sanders stood up for his principles, but he didn\u2019t play any real role. At one point he offered an amendment to raise taxes on high-income individuals, which was basically ignored. He was marvelous, but symbolically marvelous.He was in no way like Ted Cruz, who just tries to get attention by stopping things. Nobody hates Bernie Sanders. But he\u2019s a maverick legislator, a man without a party. That\u2019s a way, way different kind of life than being the person who has to run the country.\u201cYou have to make hard choices when you\u2019re in positions of responsibility,\u201d Clinton said.Clinton is a stupendous debater, and she\u2019s developed smooth and sensible-sounding answers to sticky matters like the State Department emails and Benghazi. But she still hasn\u2019t been able to handle Sanders\u2019s attacks on her $225,000 speeches to finance industry insiders. She shrugs and says she\u2019ll release the transcripts when \u201ceverybody else does,\u201d which generally involves mentioning that President Obama \u201ctook a lot of money from Wall Street.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t have any comment,\u201d she said when she was questioned earlier in the week about campaign donations. \u201cI don\u2019t know that. I don\u2019t believe that there is any reason to be concerned about it.\u201dThis is the stuff that makes Democrats want to send a message. Hillary Clinton is by far the best qualified candidate for president. But at this point in the campaign, you can understand why some people feel that voting for her against Bernie Sanders is like rewarding Washington for its worst behavior.In the end, Clinton is the one who knows how to make the system work. But she\u2019s just got to be clearer on how she can work against the system.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Jefferies Reports $166.7 Million Loss in Quarter", "Date": "2016-03-15", "News": "Supported byHow bad was the first-quarter market swoon? Ask the Jefferies Group\u2019s chief executive, Richard B. Handler.The Wall Street investment bank, a unit of the Leucadia National Corporation, reported a $166.7 million loss for its first fiscal quarter, which ended in February, as tumultuous markets slammed equity and fixed-income trading, junk bonds and leveraged lending. Investors drained money out of the market on fears of economic growth and China\u2019s stability, and companies put a stop to capital-raising, forcing Jefferies to pull back until the markets recovered.Jefferies is often viewed as a barometer of Wall Street, as its fiscal quarters end a month before its rivals\u2019, so its earnings reports tend to foretell trends for the industry.In recent weeks, executives from JPMorgan Chase and Citigroup have also talked about rocky trading that will very likely hurt their first-quarter results.Jefferies reined in its capital during the quarter.\u201cAs we have done through many other turbulent periods in our history, we reduced our already smaller balance sheet to continue to reduce risk during this difficult period,\u201d Mr. Handler said.Early signs in the second quarter point toward a rebound. \u201cIt appears markets have not only stabilized but aggressively snapped back,\u201d he said.Whereas Jefferies suffered in the previous quarters from fixed-income trading and energy-market exposure, this time around, its equities business struggled.The quarter\u2019s loss compares with a profit of $12.5 million in the first quarter a year earlier. Over all, revenue fell 49 percent, to $299 million. Sales and trading revenue fell 82 percent, to $58.5 million, and investment banking revenue dropped 15 percent, to $230.9 million.Jefferies wrote down the value of two large blocks of stock it holds, including a $37 million markdown in its holdings of KCG Holdings. Jefferies acquired the stake four years ago, when it helped rescue the trading firm the Knight Capital Group, which later merged with the high-frequency trading firm Getco to form KCG.Jefferies also wrote down the value of two loans on the books of its lending joint venture with Mass Mutual by $38 million. The write-downs contributed to the sharp decline in its equity business line, but the company points out that those unrealized losses have begun to regain value in the second quarter.In investment banking, deals that were lined up for completion early in the year were delayed, particularly new stock offerings and leveraged finance transactions. The company said its second quarter backlog was \u201csolid.\u201dIn the fourth quarter, Jefferies was plagued with a difficult bond market that sent its fixed-income trading results plunging 83 percent. The company spent a good deal of time last year shedding its exposure to distressed energy trading, and it agreed to sell its Bache commodities unit to Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale of France.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "What Do You Need to Do to Be a Supreme Court Justice?", "Date": "2016-03-18", "News": "Supported byOpinionIF someone could weaponize credentials \u2014 if a person could have a r\u00e9sum\u00e9 so impressive that the mere sight of it could turn the tide of a war \u2014 that person would be Merrick B. Garland. Degrees from Harvard. A Supreme Court clerkship. A partnership in a multinational law firm. Multiple senior roles at the Department of Justice. Nineteen years on the second-most-powerful court in the country. Now he\u2019s just one very challenging confirmation vote away from his own seat on the Supreme Court.Judge Garland is more than just credentialed. He has dominated a profession that is obsessed with credentials. There\u2019s a common joke that the practice of law is a pie-eating contest where the prize is more pie. The contest starts early: Undergraduates strive for spots at the country\u2019s top law schools, and the treadmill continues for spots on law review, prestigious clerkships, associate jobs at the best firms and on to partnerships. Partners have more prizes to chase \u2014 a political appointment, a higher political appointment, maybe even a judgeship.The story of Judge Garland is one of impeccable credentials, and an ambitious person who racked up accomplishments until he was nominated for his dream job. But what does it say about the court and the law that our notion of who is unimpeachably qualified is so narrow \u2014 and growing even narrower still?The course of a lawyer\u2019s career is often determined by what he or she accomplishes very early on. Law firms swarm elite law schools looking to hire future associates. The most highly regarded judges frequently fill their chambers with graduates from top-ranked institutions. Our pool of potential Supreme Court justices is determined by the choices, and careful calculations, that ambitious young men and women make before they turn 24.Every current member of the Supreme Court attended either Harvard or Yale. Their life experiences varied, of course, before arriving at those institutions. Justices Clarence Thomas and Sonia Sotomayor both rose from modest circumstances. And Judge Garland also fits within this meritocratic ideal: A young Garland worked as a tutor, stocked shoes in a shoe store and even sold his comic book collection, as the president noted in his announcement, to help put himself through Harvard Law School.But all that work and sacrifice can be for naught if an ambitious young lawyer doesn\u2019t achieve a circumscribed set of accomplishments. The easiest way to become a federal judge, not to mention a justice, is to spend your career surrounded by elites. That stems, in part, from the fact that it is easier to obtain power if you have powerful friends, but an even bigger factor is the highly fraught confirmation process, which punishes r\u00e9sum\u00e9s that advertise politics.If a lawyer spends his career in a large firm representing corporate clients, that is considered a politically neutral credential, as is service as a prosecutor. These jobs give a nominee plausible deniability when his record is attacked, as he can always excuse an uncomfortable argument that appears in a brief as a position he took on behalf of a client. In most cases, this excuse will even have the virtue of being true.But if someone works as a lawyer for the American Civil Liberties Union, or as a legal aid lawyer, or as a union lawyer, or in a plaintiffs\u2019 law firm, then she may as well tattoo the words \u201cBIG LEFTY\u201d on her forehead and walk into the confirmation hearing wearing a Che Guevara T-shirt.That\u2019s not to say that excellent judges cannot rise to our nation\u2019s highest court. Judge Garland\u2019s record as a court of appeals judge suggests that he is one of them. Nor should Judge Garland be punished for amassing credentials that set him up for the Supreme Court. Don\u2019t hate the player. Hate the game.Although the apparent consensus that Supreme Court justices must have gone to Harvard or Yale is a relatively recent development, there\u2019s always been a strong thread of elitism running through the legal profession\u2019s highest reaches. Alexis de Tocqueville wrote very early in our nation\u2019s history that \u201cAmerican aristocracy is found at the bar and on the bench.\u201dIn their decisions, these American aristocrats blessed segregation, struck down child labor laws, upheld Japanese internment camps, permitted states to sterilize women against their will, gutted the Voting Rights Act and ushered a torrent of money into our politics.Should liberals gain a majority on the Supreme Court, their biggest challenge will be policing the line between their legitimate constitutional grievances and disputes that should be left to the elected branches. Conservatives gave in too often to temptation while they held a majority on the court \u2014 just consider the series of challenges to Obamacare that made their way to the court. If the balance of power shifts, liberals would make a terrible mistake by following their example.America is rooted in the idea that legitimate authority to govern flows only from the consent of the governed. Meritocracy and respect for credentials both have their place in a society that needs competent leaders to hold the reins of government. But elite credentials cannot teach a judge what it means to seek shelter in the law, or how it feels to be a victim of discrimination. And a wise judge must understand his own limitations.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Bangladesh Bank Chief Resigns After Cyber Theft of $81 Million", "Date": "2016-03-15", "News": "Supported byThe Bangladesh central bank governor, Atiur Rahman, a widely respected economist, appeared to be caught by surprise, having learned of the theft only from Philippines news reports about a money-laundering investigation there. Last week he threatened to sue the New York Fed, a critical global financial gateway that holds the deposits of many foreign central banks.With pressure intensifying to explain how such a theft could have happened, Mr. Rahman submitted his resignation on Tuesday, and Bangladesh news agencies said it was accepted by Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina.The news agencies also said the Finance Ministry had dismissed two deputy central bank governors and the Bank and Financial Institutions division secretary, who were all accused of having kept the theft a secret from their superiors.Mr. Rahman, who had held the central bank post for seven years, said in Dhaka that he had been conflicted about the decision to resign. He also said he had informed foreign law enforcement authorities and had brought in cybercrime specialists to help investigate.\u201cSuch cyberattacks are happening across the world,\u201d Mr. Rahman said, according to news accounts from Bangladesh. \u201cWe are new in facing such attacks. We lack experience.\u201dA spokeswoman for FireEye, a computer security company in Milpitas, Calif., confirmed on Tuesday that its forensics division Mandiant was helping to investigate the Bangladesh theft.Reuters, quoting unidentified banking officials, reported on March 10 that the hackers appeared to have been intent on transferring nearly $1 billion out of Bangladesh\u2019s account, with nearly three dozen messaging requests. They succeeded with four requests, totaling $81 million, to move money to the Philippines, before a fifth attempt, for $20 million to be sent to Sri Lanka, was stopped because the hackers misspelled the recipient\u2019s name as the Shalika Fandation instead of the Shalika Foundation.The banking officials also were quoted as saying they were suspicious because of the unusually high number of transfer requests, so they alerted the Bangladeshis.Why a month elapsed before the news came to light remains unclear, as are the prospects for recovering any of the money.While incomes and living standards have improved, Bangladesh remains one of the poorest countries in the region. A 2014 study by Oxford University, using data on the percentage of the population considered destitute, ranked Bangladesh as the third-most impoverished in South Asia, after Afghanistan and India.The resignation and firings in Bangladesh came as testimony in a Philippines Senate panel hearing about the money-laundering investigation suggested that most of the purloined Bangladesh funds had been delivered, in dollars and Philippine pesos, to three Philippines casino operators. An anti-money-laundering law in the Philippines does not apply to the gambling industry.The senator leading the hearing, Teofisto Guingona III, said the loophole abets money laundering, an important ingredient in the crime that victimized Bangladesh\u2019s central bank.Peter Eavis contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Hillary Clinton Wins 4 Races, Rebounding From Michigan Loss", "Date": "2016-03-15", "News": "Supported byHillary Clinton swept major primaries in Florida, North Carolina and Ohio on Tuesday, rebounding from her upset loss to Bernie Sanders in Michigan a week earlier and securing a political and psychological victory for her campaign.The results were a significant setback for Mr. Sanders, who was counting on his fiery arguments against free trade to help him prevail across the industrial Midwest. He spent heavily trying to win Ohio, as well as Tuesday\u2019s contests in Illinois and Missouri, but he came away with his presidential bid looking increasingly hopeless, since Mrs. Clinton is far ahead in amassing delegates needed to win the nomination.Early Wednesday, The Associated Press declared Mrs. Clinton the winner in Illinois, too. Votes were still being counted in Missouri.For Mrs. Clinton, Tuesday\u2019s double-digit victories netted her so many delegates that her lead over Mr. Sanders is now about three times what Barack Obama\u2019s was over her in 2008. On a personal level, too, she and her advisers were reassured that regardless of her Michigan defeat, her political arguments about jobs and the economy had potency in states that will be major battlegrounds in November.The top issue for Ohio Democratic primary voters was the economy, and most of them favored Mrs. Clinton. A majority of voters also said that trade with other nations takes away American jobs, and more than half of them supported Mrs. Clinton. In Michigan, Mr. Sanders captured this group by double digits.Mrs. Clinton was bullish and beaming at her victory party in West Palm Beach, Fla., after the first three states were called in her favor. \u201cWe are moving closer to securing the Democratic Party nomination and winning this election in November,\u201d she said to cheers from a rowdy crowd of 1,300 people.More than in any other primary night speech, Mrs. Clinton aimed her remarks in South Florida at the leading Republican candidate, Donald J. Trump, who boasted of his own victory just miles away.\u201cWhen we hear a candidate for president call for rounding up 12 million immigrants, banning all Muslims from entering the United States, when he embraces torture, that doesn\u2019t make him strong \u2014 it makes him wrong,\u201d Mrs. Clinton said, as she called on all Americans to fight against \u201cbluster and bigotry.\u201dMr. Sanders, speaking at a campaign event in Arizona, which holds its contest next week, stuck to his scathing assessment of the American economic system and promised to overhaul campaign finance rules. He criticized Walmart as not paying living wages, but also repeated his creed against global trade that has particularly hit the Midwestern industrial belt.\u201cI say to corporate America, you want us to buy your products, start manufacturing those products here in America, not in China,\u201d Mr. Sanders said.Mr. Sanders also used the evening to criticize Mrs. Clinton for having a \u201csuper PAC\u201d and relying on large donations. \u201cShe has received money from the drug companies and the fossil fuel industry,\u201d he said to loud hisses and boos from the crowd of 7,200 people. \u201cShe has given speeches on Wall Street for $225,000 a pop.\u201dOhio was the prize that Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Sanders coveted the most, a bellwether state in American politics that would bestow not only delegates but also a new political story line for the winner: a Clinton comeback or a Sanders surge, given that he was a long-shot there until recently.After her loss in Michigan \u2014 and Mr. Sanders\u2019s persistent criticism of her record on global trade \u2014 Mrs. Clinton\u2019s aides seemed exasperated that her detailed policy positions to bring jobs back to the hard-hit Midwestern states were a harder sell than what they said were the unrealistic promises offered by her opponent. They huddled to retool her economic pitch so that it resonated better in Midwestern states in hopes of competing more strongly with Mr. Sanders.\u201cAfter having lost Michigan, we came into, particularly, Ohio with a renovated plan,\u201d said her spokeswoman, Jennifer Palmieri.At a rally in Youngstown, Mrs. Clinton addressed union members packed onto a factory floor at M7 Technologies, reminding them of the work she had done as a senator from New York to bring jobs back to the depressed upstate areas.\u201cI stood up for our companies in New York,\u201d she said. \u201cI will stand up for our companies in Ohio and across America,\u201d Mrs. Clinton said. \u201cIt\u2019s exciting for me. I am really totally committed to bringing back manufacturing.\u201dThe Clinton campaign dispatched former President Bill Clinton to Akron and Toledo, two predominantly white working-class cities that Mr. Sanders also campaigned in. Mrs. Clinton also racked up delegates in heavily black areas of Ohio, including courting voters in Cleveland.Mrs. Clinton\u2019s victories in Florida and North Carolina were due in large part to minorities: black voters in both states, and Hispanics in Florida as well. The Sanders campaign had been expecting to lose Florida, given that only Democrats could participate in the primary and he tends to perform better when independents are in the mix. But Mrs. Clinton was also broadly popular in the state, which was reflected in exit polls by Edison Research.Mrs. Clinton drew support from about seven in 10 Hispanic voters and nearly eight in 10 black voters. She was backed by a slim majority of white voters, who accounted for about half of the electorate \u2014 down from two-thirds in 2008. She was favored by voters who put a high priority on experience or electability, and she was the solid choice when voters were asked who had the better chance of defeating Mr. Trump in November.In Ohio exit polls, Mrs. Clinton was far ahead among black voters, but she and Mr. Sanders ran closely among white voters. As in Michigan, Mr. Sanders was drawing huge support from independents and voters under age 30, while Mrs. Clinton was popular with Democrats and voters over 45.As Ohioans streamed to the polls on Tuesday, several voters described intense feelings for their favored candidates. At the Alliance Church in Reynoldsburg, a middle-class Columbus suburb, Sediena Barry, who installs office equipment, said she decided to vote for Bernie Sanders moments before facing the horseshoe of electronic voting machines.\u201cYoung people were told, get an education and work hard and you\u2019ll get ahead, and none of us are,\u201d said Ms. Barry, 34, who complained that she is taxed at a rate higher rate than bosses who make a half-million dollars a year.James Moore, a restaurant manager, said he voted for Mrs. Clinton \u201cfor my personal future and my family\u2019s future.\u201d He added: \u201cAll her ideals line up with what we want to happen.\u201dFor both candidates, Tuesday\u2019s primary results represented a major turning point in the race: Roughly half of the 4,765 Democratic pledged delegates have now been awarded. But their campaigns offered sharply different takes.Clinton advisers noted that Mr. Sanders had reached the halfway mark without showing any progress at narrowing her sizable lead in delegates, leaving him only one way forward \u2014 to win a series of landslides through the June primaries and pick up significantly more delegates than Mrs. Clinton.That situation is highly unlikely, and Clinton advisers made it clear on Tuesday that they were confident about holding the delegate lead and ready to focus toward the general election.\u201cWe think she will be the nominee, we\u2019d like for this process to obviously be resolved as quickly as it can, but that\u2019s ultimately not up to us and we\u2019re prepared for it to go on,\u201d Ms. Palmieri said as the voting was underway.Sanders advisers, while acknowledging they were far behind in the delegate count, said that the race was now shifting to their advantage and that they expected to win more delegates than Mrs. Clinton in the coming primaries and caucuses. They argued that Mrs. Clinton\u2019s best states were behind her \u2014 the primaries across the South and in Texas where her popularity among blacks and Hispanics resulted in troves of delegates.Looking ahead, Sanders advisers predicted success in states with large liberal populations, like Wisconsin and California, and those with caucuses, a format that rewards voter enthusiasm and turnout and has favored Mr. Sanders recently. Mr. Sanders has even talked about prevailing in New York, Mrs. Clinton\u2019s home state, given the high numbers of progressive voters and working-class Democrats who share his disgust with Wall Street.\u201cWe\u2019re now entering a period where we think we\u2019ll win most if not all of the contests before the April 19 primary in New York,\u201d said Tad Devine, a senior adviser to Mr. Sanders. \u201cRegardless of how much momentum we have after Tuesday, the calendar is shifting in our favor. Now we just have to win some major showdowns, like in New York and New Jersey, to raise questions about whether she can really win the presidency.\u201dMrs. Clinton prevailed in Ohio in 2008 against Mr. Obama and referred to that victory frequently during their campaign, arguing that the Democrats\u2019 best hope in any general election was the winner of that state\u2019s primary.\u201dIt\u2019s a state that knows how to pick a president,\u201d Mrs. Clinton said at her victory rally in Columbus in 2008. \u201cAnd no candidate in recent history, Democrat or Republican, has won the White House without winning the Ohio primary.\u201dMr. Obama, of course, did go on to win the general election \u2014 and Ohio \u2014 that November. But after Tuesday, Mrs. Clinton is optimistic once again that her adage will prove true.Trip Gabriel and Dalia Sussman contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Aubrey McClendon, Ex-Head of Chesapeake Energy, Is Charged With Conspiracy", "Date": "2016-03-01", "News": "Supported byAccording to the Justice Department, the companies decided who would win the leases, with the winning bidder allotting an interest in the leases to the other company.The Justice Dept. charged Aubrey McClendon, the ex-C.E.O. of Chesapeake Energy, with conspiring to suppress prices paid for oil and natural gas leases.\u201cHis actions put company profits ahead of the interests of leaseholders entitled to competitive bids for oil and gas rights on their land,\u201d said William J. Baer, assistant attorney general for the antitrust division. \u201cExecutives who abuse their positions as leaders of major corporations to organize criminal activity must be held accountable for their actions.\u201dThe indictment was filed on Tuesday in United States District Court for the Western District of Oklahoma. The department said this was the first case resulting from a continuing federal antitrust investigation into price fixing, bid rigging and other anticompetitive conduct in the oil and natural gas industry.It did not mention anyone else or any other company, nor did it say how many leases were involved.Mr. McClendon released a statement late Tuesday denying all charges, arguing that for 35 years he has worked to create jobs and help Oklahoma\u2019s economy while providing plentiful energy for the entire country.\u201cThe charge that has been filed against me today is wrong and unprecedented,\u201d Mr. McClendon said. \u201cI have been singled out as the only person in the oil and gas industry in over 110 years since the Sherman Act became law to have been accused of this crime in relation to joint bidding on leasehold.\u201dGordon Pennoyer, a spokesman for Chesapeake, said the company \u201chas been actively cooperating for some time\u201d with the antitrust investigation. He added, \u201cChesapeake does not expect to face criminal prosecution or fines relating to this matter.\u201dUnder Mr. McClendon\u2019s leadership, Chesapeake and a handful of other companies transformed the face of energy in the United States, turning the country from an energy importer to an exporter and pioneering hydraulic fracturing in newly explored shale fields with ample global financing.Chesapeake\u2019s stock price, which is now under $3 a share, has been sinking for most of the last five years, especially since it was revealed that Mr. McClendon had taken a personal stake in Chesapeake wells and then used those investments as collateral for up to $1.1 billion in loans used mostly to pay for his share of the cost of drilling those wells.Over the last two and a half years, the oil industry experienced its deepest downturn since at least the 1990s.He was once fined $250,000 by the National Basketball Association for bragging that he and his partners did not buy the Seattle SuperSonics to keep the team in Seattle \u2014 a statement that was at odds with the N.B.A. commissioner\u2019s intentions. The Sonics moved to Oklahoma City for the 2008-9 season, and they became the Thunder. They play in Chesapeake Energy Arena.The Sierra Club cut its ties to the natural gas industry as environmentalists raised concerns over pollution caused by fracking and the disposal of fracking fluids.Mr. McClendon is now the chairman of American Energy Partners, a private company that seeks investments in shale fields globally. It recently signed an agreement with YPF, the Argentine national oil company, to help develop a shale field in Patagonia.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Restoring a Home for Scholars at the New York Public Library", "Date": "2016-03-02", "News": "Supported byBuilding BlocksFifty feet in the air at the New York Public Library on Fifth Avenue, and in an industrial-grade painting studio near Hudson Yards, artists, artisans and engineers are bringing a long scholarly diaspora nearly to an end.\u201cThe inspection and beginning of any needed repairs are expected to take approximately six months, and the library will learn more as the work continues,\u201d an official statement dated June 16, 2014, said.And here we are, in March 2016.The catalog room will re-emerge looking better than it has in generations.That is because the scaffolding needed to inspect both rooms, a platform almost two-thirds of an acre in area, has made it possible to replace a damaged and disfigured ceiling mural in the catalog room.\u201cThe mural had been badly redone,\u201d Mr. Marx said, \u201cand was even more horrifying close up.\u201d\u201cWhat we are painting is moisture and air,\u201d Mr. Mensching said. \u201cThere is not a solid subject in the canvas that we\u2019re trying to replicate.\u201dThat canvas is impressive: 33 feet 7\u00bd inches by 27 feet 7\u00bd inches, divided in two segments hung on the studio walls. The artists apply water-based acrylic paint on a lightweight cotton canvas used for theatrical sets, which has been treated with a fire retardant.At close range, brush strokes of goldenrod, lavender, violet, salmon, aquamarine and sky blue can be discerned. Seen from a few paces, however, the colors blend to form cloud towers. You can almost feel yourself levitating into the scene.\u201cWe study the artist,\u201d Mr. Veshi said. \u201cWe study the period.\u201d Spirit matters as much as details, which are lost to history anyway. \u201cIt\u2019s not a matter of imitation but connection,\u201d Mr. Veshi said.One of the 102 medium-size rosettes, weighing 16\u00bd pounds, dropped from the southeastern corner of the ceiling shortly after 2 a.m. on May 28, 2014. The event was caught on a security camera. Everyone was relieved that the rosette had picked that hour to fall, and not 2 p.m.Better yet, he said, \u201cThe ceiling is in really good shape.\u201dAll the rosettes have been manually examined, he said. Several have undergone testing in which they were made to hold more than 300 pounds. One was deliberately made to fail, but it took 434 pounds of vertical load. (That would be the equivalent of 2.7 David Dunlaps hanging from the rosette, which none of us are inclined to do.)The rosettes are attached to steel angle bars above the ceiling by a plaster mass known as a \u201cwad,\u201d reinforced by random lengths of hemp. The wad of the rosette that fell had been damaged. Water may have leaked onto it through a roof hatch above. Workers might have also stepped on it inadvertently while installing or maintaining the air-conditioning ductwork that runs through the 25-foot-high attic.To ensure that no other ornaments fall, thin, multistrand, stainless-steel cables are being threaded through each of the 420 brackets and all but the smallest rosettes. The cables are tied in turn to the angle bars. You can barely see them from a few feet away.As if this were not painstaking enough, workers also had to remove asbestos in the attic that had evidently been installed along with the air-conditioning ductwork in the mid-20th century.Together, the inspection and repairs, the painting and installation of a new mural, and the erection and dismantling of the scaffolding will have cost the library about $12 million.But Mr. Marx said, \u201cIf we do the job right, hopefully it is once in a lifetime.\u201dOr twice, depending on how you count it.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Corporations Grow Nervous About Participating in Republican Convention", "Date": "2016-03-30", "News": "Supported byAn array of activist groups is organizing a campaign to pressure the companies to refuse to sponsor the gathering, which many of the corporations have done for the Republican and the Democratic Parties for decades.The pressure is emerging as some businesses and trade groups are privately debating whether to scale back their participation, according to interviews with more than a dozen lobbyists, consultants and fund-raisers directly involved in the conversations.Apple, Google and Walmart are among the companies assessing their plans for the convention, which will be held July 18 to 21 in Cleveland.\u201cI have talked to several people at companies who have said, \u2018I\u2019ve always gone to the convention, I\u2019ve always participated at some level, but this year we\u2019re not putting it in our budget, we\u2019re not going, we\u2019re not going to sponsor any of the events going on,\u2019 \u201d said Carla Eudy, a Republican fund-raising consultant.Walmart, which contributed $150,000 to the Republican convention in 2012, has yet to commit to contributing this year. \u201cWe haven\u2019t made any decisions,\u201d said Dan Bartlett, executive vice president of corporate affairs at Walmart, who emphasized that even before Mr. Trump\u2019s rise, the company had been discussing reducing its involvement.Apple and Google declined to comment.\u201cThese companies have a choice right now, a history-making choice,\u201d said Rashad Robinson, the executive director of Color of Change. \u201cDo they want riots brought to us by Coca-Cola?\u201dThe situation is especially delicate for Coca-Cola, which is based in Atlanta and has devoted significant resources for decades to appeal to minority groups.In the company\u2019s Washington office, executives have been locked in conversations about how to handle the convention, according to two people directly involved in the discussions. In addition to donating cash, the beverage giant usually provides in-kind contributions, including sodas and other drinks.In a statement, Mr. Landers, the Coca-Cola spokesman, said the company had also provided $75,000 to the 2016 Democratic convention, adding, \u201cThe Coca-Cola Company is a nonpartisan business and does not endorse presidential candidates or nominees, nor do we endorse any specific party.\u201dEmily Lauer, a spokeswoman for the Cleveland 2016 Host Committee, played down any concerns about fund-raising. She said corporations and other donors had already pledged $54 million of the $64 million needed.But a senior Republican official with direct knowledge of convention fund-raising said there was growing worry inside the party about whether donors would follow through with their pledges if Mr. Trump became the nominee.According to the Associated Press, Donald J. Trump and Hillary Clinton have each won enough delegates to claim their party\u2019s nomination for president.Asked how much of the $54 million the committee had in hand, Ms. Lauer said, \u201cthe majority.\u201d The State of Ohio, the City of Cleveland and Cuyahoga County are contributing generously, she said, along with local businesses.But the question of what to do about the Republican convention is more complex for businesses than simply deciding whether to contribute to the host committee: They are also grappling with whether they should send their executives, whether they can just quietly give to ancillary events benefiting other Republicans, and even whether they ought to have their names removed from the off-site concerts that are often convention favorites.The issue is a touchy one for American businesses, which until now have largely avoided the delicate choice between possibly offending Mr. Trump\u2019s passionate followers by distancing themselves from him, or angering the equally vocal constituencies opposed to his candidacy.\u201cThese are Maalox months for everyone,\u201d said Bruce Haynes, a public-relations consultant at Purple Strategies, a Virginia-based bipartisan communications firm. \u201cIf this is going to look like 1968, there will be people that say, \u2018That\u2019s not where I want my product placement,\u2019 \u201d he added, referring to clashes between the police and protesters at the Democratic convention in Chicago.The Color of Change campaign is now being joined by Hispanic, Muslim and women\u2019s rights organizations. While Coke has been the focus of the convention push so far, the advocacy groups have also been in contact with Google, Cisco and AT&T and said the companies would be targeted if they did not withdraw their contributions and vow to give no more.She added, \u201cWell, there\u2019s no greater threat to women and people of color in this country than Donald Trump.\u201dRepresentatives from Cisco and AT&T issued statements pointing to their technological support for both parties\u2019 conventions in the past. They indicated that they would offer the same in-kind assistance this year, while emphasizing that their support was aimed at benefiting the democratic process. They declined to comment further.In a letter sent to Coca-Cola last month, Color of Change implored the company to withdraw its support for the Republican convention, saying the move would be \u201ca sign of corporate leadership.\u201dThe push by Color of Change got the attention of the Coca-Cola executives, who quietly reached out to Mr. Robinson, the group\u2019s executive director, and, in a series of previously undisclosed telephone calls and email exchanges, sought to mollify the activist group.\u201cWe walked them through what a public campaign would look like,\u201d Mr. Robinson recalled, explaining that he described possible protests outside Coca-Cola headquarters and in Cleveland against the company.Coca-Cola has not sought a refund of the $75,000 it gave to the Republican convention, nor has it agreed to refuse to make in-kind contributions.Other companies are hoping to avoid the controversy altogether. Some trade groups, including ones representing airlines and broadcasters, say they are planning to take a smaller role at both parties\u2019 conventions this year.In addition to the strong feelings Mr. Trump generates, there are fears that fewer elected officials, to whom sponsors like to gain access at conventions, might attend if Mr. Trump is the nominee.The question of corporate involvement is not the only challenge. For the first time since the Nixon era, federal funds will not be provided to defray the cost of the conventions, putting a greater burden on the parties to raise money.Conventions are unwieldy productions that often exceed their budgets. In 2012, Mitt Romney\u2019s national finance team helped raise money to cover the costs of the Republican convention in Tampa, Fla., and in 2004, when the Republican Party had its convention in New York, Michael R. Bloomberg, then the mayor, wrote a personal check to cover the host committee\u2019s $2 million shortfall.Ashley Parker contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Lurid Suit Over Hate Mail Embroils Isaac Perlmutter, Marvel Chief", "Date": "2016-03-07", "News": "Supported byDealBookNow you can add a bizarre litigation involving Isaac Perlmutter, the enigmatic billionaire chief executive of the Marvel Entertainment unit of the Walt Disney Company.Befitting a Palm Beach imbroglio, the dispute began over a local tennis pro. Now, at least three lawsuits later, a neighbor of Mr. Perlmutter has accused him and his wife of sending slanderous letters, unsigned, that say the neighbor \u201csexually assaulted\u201d an 11-year-old \u201cat knife-point\u201d and murdered a local couple.The hate-mail campaign, which included more than a thousand letters sent to the neighbor\u2019s friends and business associates, is said to be part of an effort by Mr. Perlmutter to pressure the neighbor, Harold Peerenboom, to leave the gated community where they both own homes. One of the letters started, \u201cToday I write you to warn you about Harold Peerenboom of 8 Sloans Curve Road who is a sexual predator.\u201dMr. Peerenboom, who has never been accused of these crimes, is now trying to compel Marvel to produce Mr. Perlmutter\u2019s emails.A spokesman for Marvel declined to comment, saying it does not discuss personal matters involving Mr. Perlmutter.The case is an example of the strange and sometimes high stakes private legal battles that take place among executives of public companies but that don\u2019t always spill into public view.Such cases raise a thicket of corporate governance questions. There are often disclosure questions surrounding senior executives\u2019 health problems. Corporate C.E.O.s including Steven P. Jobs at Apple, Jamie Dimon at JPMorgan Chase and Oscar Munoz at United Airlines have in recent years grappled with how to go public about health problems.But what\u2019s the responsibility of a public company to investigate a controversial private matter involving a senior executive? Does it need to conduct its own inquiry? At what point would it suspend an executive before a ruling is reached? Or should a private legal matter have no bearing on an executive\u2019s work?\u201cIf you become a lightning rod, it can negatively impact the company,\u201d said Charles M. Elson, a professor of finance and director of the John L. Weinberg Center for Corporate Governance at the University of Delaware. Mr. Elson said that private affairs could lead to distraction at work and could affect the executive\u2019s ability to fulfill his responsibilities. \u201cIt\u2019s very subjective. That\u2019s why you have a board.\u201dThe last public photograph of Mr. Perlmutter was taken in 1985, despite his being Marvel\u2019s chief executive and one of Disney\u2019s largest individual shareholders. He has never given an interview to the media while running Marvel, despite the Disney unit\u2019s influence over American entertainment with its Iron Man, Captain America and X-Men franchises.Mr. Perlmutter\u2019s lawyer, as you might imagine, has denied he had anything to do with the letters. He has contended the case is a shakedown and suggests that Mr. Peerenboom, a Toronto businessman who founded a successful executive search firm, is a serial litigator.Mr. Peerenboom\u2019s side says that the evidence is clear and convincing. His case has withstood multiple efforts to have it dismissed; in each instance, a judge has said that there is enough evidence to proceed.The story took a particularly strange turn last year when Mr. Peerenboom\u2019s legal team said that a private lab had found a direct DNA match on the outside of one of the sent envelopes, implicating Mr. Perlmutter\u2019s wife, Laura.Mr. Perlmutter\u2019s lawyers say that the DNA evidence was planted and is inadmissible in court. The lawyers contend that Mr. Peerenboom\u2019s legal team stole DNA samples from water bottles and papers that the Perlmutters used and touched during a deposition.Both sides have hired high-powered lawyers. Mr. Perlmutter retained Roy Black, who helped William Kennedy Smith successfully defend against rape charges in Palm Beach. Mr. Peerenboom hired the New York litigator Marc E. Kasowitz, who has represented Donald J. Trump.At the center of the case is Karen D. Donnelly, who ran the tennis program inside the Sloans Curve community. She was a favorite of Mr. Perlmutter, an avid tennis player.Mr. Peerenboom, who moved into the community in 2007, learned that Ms. Donnelly worked without a contract and had not bid for the work, which he claimed amounted to bid-rigging under Florida law. He made his objection to the arrangement known to the homeowners\u2019 organization. But the board, nudged by Mr. Perlmutter, overruled Mr. Peerenboom and reworked the agreement with Ms. Donnelly so she didn\u2019t have to submit a competitive bid to run the tennis complex.Ms. Donnelly then filed a lawsuit against Mr. Peerenboom and others \u2014 paid for by Mr. Perlmutter \u2014 contending she had been slandered.Then the hate-letter writing campaign began, Mr. Peerenboom says, coinciding with specific efforts to have Ms. Donnelly removed.Mr. Peerenboom\u2019s neighbors in Sloans Curve as well as his business associates in Canada began receiving letters saying Mr. Peerenboom was a child molester. Another claimed he killed Rochelle Wise and David Pichosky, who were found dead from asphyxiation in 2013; that case remains unsolved.Another batch of letters was sent to inmates of state and federal prisons on stationary purporting to be from Mr. Peerenboom insulting them. Some of the letters included \u201cHebrew slang and vulgarities,\u201d according to a court filing.\u201dOn Wednesday, a judge will address the question of whether Marvel must search its servers for evidence of Mr. Perlmutter\u2019s connection to the letters.Last week, Marvel produced some emails, but Mr. Kasowitz said that many others have not been turned over and contended that Mr. Perlmutter was asserting \u201cattorney-client privilege over hundreds of additional responsive emails \u2014 even though he claimed to have no control over the Marvel emails in the first place.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Even to import charcoal made from the sicklebush that grows in vast stretches across the island.But 15 months after American prospectors began swarming Havana, filling hotels and hiring consultants, only a handful have inked deals to do business with the once-forbidden island.As President Obama prepares to visit Cuba this month, the lack of trade with the former foe threatens to sap momentum from the process of building relations. It is also a reminder that beyond tourism \u2014 which satisfies Cuba\u2019s need for foreign currency and the desire of Americans to visit the island \u2014 the countries have very different visions of economic engagement.\u201cThe litmus test of normalization is trade and investment,\u201d said Robert Muse, a Washington lawyer who specializes in Cuba-related law. \u201cThat\u2019s how the Obama legacy will be judged.\u201dEager to show results, the Obama administration in late January made the biggest breach yet in the embargo by permitting Americans to trade with state-owned companies, which control much of Cuba\u2019s commerce and are run, mostly, by the military.The move was a concession to reality: Efforts at opening commerce had, until then, targeted everyday Cubans. But with the island\u2019s trade apparatus controlled by the state, trying to sell American cement to Cuban homeowners or stoves to privately owned restaurants is impractical and of little interest to the Cuban government.The Obama administration has \u201caccepted the fact that they have to do business with Cuban state enterprise,\u201d Mr. Propst said. The administration is expected to loosen restrictions on trade and travel even further and announce new commercial deals with Cuba before Mr. Obama\u2019s arrival on March 21.The European Union, meanwhile, signed an agreement with Cuba on Friday to establish normal relations. If ratified by its member states, it will open the way for full cooperation and commercial ties between Cuba and Europe.That rule book is restrictive. Foreigners are barred from buying most property in Cuba, so Americans can only covet the beautiful, crumbling mansions of downtown Havana.The Cuban government usually insists on holding a majority stake in any joint venture outside the new development zone at the port of Mariel, near Havana, where foreign companies can wholly own ventures and receive a 10-year tax holiday. State-owned companies often ask for up to a year to pay for goods, not the customary 90 days.Still, some American businesses have prospered. Airbnb began operating in Cuba in April; Sprint now has a roaming agreement\u00a0with the Cuban state telecommunications company, Etecsa. Cleber, an Alabama company, received a license in February from the Treasury Department \u2014 and has an agreement with the Cuban government \u2014 to assemble simple tractors in Cuba to sell to private farmers and cooperatives. Florida Produce, a grocer in Tampa, Fla., has a license from the Treasury to open a distribution warehouse in Cuba and is in talks with the Cuban authorities.But threading the needle between Cuba\u2019s rigid rules and the restrictions that the United States continues to impose is tricky.John S. Kavulich, the president of the U.S.-Cuba Trade and Economic Council, said he had counted about 500 visits to Cuba by American businesspeople since December 2014 and more than 140 visits by United States representatives and officials. But, he said, he could count the number of business deals they had reached on his fingers. Penny Pritzker, the commerce secretary, said the next day that her department had granted American companies billions of dollars\u2019 worth of authorizations to do business in Cuba.In interviews, American entrepreneurs, business lawyers and consultants described a culture gap that often seems the size of the Florida Straits, with Americans expecting swift decisions and baffled by the time and meetings required to get answers from Cuban officials.Kevin Ellis, the chief executive of Cayuga Milk Ingredients, a dairy company in Auburn, N.Y., met with officials at Alimport, a state import company, in Havana in April about selling milk powder. The officials were polite, said Mr. Ellis, who was part of a whirlwind delegation led by Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo of New York. But they seemed more interested in talking about the embargo than about milk, he said.On his return, Mr. Ellis twice emailed Alimport, in Spanish, about sending samples, but did not get a response.\u201cI took that as a \u2018No,\u2019\u00a0\u201d he said.Internet access, for example, has improved only marginally over the past year, and political oppression continues, said Mr. Medina, an engineer who does aerial mapping. Business cannot thrive in \u201cthis controlled environment,\u201d he said.Some Americans have only a vague grasp of the United States regulations or of the kind of business they are pursuing, lawyers and consultants said. Even when advised that their proposal will not be successful, some still insist on visiting Havana.Mr. Peters said those who do succeed in making deals \u201care prepared to have extended dialogue in Cuba and go and return.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not done by a quick visit and follow-up by email,\u201d he said.Saul Berenthal, a co-founder of Cleber, the tractor company, who was born in Cuba and spent part of his childhood there, said he had studied Cuban and American regulations in detail and then identified a gap in the Cuban market: small tractors that do not require sophisticated parts.\u201cI spend a lot of time understanding the social context in Cuba,\u201d Mr. Berenthal said.Meanwhile, applications for licenses from United States officials take months to process, as officials grapple with business proposals for which there is no precedent.Ambar Diaz, a Miami lawyer who handled Cleber\u2019s application, said it had taken seven months to get the license for the tractor project. She has been waiting four months for a license for a Hollywood filmmaker who wants to film in Cuba, and has another license pending to import charcoal from a group of Cuban entrepreneurs.\u201cMy job is to test the limits of the regulations,\u201d she said.The most important change that United States regulators could make \u2014 and that many expect will be made before Mr. Obama\u2019s trip \u2014 is to lift a ban on using dollars in transactions with Cuba, lawyers and consultants said. The ban means that legitimate trade with Cuba has to be financed through complicated, three-way operations or simply does not happen because no bank wants to handle it.Lifting that restriction would \u201ctake many of the excuses away from Cuba\u201d for holding up business deals, Mr. Kavulich said.Mr. Muse predicted that the Obama administration would continue to relax restrictions during its remaining months, regardless of how Cuba responds.The notion of the process as quid quo pro is false, he said, adding, \u201cYou cannot deal in conditionalities with the Cubans.\u201dAdvertisement"}

He and an accomplice, Anis Bahri, 32, are believed to have visited Syria between late 2014 and early 2015, Mr. Molins said. After returning to Europe, he said, they traveled back and forth among France, Belgium and the Netherlands.Mr. Molins said that investigators had not uncovered a specific target or date for the planned attack and were trying to identify other accomplices. Under questioning, he said, Mr. Kriket denied being a terrorist, said he had rented the Argenteuil apartment on behalf of someone whom he would not name, and said the unidentified man and an accomplice were the bomb makers.Mr. Ameroud was also linked to an Afghan and Pakistani network suspected of training would-be jihadists in a forest near Paris and in the French Alps. He was convicted of participation in a terrorist enterprise in 2007 and was thought to have been deported to Algeria after serving his sentence.On Wednesday, a court in Brussels delayed proceedings against him and Rabah M. to April 7, at the request of their lawyers.Officials are seeking a third airport attacker and, according to Belgian reports, another person involved in the subway blast.European nations have come under increasing scrutiny for their response to terrorism. On Wednesday, President Obama\u2019s top counterterrorism adviser, Lisa O. Monaco, criticized allies, including France and Belgium, for failing to reduce barriers to the sharing of intelligence among agencies, as the United States did after the Sept. 11 attacks.Ms. Monaco\u2019s remarks, at a security conference at the University of Texas at Austin, were one of the Obama administration\u2019s sternest rebukes of its European partners since the Paris and Brussels attacks.\u201cIt\u2019s fair to say that they have not had the same reaction that we did after we had 9/11,\u201d which was \u201cto share information amongst ourselves and to get into a position to share it very rapidly with our international partners,\u201d Ms. Monaco said.Hours before Ms. Monaco spoke, Ard van der Steur, the Dutch minister for security and justice, said it had been the intelligence division of the New York Police Department, not the F.B.I., that warned the Netherlands on March 16 that the Bakraoui brothers had links to terrorism.Mr. van der Steur had previously testified before Dutch lawmakers that the warning came from the F.B.I., but in a statement on Wednesday, he said he had misspoken. It was not clear how the police in New York had become aware of the brothers.Aurelien Breeden reported from Paris, and Lilia Blaise from Brussels.

{"Headline": "French Lit, Stripes and Cigarettes at Sonia Rykiel", "Date": "2016-03-22", "News": "Supported byCritical ShopperLike procreating or planting flowers or even just exfoliating your skin with a washcloth, spring cleaning is a process of renewal that is available, in some form, to every human on earth.It\u2019s also a shared experience that can be profoundly solitary: We clean and declutter alone, even if we do it alongside friends or family. Only you, after all, are equipped to make a decision about the memorabilia that haunts your closet \u2014 the striped shirt swiped from a college boyfriend 10 years ago, the vintage Mongolian fur hat that makes you look demented or fanciful depending on your coat, the questionable brogues.I cleaned out my closet last week and, in a torrent of frenzied decontamination, went overboard with the purging and donating.When I finished, every streak of color was gone. The remaining clothes were white, beige or black. My closet looked like a hotel lobby bathroom. It had a soporific effect. It needed seasoning.What to do?Why, add a few spicy morsels, of course. The new Sonia Rykiel store uptown seemed like a potential source of invigorating agents. The French label is known for its kicky striped knitwear, a look popularized by Ms. Rykiel in the early 1960s.In 2014, Julie de Libran was appointed artistic director after the label waffled in the wake of its founder\u2019s departure as creative director. Ms. de Libran has injected fresh life with her playful, print-happy collections.Now she has opened a store on Madison Avenue \u2014 and not just a store, but a grand gesture: 2,000 square feet of stomping ground on one of the ritzier blocks in Upper East Side shopping territory, right across from Lanvin and Dolce & Gabbana.With its apple-red lacquered walls and floor-to-ceiling bookshelves, the store is eye-catching in a way that makes passers-by halt, whip off their sunglasses and peer inside. The air is scented with a rosewater-tinged infusion (\u201cIt comes in through the air-conditioners,\u201d a saleswoman whispered), and the shelves are stocked with vintage paperbacks by Fran\u00e7oise Sagan, Stendhal, Victor Hugo and Andr\u00e9 Malraux.A custom carpet is woven with cartoonish books, pencils, eyeballs, lips and cigarettes, which is the first time in years that I\u2019ve seen a non-cigarette brand acknowledge the existence of cigarettes. (An American version of this carpet would feature an iPhone, a green juice and a turmeric supplement. I like Rykiel\u2019s rendition.)The clothing stands up to its environment. I zoomed in on a rack of grapefruit-size pompoms made from turkey feathers dyed in acid-trip hues: banana, fern, cerulean ($220). The pompoms were affixed to either a silk ribbon or an oversize safety pin. They weighed nothing.\u201cHow would a person wear this?\u201d I asked a saleswoman.\u201cOn the runway, they wore them on the wrist,\u201d she said, demonstrating the accessory\u2019s placement like a flight attendant miming safety procedures. \u201cOr you can wear them in your hair\u201d (she mimed this, too), or on a bag (mimed) or \u2014 this is my favorite place \u2014 right on your shoulder.\u201dIn theory the shoulder seems like an odd place for a single pompom, but the saleswoman\u2019s demonstration was compelling.\u201cI love fuzzy things,\u201d she said.Me, too.Other items offered a similarly multisensory experience, like a pair of glitter-encrusted tennis shoes ($425) and a fluttering pleated dress ($2,190) in creamsicle polyester (though it should have been chiffon, at that price).A tweedy cropped jacket with rainbow stripes ($1,490) looked edible on the rack \u2014 like precisely the right element to wear with jeans or to work over a silk dress \u2014 and the saleswoman slid it onto my shoulders. I had been semiconsciously shedding layers and she had correctly interpreted the momentum of my stripping. I looked in the mirror. Oh, dear. On a taller person, the fit would have been slouchy. I looked like a garden gnome.\u201cMaybe with slimmer pants, it would work,\u201d I thought. \u201cMaybe with some tailoring.\u201d But the tailoring would need to be intensive. I bid goodbye to the jacket and assured myself that I could always return to it online. You can find most of the store\u2019s items online, though Rykiel\u2019s e-commerce presentation is a low-fat plain-yogurt version of the store\u2019s ice cream sundae.This occurred to me as a woman and her teenage daughter wandered inside. The teenager moved pompomward. Her mother gazed at the store\u2019s vast array of books.\u201cThere must be thousands,\u201d she murmured.\u201cThere are,\u201d a saleswoman confirmed. \u201cFeel free to borrow anything you\u2019d like to read.\u201d\u201cReally?\u201d the woman squawked.(I squawked, too.

{"Headline": "Trade Deficits: These Times are Different", "Date": "2016-03-28", "News": "In normal times, the counterpart of a trade deficit is capital inflows, which reduce interest rates, and there\u2019s no reason to believe that trade deficits reduce employment on net, even if they do redistribute it.

{"Headline": "The Plot to Take Down a Fox News Analyst", "Date": "2016-03-01", "News": "FeatureFor years, Wayne Simmons claimed to be a former C.I.A. operative. Then one ex-spook got suspicious.Supported byClizbe grew up poor in Halifax County, North Carolina, raised by a single mother. In 1980, after failing out of East Carolina University, he joined the Air Force. Aptitude tests revealed a gift for languages, so Clizbe enrolled in intensive Vietnamese courses and then was shipped to the Philippines, where he spent three years monitoring Vietnamese radio communications. When his tour ended, he went back to school at Southern Illinois University. On campus, he fell in love with a Malaysian girl, who told him that if he wanted to marry her, he would have to convert to Islam. He converted, married her and followed her back to Southeast Asia, where he found work at a refugee camp in the Philippines. Clizbe made frequent trips to her hometown outside Kuala Lumpur, where he immersed himself in the local customs.He and his wife lived in Asia for a year before finding jobs at the business college at King Saud University in Qassim Province in Saudi Arabia. He taught English as a second language and made the pilgrimage to Mecca. It was 1988, and the war in Afghanistan was dragging on. At the mosque on Fridays, Clizbe would hear calls for young men to travel east and wage jihad against the communists.After returning to the United States in 1990, Clizbe earned a master\u2019s degree in linguistics and studied business and instructional design. While he searched for a job, he sometimes paid the bills by working the phones at a venereal-disease hotline. He was eventually hired by the C.I.A. as an operations officer.He was sent to an island overseas, where he worked a day job unrelated to his real responsibilities. At night he recruited spies. His experiences in the Philippines, Malaysia and Saudi Arabia all came in handy. \u2018\u2018You have to understand your target and immerse yourself in his or her culture and the context from which they come,\u2019\u2019 he said. \u2018\u2018Do they have access to something of interest to you? Are they suitable to do what you want them to do? What are their motivations? What problems do they have that I can solve? Solve their problems, and they\u2019ll become your best friend forever.\u2019\u2019 (This fixation on immersion was a big reason Clizbe practiced Islam in the Muslim world; he stopped going to mosques, for the most part, after leaving.) He told me that during his first overseas tour, he probably recruited as many spies as anybody else in his region. \u2018\u2018I was really, really good at what I did,\u2019\u2019 he said. \u2018\u2018Never pitched somebody who said no. This process of elicitation is really like the slow hitching up of a woman\u2019s skirt.\u2019\u2019In the fall of 2010, Clizbe was summoned from his Northern Virginia home to a restaurant at Baltimore-Washington International Airport for lunch with a Department of Defense contractor named Kerry Patton. The two had grown friendly on an email list affiliated with the International Association for Intelligence Education. The lunch was Patton\u2019s idea; he wanted Clizbe to meet a mentor of his, Wayne Simmons. Simmons had served in the C.I.A. for 27 years and appeared regularly as an analyst on Fox News. He was \u2018\u2018all Kerry could talk about,\u2019\u2019 Clizbe recalls.Though Simmons had become well known to people in that right-wing media circle, Clizbe didn\u2019t know his name. He never encountered Simmons during his days with the C.I.A. \u2014 it\u2019s a massive, compartmentalized organization, after all \u2014 and he didn\u2019t have cable TV. Still, Simmons and Clizbe should have had plenty to discuss. Their political leanings were similar enough. Simmons claimed to be \u2018\u2018far right of Attila the Hun.\u2019\u2019 But something about Simmons didn\u2019t sit right with Clizbe.Over lunch, it seemed to Clizbe that Simmons was oblivious to the routine \u2018\u2018butt-sniffing\u2019\u2019 that C.I.A. veterans routinely engage in: questions about time spent at the \u2018\u2018Farm\u2019\u2019 and about stints in war zones. Simmons said he had operated separately from Langley; he hinted at brazen operations against drug cartels, opining on the painful isolation of an operative\u2019s existence. \u2018\u2018\u2009\u2018You and me, we know what it\u2019s like,\u2019\u2009\u2019\u2019 Clizbe recalls him saying. \u2018\u2018\u2009\u2018It\u2019s how we have to live our lives.\u2019\u2009\u2019\u2019Clizbe added: \u2018\u2018He was so full of bluster that anybody who hadn\u2019t been in the C.I.A. would have had their socks knocked off. But the things he said were so not C.I.A.\u2019\u2019Five years later, in October of last year, Simmons \u2014 who, as a frequent guest on Fox News discussing intelligence matters, had become a prominent commentator on national security \u2014 was arrested for fraud, on charges that (among other things) he used a fictitious background in the C.I.A. to gain real government contract work. Today, the garrulous 62-year-old is under house arrest pending trial. He claims that he was done in by a vindictive Obama administration, which is taking advantage of the fact that his agency past, while real, is almost unfathomably classified. \u2018\u2018Nobody could see us,\u2019\u2019 he said. \u2018\u2018Nobody knew who we were. The program I was in was so black it made the black hole seem white.\u2019\u2019Fox News may have been surprised by the allegations, as were many close to Simmons, but doubts about his background had percolated for years within Clizbe\u2019s social network of ex-spooks, and they began in earnest at that fateful lunch in 2010. As Clizbe drove home, his thoughts drifted to a passage from George MacDonald Fraser\u2019s 1969 novel \u2018\u2018Flashman,\u2019\u2019 about a wealthy misfit who, because of a series of misunderstandings, earns a reputation as a war hero. It opens on the fraudulent narrator considering a portrait of himself: \u2018\u2018I can look at the picture above my desk, of the young officer .\u2009.\u2009. tall, masterful and roughly handsome .\u2009.\u2009. and say that it is the portrait of a scoundrel, a liar, a cheat, a thief, a coward \u2014 and, oh yes, a toady.\u2019\u2019Soon after that, Fox bookers started calling, inviting him to appear on more shows: Rita Cosby, Neil Cavuto, Bill O\u2019Reilly, Hannity and Colmes. Not only was Simmons a good talker, he was also courteous, dependable and willing to make the trek from his home in Annapolis, Md., to the bureau in Washington whenever he was needed. And he was a guest, not a contributor, so he worked free.By the time of the invasion of Iraq in 2003, Simmons was a regular on the network, talking primarily about terrorism. His tidy gray mustache and smoky-lensed glasses lent him an air of mystery. Everything else about his appearance \u2014 the fullback\u2019s neck, razor-sharp jawline and power suits \u2014 amplified his message of American supremacy through force. His opinions were cartoonishly belligerent. He defended the enhanced-interrogation techniques employed by the Bush-era C.I.A. In 2005, after Al Jazeera broadcast footage of Ayman al-Zawahri calling for jihad on the West, Simmons suggested one way to contain the terrorist\u2019s message was to \u2018\u2018locate Al Jazeera and blow them off the map.\u2019\u2019 He urged lawmakers to consider a moratorium on the construction of mosques in the United States. After The Times exposed the Bush administration\u2019s covert terrorist-finance-tracking program in 2006, he suggested the paper\u2019s sources ought to be imprisoned and maybe even face a firing squad.In 2005, Simmons was invited to join a Defense Department effort called the Retired Military Analysts program. Started in 2002 during the Bush administration\u2019s push for a U.S. invasion of Iraq, the program recruited retired military officers who had high-profile jobs as cable-news experts to be Defense Department \u2018\u2018message force multipliers.\u2019\u2019 They were given regular briefings from Donald Rumsfeld, then the secretary of defense, as well as access to other high-ranking department officials. There were trips to Iraq and Guant\u00e1namo Bay. It was all done in an effort to win favorable but independent-seeming news coverage for the administration\u2019s foreign policy.Cable-news bookers typically do not run extensive background checks. Standards vary from show to show, but according to producers and bookers I spoke with, a cursory look at an expert\u2019s website is usually sufficient. (In a statement, Fox News said its vetting procedure is as thorough as possible.) But it\u2019s somewhat more surprising that the Retired Military Analysts program did not include a thorough check, either. While many participants in the program did have top-secret clearances, program events were \u2018\u2018no clearance necessary\u2019\u2019: Any time Simmons wanted to visit the Pentagon or hop on a jet to Iraq, he simply submitted his date of birth, Social Security number and a photo ID for a check that verified only that he was an American citizen and wasn\u2019t on any watch lists.One of Clizbe\u2019s specialties in the C.I.A. and in his post-agency career as an intelligence consultant was \u2018\u2018deception detection.\u2019\u2019 He had even codified his method, which he calls the \u2018\u2018holistic contextual credibility assessment system.\u2019\u2019 Clizbe doesn\u2019t believe in polygraph machines and other standard lie-detection techniques. They function, he says, from the flawed assumption that people from all cultures have the same physical and psychological reactions when they lie. After all, famous American traitors like Aldrich Ames passed polygraphs while spying for the enemy. True deception detection requires a far deeper cultural immersion. \u2018\u2018I am what Wayne was pretending to be,\u2019\u2019 he says. \u2018\u2018He was stepping into my context. I\u2019ve lived it, thought about it, pondered it academically and philosophically. Wayne never saw me coming.\u2019\u2019Still, there\u2019s no number to call at the C.I.A. about that sort of business \u2014 no desk dedicated to fact-checking wild claims nor, for obvious reasons, any public access to the agency\u2019s roster. The C.I.A. also has a policy against confirming or denying questions about employment. (The agency declined to comment on the Simmons prosecution, except to say that it is working closely with the Justice Department on the case.) There was also the simple difficulty of proving a negative. Clizbe had been an executive recruiter for clients in Silicon Valley for two years after he quit the C.I.A. in 1999, which taught him to approach such epistemological quandaries the other way around. \u2018\u2018I never vetted a candidate by starting with the hypothesis that they weren\u2019t qualified for a job,\u2019\u2019 he says. \u2018\u2018I tried to prove that they were qualified. If the evidence proves that they aren\u2019t, then I\u2019ve falsified the hypothesis.\u2019\u2019He set out to see if he could prove that Simmons was a former C.I.A. employee. Running into old C.I.A. colleagues at the Raleigh Spy Conference or at meetings of the Association of Former Intelligence Officers or the C.I.A. Retirees Association, Clizbe folded his inquiries into conversations with dozens of former spooks. Who is this guy? Seen him around? Ever work with him? Know anybody who has? He was especially interested in those who had worked at the Crime and Narcotics Center (C.N.C.), which was the division of the C.I.A. that he figured Simmons claimed to be a part of. But none of the former agents, even from the C.N.C., remembered working with him or even hearing about him.By the spring of 2011, Clizbe was convinced that there was no way to confirm Simmons\u2019s claims, so he reached out to his former boss, M., an irascible older man who had been a high-ranking Senior Intelligence Service officer. (He insisted on being identified only by his middle initial.) M. spent about 40 years with the C.I.A., both on the staff and as a contract worker, ascending to its highest ranks. He knew of Simmons \u2014 he consumed Fox News regularly \u2014 and had figured Simmons might have been an obscure contractor at the agency. Clizbe pointed out the irregularities in Simmons\u2019s biography, and M. became convinced he was a fraud.M. alerted Paul Vallely, the retired two-star general who founded Stand Up America, an organization that promotes a conservative foreign-policy agenda through analysis on cable-news networks and talk radio. Vallely met Simmons through Fox News and invited him to serve on the Citizens\u2019 Commission on Benghazi, a collection of military brass, C.I.A. officers and politicians determined to uncover the truth about the September 2012 embassy attack in Libya. M. remained suspicious when Vallely failed to respond after a month. (Vallely declined to comment for this article, citing Simmons\u2019s coming trial.)M. also contacted Gary Berntsen, a decorated former C.I.A. counterterrorism officer and onetime Republican Senate candidate from New York. Berntsen made occasional appearances on Fox News and wasn\u2019t surprised by M.\u2019s message. \u2018\u2018When I started doing television, senior agency guys were calling me on the phone and telling me: \u2018That guy\u2019s on television, he goes on the network you are on, he\u2019s a fraud. Please tell them,\u2019\u2009\u2019\u2019 Berntsen says. While waiting in the greenroom one day before going on Judge Jeanine\u2019s show, Berntsen was approached by Col. David Hunt, a retired officer who had done special-operations work.\u2018\u2018\u2009\u2018Can I ask you something?\u2019\u2009\u2019\u2019 Berntsen recalls Hunt saying. \u2018\u2018\u2009\u2018This guy Wayne Simmons, is he a fraud?\u2019\u2018\u2018Of course he\u2019s a fraud,\u2019\u2019 Berntsen said he replied. \u2018\u2018He\u2019s a blithering idiot.\u2019\u2019According to Berntsen, Hunt said that he too had been suspicious of Simmons and intended to inform Bill Shine, a senior programming executive at the network. He suspected Fox would heed Hunt\u2019s warning. (Hunt did not respond to requests for comment.) But then, one morning, Berntsen was at the network\u2019s studios to make an appearance on a radio show, and he bumped into Simmons. He asked Simmons what division of the C.I.A. he had served in. \u2018\u2018If you\u2019re an agency officer, you know exactly what to say,\u2019\u2019 Berntsen told me. But Simmons\u2019s response was, he said, \u2018\u2018bloody [expletive] gibberish.\u2019\u2019This assessment could be correct. Publicly available information on Simmons\u2019s life after 1973, when he left the Navy, reveals a certain sort of aimlessness that doesn\u2019t jibe with a career in the C.I.A. He worked as a headwaiter at Pisces, a nightclub in Georgetown, and as a manager for Making Waves, an adult-entertainment hot-tub complex in College Park, Md. He played semipro football for the Baltimore Eagles and, in 1978, was invited to try out with the New Orleans Saints. He played defensive back for them before being cut early in the season. In July 1980 he got into an argument with three men in a nightclub parking lot and shot at them with his 9 millimeter Walther \u2014 the sort of handgun James Bond carries. He pleaded guilty to assault and transporting a firearm and received probation.In 1983, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms and the F.B.I. received a tip that Simmons was looking to purchase large quantities of Uzis, grenades and surface-to-air missiles. Undercover agents began meeting with Simmons late at night, in an effort to draw him out. Simultaneously, the Prince George\u2019s County Police Department vice squad learned of a bookmaking operation that Simmons ran out of the small house he shared with his wife and two young children. The police monitored his phone activity and, after gathering enough evidence for an arrest warrant, staged a raid. In addition to gambling paraphernalia, the authorities recovered an old handgun stashed in the garage and a rifle in Simmons\u2019s bedroom. They also confiscated a safe. Simmons was charged with possession of firearms by a felon.When Simmons took the stand, an incredible story emerged. The prosecution revealed that Simmons was involved with a man named Tom Tindall, a pilot who had been caught by the United States Customs Service flying drugs into the country for the Patriarca crime family. Because Tindall decided to testify against the Boston-based organized-crime group, he had a contract on his head. Simmons claimed that the Patriarcas wanted him dead, too, simply because of his affiliation with Tindall. That, he said, was the reason for the rifle in his bedroom. As for the artillery he was looking to buy, Simmons claimed that was Tindall\u2019s idea. The two were working undercover with Customs, buying weapons so they could infiltrate \u2018\u2018anti-American forces\u2019\u2019 in South Florida and Central America. Simmons was found guilty, but his sentence was suspended and he was placed on five-year probation.In a post-trial motion to modify the conditions of Simmons\u2019s release, the prosecutor mentioned the safe seized from Simmons\u2019s bedroom. When law-enforcement officers opened the safe, they found a ledger that contained documentary \u2018\u2018evidence of large-scale narcotics activity.\u2019\u2019 Simmons, however, never faced any drug charges. The safe was barely mentioned during his trial. Simmons claims today that the lenient sentence is proof that he was working for the C.I.A. He also claims he perjured himself to cover up for his C.I.A. work. To Clizbe, though, the outcome of the trial supports his theory: Simmons was an informant. Drug charges were never pursued, perhaps, in exchange for some sort of cooperation. (Simmons denies being an informant and dismissed the notion as \u2018\u2018amateur speculation.\u2019\u2019)Clizbe\u2019s theory seems plausible, but it was still missing some vital details. The typical informant doesn\u2019t try his hand, let alone succeed, at conning his way into Pentagon public-relations programs. Clizbe eventually found what he thought was the missing piece: The 2012 obituary for Simmons\u2019s wife, Corinne, a longtime military-hospital administrator, laid out the Simmons family tree, and further digging revealed that it was a remarkable lineage. Simmons\u2019s father, Wayne Sr., joined the Navy on the day he turned 17 and was stationed at Pearl Harbor when the Japanese attacked. He served in the Pacific during the war and belonged to the Baltimore Masonic Lodge. His mother had been an F.B.I. fingerprint analyst. Simmons\u2019s sister, Patricia Bradshaw, had been the deputy under secretary of defense for civilian personnel policy. Before that, she held a number of high-ranking positions in the Defense Department and the Department of the Navy. She was married to a former admiral. (Bradshaw didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment.)Clizbe finally saw it: the black sheep of a distinguished family, disgraced with an arrest that put him in the hands of special agents. Clizbe imagined Simmons reading spy novels and watching movies, researching the history of the C.I.A., internalizing tradecraft. And then one day, he got a lucky break, finding his way onto Fox and into the Retired Military Analysts program. All of a sudden, he was eating lunch with Donald Rumsfeld at the Pentagon and making day trips to Guant\u00e1namo. He was living the life of the decorated patriot he was born to be.In late 2013, Clizbe and M. developed a plan to extract a confession from Simmons. Their method would be a good-cop/bad-cop interrogation, carried out where Simmons would least suspect it: on Facebook. M. left needling comments on Simmons\u2019s page, questioning the validity of his claims. In a series of private messages beginning Dec. 1, M. called him a liar. Simmons shot back, accusing M. of being an Obama apologist. M. responded, \u2018\u2018I agree with you politically (not an Obamatron), but .\u2009.\u2009. am convinced that your claim to be a former \u2018operative\u2019 is phony.\u2019\u2019Simmons noticed that Clizbe and M. were Facebook friends and suspected a connection, so he wrote to Clizbe in an effort to ward off further attacks: \u2018\u2018My creds are impeccable. .\u2009.\u2009. Every Federal Agency in the US gov has been up my ass for 12 years.\u2019\u2019 Clizbe responded with a message that seemed friendly yet was still intended to push Simmons closer to an admission: \u2018\u2018[M.] is about as wired into the C.I.A. as anyone living. If he\u2019s criticizing something .\u2009.\u2009. it might be worth listening to. You\u2019re welcome to reach out to him. He is not shy.\u2019\u2019 So Simmons turned back to M., again leaning on his work with the Pentagon: \u2018\u2018BTW .\u2009.\u2009. I was sent by the SECDEF, Rumsfeld, to GITMO 3 times. My clearances were good on each trip.\u2019\u2019 M. had seen a flight manifest from one of those trips, showing Simmons listed as a former C.I.A. worker. M. knew that didn\u2019t prove anything; Simmons most likely provided that description himself.The next morning, Simmons provided M. with a litany of his operations. He helped bring down the Patriarcas in Boston; he helped uncover an Iranian-American drug-smuggling ring; he orchestrated the recovery of a device stolen from a Scandinavian laboratory. He\u2019d been all over the globe: Central America, South America, Geneva, Bimini, Islamorada, Hong Kong, Macau and Kazakhstan. M. reviewed the message, line by line. He may not have been aware of every operation the C.I.A. ran, but he knew what sort of work they did. And like Clizbe, he noticed the strange jurisdictional confusion in Simmons\u2019s r\u00e9sum\u00e9 as well as the suspicious diversity of tasks and locations. Despite its swashbuckling reputation, the C.I.A. is a highly bureaucratic organization, rife with procedures, regulations and paperwork. People like M. rise through the ranks because of their ability to work that bureaucracy to their advantage. The operations Simmons claimed to have carried out, if they were real, would have been well known around the higher levels of the directorate, and M. had never heard of any of them. Moreover, if Simmons had done half the things he claimed, the agency never would have agreed to lift his cover. They most likely would have sued him for writing \u2018\u2018The Natanz Directive\u2019\u2019 or for appearing on Fox News at all.On the afternoon of Dec. 2, M. sent a note to a group of former senior C.I.A. officers whose careers would have made them familiar with the operations Simmons claimed to have worked. Nobody knew him or his supposed exploits. M. composed a stern warning to Simmons: \u2018\u2018If you continue to promote yourself as a former agency \u2018operative,\u2019 we will have to expose you publicly as a poser and a fraud.\u2019\u2019 But he also offered him a way out: either to provide his full name and date of birth so that a friend of M.\u2019s with access to the C.I.A.\u2019s records could run his name, or to provide the name of a living C.I.A. officer who could vouch for him.And then, just like that, Simmons folded. He wouldn\u2019t admit to having fabricated the operations on his r\u00e9sum\u00e9, but he was willing to entertain the idea that his bosses had been pretending to be C.I.A. \u2014 that he had been duped his entire career by some other outfit. \u2018\u2018I will cede to your wishes,\u2019\u2019 he wrote. \u2018\u2018You have my word that I will never personally hold myself out as C.I.A. again.\u2019\u2019Almost immediately, Clizbe pitched the story of this vetting operation to The Washington Times. The paper sent Simmons an email. Simmons replied, denying the accusations and claiming that he had run an \u2018\u2018intel op\u2019\u2019 to expose the link that he suspected between Clizbe and M. (This was apparently a reference to their interactions on Facebook.) It was a bold move, but Simmons was a well-known media figure. Nobody knew who Clizbe and M. were. The Washington Times rejected Clizbe\u2019s story.Clizbe had sent a draft to Simmons for comment, and as he tried to find another home for his article, Simmons offered a new and curious response. He categorically denied the accusations, which didn\u2019t surprise Clizbe. But then he changed his story completely, claiming that for 27 years, he was a sort of officer known as a NOC (Nonofficial Cover). This is the deepest cover the C.I.A. provides. Rather than working out of an embassy, NOCs often maintain a plausible career \u2014 as energy consultants, for example \u2014 and if they are caught, the C.I.A. may deny their affiliation.M. thought this explanation was absurd. If Simmons had been a NOC for almost three decades, one of M.\u2019s colleagues would have remembered his name. He began to alert Simmons\u2019s media colleagues about his and Clizbe\u2019s suspicion. One of them, a high-ranking military officer who worked as a paid contributor to Fox News, wrote: \u2018\u2018I\u2019ve had reservations for years. In my experience, some of the \u2018programs\u2019 he claims to have been a part of simply never existed. While he may have somehow been on the periphery of something, I\u2019ve seen and heard nothing to convince me he was a NOC.\u2019\u2019 M. also notified Shine, the Fox senior programming executive; the Fox legal chief Dianne Brandi; and Neil Cavuto. Nobody wrote back to him. (These emails were obtained by The Times. Fox says Shine, Brandi and Cavuto have no record of receiving the emails.)After trying and failing to pitch his story elsewhere, Clizbe eventually gave up. He contacted a former senior official at the agency, who took Clizbe\u2019s report to an assistant deputy director, close to the top of the chain. He had no idea if he would ever hear back.In papers submitted by the prosecution, Simmons is said to have repeatedly tried to use his reputation as a C.I.A. veteran to find lucrative contracting work. In 2008, he managed to pass an interim security clearance and gain entry into the U.S. Army\u2019s Human Terrain System program, which brought anthropologists into Afghanistan and Iraq to learn about local culture. Interim clearances are minimally invasive and granted on a temporary basis, pending the completion of a more intense background investigation. According to Simmons, he self-reported his criminal infractions, explaining them away as the collateral damage of a long, complicated career with the C.I.A. He went to training at Fort Leavenworth but was asked to resign before completing the program. Simmons says he resigned over a pay cut. The Army, however, cited unspecified performance problems.A manager of the Human Terrain System program told me that Simmons had found his way into the program through BAE Systems, a subcontractor that was struggling to meet personnel quotas. \u2018\u2018Wayne was like a lot of folks taking advantage of the poor screening by the BAE recruiters to draw good pay during training and then cop out,\u2019\u2019 the manager told me. \u2018\u2018We had a lot of this.\u2019\u2019 He described Simmons as \u2018\u2018a mile wide\u2019\u2019 and \u2018\u2018an inch deep.\u2019\u2019In 2009, the prosecution argues, Simmons made false statements on security-clearance forms in an effort to secure employment with the defense contractor Triple Canopy. This application led to a full background check by the State Department, which concluded that Simmons never worked for the C.I.A. in any capacity whatsoever. His top-secret clearance was denied. In 2010, he supposedly used another interim clearance to be hired as a senior intelligence adviser on NATO\u2019s anti-insurgency team in Kabul. After a time, his clearance was revoked, and he was sent back to the United States.Simmons generally failed in his attempts to fleece the government, but he succeeded elsewhere. According to the prosecution, Simmons defrauded his former girlfriend, referred to in documents as E.\u2009L. (Simmons denies any romantic involvement.) She gave him $125,000 to invest in a real estate venture, and Simmons pocketed the money. (Simmons denies this, too.) Simmons\u2019s trial is set to begin in May and, if he is found guilty, he could face decades in federal prison.The F.B.I. claims that the timing of Clizbe\u2019s investigation and their own is coincidental, but Clizbe is skeptical. During the course of his inquiry, he talked to dozens of people, and any one of them could have sounded the alarm. Additionally, Clizbe said, he submitted his article to the C.I.A.\u2019s Publications Review Board, which would have sent it to offices all around the agency and, potentially, to other federal agencies as well.After trying to publish his story about Simmons, Clizbe says, he was blacklisted by the conservative media. (When I asked Simmons about this claim, he grinned, shrugged and said, \u2018\u2018I have powerful friends.\u2019\u2019) I asked Clizbe if exposing Simmons was worth the trouble it had brought him. He insisted that it was. \u2018\u2018We cannot allow scum bags to take away honor and truth and change the meanings of those things,\u2019\u2019 he said. \u2018\u2018It\u2019s the fundamental basis of our society and culture.\u2019\u2019In the government\u2019s extensive rap sheet on Simmons, the picture that emerges is not of a cynical fraudster but of a man living in a fiction of his own creation. The U.S. attorney\u2019s office shared with me a particularly troubling police report from January 2007. Two police officers in Annapolis, Md., were called to Church Circle, right in the center of town, to break up a street fight. They arrived to find Syed Mohammed Azizur-Rehman, a 53-year-old taxi driver, lying face down on the street; nearby, they found Simmons screaming, \u2018\u2018He has a bomb!\u2019\u2019 Simmons claimed that during a ride in Azizur-Rehman\u2019s cab, the driver started ranting about his hatred of America and announced that he had a bomb in the trunk. After grabbing his cellphone, which Simmons believed to be the detonator, he forced Azizur-Rehman to stop the car and subdued him. He was a former C.I.A. officer, he told the Annapolis Police, and he advised them to call the White House or Fox News to vouch for him.A crowd assembled. Bomb dogs were called in. The driver, meanwhile, explained his side of the story. He picked up Simmons at a downtown steakhouse. Simmons hopped in, handed him a $20 bill and told him to just drive; he wouldn\u2019t say where he wanted to go. Once they reached Church Circle, with seemingly no explanation, Simmons grabbed the driver\u2019s cellphone and ordered him to stop the car. Simmons pulled Azizur-Rehman out of the car and started kicking him.Needless to say, a bomb-sniffing dog failed to find any explosive devices in the car. At the local precinct, the police called the C.I.A. and spoke to a supervisor, who advised them to \u2018\u2018take appropriate action\u2019\u2019 \u2014 whatever that meant. They called Corinne Simmons, and she told them Wayne was depressed and was supposed to be at a support group for retired government employees the previous day, but it had been canceled. Simmons was taken to the hospital for observation. No charges were ever filed. (Simmons now blames drinking and PTSD for the episode.)Simmons answered the door in gray wool slacks, a pressed navy blue shirt and blue boat shoes. At 62, he remains physically imposing and still moves with an athlete\u2019s grace, something he has retained, he said, through regular krav maga, the Israeli self-defense system. The rooms in his ornately decorated home are painted pink, burgundy and teal. He hadn\u2019t changed a thing since Corinne died in 2012, he said. He had a Rottweiler named Brutus and two irresistible Maltipoos. His shelves were covered in patriotic bric-a-brac: presidential biographies, flags and awards earned by his son, a civil servant. (His daughter, who is active in local politics, does his shopping.) On a ledge sat a signed note from Rumsfeld, thanking Simmons for some cigars, and next to it, an autographed photo of Ronald Reagan and a glossy of a gleeful handshake Simmons shared with President George W. Bush in 2006.We sat down at the kitchen table, and he produced a black binder, stuffed with documents. He began to unspool his current version of events: He dropped out of Jacksonville State to join the Navy. His service lasted less than two months before he was given a medical discharge for post-concussion syndrome. The diagnosis was phony, however: a ruse to separate from the Navy and join the C.I.A. But he wasn\u2019t recruited to be an officer, he said. He didn\u2019t go to \u2018\u2018the Farm,\u2019\u2019 the C.I.A.\u2019s famous training facility near Williamsburg, Va. Instead, he shipped off to Alaska and got a job with Mukluk Freight Lines \u2014 perfect cover. He would work four weeks and then take off to Fort Wainwright to learn tradecraft. He flipped to a printout of the Wikipedia entry on MK Ultra, the notorious C.I.A. mind-control program, and told me he was subjected to similar sorts of experiments there.The reason Clizbe and M. found his r\u00e9sum\u00e9 bizarre, he said, is that he was part of an off-the-books outfit authorized to do whatever was needed, wherever it was needed. Simmons was a saboteur, specialized in infiltrating criminal organizations or terror groups and dismantling them from the inside by inciting violence between rivals. He insinuated that he killed foreign nationals on American soil. His weapons convictions and several D.U.I.s were proof of how far outside the law he operated: Before his arrest in October, he\u2019d never spent a day in jail, he says.He showed me snapshots of buildings that he said were safe houses. Each one was accompanied by a map, their locations marked with a black X. I told him those didn\u2019t prove anything about the C.I.A.; they were just photographs of vacation cottages. He shut his binder and held it up in the air for me to ponder. \u2018\u2018Alex, you don\u2019t just wake up one morning and make this from nothing,\u2019\u2019 he said. \u2018\u2018If it appears I lived this life, it\u2019s because I did.\u2019\u2019He flipped to a binder tab marked \u2018\u2018Businesses.\u2019\u2019 He showed me articles of incorporation for consulting firms bearing opaque names like WSS International and Phoenix Management. There was Regal Limousine, which had just one car in its fleet. These were agency fronts, he claimed. \u2018\u2018The C.I.A. spent millions to make sure no one can see me,\u2019\u2019 he said.He dropped name after name, putting himself in the middle of real events that I later found news clippings about: the massive heroin bust in Washington that took down that Iranian smuggling ring, for instance. But I was never able to independently confirm his involvement in any of the events he mentioned. He vowed to send me corroborating documents but never delivered them. He promised to introduce me to former colleagues and lawyers who would verify his stories, but those offers always fell to the side.I questioned Simmons on his credentials, and he fell back, as he did with others, on his trips to Gitmo. \u2018\u2018We rode down on Air Force Two,\u2019\u2019 he said. He produced a photograph taken on the runway. \u2018\u2018I don\u2019t care who you are, you don\u2019t get on Air Force Two unless your credentials are legit.\u2019\u2019 (Allison Barber, who ran the Retired Military Analysts program, says the group never flew to Cuba on the vice president\u2019s plane during her tenure, which overlapped with Simmons\u2019s.) He pulled out a photo of him standing nose to nose with President Bush. \u2018\u2018Who did the background checks on me then?

{"Headline": "Investing for Your Future Health Care", "Date": "2016-03-25", "News": "Supported bySpecial SectionKen Dychtwald, who is 65 and is the chief executive officer of Age Wave, a consulting and research company focused on aging, decided in his 50s that he and his wife should buy long-term care insurance so they wouldn\u2019t be a burden on each other or their children if they became ill or disabled.Mark V. Pauly, 74, a professor of health care management, business economics and public policy at the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania, considered long-term care insurance and decided against it.He is \u201cself-insuring\u201d \u2014 that is, stashing enough in savings so that, hopefully, it will cover any needs that arise.Both are experts in the field of aging and both understand, more than most, the potential cost of paying for care in later years. But they took different paths in addressing those needs.Even as the debate about how to take care of an aging population grows, interest in long-term care insurance has waned. Individual market sales of long-term insurance stood at 380,000 in 1990, peaked at 750,000 in 2002 and were at the lowest figure in a quarter-century at 110,000 in 2015, according to the American Association for Long-Term Care Insurance.That slide has occurred for a number of reasons. First, insurance companies found themselves faced with more claims, and more expensive claims, than they had anticipated. Another factor is that the low interest rates of recent years mean their investments didn\u2019t earn what they once did.Companies began raising premiums on long-term care policies. Some left the business. Long-term care insurance developed a reputation for being unpredictable.Now, only about eight million Americans, of the almost 45 million who are 65 and older, have such insurance, which is usually sold to people in their 50s and 60s. The average long-term care insurance premium for a couple who are both 60 years old is $2,000 to $3,500 annually, according to the American Association for Long-Term Care Insurance. The older you get, the more difficult and more expensive it is to buy.Research shows that people who buy such insurance tend to be very conscientious and cautious.\u201cThey\u2019re the people who get their flu shots, get their mammograms, exercise, always wear seatbelts,\u201d said Kathleen McGarry, a professor of economics at U.C.L.A., whose research focuses on the well-being of the elderly. So that means the very people most likely to buy long-term care insurance are the very ones who are least likely to need it.The lack of interest in the insurance probably stems from a number of factors.One is the mistaken notion that Medicaid will help them when they need it.\u201cThe presence of Medicaid crowds out insurance,\u201d said Gopi Shah Goda, a senior research scholar at the Stanford Institute for Economic Policy Research. \u201cIt\u2019s a classic case of the more insurance provided by government, the less incentive there is to buy private.\u201d But to receive Medicaid, you must be essentially impoverished.And some people have a different worry: that long-term insurance will make it \u201ctoo easy for their kids to put them in a nursing home,\u201d Professor Pauly said.The decision is complex and tough to make because no one knows whether 24-hour care or just partial care will be needed. Insurance companies have too often oversold worst-case situations, plying people with more coverage than they need at higher premiums, said Anthony Webb, the research director at the Retirement Equity Lab at the New School for Social Research. The reality is that the average stay in a nursing home for men is 10 months, and the average for women is just over one year, he said.For Mr. Dychtwald, concern about his wife and children was the reason he decided to get long-term care insurance.He knows insurance will not cover all the costs, but says he believes it will take a large burden off his family if he becomes disabled in some way.Professor Pauly said he assessed the benefits of long-term insurance and self-insuring and decided that he preferred to put money into annuities and other funds to ensure an annual income of at least $100,000 during his retirement years to cover his long-term health care needs.Maureen Whelan, a financial planner, said that long-term insurance for her aging parents had one significant emotional benefit. \u201cIt made it easier for my parents to accept help in the home, knowing that they had paid for this type of insurance,\u201d she said. \u201cI believe it would have been quite a struggle for my siblings and I to convince my father to start paying out of pocket for home health aides.\u201dShe said she relayed her experience to clients but realized that \u201cthe decision to purchase insurance is much harder now \u2014 the premiums are so high and the benefits limited.\u201dFor years, experts have been looking at ways to revise government and private long-term insurance to make it more palatable and effective. One idea is to have payments go directly to those who need it \u2014 or their children, if they are the caregivers \u2014 rather than the nursing home or home health care. That way, children who leave their jobs to take care of their parents can receive some reimbursement.The real challenge, said Dylan Ross, a financial planner with Garrett Planning Network, is getting people to take a hard look at what various situations in the future might look like, something that is not easy when faced with the all-too-human desire to ignore unpleasant topics.\u201cWhat would I need if I had a short-term stay in a rehabilitation or a skilled nursing home?\u201d he said. \u201cWhat would I need for an extended stay? How does that affect my spouse? Should I spend on premiums or beef up my savings?\u201dOr as Ms. Whelan said, this process of imagining the future \u201cis about so much more than insurance.\u201dAlina Tugend is a writer based in New York and the author of \u201cBetter by Mistake: The Unexpected Benefits of Being Wrong.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "As Detroit Starts to Mend, Its Schools Lurch Toward Fiscal Crisis", "Date": "2016-02-29", "News": "Supported byToday in Detroit, \u201cyou see a mayor and a Council working together to rebuild this city,\u201d a triumphant Mayor Mike Duggan said in his annual State of the City speech last week.But the public school system in Detroit is now on the verge of its own fiscal crisis. Darnell Earley, the departing state-appointed emergency manager, said the Detroit Public Schools, battered by declining enrollment and debt of $3.5 billion, could run out of money by April. Some officials in Michigan have predicted that the district is headed for bankruptcy.The financing problem is adding uncertainty to a system already burdened by decrepit buildings, teacher disgruntlement, low test scores and a reputation as one of the country\u2019s most troubled school districts. Falling into default or bankruptcy could further jeopardize the education of its 45,000 children and hurt the city\u2019s fledgling recovery, officials said.The district\u2019s only salvation may be the Republican-controlled State Legislature, whose members are considering bills in both chambers that would gradually pay down hundreds of millions in debt and effectively divide the district into two parts.\u201cWithout that, all bets are off,\u201d Mr. Earley said in an interview in his office last week. \u201cThe whole thing will just kind of bottom out.\u201dMr. Duggan and other local leaders are pressing lawmakers to pass legislation in the next several weeks. \u201cWe don\u2019t have any other options,\u201d Mr. Earley said.Steven W. Rhodes, a retired judge who presided over Detroit\u2019s bankruptcy, was named on Monday by Gov. Rick Snyder as the district\u2019s \u201ctransition manager.\u201d Mr. Rhodes told school district employees in a meeting last week that he expected to stay in the role only through the summer. Mr. Snyder, a Republican, has been under fire for appointing emergency managers, with critics saying the move subsumes local oversight and control.Amber Arellano, the executive director of the Education Trust-Midwest, an education policy, research and advocacy organization in Michigan, said the Detroit schools\u2019 problems are directly tied to the city\u2019s loss of population and tax base.\u201cThe schools suffer from a lack of resources and support for teachers,\u201d she said. \u201cCharter schools, hailed as a savior for public schoolchildren, often perform worse than traditional public schools. All of this has left children in the city \u2014 and across urban districts in Michigan \u2014 with typically terribly low-performing public schools with huge talent and leadership challenges.\u201dIn the recent interview, Mr. Earley \u2014 who would not discuss Flint \u2014 said the district was in better shape than when he had found it, and he shook off criticism that he was not effective enough in solving the district\u2019s problems. \u201cYou can\u2019t just come in and automatically make them disappear,\u201d he said.He said some of the mess had slowly been cleaned up. Enrollment, which dropped to 45,000 students this year from 150,000 in 2000, had begun to stabilize. He eliminated almost 90 administrative positions and whittled down the number of departments in the district\u2019s central office.\u201cWe\u2019ve eliminated a lot of the bureaucracy,\u201d he said. \u201cI would like to think that we did what we needed to do. And we\u2019ve set the Detroit Public Schools on a course of long-term financial solvency and long-term sustainability.\u201dBut the district\u2019s financial problems are crippling, officials said. The enrollment loss has resulted in a steep decline in revenue for the district, which depends partly on per-pupil funding from the state. That has made it more difficult to reduce debt, maintain buildings and pay for fixed costs.Entering bankruptcy \u201cis not a solution,\u201d said Karol K. Denniston, a veteran bankruptcy lawyer. \u201cIt\u2019s basically a conversation about how to carve up the assets among creditors. It doesn\u2019t necessarily fix anything unless someone steps up to offer more funding.\u201dMr. Earley said he wanted the Legislature to adopt a plan supported by Mr. Snyder, which would create a new district for the existing schools and spin off the old one as a subsidiary that would exist solely to pay down debt. The debt payments \u2014 about $72 million a year for a decade \u2014 would come from the state\u2019s tobacco settlement fund, which generates close to $200 million a year. The move, Mr. Snyder said in his budget address last month, would help relieve the district\u2019s financial stress.In the Senate, a package of bills introduced by a Republican would establish an appointed interim school board for the new proposed district, gradually pay off much of the district\u2019s old debt and transfer $250 million from the state\u2019s general fund to the school district.To the dismay of Democrats, House Republicans have countered with their own bills that would relieve debt but also tack on conservative-friendly measures like curbing collective bargaining for teachers.Mr. Earley was appointed by Mr. Snyder in January 2015 after leaving the emergency manager post in Flint, where he had served since October 2013, a period in which the city switched to water from the Flint River. (He is scheduled to testify before a congressional committee examining the Flint crisis in March.)The Detroit Public Schools were already suffering financially and academically when the state imposed emergency management in 2009, but many residents have chafed at the lack of local control. Many also are critical of Mr. Earley, 64, who has spent his career in management and budget positions.\u201cA lot of things on his watch were not addressed,\u201d said Ivy Bailey, the head of the teachers\u2019 union.However, Mr. Thiel added, the emergency management system \u201chasn\u2019t worked.\u201d\u201cIt hasn\u2019t solved these problems,\u201d he said. \u201cEmergency managers can do anything they want on the spending side of the ledger, but they can\u2019t go out and raise taxes and they can\u2019t make kids come to their school district, which would increase their revenue.\u201dMr. Earley acknowledged that his exit may allow the political process to move more smoothly to address the district\u2019s debts, given the fierce opposition from many Michiganders to emergency managers.Members of the Democratic minority in the Legislature said they were eager to take action. But Brian Banks, a Democratic House member from Detroit, said the bills introduced by Republicans in the House to deal with the Detroit system\u2019s woes would take away power from the union and delay a return to an elected school board for too long \u2014 eight years.He was also troubled by provisions that would impose a grading system on individual schools. \u201cIf these reforms are good, then we should make them statewide,\u201d he said.Bankruptcy experts said school districts might threaten to enter bankruptcy but rarely took the step, partly because of the damage it would inflict on the city.\u201cIf you have a school district in bankruptcy, do you really want to move there? Do you want to expand your business there?\u201d asked James E. Spiotto, a bankruptcy lawyer and an expert on municipal bankruptcy. \u201cThe recovery of the city is inextricably entwined with the recovery of the school district.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Spotify Expected to Sign $1 Billion Financing Deal", "Date": "2016-03-29", "News": "Supported bySpotify is about to close on a $1 billion deal that would double the amount of financing the music-streaming company has raised since its founding a decade ago, people briefed on the matter said Tuesday.The money comes in the form of convertible debt, which allows Spotify\u2019s investors to change their securities into equity at a future date, said the people, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the deal was not yet public.By using convertible debt, Spotify obtains the funds, without needing to change its valuation. The terms of the debt, however, may put pressure on the company to go public sooner. The company had an equity value of $8.4 billion last year.Funds associated with the private equity firm TPG as well as the investment firm Dragoneer put in $750 million of the $1 billion, with the rest coming from other institutional investors, the people said. The transaction, which was placed by Goldman Sachs, is expected to close on Friday, they said.The terms give the investors the ability to convert to equity at a discount to an initial public offering price, two of the people briefed on the matter said. The discount increases if Spotify waits longer than a year to do so, they said. The coupon payment on the debt would also continue to rise over time, the people said.Different music streaming services have varying costs, platforms and catalog sizes. See how some of the most popular companies stack up against one another.TPG Special Situations Partners, an $18 billion fund within TPG that does transactions other than leveraged buyouts, participated in the deal, as did TPG Growth, which has invested in other start-ups like Uber and Airbnb.Spotify may use the funds for acquisitions, investments and international expansion, the people said.As consumers have turned from CDs and downloads to streaming, Spotify has developed a powerful position in the music industry, helping albums by young stars like Drake, Justin Bieber and Ed Sheeran reach high levels on the charts. The service has amassed 30 million paying users, far more than any other similar outlet.But Spotify has been challenged by Apple, which introduced a competing service, Apple Music, last year, as well as by a growing array of new streaming outlets. YouTube also introduced a paid version last year, and Pandora, which dominates Internet radio with more than 80 million listeners, is negotiating with record companies to enter the on-demand market alongside Spotify, Apple Music, Tidal and Rhapsody.Spotify, which has both free and paid versions, has also found itself on the defensive as record companies have withheld major new releases for brief periods to try to increase sales on just paid services, which tend to pay higher royalty rates. Lately, new albums by Gwen Stefani, Future and the 1975 have been withheld from Spotify in their opening weeks.For its music, Spotify depends on licensing deals with music companies. It does not have long-term contracts for two of its suppliers. Universal and Warner Music, two of the largest record companies, have had \u201cmonth to month\u201d licensing deals with Spotify for some time, according to two people with knowledge of those deals, which puts Spotify at risk of facing stricter licensing terms in the future, or even, potentially, losing that content.But as Spotify has grown more powerful, the labels and artists have come to need it as much as it needs the music companies.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Donald Trump Doesn\u2019t Understand Common Core (and Neither Do His Rivals)", "Date": "2016-03-08", "News": "Supported byCurriculum ConfusionThis is revealing, and not just because it shows Mr. Trump\u2019s ignorance of how American education actually works. He is promising to solve a problem that doesn\u2019t exist by using power the president doesn\u2019t have. His plan may also have the unintended effect of stultifying American greatness.The president can\u2019t end the Common Core, because the federal government didn\u2019t create the Common Core. Governors and state boards of education developed and voluntarily adopted the standards in reading, language and math. Some states subsequently un-adopted them, as is their right. When Congress passed a new version of the federal Elementary and Secondary Education Act last year, it prohibited the secretary of education from requiring or even encouraging states to adopt any uniform standards, Common Core or otherwise.Mr. Trump has another claim about education: that America\u2019s weak educational results will be improved by returning power to local school districts. That\u2019s a notion, widely held, that is at odds with research, common sense and the education agenda of every president, Republican and Democrat, for the past 40 years.President George H.W. Bush took up the banner next, collaborating with Bill Clinton, then the governor of Arkansas, to rally the nation\u2019s governors around high academic standards. As president, Mr. Clinton built on that idea by shepherding a new education law in 1994 that required states to develop common standards for all schools within the state, and hold schools accountable for helping students measure up. George W. Bush embraced that idea as governor of Texas, and strengthened it with the No Child Left Behind Act of 2001. President Obama supported the Common Core by using money from the 2009 economic stimulus package to finance better standardized tests and reward states that adopted challenging standards.Mr. Trump is correct that education is \u201cat\u201d a local level. Local school districts hire the principals and teachers, and experiment with methods and curriculums that they think work for their children. Most districts still have substantial autonomy to raise school taxes, though some districts aren\u2019t able to and this can lead to pervasive inequality between rich and poor districts and brings our national results down.But states and localities, in a sense, don\u2019t actually have the ability to set educational standards, even if they choose to. The world around us ultimately determines what students need to learn \u2014 the demands of highly competitive and increasingly global labor markets, the admissions requirements of colleges and universities, and the march of scientific progress.The only choice local schools have is whether they will try to meet those expectations. The Common Core is simply a way of organizing and articulating standards that already exist, for the benefit of students, parents and teachers, so that schooling makes sense when children move between different grades, schools, districts and states.Indeed, while Mr. Trump on the stump frequently complains that American test scores lag behind those of other nations, he doesn\u2019t mention that many high-achieving countries have adopted common standards for all students.But Mr. Trump, more than his rivals, has made opposition to Common Core a part of the pillar of his (admittedly thin) domestic agenda. It\u2019s an education vision that is ultimately neither liberal nor conservative. It\u2019s a repudiation of four decades of bipartisan effort, and a return to a time when children were at the mercy of whatever local schools decided they should or should not learn.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Art as Collateral in a Fickle Market", "Date": "2016-03-04", "News": "Supported byLONDON \u2014 Art and money have long been closely linked, but in the 21st century, it seems, the two have become synonymous.One way to extract the latter from the former is art-based lending, in which paintings or sculptures are used as collateral for loans. Now that the notoriously fickle and opaque art market is seemingly headed toward a downturn, with money tighter and the prices of many artworks lower, will this kind of niche financing become more attractive to collectors?Carlyle Group, the private-equity behemoth, certainly thinks so. In October, the company started Athena Art Finance Corporation, a collaboration with Banque Pictet that would use $280 million of Carlyle equity to enable owners of high-end art to tap the liquidity of their collections.Crucially, Athena is offering nonrecourse loans, exclusively secured by art works rather than other assets. Those loans can be attractive to borrowers, because the lender can lay claim only to the art in the event of a default.Art lenders who have offered full-recourse loans, secured by a range of personal assets, have faced unfavorable publicity. During the financial crisis of 2008-2009, the photographer Annie Leibovitz pledged her four homes and the rights to her images to secure a $24 million loan from Art Capital. She was unable to service the debt, and a high-profile court action ensued.\u201cThis is an opportunity,\u201d Andrea Danese, a co-founder of Athena and the company\u2019s chief executive, said in a telephone interview. Mr. Danese said there was potentially about $150 billion worth of art in private hands that could be collateralized. He identified three groups to whom his company\u2019s products might appeal.\u201cFirst, there are billionaires who put the money into private equity deals, where they make 20 to 25 percent,\u201d he said. \u201cThen there are collectors with, say, $30 million of art they leverage to buy another piece. And thirdly there are the art-rich and cash-poor in their 70s and 80s who don\u2019t want to sell because of capital gains or estate taxes.\u201dAthena offers loans of at least $1 million over six months to seven years based on a maximum of 50 percent of the low valuation of a collection or artwork. It typically charges annual interest of 7 to 9 percent, including origination fees.Athena is just one of two big self-financed lenders offering nonrecourse loans secured by art. Falcon Fine Art in London is the other. Since opening in January 2015, Falcon has arranged about $50 million in loans against high-value artworks, again at annual interest rates of about 7 to 9 percent.Larger banks, even those with art advisory facilities like Citi Private Bank, offer full-recourse loans to wealthy clients for as little as 2.5 to 3 percent a year, said Paul Ress, the managing director of the art lender Right Capital in London.\u201cArt lending is quite limited because of the affordability conundrum,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you\u2019re a high-net-worth individual, you don\u2019t need to use art solely as collateral for a loan.\u201dBut art lenders, like pawnbrokers, can get a boost when markets dip.On Monday in New York, the evening session of Phillips\u2019s \u201cNew Now\u201d auction of contemporary art, designed to kick-start the week of the Armory Show, contained a meager 23 lots, 13 of which managed to sell, raising just $1.7 million. The only work that was sold significantly above its estimate was a 1983 Jean-Michel Basquiat drawing of a snarling dog\u2019s head, estimated at $80,000 to $120,000, which drew the night\u2019s top price of $257,000.\u201cThere is a process of attrition at the moment. It\u2019s cyclical, and it\u2019s healthy for the market,\u201d said the Los Angeles entrepreneur Carlos Rivera, the founder of Art Rank, a website that uses algorithms to analyze contemporary artists as stocks to be bought, held or sold.Mr. Rivera has a new venture, Levart, that \u2014 much like the new-age pawnbrokers Borro \u2014 aims to provide liquidity at a much lower level of the market than Athena. Levart says it can provide nonrecourse financing within 12 hours, if backed by suitable contemporary works valued at as little as $5,000.The monthly interest is a hefty 4 percent for loans under $250,000. But that has not deterred art insiders from using the site to finance profitable short-term resales.Levart cites, for example, the $20,000 borrowed by a client to buy \u201cNewz!,\u201d a 2014 painting by the Los Angeles artist Math Bass. The work was then sold at Phillips in November for $81,250 against a low estimate of $25,000, reflecting the original purchase price.If the market does take a serious dip, lenders believe they can play a role in preventing a fire sale. \u201cPeople don\u2019t want to sell when things are going down in value,\u201d said Tim Hunter, the vice president of Falcon Fine Art, \u201cbut they might need to take liquidity out of their collection.\u201dWealthy art buyers certainly took plenty of liquidity out of their collections last year at Sotheby\u2019s. Throughout 2015, the auction house\u2019s finance division had an average of $733 million of full-recourse loans on its books, generating $65 million of income, according to fourth-quarter results released on Feb. 26.Those figures might not seem much compared to the company\u2019s $6 billion in auction sales, but Sotheby\u2019s 2015 auction commissions of $719 million were 5 percent less than in 2014, while income from financing rose 38 percent.For many, art collecting today is all about maximizing returns on an investment portfolio. But an auction in France last month is a reminder of the premium buyers place on collections put together without commercial considerations.On Feb. 22 and 23, the Paris auctioneer Artcurial sold the collection of Pierre Hebey, a French intellectual property lawyer who died last year at 89. The sale raised 8.9 million euros, about $9.8 million, well above the estimate of \u20ac6 million, with 85 percent of the 564 lots sold. Top price was the \u20ac845,000 paid for Roberto Matta\u2019s 1938 surrealist painting \u201cMorphologie Psychologique de l\u2019Angoisse.\u201dHebey, who counted Max Ernst and Marc Chagall among his friends, had been well-positioned to acquire 20th century art. But he was also a lifelong collector of Art Deco, 19th-century bronzes and other antiques, and he could often be found at flea markets around Paris, flashlight in hand, at five in the morning.One of his most striking purchases was Emmanuel Fr\u00e9miet\u2019s gilded bronze sculpture \u201cP\u00e9lican Gastronome,\u201d showing the bird feeding its chicks, commissioned in 1890 by the president of the Banque de France. The Petit Palais museum in Paris bought the work at the Artcurial auction for \u20ac76,200.Fabien Naudan, the vice president of Artcurial, explained why he thought buyers were so eager to bid at the Hebey sale.\u201cThey were trying to buy part of his life,\u201d said Mr. Naudan, who added that Mr. Hebey was motivated as a collector solely by his love of an object. \u201cPeople are ready to pay much more for this \u2018charge \u00e9motionnelle.\u201d\u2019How much? \u201cMaybe 20 percent,\u201d Mr. Naudan suggested.The financial industry sometimes classifies art as an \u201cinvestment of passion.\u201d Paradoxically, passion, rather than portfolio planning, seems to be the thing that ensures above-average financial returns.Advertisement"}

He has always called for repealing the health law, which he describes as a bureaucratic disaster and an economic drag. But he has repeatedly expressed enthusiasm for some of its ideas and ambitions.This mix of policies, which are quite similar to those proposed by Mr. Trump\u2019s rivals Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz, would mean millions of Americans would lose their health insurance, especially the low-income people whom Mr. Trump talks about wanting to protect. There is no bullet point for helping the people who fall through the cracks, or for preventing Americans from dying \u201con the sidewalk.\u201dMr. Trump\u2019s plan appears to be even less generous to middle-class Americans than Mr. Rubio\u2019s. Both would provide tax benefits to people who buy their own insurance \u2014 an effort to make individual insurance more like employer insurance. Mr. Rubio suggests tax credits \u2014 basically government-provided cash \u2014 to buy insurance. Mr. Trump, instead, would allow Americans to deduct the cost of health insurance from their taxable income. People with lower incomes, who pay less in taxes, would see a much smaller benefit than Americans with high incomes, who can benefit more from such a deduction.There is one place where Mr. Trump appears to break from the pack. When it comes to drugs, he argues that market competition may not be enough, and suggests that Congress needs to stand up to drugmakers. \u201cThough the pharmaceutical industry is in the private sector, drug companies provide a public service,\u201d the document says. Just what sort of public involvement he\u2019d champion is unclear. The plan says he would favor importation of foreign drugs, an interesting departure from his usual trade policies.It is possible that Mr. Trump\u2019s document, now a sketch, will be filled in later with a plan to help people with pre-existing conditions, or with some new financing system to provide health insurance for poor Americans. But, for now, the policies he has chosen to highlight won\u2019t help them. He may describe himself as more compassionate and generous on health care than his rivals, but there\u2019s a huge gulf between that rhetoric and the practical consequences of his policies.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Tinder Dating Pool Isn\u2019t Completely Shallow", "Date": "2016-03-26", "News": "Supported byBy now it was early evening, and Ms. Claudio, who now works in corporate communications, was scheduled to go on a date at a nearby bar with a guy named Ken. He turned out to be Ken Andrews, a 33-year-old surgeon in his fourth year of medical residency at N.Y.U., who thought Ms. Claudio was a \u201ctotal knockout.\u201dAfter three hours of conversation, Mr. Andrews walked her home, giving her a quick kiss at her apartment doorstep. \u201cNo way was he coming upstairs and he didn\u2019t try \u2014 that\u2019s not why I was on Tinder,\u201d said Ms. Claudio, now 33. They went out again, and they were engaged 10 months later. She is now Mrs. Andrews.Yes, they swiped right and met the one \u2014 with hardly a cheap rendezvous in sight, even though Tinder, the ubiquitous mobile-dating app, has been written off by some observers as nothing more than a vehicle to promote quick and easy hookups.Tinder users can swipe right if they think someone is attractive, or swipe left if they don\u2019t. And if the right-swiped person approves, then the duo has the ability to message, and perhaps get to know each other.But despite its critics, the app has catapulted to the top of the dating scene in places around the country, from Miami to Manhattan, thanks to its ease of use. You sign up, you swipe, you maybe land a date.And what may surprise some cynics is that Tinder is also landing spouses for more than a few of its users, including a number who have been featured in the Vows section of The New York Times.Thanks to Tinder\u2019s lowbrow reputation, some couples have lied to friends and family members about how they met. Mrs. Andrews admits that she and her husband told people they met at a bar when they first started dating. \u201cWe worried they wouldn\u2019t take us as seriously,\u201d she said.Janie Egan, a 21-year-old living in Salt Lake City, met her husband, Chris George, on Tinder as a freshman at the University of Utah. Her parents had forbidden her to use the dating app, but she thought it was fun; Mr. George, 29, was the second guy she met on the app.When she took Mr. George, who works in advertising, to a college basketball game with her parents, her father asked him, \u201cYou\u2019re not one of those Tinder boys, are you?\u201d Mr. George shook his head no. (They came clean a few weeks later, and it became a running joke that Mr. George had lied to his father-in-law the first time they met.)Still, the app has become so popular that couples are shedding some of the shame associated with meeting on it. Many are proudly incorporating Tinder into their engagement or wedding ceremonies. A spokesman for Tinder said that the company has received wedding invitations via email and regular mail, and that Sean Rad, the chief executive, and other members of the Tinder team are often asked if they would like to attend.One couple were engaged using Tinder messages. Rachael Honowitz, 35, lived in Manhattan for 12 years, working as an event planner for People magazine, before deciding to move to Los Angeles in 2014. She moved with the hope that men on the West Coast weren\u2019t as noncommittal as the ones she met in New York.She met her husband, Jason Cosgrove, a digital media executive who was growing tired of the online dating scene, on Tinder six weeks later.\u201cI was probably chatting with 10 guys at the time,\u201d said Ms. Honowitz, who now runs a company that prepares gift bags for award shows and celebrities. \u201cI was even talking to one of his best friends, which was a bit awkward later.\u201dMr. Cosgrove and Ms. Honowitz went out for sushi for their first date. They clicked. \u201cYou just know if it\u2019s going to work after one date,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd it did.\u201dMr. Cosgrove, 38, decided to propose using Tinder messages while sitting with Ms. Honowitz on a bench in Central Park during a trip to New York. When he ran into technical difficulties on Tinder (they couldn\u2019t get their profiles to \u201cmatch\u201d in a different city), he sent his \u201cTinder message\u201d via text, excerpted here: \u201cHere we are. Back in the place where it all began \u2014 a little app inside your phone. But things have changed a bit since we first met here \u2026 I suppose after saying some sweet stuff to a girl on Tinder, it would be time to ask her out. \u2026 But I\u2019ve got another question instead.\u201dMs. Honowitz put the phone down; Mr. Cosgrove got down on one knee and proposed.\u201cI was embarrassed by how we met at first and didn\u2019t tell people, but now I see it as my civic duty to let people know,\u201d said Ms. Honowitz, who agreed to let Tinder post their love story on the \u201csuccess stories\u201d part of their website. \u201cThere\u2019s no shame in meeting on Tinder. I\u2019m a smart, educated girl from a great family. Jason is, too.\u201d\u201cAnd we\u2019re having a tinderbaby,\u201d Mr. Cosgrove announced proudly.In 2015, Eric Schleicher posted a wedding photo of himself and his new wife, Caitlin, on Instagram with an attention-grabbing \u201cStraight Outta Tinder\u201d graphic stamped on the front. \u201cWe #SwipedRight!,\u201d Mr. Schleicher, the marketing manager for events at the BOK Center arena in Tulsa, Okla., captioned the photo.He\u2019s one of hundreds who have posted to the hashtag. \u201cPeople are always surprised when I tell them how we met,\u201d he said. \u201cI thought this was a fun way of sharing it.\u201dMr. Schleicher joined Tinder in the fall of 2013, shortly after moving to Dallas. He wasn\u2019t looking for a hookup (he says that\u2019s not his thing). He just wanted to get to know people.He met Ms. Schleicher at 11 p.m. at a bar called Three Sheets for their first date; it was her idea. \u201cLooking back, the late time could have given him the wrong impression,\u201d said Ms. Schleicher, a labor and delivery nurse, \u201cBut he wasn\u2019t in a rush that night, about anything. We just talked for hours.\u201d\u201cI think Tinder is what you make of it,\u201d said Mr. Schleicher, 25. Sure, there are people looking for casual sex, he said, but then there are people who really want to meet someone. \u201cYou just have to sift through,\u201d he said.He\u2019d go out of his way to seem normal when he approached women on the app, knowing that many of them were hurled insulting pickup lines like, \u201cDo you have any bikini shots?\u201d His opening line was always plain vanilla: Hey, how are you?Mr. Cosgrove thinks of Tinder as an icebreaker, since it can ease the stress of approaching a woman. \u201cIf I saw my wife in a bar, I would have been too intimidated to approach her,\u201d he said. Knowing that she had already swiped right reassured him that she found him attractive, which he said gave him more confidence on their first date.Aimee Denaro, a real estate broker who lives in the East Village, never thought she\u2019d meet a husband on Tinder in 2013. \u201cI had tried Match.com and eHarmony, but I never found any normal guys there,\u201d she said.Ms. Denaro signed up for a Tinder account at the same time as her best friend, and they\u2019d both scroll through the guys, like it was a game. They were encouraged. \u201cOn Tinder, I felt like I\u2019d found a larger pool of guys, guys I would have been friends with,\u201d she said. (There were definitely creepers, too, like the guy who asked if she liked massages, or the one who asked her to describe her feet.)When she met Rob Becker, she had an instant crush, but she didn\u2019t take him seriously at first. \u201cI had written him off, thinking \u2018Come on, I\u2019m not really going to meet my husband on Tinder,\u2019\u201d she said. But he was exactly her type, and they were engaged a year later. He gave her a T-shirt that night: \u201cYeah, we met on Tinder,\u201d it read.And Ms. Denaro\u2019s best friend? She was engaged a month later to one of her Tinder beaus as well. Says Ms. Denaro: \u201cWe were in each other\u2019s bridal parties.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Bounty Hunter Tracks Chinese Companies That Dupe Investors", "Date": "2016-03-15", "News": "Supported byRobert W. Seiden is a Wall Street bounty hunter. He tracks down executives of Chinese companies that listed on stock exchanges in the United States and then blew up.It is a painstaking business that few are willing to do.One of his current targets is the chairman at Sino Clean Energy, who has battled with investors in a Nevada state court since 2014. On Feb. 16, the trial judge found the executive, Ren Baowen, in criminal contempt and ordered his arrest for failing to comply with earlier court orders.In an attempt to increase the pressure on Mr. Ren, Mr. Seiden, the court-appointed receiver for Sino Clean, prepared a notice about the arrest warrant to be published through PR Newswire, which distributes corporate news releases.The release was published on Feb. 29 \u2014 but not in China, where Mr. Ren lives. PRNewswire, in an email to Mr. Seiden, said it had refused to publish the notice there citing \u201cheightened political sensitivity concerning Chinese investment interests.\u201dIt was not the first time Mr. Seiden\u2019s tactics have been thwarted. It is the reason many remain skeptical of his efforts. Nevertheless, he has embraced the challenge and become the go-to person for American investors who are suing Chinese companies saying that they were swindled.\u201cUnless the Chinese government is coming to arrest me, I\u2019m going to do whatever is legally permissible by court order,\u201d Mr. Seiden said in a recent interview.Mr. Seiden, 52, a former Manhattan prosecutor, has been appointed by judges as the receiver to oversee the management of nine Chinese companies \u2014 many incorporated in Nevada \u2014 that once traded shares in the United States.But his actual dollar recoveries for investors have been small \u2014 just $8 million out of the nearly $90 million he has sought to recoup.A Sherlock Holmes enthusiast (a bust of the fictional detective sits on his desk in Manhattan), Mr. Seiden has built a reputation for being tenacious. And for good reason: Getting Chinese executives to pay up involves extensive meetings, negotiations and cooperation from Chinese authorities and bankers.He is not just focused on China. He employs former agents from intelligence agencies around the world, including the Mossad in Israel and the K.G.B. in Russia, to help him conduct cloak-and-dagger investigations in places like Russia, Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan.He opened his company, Confidential Global Investigation, in 2008. Early on, he did work for hedge funds and their investors. But one of his first jobs in China was for Richemont, the company that owns luxury brands like Cartier, Piaget and Jaeger-LeCoultre. Mr. Seiden tracked down a ring of counterfeiters operating from Latvia and Scotland and manufacturing fake watches in China.In 2013, Mr. Seiden received a call from a lawyer representing a large investor in ZST Digital Networks, a Chinese equipment maker. A Delaware judge appointed Mr. Seiden as the company\u2019s receiver to enforce the terms of a $32 million judgment on behalf of the investor. Mr. Seiden is still trying to get that money back, but the assignment started him on a new career path.More work started to flow from investor lawsuits over reverse mergers. In those deals, Chinese companies looking to trade in the United States bypassed the traditional method of an initial public offering and instead merged with largely defunct companies that already had shares listed on an exchange in the United States.Starting in the mid-2000s, these companies drew a wave of interest from investors who thought they could get rich from China\u2019s surging economic growth. But years later, they had little but burned fingers to show for their investments.Many of the Chinese companies were soon engulfed in accounting irregularities or allegations of outright fraud. Others simply stopped submitting quarterly financial statements in the United States, leaving investors in the dark about what was happening with their operations in China.Critics say regulators have been slow to act.\u201cThe U.S. regulators have been unwilling to go to the mat on this,\u201d said Paul Gillis, an accounting professor at Guanghua School of Management, Peking University in Beijing.At the same time, there has been little political will to do anything about in China. \u201cThe responsibility for this stuff is spread out too widely, there are so many different Chinese bureaucracies involved,\u201d Professor Gillis said.But recently, Mr. Seiden has enlisted some officials in China. With the help of China\u2019s Ministry of Finance and Commerce and the State Administration of Foreign Exchange, Mr. Seiden collected $4 million from a settlement with Shengtai Pharmaceutical in 2015.Mr. Seiden said that he expected to collect an additional $28 million within months as a result of current negotiations, including talks with Mr. Ren\u2019s legal team.In the case of Sino Clean Energy, a clean coal manufacturing company, Mr. Seiden contends in court filings that Mr. Ren \u201cstole millions of dollars\u201d from investors in the United States by \u201cgoing dark.\u201dThe company, based in Xi\u2019an, China, has not filed updated financial statements with the Securities and Exchange Commission since early 2012, according to the investor lawsuit.Sino Clean Energy listed its shares on the Nasdaq stock market after a reverse merger in 2006 with a largely defunct company called Endo Networks. It then raised more than $26 million in the United States.Matthew C. Zirzow, the Las Vegas bankruptcy lawyer for Sino Clean, did not return a telephone call seeking comment. Another lawyer for Mr. Ren could not reached for comment.Investors in companies that Mr. Seiden is pursuing to recover money acknowledge that the efforts are long shots.John J. Kassay Jr. of Parksville, N.Y., said he lost about $20,000 on his investment in Sino Clean and joined the lawsuit in Nevada against Mr. Ren and the company to \u201ctake them to task.\u201dWhatever money he gets back from the litigation will be worth it, he said.Michael Sammons, a San Antonio investor who lost money in two Chinese companies, Weikang Bio-Technology Group and RINO International, said he could not find anyone other than Mr. Seiden to take on these cases.Mr. Seiden\u2019s firm has grown from a handful of employees, including Steven, his brother, to 20 employees. Chinese reverse merger cases account for about 80 percent of the firm\u2019s work.\u201cWe are creating a pathway to get money back,\u201d he said.A recent crackdown on financial firms because of turmoil in the Chinese stock market has heightened concerns about how China treats foreign business interests when they conflict with its own.A spokeswoman for PRNewswire said it did not publish the release in China because of new Chinese government restrictions on what foreign companies may publish online.Yet while China can appear to be uncooperative with demands from outside investors, that attitude is changing as some Chinese leaders want to show that it can be a reliable business partner, Mr. Seiden argued.Still, when he is in China \u2014 where he spends up to one month a year \u2014 he uses disposable phones and changes his hotel room after he checks in to make it more difficult for people to track his whereabouts, he said.The investors he represents say they sense that change could be underway. At the very least, they figure his help cannot hurt.\u201cIt\u2019s a big battle, and it\u2019s a big unknown because it has not been done before,\u201d said Alain Peracca, a former Microsoft executive and an investor in Sino Clean Energy. \u201cIt is the only hope that shareholders have.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Energy Transfer\u2019s Deal Is a Nightmare With No Escape", "Date": "2016-03-10", "News": "Supported byDeal ProfessorEnergy Transfer Equity\u2019s acquisition of a rival pipeline company, Williams Companies, has turned into a nightmare as troubles in the energy industry worsen.Energy Transfer has only itself to blame, but how can it escape its troublesome deal?Let\u2019s start with the simple fact that Energy Transfer is not actually acquiring Williams. Instead, a newly created affiliate, Energy Transfer Corporation, is making the acquisition.Even though the only asset of the Transfer Corporation will be Energy Transfer stock, there are bound to be trading price divergences between the price of Transfer Corporation and Energy Transfer stock. Energy Transfer has committed to equalize the price of the two stocks only for two years after completion of the deal.The deal will also leave Energy Transfer at the center of an orbit of six publicly traded companies \u2014 different pipelines that Energy Transfer manages.This is a Frankenstein creature created only for tax purposes. It should not exist and makes everything that much more complicated.There is no doubt Energy Transfer is good at tax planning, but these sort of machinations are locking the company into the transaction.The transaction was structured as a stock-and-cash deal, with Energy Transfer issuing out only about 19 percent of its outstanding stock. Cash was used to pay up for the rest of the consideration in the transaction. That cash is a problem now because borrowing that sum in a down market will leave Energy Transfer overleveraged.Furthermore, in strategic transactions, as opposed to private equity transactions, there is no \u201cout\u201d that allows the acquirer to simply terminate the deal.Before the financial crisis, provisions in private equity deals sometimes permitted an acquirer to terminate the transaction and pay a reverse termination fee of about 3 percent of the transaction value. After the financial crisis, that practice changed. As a result, a private equity acquirer could typically terminate a deal only if financing became unavailable, and it had to pay a reverse termination fee of about 6 percent of deal value.But that was for private equity deals. In strategic deals, the acquirer has no way to back out unless it has a shareholder vote or specifically negotiates a termination right.Unfortunately for Energy Transfer, it has no vote and it did not negotiate special rights to terminate its agreement with Williams.There are signs of a rift between Williams and Energy Transfer. Energy Transfer completed an offering of preferred securities to its inside executives on Wednesday. The offering was made to lessen the debt load. But Williams refused to give its consent for its audited financials to be used in the exchange, so Energy Transfer could not register the securities with the Securities and Exchange Commission so that they could be freely tradeable.One option for Energy Transfer to back out would be if a tax opinion cannot be delivered, but that does not seem a problem.And the company could in theory invoke the material adverse change clause in its agreement. This clause allows Energy Transfer to terminate the deal on a material adverse change to Williams.Over the last two and a half years, the oil industry experienced its deepest downturn since at least the 1990s.But to be a material adverse change, or MAC, under Delaware law, the bad events to Williams must be long term and significant and generally affect Williams in ways the rest of the oil industry is unaffected.Such a claim would be hard to prove given the near depression in the oil industry today. Indeed, the Delaware courts, where such a claim would be litigated, have never found a reason for the material adverse change clause to be set off.Still, anyone who thinks this is an airtight agreement did not go through the financial crisis.The lessons from these deals is this: Just because the deal appears to be airtight does not mean it will not be renogtiated. Energy Transfer can use litigation or the threat thereof to try to do this. Because Williams\u2019s shareholders will own part of the combined company at some point, this will make more sense as Energy Transfer\u2019s situation becomes worse.Either way, don\u2019t shed any tears for Energy Transfer. It got itself into this mess in the first place.An earlier version of this column referred incorrectly to a stock exchange rule that requires a shareholder vote if more than 20 percent of a company\u2019s shares are issued in a transaction. The rule does not apply to partnerships like Energy Transfer; the company\u2019s planned acquisition of the Williams Companies was structured to include cash and stock for other reasons.

{"Headline": "Bernie Sanders Forges Ahead With Jabs at Donald Trump", "Date": "2016-03-18", "News": "Supported byUndeterred by questions of delegate math or political momentum, Senator Bernie Sanders brushed off suggestions on Friday that his campaign had no way forward and forcefully made the case that he was the Democratic candidate better suited to defeat Donald J. Trump in a general election.Despite the veiled jab at Mrs. Clinton, who did attend Mr. Trump\u2019s third wedding, Mr. Sanders directed most of his fire at the leading Republican candidate. He said he was \u201cmaking an exception\u201d to his promise not to campaign negatively, saying it was a necessary evil because of the gravity of Mr. Trump\u2019s rise.\u201cThe truth is that Donald Trump is a pathological liar,\u201d Mr. Sanders said, spending several minutes discussing Mr. Trump\u2019s record of bending the truth. \u201cPeople can disagree about ideas, but you cannot have a president who the American people cannot trust when he speaks.\u201dMr. Sanders pointed to several polls that show him as the stronger candidate to take on Mr. Trump, but he ignored the more daunting numbers facing him in the near term. He trails Mrs. Clinton by more than 300 delegates, and although his campaign says friendlier terrain is ahead, state polls of Democrats do not indicate that the race is likely to shift in his favor.The Sanders team said Friday that it has received more than 150,000 donations in the past three days and insists that this is merely the midpoint in a long contest that will end in June. Still, many political analysts say the campaign is kidding itself.\u201cHope is a difficult thing to extinguish, particularly when it\u2019s well funded,\u201d said Steve McMahon, a Democratic political consultant with Purple Strategies. \u201cBut keeping hope alive is different than keeping a campaign alive because this is ultimately about winning the most delegates, and it\u2019s nearly impossible to see a path for Sanders to pass Clinton in delegates.\u201dPutting the long odds aside, Mr. Sanders has more rallies scheduled this weekend in Phoenix and in Boise, Idaho, and he is firing up his supporters by hitting local issues and throwing red meat in new directions.On Thursday night, he focused on immigration at an event in Arizona and assailed Sheriff Joe Arpaio of Maricopa County \u2014 one of the state\u2019s most contentious political figures \u2014 as being an \u201cun-American\u201d bully.According to the Associated Press, Donald J. Trump and Hillary Clinton have each won enough delegates to claim their party\u2019s nomination for president.\u201cArpaio took away my childhood because I had to grow up from one week to another,\u201d she said. \u201cI am one of millions of other kids that are left behind.\u201d\u201cI want all deportations to stop \u2014 that\u2019s why we need Bernie Sanders to be our president,\u201d she said.Mr. Sanders vowed to prevent others from experiencing what Ms. Figueroa Bueno did.\u201cIt\u2019s easy for bullies like Sheriff Arpaio to pick on people who have no power, but if I\u2019m elected president, the president of the United States does have the power,\u201d Mr. Sanders said. \u201cWatch out, Joe!\u201dMr. Sanders also called for an end to \u201csystemic injustice\u201d faced by Native Americans, a quarter of whom he said live in poverty. He said that young American Indians faced low graduation rates and high suicide rates, and that one Native American woman in three would be raped during her lifetime.\u201cThe Native American people have been lied to, they have been cheated and negotiated treaties have been broken,\u201d he said. \u201cWe owe the Native American people so, so much.\u201dThat outreach came in stark contrast to Mr. Trump, who was asked by a Native American woman this week in Ohio if, as president, he would apologize to the group for wrongs that were committed by the United States over the years.Mr. Trump expressed little sympathy.\u201cWell, I\u2019ll certainly look into it,\u201d he said. \u201cI haven\u2019t been big on apologizing, you do know that, right?Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "In Sri Lanka, Barriers Fall in a Land Marred by Bloodshed", "Date": "2016-03-02", "News": "Supported byExplorerWe had just crossed the causeway leading from the Jaffna Peninsula to the Vanni, the northern Sri Lankan mainland, when the colossus came into view: a pair of bronze hands, mounted on a plinth, raising aloft a model of this teardrop-shaped island nation. A marble frieze on the wall that encircled the statue showed columns of helmeted troops and tanks rolling past swamps and palmyra trees, the spiky palm indigenous to Sri Lanka\u2019s far north. I stepped out of the car in the torpid heat and walked around the monument, which dominates this strategic corridor known as Elephant Pass.It was here, in January 2009, that two divisions of Sri Lankan troops pushed down from the peninsula, converging with two other divisions marching from the south, to begin a final offensive against the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam, otherwise known as the Tamil Tigers. \u201cThe gallant operation [was] launched under the state leadership of the president ... who was born for the grace of the nation,\u201d declared a plaque at the base of the statue, commemorating Sri Lanka\u2019s hard-line leader at the time, Mahinda Rajapaksa. In overblown language, the inscription noted that the troops had \u201ctraversed scrubs, impassable moats, quagmires and ... dreadful traps ... liberating this long path and annihilating terrorism.\u201dBut in 2011, with the region pacified, President Rajapaksa began relaxing his stringent security measures, allowing in both Sri Lankans from the south and foreigners.Last year\u2019s election, which brought Maithripala Sirisena, a moderate Sinhalese, to power, raised hopes for reconciliation, and an end to government obfuscations about the brutality that took place here during the war\u2019s final months.To reach the north, I traveled from the ancient Sinhalese Buddhist capital of Anuradhapura to Jaffna on the Northern Line, the old British-built railroad that runs for 211 miles through Sri Lanka\u2019s interior. In the 1980s, Tiger bombings and sabotage forced the line to shut down; the guerrillas then seized control of the adjacent territory, ripped up the rails to make bunkers, and let the jungle reclaim what was left. Bombing raids by the Sri Lankan Air Force reduced stations to rubble.Financed by loans from Indian Railways and other sources, President Rajapaksa\u2019s government rebuilt the line over five years. On a sunny afternoon in October 2014, the president made the inaugural journey to Jaffna aboard the Queen of Jaffna train, known in Tamil as the Yarl Devi. Garlanded with flowers and banana leaves, it rolled into Jaffna to an explosion of cheers and firecrackers.My own journey on the Northern Line took place with less fanfare. The train arrived at Anuradhapura\u2019s sleepy station two hours behind schedule, and I took a seat in the nearly empty first-class car. Walking through the train as it rumbled through paddies and jungle, I encountered a microcosm of Sri Lanka\u2019s population. Two young men sitting together in a second-class compartment told me they were military officers returning to their base in Kilinochchi, the former Tigers capital in the Vanni, but politely rebuffed my attempts at further conversation.In a crowded third-class car I met a Tamil Hindu family \u2014 husband, wife and teenage son \u2014 traveling to Jaffna from their home in Colombo to visit the man\u2019s ailing mother. It was the first time that the 62-year-old railway worker had ridden the line since the 1980s, and he gave President Rajapaksa grudging credit. \u201cHe built roads, the railways are running, education is better,\u201d he told me in Tamil, which his son translated. But the Tamil people, he added, shifting nervously in his seat, \u201chave to watch what we say. We do not feel protected.\u201dAfter five hours we pulled into Jaffna, dominated by a heavily shelled Portuguese-built fort, where the Tigers once held sway. The army drove the guerrillas out of the Jaffna Peninsula 20 years ago, forcing them to take refuge in the Vanni to the south, and, for many Jaffna residents, the war has faded into a distant memory.Worshipers gather every Friday at the city\u2019s elaborate Hindu temples to make puka, or devotions, to their gods. The military curfew has been lifted, and outdoor restaurants are packed at night with Tamil families dining on dosas, idlis and other specialties of the distinctive cuisine that Jaffna shares with Tamil Nadu, India\u2019s southernmost state.Scholars and students fill the Jaffna library, an opulent, Indo-Saracenic-style edifice. After a pro-separatist Tamil party held a rally in Jaffna in 1981 in which two Sinhalese policemen were killed, a mob burned the library to the ground, an act that served to catalyze the conflict. But the library was restored two decades ago, and it has again become a center of Tamil intellectual life.The next morning my guide, a Tamil architect named Kumaralingan Pathyran but known to everyone as Pathy, and I followed a causeway across a lagoon to the western edge of the peninsula. There we boarded a navy-operated ferry and motored toward Delft, one of several remote islands in the Palk Strait dividing Sri Lanka and India. I secured a perch on the tiny foredeck. Below, dozens of locals huddled in a dark and cramped cabin.As we crossed the strait, Pathy told me that the body of water was the site of what was called a massacre. In May 1985, six men believed to be from the Sri Lankan navy boarded the Kumudini, a ferry sailing from Delft, and hacked to death 23 Tamil men, women and children. The slaughter was in revenge for a mass killing carried out by the Tigers around Anuradhapura days earlier.Alighting in Delft\u2019s soporific port, we hired a motorized rickshaw and bounced down decrepit roads, past Hindu temples, stopping to view various curiosities left by Sri Lanka\u2019s succession of European conquerors: a giant baobab brought by the Portuguese in the 16th century from Madagascar; a ruined 17th-century Portuguese fortress built of coral; a herd of wild horses galloping across a barren plain, the descendants of those brought over, then abandoned, by Dutch colonizers 300 years ago; a stone aviary used by a British governor to house his carrier pigeons.There were no hotels, no restaurants, no tourist infrastructure, just a back-of-beyond landscape and miles of empty beach. Pathy and I bought fish at a market by the port and hired a local man to prepare a curry with chiles and coconut milk. On a deserted strip of sand battered by rough waves, we ate out of a communal pot, as feral cats gathered.Just past the Elephant Pass, at the edge of the Vanni, a grandiose memorial celebrates the life of Gamini Kularatne, an ordinary Sinhalese soldier who, in July 1991, single-handedly disabled a Tiger bulldozer packed with explosives, and died. It typifies the iconography indulged in by the Rajapaksa government to glory in its victory and to remind the Tamils of the cost of resistance.The shredded remnants of the Caterpillar, which Gamini Kularatne attacked with grenades, are mounted on a pedestal, surrounded by a carp pond, a fountain and exhibits chronicling every twist and turn in the young hero\u2019s life: a New Year\u2019s greeting from the soldier to his mother, a 1988 pay slip, snapshots of his wedding. Farther down the road an outdoor museum displays captured Tiger speedboats, submarines, even a mini-destroyer. In Kilinochchi, which the Tigers occupied for a decade, I inspected a 60-foot-high water tank lying on its side, a tangle of concrete and rebar that was toppled by the Tigers in the spring of 2009 as they retreated.Pathy and I drove down a dirt road through the jungle, followed by clouds of green parakeets. After a 15-minute drive, we stopped before a brick bungalow with a red-tile roof and an orange stucco facade. Soldiers sat on the veranda and milled about the garden. This was the former hideaway of Velupillai Prabhakaran, the charismatic founder of the Tamil Tigers.A high-school dropout from Jaffna, Mr. Prabhakaran tried to build an egalitarian utopia in the Tiger-occupied Vanni, but he grew increasingly isolated, paranoid and brutal; Sri Lankan troops captured and executed him in the last days of the government\u2019s offensive. His house, laced with underground bunkers, is open to the public, but this day the soldiers refused to let us enter, claiming that the bunkers were in danger of collapse. Instead we had to settle for a visit to the nearby home of Colonel Soosai, the commander of the Sea Tigers, the rebels\u2019 naval force, who was killed a few days before Mr. Prabhakaran.\u201cEnemies are our best teachers\u201d read a sign placed by government soldiers over the doorway to the guerrilla chief\u2019s bungalow. I walked down a narrow flight of steps concealed inside a closet, and found myself in a long, mud-filled tunnel \u2014 a secret escape route that burrowed beneath Colonel Soosai\u2019s garden.The Tigers made their final stand at the Nanthi Kadal Lagoon, a few miles down the coast. The road followed an unbroken swath of jungle, bordered by yellow tape and signs displaying a skull-and-crossbones and the warning, \u201cMines,\u201d in English, Sinhalese and Tamil. Soldiers were still sweeping the jungle for buried explosives and had blocked off many dirt roads leading to the lagoon. Eventually we found our way to the Vaddu Vakal Bridge, not far from Lagoon\u2019s Edge, the military-owned villa now being marketed as a getaway for tourists.A scene of pristine beauty surrounded me. Looking north toward the Indian Ocean, I could see distant breakers crashing against a golden beach. On the inland side of the bridge, herons flew over tidal flats and islets covered with marsh grass, and palmyras swayed over the thick brush that grew along the shore. But the serenity belied the horror that had unfolded here. In May 2009, the Sri Lankan army trapped 100,000 civilians and Tiger guerrillas between the jungle and the ocean, and shelled them relentlessly.Today a military guard post flanks one end of the span, along with a sign that reflects the Sinhalese victors\u2019 view of history. It proclaims that this was the site of \u201cheroic victory\u201d over \u201cruthless terrorists,\u201d by government troops who saved the civilians in a \u201chumanitarian operation.\u201dI fell into a conversation with a grizzled Tamil fisherman who was dangling a line off the bridge. He\u2019d been trapped here with thousands of others in 2009, he told me, but \u201cthere has no been no problem here since the \u2018liberation.\u2019 \u201d He cast a nervous glance toward the military guard post, and then hurried away.Seven years after a brutal war, peace and tourism have returned to Sri Lanka\u2019s north, but normality remains more elusive.An article last Sunday about traveling to the Jaffna region of Sri Lanka misspelled part of the Tamil name of the Queen of Jaffna train. It is Yarl Devi, not Yari Devi. The article also misstated the phone number for the Experience Travel Group, which organizes tours to the area. It is 44-20-79-24-7133.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Reviving the Working Class Without Building Walls", "Date": "2016-03-08", "News": "Supported byEconomic SceneCan the government help Donald Trump\u2019s supporters?That strategy, if it amounts to that, would visit a disaster of epic proportions upon the world economy. It harks back to the Smoot-Hawley tariffs of the 1930s, which pushed the world into a tit-for-tat trade war in which everybody raised their barriers against everybody else\u2019s imports, entrenching the Depression.But the raw anxiety of his supporters remains unaddressed.It is not obvious how to restore the America Mr. Trump\u2019s legions pine for. The nation\u2019s diversity would not go into reverse regardless of how high he built his wall along the nation\u2019s southern border.Their economic discontent \u2014 born of the mismatch between expectations based on an earlier America, where plenty of blue-collar jobs offered a decent standard of living, and the more cutthroat reality they face today \u2014 can seem intractable, too.\u201cIt\u2019s not clear what public policy can do for someone who was expecting his income to grow from $50,000 to $80,000 but instead saw it stagnate at $50,000,\u201d said Lawrence Katz, a Harvard economist.Stumped by the economy\u2019s inability to deliver more decent jobs, policy makers are struggling to come up with solutions.The routine promise that economic growth will automatically spread prosperity has proved empty, belied by the long slide in the real earnings of all but the best-paid workers.Any long-term strategy to improve workers\u2019 lot, of course, must include improving their skills. But just kicking the challenge down the road under the fuzzy prescription that all America needs is better education and training \u2014 a favorite of policy makers and their economic advisers \u2014 is no longer acceptable for workers who have suffered multiple rounds of dislocation over several decades.But before we enter the world of science fiction, it\u2019s worth looking at some policies that could improve jobs for most American workers, in the here and now.Instead of enhancing these trends, as it now does, government policy could push back. As Professor Katz noted, over the last few decades, about 13 percent of the nation\u2019s gross domestic product was redistributed to the top 1 percent from the rest of the population. \u201cIt is not crazy to suggest,\u201d he said, \u201cthat some percentage of that could be shared with a broader group.\u201dThe earned-income tax credit \u2014 a wage subsidy for low-income workers that has become the nation\u2019s most powerful antipoverty tool \u2014 could be expanded to include more workers and phase out at higher incomes. Combined with a higher minimum wage, it could be calibrated to ensure that workers\u2019 earnings totaled, say, at least $15 an hour.The White House also supports increasing the earned-income tax credit for adults without children; so does Speaker Paul Ryan, the Republican leader in the House of Representatives.These proposals represent only a start. They are far from full solutions for the struggling working class.Yet modest though they may be, they are still highly controversial. Indeed, the most critical question is whether politicians divided by an ideological gulf could agree on any effective labor market strategy.Many citizens of red states and members of the struggling working class \u2014 supporters of Mr. Trump, not to mention Senators Ted Cruz of Texas and Marco Rubio of Florida \u2014 oppose programs to benefit \u201cpoor people.\u201d Even if the \u201cpoor people\u201d these programs would help is them.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Obama Chooses Merrick Garland for Supreme Court", "Date": "2016-03-16", "News": "Supported byIn selecting Judge Garland, 63, a well-known figure in Washington legal circles who has drawn praise from members of both parties, Mr. Obama dared Republican senators to ignore public pressure and make good on their promise to block consideration of any nominee until after the next president is chosen.The nomination to fill the seat on the court created by the death of Justice Antonin Scalia sets in motion a standoff that is likely to play out for many months, perhaps without resolution. Its outcome could tip the ideological balance of the nation\u2019s highest court, and an array of well-financed interest groups on both sides has already assembled for the battle over the nomination.\u201cI\u2019ve selected a nominee who is widely recognized not only as one of America\u2019s sharpest legal minds, but someone who brings to his work a spirit of decency, modesty, integrity, even-handedness, and excellence,\u201d Mr. Obama said in a formal Rose Garden ceremony announcing his selection, where the president was flanked by Judge Garland and Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. \u201cPresidents do not stop working in the final year of their term; neither should a senator.\u201dRepublicans quickly rejected Mr. Obama\u2019s challenge. Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, appeared on the Senate floor shortly after the president\u2019s remarks to declare an end to Judge Garland\u2019s nomination, no matter his qualifications. In case there was any doubt, Mr. McConnell later called Judge Garland personally to say he would not be receiving him in his Capitol office, nor taking any action on his nomination.\u201cThe American people may well elect a president who decides to nominate Judge Garland for Senate consideration,\u201d Mr. McConnell said on the Senate floor. \u201cThe next president may also nominate someone very different. Either way, our view is this: Give the people a voice in the filling of this vacancy.\u201dIn choosing Judge Garland, a former prosecutor who has served on the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit since 1997 and as its chief judge since 2013, Mr. Obama opted to select a jurist better known for his meticulous work ethic and adherence to legal principles than for an ideological bent.\u201cAt a time when our politics are so polarized, at a time when norms and customs of political rhetoric and courtesy and comity are so often treated like they\u2019re disposable, this is precisely the time when we should play it straight,\u201d Mr. Obama told an audience that included Judge Garland\u2019s family, Democratic senators and liberal activists.White House officials considered, and rejected, advice from supporters who urged Mr. Obama to pressure Republicans by nominating a member of a racial minority. They also declined to zero in on a liberal champion who might have excited the core Democratic supporters that Hillary Clinton or Bernie Sanders would need in the general election.Some liberals expressed dismay with that decision. Charles Chamberlain, executive director of Democracy in America, said it was \u201cdeeply disappointing that President Obama failed to use this opportunity to add the voice of another progressive woman of color to the Supreme Court, and instead put forward a nominee seemingly designed to appease intransigent Republicans.\u201dBut White House officials said that Mr. Obama and his aides made the calculation that focusing on finding a nominee with impeccable legal credentials would expose the Republican opposition as based solely on politics. The president passed over two other federal appellate judges on his short list who might have achieved those goals: Sri Srinivasan, 49, of Indian descent, and Paul Watford, 48, an African-American who is viewed as more liberal than Judge Garland.Merrick B. Garland is a candidate who had support from Republicans in the past but would still move the court in a progressive direction.\u201cTo suggest that someone as qualified and respected as Merrick Garland doesn\u2019t even deserve a hearing, let alone an up-or-down vote, to join an institution as important as our Supreme Court, when two-thirds of Americans believe otherwise \u2014 that would be unprecedented,\u201d the president said.Mr. Obama had twice considered Judge Garland for the Supreme Court during his first term, and some aides viewed him at the time as an \u201cin-case-of-emergency-break-glass\u201d candidate whom they should save for a future vacancy where they needed a nominee who was broadly acceptable to Republicans. That future appears to have arrived.A few Senate Republicans have suggested recently that if Mrs. Clinton is elected in November, they might be more open to considering Judge Garland as an alternative to a more liberal nominee. And as Judge Garland prepared to begin meeting with senators on Thursday, there was early evidence that at least some Republican senators were softening their stances.A White House statement said that Senator Charles E. Grassley, Republican of Iowa, the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, had agreed to meet with Judge Garland, but that the meeting would be scheduled after the two-week congressional recess ended. Senators Mark Kirk of Illinois and Kelly Ayotte of New Hampshire, both facing steep re-election challenges in Democratic-leaning states, said they would meet with Judge Garland.Senators Susan M. Collins and Jeff Flake of Arizona, both Republicans, have also said they would sit down with Mr. Obama\u2019s nominee. And Senator Orrin G. Hatch, Republican of Utah and a member of the Judiciary Committee, said he would be open to holding hearings on Judge Garland during a lame-duck congressional session after the election.The White House reached out to Judge Garland, along with a number of other potential nominees, days after Justice Scalia\u2019s death on Feb. 13. Mr. Obama interviewed him last Thursday even as the president\u2019s short list, which included his name and those of Judges Srinivasan and Watford, leaked in the news media, alarming the West Wing officials who were trying to keep the process out of the spotlight.Mr. Obama spent Friday and Saturday in Texas, attending the South by Southwest festival and Democratic fund-raisers before playing a round of golf. He returned to Washington late Saturday night and informed his top aides soon afterward that Judge Garland would be his pick.Denis McDonough, the president\u2019s chief of staff, was one of only about a half-dozen top aides who knew the choice as planning for the public rollout of the nominee kicked into gear. Much of the work could be prepared without knowing the specific nominee, but on Tuesday night, White House videographers recorded Judge Garland for the gauzy biographical video that they released Wednesday morning.Since 1900, the Senate has voted on eight Supreme Court nominees during an election year. Six were confirmed.It came out just after Mr. Obama appeared under a sunny sky at the Rose Garden to introduce Judge Garland and urge Republicans to give him a chance.\u201cI simply ask Republicans in the Senate to give him a fair hearing, and then an up-or-down vote,\u201d Mr. Obama said. \u201cIf you don\u2019t, then it will not only be an abdication of the Senate\u2019s constitutional duty, it will indicate a process for nominating and confirming judges that is beyond repair.\u201dJudge Garland\u2019s professional life was shaped in part by the bombing of the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City in 1995, which killed 168 people. As a Justice Department official in the Clinton administration, he coordinated the government\u2019s response, starting the case against the two men charged, Timothy J. McVeigh and Terry Nichols, and eventually supervising their prosecution. Mr. McVeigh was executed.Judge Garland insisted on going to the scene even as bodies were being pulled from the rubble, friends said. His role captivated Mr. Obama, said Valerie Jarrett, the president\u2019s senior adviser, who added that it \u201cstruck the president because it reflects on the chief judge\u2019s character.\u201dIn his brief remarks, Judge Garland emotionally described his career as a prosecutor and a judge, saying that \u201cfidelity to the Constitution and the law have been the cornerstone of my professional life.\u201d He said that if the Senate confirmed him, he promised to \u201ccontinue on that course.\u201dThe scene captured an extraordinary moment of uncertainty for Judge Garland, twice passed over for the Supreme Court and now facing a path to confirmation that is, at best, ambiguous \u2014 and could be a dead end entirely.Senator Amy Klobuchar, Democrat of Minnesota and a member of the Judiciary panel who attended the ceremony, said that may have helped move Judge Garland to the verge of tears during his comments.\u201cThis is about how this burden of standing up for an independent judiciary \u2014 even if you may never get confirmed \u2014 is so important in this incredibly polarized time,\u201d Ms. Klobuchar said in an interview.She said many Republicans who had opposed Mr. Obama\u2019s earlier, successfully confirmed Supreme Court nominees, Elena Kagan and Sonia Sotomayor, had told her during those proceedings that they would have supported the president if he had selected Judge Garland instead.\u201cIt\u2019s kind of hard to get away from the fact that he, in the past and now, has been viewed as a consensus person,\u201d she added.Adam Liptak contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "After an Indictment, Turks Give U.S. Prosecutor a Hero\u2019s Welcome Online", "Date": "2016-03-26", "News": "Supported bySince that message was posted, the number of Mr. Bharara\u2019s Twitter followers has soared to 245,000 from a few thousand. An anonymous poem written in Turkish about Mr. Bharara, which notes his reputation as a fearless prosecutor of Wall Street malfeasance, gained traction online and begins, \u201cThere is a prosecutor in America, he is unshakably loyal to the law, now it is the turn of Reza, what a great man you are, Preet Bharara.\u201dMr. Zarrab, a flamboyant gold trader who is married to a Turkish pop star, was once a constant in the gossip pages of this city\u2019s newspapers. He became a household name in Turkey in late 2013 when a corruption inquiry became public with dawn police raids against Mr. Zarrab, several other businessmen and the sons of three cabinet ministers.The investigation \u2014 focused on those in the inner circle of Recep Tayyip Erdogan, then the prime minister and now president \u2014 became a national sensation, and it was seized upon by the many critics of Mr. Erdogan and his Islamist Justice and Development Party as evidence of abuse of power.But Mr. Zarrab quickly disappeared from view, along with the splashy headlines, as the investigation was quashed through a series of purges of the police and judiciary.As Mr. Zarrab sits in jail in the United States, having been denied bail, his case has again captured the imagination of many Turks who believe the original corruption inquiry was swept under the rug and who now hope that an American court will achieve what Turkish courts were unable to: a full and fair hearing of corruption allegations that touched the highest levels of government here.The 2013 inquiry mainly focused on corruption in the construction business and the public financing of real estate development. It also cast a spotlight on an issue that had long been a concern of the United States: the role of Turkey in helping Iran evade international sanctions over its nuclear program. One of the targets was the chief executive of the state-owned Halkbank, which the United States had long accused of working with Iran to evade sanctions in a scheme that involved using gold to buy Iranian oil and gas.It is unclear whether the American investigation intersects at all with the allegations Mr. Zarrab faced in Turkey. But critics of the Turkish government, who say the corruption inquiry was silenced through firings of the police and prosecutors who carried it out, are hoping that Mr. Zarrab, in trying to save himself, sings, and sings loudly.Two articles, side by side, in Thursday\u2019s Hurriyet Daily News, a Turkish newspaper, highlighted the divergence of Turkish and American justice. One reported that an arrest warrant had been issued for a Turkish prosecutor involved in the original graft case; the other was about Mr. Zarrab\u2019s having been denied bail in the United States.Mr. Gulen had built up a network of followers in the police and judiciary over decades and was once an important ally of Mr. Erdogan\u2019s. But the two had a falling out, and the disagreements crystallized over the corruption investigation.The response from Mr. Erdogan was swift: First came the purging from government of those thought to be followers of Mr. Gulen, on suspicion that they were plotting a coup, followed by the seizure under terrorism laws of many businesses and news outlets said to be linked to Mr. Gulen.Ceylan Yeginsu contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Assets of the Ultrarich Come Closer to Earth", "Date": "2016-03-10", "News": "Supported byCommon SenseFor the ultrawealthy, 2015 was an embarrassment of riches.But after years of dizzying appreciation, the values of luxury assets are plateauing and in some cases plunging. Volumes have shrunk, prices are being cut and some auction lots are going unsold.\u201cWe\u2019ve just come through a boom unlike anything I\u2019ve experienced in 30 years in the business,\u201d Jonathan J. Miller, chief executive of Miller Samuel, a real estate appraisal and consulting firm, said of the market for high-end sales. \u201cThe hard asset buyers have all cooled at the same time.\u201dThe sharp decline in demand is caused by many of the same factors creating broad financial weakness across the globe: collapsing oil and commodity prices; a slowing Chinese economy; and the prospect of higher interest rates in the United States. Rather suddenly, it seems, the voracious spending appetites of newly minted billionaires from Russia, Brazil and China have cooled off.In Manhattan, some sellers of luxury real estate have slashed prices. The asking price for a Park Avenue townhouse dropped $18.5 million, to just under $30 million; a seller cut the price for a Central Park South apartment by $7 million late last year, to below $18 million, and has since taken off another $2 million. Neither property has sold.The billionaire hedge fund manager William A. Ackman, who was part of an investor group that paid $91.5 million for an apartment at One57, the tower on what is now known as Billionaire\u2019s Row in Manhattan, may already have missed the market peak if he hopes to flip it at a profit. An apartment there purchased last April for $20.3 million sold again this year at a $2.5 million loss.Such prices are still in the unattainable stratosphere for almost everyone but the ultrawealthy. Still, the impact is significant: 12 percent fewer Manhattan apartments (189) were sold last year for more than $10 million than in 2014, with most of the decline coming in the second half of the year, according to CityRealty, which tracks co-op and condo sales.In London, the trend is even more pronounced. Prices for central London luxury properties over all dropped in 2015, with the steepest declines in two of the city\u2019s wealthiest neighborhoods, Belgravia and Knightsbridge. The number of high-end sales dropped 40 percent in December, according to Property Vision, an English property advisory concern. It recently reported that sellers were cutting prices, and \u201cwe are negotiating deals today that would have been impossible even in the late autumn.\u201dArt collectors are anxiously waiting for the results of the big spring auctions in New York. The art market\u2019s first test of the year, the February auctions in London, were not the disaster some had feared, but results were tepid, with total sales declining 35 percent at Christie\u2019s and 50 percent at Sotheby\u2019s.Shares in Sotheby\u2019s have mirrored the auction results: After peaking last June at over $47, they have declined about 45 percent.\u201cWe\u2019re seeing more restraint by mega-buyers, both individuals and institutions,\u201d said Evan Beard, national art executive for U.S. Trust, who has advised many high-net-worth clients. \u201cMany would-be consignors have looked at all the uncertainty and decided they\u2019re sitting out this season.\u201dThe market chill is especially pronounced for classic cars, the luxury asset class that had the highest run-up in prices over the last 10 years (490 percent), according to the recently released 2016 Knight-Frank wealth report. The big classic car auctions held every January in Scottsdale, Ariz., were a disappointment, with total sales falling 15 percent from last year, the first decline since 2010.\u201cPrices are dropping relative to last year,\u201d said Eric Minoff, a car specialist at Bonhams who was in Florida this week for the Amelia Island car auctions. \u201cYou can\u2019t have 20 percent appreciation every year. But if you bought in 2008, you\u2019re still far ahead.\u201dHagerty, which insures and appraises vintage autos, said its North American index of the collector car market had its biggest month-over-month drop in February since the depths of the financial crisis in 2009.Even worse is the once-thriving market for high-end antiques. Prices have dropped for 10 consecutive years, a result of changing tastes and a shift toward midcentury modern and contemporary furniture.It appears the ultrarich are as vulnerable to the laws of supply and demand as everyone else. Despite auction catalog copy that stresses adjectives like \u201crare,\u201d \u201cunique\u201d and \u201cirreplaceable,\u201d the supply of luxury assets for sale has surged as prices have climbed into the stratosphere, driving down prices.On or near 57th Street, where developers are vying to build the world\u2019s tallest residential apartment building, five major towers are in various stages of construction. \u201cNow that all these towers are visible, and not just holes in the ground, people are realizing that there\u2019s a lot of this kind of product coming on the market,\u201d Mr. Miller said.As prices surged for late-model Ferraris, fleets of them flooded onto the market. At the Bonhams February sale at the Grand Palais in Paris, six nearly identical Ferraris from the late 1980s to mid-1990s were offered; three failed to sell.\u201cThe sight of six Ferrari Testarossas, all red, lined up at one auction waiting optimistically for buyers probably summed up much of what\u2019s wrong with the recent bull market,\u201d noted Simon Kidston, founder of an advisory firm for car collectors.It also hasn\u2019t helped the psychology of luxury markets that Wall Street bonuses for 2015 dropped nearly 10 percent from the year before.Because the number of ultrawealthy buyers is so small, even a modest drop in demand can produce outsize declines. \u201cIt\u2019s generally been the case that at the extremely high end of the art market, demand is driven by about 50 to 60 people,\u201d Mr. Beard said.After five years of surging prices and buying sprees, some ultrarich people may simply be tapped out. \u201cThere are only so many billionaires out there,\u201d Mr. Miller said. \u201cEven though they rotate from place to place around the globe, at some point you have to wonder if they have enough.\u201dIt sold on Thursday for $9.375 million.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Apple Gets Tech Industry Backing in iPhone Dispute, Despite Misgivings", "Date": "2016-03-02", "News": "Supported byYet behind the scenes, it took time for some of the tech companies to make the decision to support Apple. Several feared the showdown with the government was too risky and could have far-reaching implications for the tech industry if Apple lost.Those misgivings ultimately did not win the day. About 40 companies and organizations are expected to file court briefs on Thursday backing Apple as it fights a judge\u2019s order to help law enforcement break into an iPhone used by a gunman in the San Bernardino, Calif., terrorist attack last year.Dropbox, Facebook, Google, Microsoft, Snapchat and Yahoo are among the tech companies expected to sign on to briefs in the case, according to people with knowledge of the plans who spoke on the condition of anonymity. More than 40 individuals, including prominent security experts and academics, are also planning to sign briefs, which will focus on themes like free speech, the importance of encryption and concerns about government overreach.The show of support \u2014 including briefs filed on Wednesday by groups like the American Civil Liberties Union and Access Now \u2014 is unusual in its breadth, showing that many in Silicon Valley believe that it could have profound implications on the trustworthiness of their products.Still, several executives at tech companies supporting Apple said they were worried that Apple had picked a fight that could end up backfiring on the rest of the industry. In the days since a magistrate judge in California ordered Apple to bypass security measures on the iPhone, lawyers in some of the companies debated these issues with one another and peers at other firms.All of the executives asked to remain anonymous because their deliberations were private, but their views are shared among others in Silicon Valley.Keith Rabois, a venture capitalist with the firm Khosla Ventures, said he was a strong believer in privacy and encryption \u2014 \u201call the normal Silicon Valley views,\u201d he said \u2014 but worried that Apple could lose the case, setting a legal precedent that could force other companies to compromise the security of their products for law enforcement.\u201cIn my view, this is the wrong case to fight,\u201d Mr. Rabois said. \u201cThere are plenty of other cases with a lot less sympathetic case for the government.\u201dApple\u2019s defenders said the company did not pick this fight \u2014 the government did. Critics of Apple\u2019s approach believe that the company could have quietly complied with the government\u2019s request to help break into the iPhone and then taken a public stand in a more favorable case. But Apple has said that once a tool exists for extracting data from the phone, that tool cannot be made to disappear.Yet whatever doubts Apple\u2019s allies voiced privately, they were in the end insufficient to keep a large number of big companies from signing on to the cause.Dropbox\u2019s general counsel, Ramsey Homsany, said in a statement, \u201cWe stand against the use of broad authorities to undermine the security of a company\u2019s products.\u201dBruce Sewell, Apple\u2019s general counsel, said in a statement, \u201cWe are humbled by the outpouring of support we\u2019ve received from our customers, our colleagues in business, nonprofit organizations, the security community and many others.\u201d He added, \u201cThe groups filing briefs with the court understand, as more and more people have come to realize, that this case is not about one phone \u2014 it is about the future and how we protect our safety and our privacy.\u201dOn Tuesday, Apple filed its formal objection to the government order to open up the iPhone, citing the reasons set forth in a previously filed motion.For many tech companies that were initially concerned by Apple\u2019s opposition to opening up the iPhone in the San Bernardino case, the worries centered not only on whether this was the right case for challenging the government but also on how public perceptions of the fight might reflect on the rest of the industry, according to tech executives involved in the discussions, who spoke on the condition of anonymity.Some of the companies were also concerned that the relationships they had forged with the government might degrade because of Apple\u2019s battle, according to the people involved in the tech industry discussions. In the years since the disclosures by Edward J. Snowden, the former intelligence contractor who released a trove of details on United States government surveillance tactics, some tech companies have been trying to educate members of Congress about online privacy practices.Others were also anxious that Apple\u2019s defiance of the government could lead to congressional efforts to reshape, in ways unfavorable to the tech industry, the Electronic Communications Privacy Act, which privacy advocates and tech companies have long claimed needs an overhaul.And these companies are watching what effect the fight could have on a proposal to establish a national commission that would explore ways to obtain encrypted data from consumers while working to safeguard users\u2019 privacy. The proposed commission, the bill for which was introduced on Monday, would be led by the House Homeland Security Committee chairman Michael McCaul, Republican of Texas, and Senator Mark Warner, Democrat of Virginia.Nick Wingfield reported from Seattle and Mike Isaac from New York.

{"Headline": "End of Tax Break Program May Blunt Impact of New York Zoning Change", "Date": "2016-03-16", "News": "Supported byBut one stubborn obstacle went unmentioned: The zoning change was meant to work in tandem with a key property tax exemption that no longer exists and can be resurrected only by the State Legislature. Without the tax break, known as 421-a, New York City may have to spend more to subsidize affordable housing, or risk allowing Mr. de Blasio\u2019s housing target to go unmet.The zoning change, called mandatory inclusionary housing, requires that the developers of rental apartment buildings in some parts of the city set aside a portion of units to be offered to tenants at below-market rates. Conceived when the 421-a exemption still existed, the change was expected to clear the way for the creation of about 12,000 affordable apartments through 2024, a sizable step toward the mayor\u2019s goal.Without the exemption, many in the real estate industry and the government believe that the impact of the zoning change will be seriously dampened.\u201cIt is a strange moment,\u201d said Benjamin Dulchin, executive director of the Association for Neighborhood and Housing Development, an advocacy group, which pressed the city to alter the zoning proposal to spur the creation of more units affordable to people at very low income levels. The exemption \u201cwas baked into all their assumptions about how neighborhood real estate markets would work and therefore how they would structure their mandatory inclusionary program.\u201dThe exemption expired in January amid bitter squabbling between City Hall and Albany, and appears unlikely to be revived anytime soon.David G. Greenfield, a councilman from Brooklyn who leads the body\u2019s land use committee, said planners had considered 421-a so integral to the zoning change proposal that the exemption was \u201cmentioned 438 times, by my count,\u201d in a consultant\u2019s report on the subject.\u201cThere\u2019s no question that 421-a plays a critical role and certainly the premise of M.I.H. was that there would be 421-a,\u201d Mr. Greenfield, a Democrat, said, using a shorthand for the zoning proposal. \u201cM.I.H. still works without it, but it doesn\u2019t work as well.\u201dIn the two years since Mr. de Blasio, a Democrat, took office in January 2014, developers have received construction financing for 13,929 affordable units, according to data from the Department of Housing Preservation and Development. Of those, 5,006, or more than a third, were to receive a 421-a subsidy, a clear sign of how heavily the mayor\u2019s overall program relied on the now-defunct exemption.Meredith Marshall, managing partner and co-founder of BRP Development, a company that builds both affordable and market-rate housing, said his company had rushed to start at least one project last year before the 421-a program expired. But the firm was unable to move quickly enough to begin a second one, on a parcel in central Harlem where BRP had planned a medium-size building with fewer than 50 rental units. As a result, Mr. Marshall said, the company was considering a nonresidential use for the site.Though the project might have included fewer than 10 affordable units if it had proceeded, its demise shows how the lack of 421-a subsidies could steadily undermine the mayor\u2019s housing goals.\u201cWould I prefer to have 421-a? Absolutely,\u201d said Vicki Been, commissioner of housing preservation and development. \u201cBut does it mean the mayor\u2019s housing plan is doomed? No. It will require us to be more creative and more nimble.\u201dMs. Been believes state lawmakers will eventually revive the tax break. Even without it, she said, the city could still meet the 12,000-unit goal connected to the rezoning by using other tax-abatement programs and city subsidies, though some officials contend that doing so could divert part of the $8 billion the city has earmarked for meeting the mayor\u2019s housing goals.At the same time, Ms. Been acknowledged that it would be harder to deliver the full results envisioned under the zoning change without the tax abatement.\u201cYou\u2019re working without one spark plug so you\u2019re not running at full throttle,\u201d she said.She cited an internal study that estimated that 60 percent of the affordable units that began construction over the past two years and were eligible for the 421-a program might have qualified for a different sort of abatement.But because the other types of subsidies were geared toward developments that were either entirely affordable or subject to other stringent requirements, it was unclear whether developers of similar projects would seek to use them or would simply choose to build condos instead of rental housing, which is the trend in many areas of the city.\u201cOur position is one of watchful waiting,\u201d Mr. de Blasio said in a recent interview. \u201cPeople are now getting used to the fact it\u2019s not there. I think for a lot of people that\u2019s discomfiting and that may create some of the good pressure toward a solution.\u201d In addition to the new construction, the mayor\u2019s plans call for keeping 120,000 units that are currently affordable from reverting to market rates.The exemption was popular with the real estate industry, but reviled by housing advocates, who saw it as a giveaway to some of New York\u2019s wealthiest developers and a highly inefficient means of creating affordable housing.Last summer, with the 421-a program set to expire unless the Legislature renewed it, Mr. de Blasio proposed a revised version that sweetened the subsidy for developers in exchange for the creation more below-market unitsBut Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, a Democrat who has been feuding with the mayor over various issues, sided with labor unions that insisted the program include a provision requiring projects receiving subsidies to pay union-level wages, something that developers and the mayor said would make such projects too costly. The Legislature passed a six-month extension and called on the real estate industry and construction unions to reach a deal on wages that would allow the abatement to continue. But the two sides could not agree and the tax abatement died on Jan. 15.City officials, citing a rise in construction permits before the exemption expired, said the loss of the program would not be felt right away because there were plenty of affordable units being built. Other data provided by the city does not support that contention.Of the affordable units to get 421-a subsidies over the last two years, fewer received construction financing through the city last year than in 2014 \u2014 2,406 compared with 2,600, a 7 percent decline at odds with the idea that there was a rush to build as the deadline approached. City officials said the data may not reflect some 421-a projects.Jordan Barowitz, a spokesman for the Durst Organization, a large developer, said the second phase of a 2,400-unit rental complex called Hallets Point that the company is building in Astoria, Queens, was in jeopardy if the 421-a program was not revived.\u201cThe economics of the project are simply not viable\u201d without the subsidy, he said. \u201cWe will lose more than 300 affordable units if we can\u2019t proceed.\u201d The Hallets Point project is not affected by the zoning change, which the Council is expected to vote on next week.John Banks, president of the Real Estate Board of New York, which represents large developers, said it was not feasible to build rental housing in New York City without the 421-a subsidies. The combination of high construction and land costs and high taxes on rentals made such construction unprofitable, he said, and the passage of mandatory inclusionary housing would not change that.The subsidies are \u201cthe linchpin in meeting the goal,\u201d Mr. Banks said. \u201cWithout 421-a, in a lot of the city it\u2019s going to be hard to fulfill the provisions of M.I.H.\u201dMr. Greenfield, the city councilman, said that approving the zoning change could force the Legislature to restore some version of the exemption.\u201cThat will put more pressure on Albany to act,\u201d he said. \u201cIt will be very clear and very stark that the lack of 421-a is what\u2019s preventing us from developing more affordable housing in New York City.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "In Scandal at Puerto Rico Utility, Ex-Fuel Buyer Insists He Took No Bribes", "Date": "2016-03-02", "News": "Supported bySAN JUAN, P.R. \u2014 The mystery man at the heart of what is being called \u201ca monumental fraud\u201d in Puerto Rico broke his silence this week, answering questions under oath about whether conspirators at the island\u2019s electric utility overcharged residents by hundreds of millions of dollars and worsened the island\u2019s debt crisis.How did William R. Clark respond to suggestions that he and other utility officials took gifts and favors from vendors seeking lucrative contracts to sell substandard fuel to Puerto Rico\u2019s giant electric authority?\u201cI never received a thing,\u201d said Mr. Clark, who for 18 years led the authority\u2019s fuel oil purchasing office. \u201cNot money, not gifts, not bribes, not trips, not parties.\u201dMr. Clark retired in 2014, just as oil prices were crashing and the bottom dropped out of the electric authority\u2019s finances. A widely viewed television documentary in Puerto Rico at the time, \u201cWhy Do We Pay So Much?\u201d reported that oil companies and other grateful vendors had just thrown Mr. Clark a sumptuous retirement party, and showed him walking into a high-end restaurant while the announcer talked about possible conflicts of interest.Mr. Clark promptly went into seclusion, and until this week remained shrouded in rumor and folklore. On the anniversary of \u201cWhy Do We Pay So Much?\u201d last year, Puerto Rican television broadcast another show, this time about the unsuccessful efforts to find him, called \u201cWhere Is William Clark?\u201dSuspicions about the oil quality have been circulating for years. The Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority, known as Prepa, has been under a federal consent decree since 1999 for violations of the Clean Air Act, requiring it to limit its emissions of sulfur and other substances.Puerto Ricans have complained since at least the 1990s that neighborhoods near power stations were hot spots for asthma, respiratory diseases and other illnesses. Those complaints were among the factors that led to the consent decree.In testimony this week before a special investigative committee of the Puerto Rican Senate, Mr. Clark expressed frustration at the way the media had portrayed him and called himself \u201ca disciplined observer of the rules and regulations\u201d who had done nothing wrong. He said he was eager to dispel myths about goings-on in the Fuel Procurement Office, where just three people control the contracting process.\u201cQuestions are welcome,\u201d he said in his opening statement. \u201cEach of them has an adequate, logical and reasonable response. There is no need to speculate, conjecture, imagine or extrapolate. There is no need to draw conclusions in a vacuum. Detailed explanations exist; the only thing missing has been a willingness to listen to them.\u201dAs for nagging accusations that he had allowed the utility\u2019s power plants to burn fuel with unlawful levels of sulfur, he said that testing for sulfur \u201cwas always done in compliance with the authority\u2019s applicable protocols.\u201d\u201cNo one has shown they have a monopoly on the truth,\u201d he added, nodding to \u201cdifferences of opinion\u201d that had cropped up in certain situations. By following rules set by the power authority, he said on Tuesday, he was able both to buy fuel that was within \u201cacceptable margins of error,\u201d and to approach \u201cthe most effective, efficient and economical operating practices.\u201dAlmost immediately after he made that statement, the going began to get rough.\u201cYou are the second witness to talk about \u2018acceptable margins of error,\u2019 \u201d said the main investigator, a retired prosecutor named C\u00e9sar L\u00f3pez Cintr\u00f3n. The first had been Mr. Clark\u2019s former deputy in the Fuel Procurement Office, Edwin Rodr\u00edguez, who has held the job since Mr. Clark retired. He testified last week.Both those statements on acceptable margins of error \u201care absolutely false,\u201d said Mr. L\u00f3pez Cintr\u00f3n.Mr. Rodr\u00edguez cut his own testimony short last week and walked out in the middle of his appearance, after Mr. L\u00f3pez Cintr\u00f3n ordered his lawyer to leave for violating procedural rules. Mr. Rodr\u00edguez has since offered to return, but the special committee has not yet decided whether to receive him.Mr. L\u00f3pez Cintr\u00f3n walked Mr. Clark step-by-step through his duties as the utility\u2019s purchasing chief. Yes, Mr. Clark had signed contracts. Yes, he approved invoices. He evaluated inventories. He authorized emergency purchases. He calculated prices. It all added up to a picture of Mr. Clark in absolute control.Mr. Clark tried to assert, however, that it was not his job to select the labs that would test oil shipments for sulfur. Mr. L\u00f3pez Cintr\u00f3n pounced.\u201cWho put the signature on this contract?\u201d he demanded, showing an agreement with a lab that Mr. Clark had signed.\u201cYes, but \u2014\u201d said Mr. Clark.\u201cI just want to know if that\u2019s your signature,\u201d Mr. L\u00f3pez Cintr\u00f3n said.Mr. Clark confirmed it was his, and Mr. L\u00f3pez-Cintr\u00f3n asked what it would mean if Mr. Clark had played favorites among the outside labs, perhaps steering business to the ones he could rely upon to say the oil was compliant.\u201cThen I would not have been doing my job correctly,\u201d Mr. Clark replied.As Mr. Clark spoke, up to the witness table marched two auditors from the Puerto Rico Comptroller\u2019s Office, to the apparent surprise of Mr. Clark and his lawyer, who asked to be excused for a moment. But Mr. L\u00f3pez Cintr\u00f3n made them stay.The auditors sat down next to Mr. Clark and testified that they had been tracking the electric utility\u2019s disbursements since 2008. They produced records showing that in fact, one lab had received 87 percent of the oil-testing business.And so it went, hour after hour.It was the fourth week of testimony before the Senate panel, which is trying to nail down reports that for decades, the electric authority was buying cheap, dirty fuel and overcharging customers for it. The disparity, the theory goes, created a spread between two prices that would have been multiplied across millions of barrels of oil for nearly 30 years, giving rise to a big slush fund.If such a fund existed, no one has explained who may have had access to it or what it might have been used for. But there is substantial speculation.\u201cThey kept buying oil that was not the specified quality or the specified amount. Why were they doing that?\u201d said Eduardo Bhatia, president of the Puerto Rico Senate and a member of the special investigative committee. \u201cThe only reason I could think of was, at some point they were getting benefits out of that. What benefits were they getting? Were they being paid off? Were they getting kickbacks? Were they coming up with the money for financing political campaigns, or what?\u201dThe committee\u2019s rules put all investigative powers into the hands of Mr. L\u00f3pez Cintr\u00f3n and two other independent investigators, to keep senators and other elected officials from trying to tamper with the process in an election year.So Senator Bhatia and other lawmakers must wait for the investigators to present their evidence and eventually refer the matter to law enforcement agencies if that seems warranted.Senator Bhatia has already said publicly that he has seen enough to be persuaded that \u201ca monumental fraud\u201d took place within the power authority.Advertisement"}

On March 24, Argentina commemorates the 40th anniversary of a military coup that \u201cdisappeared\u201d thousands of people, a deep trauma in Argentina\u2019s national psyche.There were other, greater atrocities in South America in that era, like the ones that occurred during virtual civil wars in Colombia or Guatemala. The killings in Argentina may have been lesser in number, but this was premeditated mass murder.Argentina\u2019s military dictatorship organized its killings in death camps, with methods reminiscent of the Nazis\u2019 (and many Nazis had, in fact, found asylum in Argentina after World War II and still lived there then). In many cases, doctors injected opponents with sedatives before they were dropped, still alive, from planes into the freezing waters of the South Atlantic.Argentina must be commended for its efforts to confront this ugly past. In a reckoning rare in the annals of international justice, more than 1,000 former officers have been put on trial, and hundreds have been convicted. Last week\u2019s announcement ahead of Mr. Obama\u2019s visit by the national security adviser, Susan E. Rice, that the American government would declassify military and intelligence records on the dictatorship could provide evidence for further prosecutions.In his letter to Mr. Obama, Mr. P\u00e9rez Esquivel noted that the military dictatorship had relied on \u201cfinancing, training and coordination by the United States.\u201d Human rights activists point to a 1976 meeting between Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger and the regime\u2019s foreign minister, Adm. C\u00e9sar Augusto Guzzetti, at which Admiral Guzzetti asked for American \u201cunderstanding and support\u201d in suppressing resistance to the coup.Many Argentines find it hard to forgive the encouragement for atrocities. But an attitude that Mr. Obama somehow represents such thinking, and should not be welcomed, is mistaken.Those who are still angry at the United States over its abetting of the military junta also forget that President Jimmy Carter helped save many lives after he took office in 1977 by making human rights a cornerstone of American foreign policy.It\u2019s a sad epilogue to the United States\u2019 mixed record on the dictatorship of the 1970s that many in Argentina seem unwilling to admit that Washington\u2019s initial support for the dictatorship was later counterbalanced by the brave efforts of the Carter administration to rein in the killers in uniform.Uki Go\u00f1i is the author of \u201cThe Real Odessa: Smuggling the Nazis to Per\u00f3n\u2019s Argentina\u201d and a contributing opinion writer.Advertisement"}

They lived for a few years in San Francisco and then moved to New York, settling into a rented one-bedroom fourth-floor walk-up in Yorkville on the Upper East Side.When Mr. Dotson, now 52, received a small inheritance from his grandparents, the couple decided to buy a home, but felt they couldn\u2019t afford the city. They discovered the large houses and reasonable property taxes in Milford, Conn., and bought a centuries-old farmhouse there.\u201cAll we had to do was deal with the commute,\u201d said Mr. Sullivan, who is 55. The train ride on Metro-North to Grand Central Terminal was around an hour and a half. Being early risers, however, both found the commute doable, at least for a while.Up popped not a penthouse in Midtown but a house in central Vermont, surrounded by nearly 40 acres, mistakenly categorized.\u201cI was so intrigued that for $129,000, you could get all this,\u201d Mr. Dotson said. \u201cI knew this was really stupid. But it was like a magnet.\u201dThe couple drove north, bought the property, acquired a heavy-duty pickup truck that could traverse dirt roads, and used the house as a weekend getaway. \u201cI didn\u2019t even know what \u2018off the grid\u2019 meant,\u201d Mr. Dotson said. \u201cWe were at least half a mile from an electric pole.\u201dThe restaurant turned out to require far more work than they had anticipated. \u201cThere is definitely a fantasy aspect in the beginning, and then the reality sets in,\u201d Mr. Sullivan said. In 2011, Hurricane Irene flooded the premises. They rebuilt, even though they wanted out.\u201cAs we were getting into our 50s, this was way too many hours,\u201d Mr. Sullivan said. The winters were harsh. \u201cWe both missed the city terribly.\u201dThey sold the restaurant last fall.Mr. Sullivan contacted a former colleague at the bank where he used to work, and within a few weeks had a job in the field of supply chain finance. \u201cI consider myself very lucky that I got a job at 55 years old,\u201d he said.With a start date in hand but no place to live, the couple contacted Klara Madlin, the president of Klara Madlin Real Estate, who was recommended by some New York friends. She arranged to take Mr. Sullivan for a day of apartment hunting. Mr. Dotson, who is now job-hunting in the field of export logistics, remained in Vermont with their dog, Hubble.The couple wanted at least two bedrooms, easy access to a subway for Mr. Sullivan\u2019s commute to the financial district, and a backyard for Hubble. Their budget was up to $4,000 a month.For that price, \u201cI told them we might have to give up the outdoor space,\u201d Ms. Madlin said. But they could still be fairly close to a park for dog-walking.They began the hunt in their old Yorkville neighborhood. At a 40-story condominium high-rise on East 85th Street, a one-bedroom converted to two was renting for $3,750 a month. It was on the 35th floor.The views were striking, but the idea of Hubble \u201chaving to wait for an elevator to go 35 floors was a little scary,\u201d Mr. Sullivan said. \u201cHe was a Vermont dog. I could open the door and he could go outside.\u201dA little farther uptown, on East 95th Street, a nicely renovated two-bedroom, one-bathroom garden duplex was available for $3,900 a month. It had a large fenced backyard. The floors were connected by a narrow spiral staircase.\u201cA lot of people have a problem with a tight spiral staircase if the bathroom is on another floor,\u201d as was the case here, Ms. Madlin said.On the Upper West Side, a three-bedroom on 105th Street, for $4,200 a month, was on the second floor. It would be easy to run downstairs with the dog. Mr. Sullivan considered it. But the place was over budget and he had one more candidate on his list.That place, a newly renovated ground-floor duplex in South Harlem, for $4,000 a month, had three bedrooms and three bathrooms plus a big backyard and a normal staircase. Mr. Sullivan didn\u2019t hesitate. The couple signed on immediately, paid a broker fee of 15 percent of a year\u2019s rent, or $7,200, and arrived late last fall.Their new city home is just what they wanted and more. They turned one of the three bedrooms into an office and reserve another for guests. They also have a storage room and a full-size washer and dryer. \u201cIt is nice being on the ground floor at our age,\u201d Mr. Dotson said.With weekends off for the first time in years, they have time to enjoy the city. Men and dog get plenty of exercise daily in Central Park, just a block away, and on weekends in Morningside Park, a bit farther. \u201cThe avenues are wide in Harlem,\u201d Mr. Dotson said, with plenty of sidewalk space for a dog.\u201cIt has always been an adventure,\u201d Mr. Sullivan said. \u201cWe\u2019ve always taken loads of chances, and people told us we were crazy, but it always worked out in the end.\u201dEmail: thehunt@nytimes.comAdvertisement"}

Of black teenagers, ages 16 to 19, nearly 89 percent had no work in 2014.Recent research provides some clues for what drives unemployment and social disconnection in Chicago\u2019s poor communities. It shows that the city\u2019s high-poverty communities have lost much of the middle class and can no longer support businesses or even nonprofit institutions. Per capita, poor communities in Chicago have fewer of these institutions than equally poor areas in the average American city or even in the average Rust Belt city.In quantitative terms, the program reduced arrests for violent offenses by 43 percent over the period studied. Researchers will continue to follow these young people to see if the summer job experience improves later education and employment outcomes.Chicago expects to expand the program to 3,000 students this summer, up from 2,000 in 2015. Of course, that is still well short of the need in a city of Chicago\u2019s size.

{"Headline": "Xi Jinping\u2019s Remedy for China\u2019s Economic Gloom Has Echoes of Reaganomics", "Date": "2016-03-03", "News": "Supported byThe new slogan, expected to receive top billing when China\u2019s legislature convenes Saturday, represents an effort to rejuvenate Mr. Xi\u2019s faltering plans to overhaul the Chinese economy. But he still faces widespread skepticism that he is committed to thorough restructuring, which would require reducing bloated state enterprises, along with millions of jobs.The supply side Mr. Xi is referring to would, like Reaganomics, include lowering taxes and reducing the government burden on investors. Yet its main goal appears to be shutting or paring down mines and factories that produce far more coal, steel, cement and other industrial products than the market demands and reining in the credit and subsidies that feed that glut.Some economists say the supply-side rubric is at least a step toward painful measures that could lead to healthier growth.Mr. Xi has reorganized China\u2019s military and orchestrated a scorching campaign against corruption. But breakthroughs in the economy have eluded him, which many economists say have sapped business confidence.On Wednesday, Moody\u2019s Investors Service, the credit ratings agency, lowered its outlook for China from stable to negative, citing \u201cuncertainty about the authorities\u2019 capacity to implement reforms.\u201dSkeptics attribute the problem partly to the repeated clash of Mr. Xi\u2019s economic goals with his political objectives. While he has shown great enterprise in centralizing power, they say, he has been reluctant to restrain the reach of the state, especially to curtail state companies\u2019 privileged, often monopolistic, access to loans, resources and customers.Several economists said Mr. Xi\u2019s supply-side initiative may turn out to be cosmetic \u2014 promising market liberalization yet magnifying state control.China\u2019s economy is faltering, prompting concerns that are now shaking global stock markets.Many liberal economists remain unconvinced that for all the tough talk, the Chinese government would willingly reduce its own power and risk a backlash from displaced workers. Recalibrating state-supported industries to true market levels would mean cutting millions of jobs.Mr. Xi first laid out a sweeping blueprint for economic rejuvenation, including vows to revamp the state sector and nurture market forces, in 2013. But the halting progress reflected his reluctance to cede state control, several economists said.The mixed signals have paralyzed state officials, who are unsure how far to impose cuts while preserving stability.How far Mr. Xi is willing to go, given the economic warning sirens, may become clearer after the Communist Party leadership presents its economic plans to the legislature, the National People\u2019s Congress.It could also be difficult if they do.But if the slowing of the economy is forcing Mr. Xi to act, it has also increased the costs of doing so.During the first wave of closings of state-owned factories, starting in 1997, more than 30 million jobs were eliminated in less than a decade. But the Chinese economy boomed, especially after China joined the World Trade Organization in 2001, creating jobs that absorbed many of the excess workers.The job losses envisioned today, while smaller, may be more contentious when the economy is slowing. They threaten to erode the stability Mr. Xi prizes.Since the financial crisis of 2008, the government has spent heavily to stimulate the economy, increasing the debt. Chinese supply-siders say such splurging has reached unsustainable levels.Beyond correcting such distortions, debate remains over what specific policies fall under the supply-side banner. Officials and economists have called for tax cuts for private businesses and giving private investors bigger stakes in more state-owned companies, while ruling out full privatization.But the concept is vague enough that it has also been used to argue for a greater government role to promote exports and prop up faltering state firms.\u201cIf there\u2019s no sign of a solution, this year could be especially dangerous,\u201d he said. \u201cWithout reforms, there\u2019ll be big problems.\u201dAnd supply-side structural reform would be just another slogan.Because of an editing error, an earlier version of a picture caption with this article misstated the name of a Chinese city that is home to a coal-fired power plant. It is Shanxi, not Shaxi.An article on March 4 about President Xi Jinping\u2019s remedy for China\u2019s economic gloom, which has echoes of Reaganomics, misstated part of the name of an American credit-rating agency that lowered its outlook for China from stable to negative earlier that week. It is Moody\u2019s Investors Service (not Investor). Although the error was corrected online shortly after publication, editors failed to follow through with this print correction.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "MetLife Wins Battle to Remove \u2018Too Big to Fail\u2019 Label", "Date": "2016-03-30", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Opponents of the Dodd-Frank financial overhaul won an important battle on Wednesday as a federal judge here stripped the \u201ctoo big to fail\u201d label from the insurance company MetLife.With memories still fresh on how the American International Group\u2019s 2008 near-collapse rattled the global financial system, the Dodd-Frank Act empowered regulators to classify certain large nonbank institutions as deserving as the big banks of increased capital requirements and greater scrutiny.But Judge Rosemary M. Collyer of the Federal District Court for the District of Columbia overturned MetLife\u2019s designation, raising questions about how regulators determine who is too big to fail.The judge\u2019s full opinion is currently under seal, but her order on Wednesday said that she had upheld arguments that regulators failed to adequately assess the insurance company\u2019s vulnerability to extreme financial distress and the potential economic impact of the designation.She also appeared to back, at least in part, MetLife\u2019s charge that regulators relied on unsubstantiated assumptions or speculation during the designation process that were not supported by the reform law or regulators\u2019 own interpretive guidance.\u201cToday\u2019s ruling really vindicates our decision to seek a judicial review of that designation,\u201d said Steven A. Kandarian, the chief executive and chairman of MetLife, the nation\u2019s largest life insurer.The Treasury Department said in a statement that it disagreed with the judge\u2019s decision and that it would continue to defend the \u201cdesignations process vigorously.\u201dRegulators, it said, \u201cconducted a rigorous analysis of MetLife, including extensive engagement with the company, and determined that material financial distress at MetLife could pose such a threat to the financial system.\u201dA Treasury spokesman did not respond to requests for comment on whether the government would appeal the ruling. The Treasury Department, under Secretary Jacob J. Lew, leads a body of regulators created by Dodd-Frank \u2014 the Financial Stability Oversight Council \u2014 to make decisions about systemically important financial institutions.Several supporters of Dodd-Frank said they hoped the legal fight would continue.\u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s any question that if this decision were allowed to stand, it would, at a minimum, slow down the regulation of systemic threats to the shadow banking system, and it may well prevent the regulation of those systemic threats,\u201d said Dennis Kelleher, president and chief executive of Better Markets, an advocacy group.Some warn that the decision could also sway future rule-making efforts. The Federal Reserve, for example, is writing new rules to oversee insurance companies deemed systemically important.Robert J. Jackson, a professor at Columbia Law School and a former adviser to the Treasury Department, said that the judge\u2019s decision on Wednesday could have a chilling effect.\u201cMy concern would be that federal regulators are going to be afraid to take the steps they\u2019ll need to take to stop another A.I.G.,\u201d he said. (With other law professors, Mr. Jackson wrote an amicus brief in support of the government\u2019s position.)At the same time, the decision will most likely embolden House Republicans who have criticized the Treasury Department and the oversight council for not being more open about the process.The House Financial Services Committee issued subpoenas to four Treasury officials this month, part of a fight for more information around the agency\u2019s handling of the debt ceiling. Several lawmakers have also introduced legislation in recent years intended to make the council and the designation of nonbanks more transparent.\u201cThe Financial Stability Oversight Council typifies the unfair Washington insider system that Americans have come to fear and loathe: powerful government bureaucrats, secretive government meetings, arbitrary and capricious rules and the power to pick winners and losers \u2013 and taxpayers always end up being the losers,\u201d Representative Jeb Hensarling of Texas, the Republican chairman of the committee, said in a statement on Wednesday.Besides MetLife and A.I.G., Prudential Financial and General Electric\u2019s financing arm are the other nonbanks that have been designated systemically important. Some are already changing.MetLife and General Electric\u2019s finance arm are seeking to separate or sell businesses to lose the designation. A.I.G. has decided to streamline, but is stopping short of an outright breakup, something activist investors like Carl C. Icahn and John Paulson have pushed it to pursue.Depending on the details of the judge\u2019s full opinion, Prudential and A.I.G. may also weigh their own legal challenges.\u201cIf Judge Collyer\u2019s decision details her belief that the process is unlawful, then the odds of legal challenges from A.I.G. and Prudential increase,\u201d said Isaac Boltansky, an analyst with Compass Point Research & Trading. \u201cBut if her decision is more narrowly defined and she says the process was incorrectly applied to MetLife, then the dynamics for A.I.G. and Prudential are unlikely changed.\u201dThe firms themselves said little after the court ruling.\u201cWe continuously review developments that impact our company, and we are evaluating what is in the best interests of the company and our shareholders,\u201d said Scot Hoffman, a spokesman for Prudential Financial.An A.I.G. spokesman declined to comment on the ruling.MetLife was found to be systemically important in December 2014, and the company sued the government a month later. The two sides made their arguments before Judge Collyer last month.At the time, the judge asked several questions that suggested that she might be skeptical of how regulators analyzed the MetLife case.On Wednesday, Judge Collyer ordered both sides to file a notice by April 6 regarding whether any portions of the opinion should remain blocked from public view.Mr. Kandarian of MetLife said that the court decision would not affect his company\u2019s previously announced plans to spin off its retail life and annuity businesses, though he had previously acknowledged that the \u201ctoo big to fail\u201d label had played a role in the decision, among other factors.\u201cWe are moving forward with the plan to separate the U.S. retail business,\u201d he said.Shares of MetLife rose over 5 percent on Wednesday.Liz Moyer contributed reporting from New York.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Plan to Rescue Puerto Rico Advances, Led by House Republicans", "Date": "2016-03-24", "News": "Supported byPoliticians in Washington are coalescing around a financial plan to rescue Puerto Rico, just weeks before an expected major default on bond payments that would spread more turmoil through the island\u2019s shaky economy.The plan, being drafted as legislation by House Republicans, would not grant Puerto Rico\u2019s most fervent request: permission to restructure its entire $72 billion debt in bankruptcy. It would, however, give the island certain crucial tools that bankruptcy proceedings can offer \u2014 but only if it first comes under close federal oversight and meets other conditions.The oversight would be provided by a five-member voting board, selected by the president of the United States from candidates with expertise in finance, law or other relevant fields; at least two would have their primary residence in Puerto Rico. The secretary of the Treasury and the governor of Puerto Rico would also serve on the board, but would not have a vote.The board would have offices both in Washington and San Juan, and would have the power to subpoena documents from both governments. It would audit Puerto Rico\u2019s government, improve operations, find savings and ultimately determine how much of the $72 billion debt really has to be restructured, if any. The creation of such a board has been highly controversial on the island, where some residents and officials have called it an act of \u201ccolonialism,\u201d and expressed some concern about outsiders making financial decisions \u2014 like budget cuts \u2014 that could adversely affect island residents.The rescue package is primarily the work of House Republicans under the direction of Paul Ryan, the House speaker, in consultation with the Treasury Department and Democratic leaders, including Representative Nancy Pelosi, the minority leader.Like Puerto Rico, the Treasury Department has been calling for all of the island\u2019s debts to be eligible for restructuring, no matter which part of the government issued them.But while the House Republicans drafting the rescue package have worked closely with Treasury, they remain skeptical of Puerto Rico\u2019s financial disclosures and want the oversight board to first audit each unit of government, allowing restructurings only \u201cin certain areas\u201d and \u201cwhere necessary,\u201d according to a legislative summary reviewed by The New York Times.The plan would also require Puerto Rico to provide fair-value measurements of all pension assets and liabilities, instead of the numbers now provided by actuaries, which tend to understate the amounts promised. Puerto Rico currently reports a pension shortfall of around $43 billion, but at fair value the shortfall could be twice that amount or even more. Telling the truth about the cost of its pension plan would make it harder for Puerto Rico to mismanage the plan in the future.The Treasury had recommended that Puerto Rico give pension payments to retired government workers priority over payments to bondholders, but lawmakers rejected that approach.Rearranging the existing payment priorities \u201cwould have serious consequences on the broader municipal bond market and existing creditor-to-debtor relationships,\u201d the summary said.Before any restructuring of its debt, most it in the form of municipal bonds, the government would first be required to seek a consensual settlement in mediation. It would also have to issue up-to-date audited financial statements and balance its budget; Puerto Rico\u2019s debt grew to its current crushing size because for years it took out new long-term debt just to get enough cash to get through the year.If Puerto Rican officials are unable to make the budget balance with existing resources, the oversight board would have the power to do it for them \u2014 which could mean cuts in services.On the other hand, House Republicans agreed with the Treasury that any restructuring would best take place outside of bankruptcy. Giving Puerto Rico access to the bankruptcy courts threatened to become a constitutional minefield. Instead of working through the bankruptcy code, the lawmakers devised a restructuring framework under the Territorial Clause of the United States Constitution, which gives Congress broad authority to write \u201call needful rules and regulations\u201d for territories.The legislative summary states that giving Puerto Rico access to Chapter 9 \u201cis ill conceived and would undermine the rule of law.\u201dMuch of the rescue package has been drafted in the House Natural Resources Committee under its chairman, Rob Bishop of Utah. It jumped into action after Mr. Ryan set the March deadline back in December, instructing the committees with jurisdiction \u201cto come up with a responsible solution\u201d by then.If the lawmakers stay on schedule \u2014 a \u201cdiscussion draft\u201d is to be made public Tuesday \u2014 the rescue package could be the first substantial piece of legislation to get traction in the House since Mr. Ryan was elected speaker in October, promising to rejuvenate the legislative process by giving the committees the lead in drafting all major bills.\u201cOpen the process,\u201d Mr. Ryan said at the time. \u201cLet people participate, and they might change their tune. A neglected minority will gum up the works. A respected minority will work in good faith.\u201dAlthough the Natural Resources Committee might seem an odd place to resolve an offshore financial collapse, the committee has jurisdiction over America\u2019s territories, which include Puerto Rico.The top-ranked Democrat on the committee, Raul Grijalva of Arizona, yielded his position in hearings to Puerto Rico\u2019s nonvoting member of Congress, Pedro Pierluisi, also a Democrat, to give someone from the island a central role.A number of representatives, all Democrats, who are not members of the committee also took part because they have close ties to Puerto Rico. Several of them have said they thought the Republicans were negotiating in good faith, although they had not yet seen the draft of the bill.A court-supervised restructuring would offer Puerto Rico some of the legal tools that bankruptcy makes available. The plan, for example, would hold off creditor lawsuits while the restructuring is underway, a central feature of bankruptcy court.Chapter 9 is the part of the bankruptcy code for insolvent governments. Currently, the code specifically bars Puerto Rico from seeking any relief under Chapter 9, and the governor and other officials have been calling for an amendment to change that.On Tuesday, Puerto Rico went before the Supreme Court seeking the right to enact its own version of a bankruptcy law. Justices were aggressive in their questioning but seemed perplexed about why Congress \u2014 in 1984 \u2014 denied the island bankruptcy protection.The Natural Resources committee also has taken an interest in Puerto Rico\u2019s big electric power authority, which is responsible for about $9 billion of the island\u2019s total debt. It appears to be insolvent and is embroiled in a scandal over improprieties in its purchases of fuel oil, its biggest expense.A summary of the rescue plan cites power costs as one reason people and businesses have been leaving Puerto Rico.An earlier version of this article misidentified the state represented by Rob Bishop, chairman of the House Natural Resources Committee. It is Utah, not Colorado.An article on Friday about a congressional plan to address Puerto Rico\u2019s financial crisis misstated, in some copies, when the island made its case to the Supreme Court. It was on Tuesday, not last week.Advertisement"}

He has a charming impulse to ridicule anything that sounds absurd and self-righteous, even if it is accurate. His Twitter handle \u2014 @whatwouldDOOdo \u2014 is a pun and a question, a vessel for jokes, but also for good will.\u201cI just like showing people \u2014 and this might be at the root of everything that I\u2019ve done \u2014 that I don\u2019t want to be looked at as a baseball robot,\u201d he said the other morning, before an A\u2019s practice. \u201cIt feels weird to say there\u2019s more to me than that, like I\u2019m being overdramatic, and a tear rolls down my cheek. But, no \u2014 I do like I feel like there\u2019s more to me than just baseball.\u201cWhen I was a kid, I remember my parents would say, \u2018Baseball is what you do, but that\u2019s not who you are\u2019 \u2014 like that might be my job, but that\u2019s not the end-all, be-all. I feel like I might even be able to use it to help other people or open some doors or explore more opportunities.\u201dMany athletes donate time and money to charities. Doolittle is a strong supporter of Operation Finally Home, which builds houses for wounded veterans and their families. The difference with Doolittle and his girlfriend, Eireann Dolan, a writer and a host on Comcast SportsNet Bay Area, is their willingness to embrace publicly the kinds of causes rarely discussed, let alone endorsed, in the strongly right-leaning culture of the baseball clubhouse.Last spring, in response to an online backlash against a scheduled lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender Pride Night at the Oakland Coliseum, Doolittle and Dolan raised $40,000 and bought about 900 tickets. Last fall, in response to the call by some governors to bar Syrian refugees, they planned and financed a Thanksgiving dinner for refugee families in Chicago, Dolan\u2019s hometown. Twitter trolls, Dolan said, criticized them for the public nature of such causes.\u201cIt does seem disingenuous to say, \u2018Look at me giving!\u2019 \u2014 but this, to me, is a little different, because we\u2019re trying to create things where people can get involved and be part of a movement,\u201d Dolan said.\u201cThere\u2019s an impact that can be had by sharing it and sort of crowdsourcing it \u2014 especially with Oakland A\u2019s fans, who are crazy generous. The opportunity cost of not getting them involved is just too great. People really respond when given an opportunity to take part in something.\u201dDolan\u2019s mother is gay, and her grandfather emigrated from Ireland to flee a civil war. She feared that gay people who were newly out might see empty seats on Pride Night and take it as a rejection of their orientation. A Thanksgiving feast for Syrian refugees simply seemed like the humane thing to do.\u201cWhether you like it or not, these people are part of our community now,\u201d Doolittle said. \u201cThese people are part of our country now. They\u2019re going to go to our schools and pay taxes and join our military and work here. Why not welcome them? \u201cRegardless of people\u2019s stances on the issue, when they\u2019re here, let\u2019s show them that regardless of what\u2019s going on with our political scene right now in America, we can be hospitable. Let\u2019s welcome them in and treat them like we treat the rest of our neighbors.\u201dTheir plan attracted the notice of the Chicago mayor\u2019s office, which helped organize the dinner but changed the time, holding it before Doolittle and Dolan arrived in town. But her father attended in their place, and A\u2019s fans, she said, donated cookies and pies for desserts.On Pride Night, held last June, hundreds of fans enjoyed a game and several charities shared in the donations. Stephanie Perron, the director of Our Space, a community center for at-risk L.G.B.T. teens and young adults, had never heard of Doolittle or Dolan before her group was included.\u201cI was surprised to get the phone call,\u201d she said. \u201cI had never thought about approaching sports folks for support. But I think it really speaks to the power of relationship building. Change happens when we know one another and build a community.\u201dThrough the Pride Night event, Bloomingdale\u2019s learned about Our Space and held a fund-raiser, with Doolittle and Dolan greeting fans. Again, he said, his involvement stemmed from an instinct to do what seemed right.\u201cCould you imagine being ostracized or judged or shunned just for being who you are?\u201d he said. \u201cI guess that blew my mind, more than anything else. If you\u2019re born a certain way, or if you\u2019re born in a certain part of the world, you\u2019re persecuted for that? That doesn\u2019t make sense. I\u2019ll never understand that.\u201dThe main theme, said Doolittle, 29, is finding a negative and spinning it around. The idea made him a major leaguer. Drafted as a first baseman but ravaged by leg injuries, he turned to pitching and reinvented himself, earning an All-Star selection in 2014. He missed most of last season with shoulder trouble, but he returned and pitched well down the stretch.Using social media comes naturally for Doolittle and Dolan, who followed each other on Twitter before they met. In 2012, Dolan was working on a comedy-writing venture with the then-Oakland pitcher Brandon McCarthy, who told his teammate that Dolan would be a good match for his sense of humor. Doolittle direct-messaged Dolan on Twitter and asked her on a date to get frozen yogurt, and they have been together ever since.\u201cIs that a tale as old as time?\u201d she said. \u201cHonestly.\u201dDoolittle\u2019s Twitter feed offers a slice of personality, heavy on \u201cStar Wars\u201d references, low on politics. The son of an Air Force navigator who was awarded a bronze star in 2003 for his role in Operation Enduring Freedom, he said he was a lifelong Republican and had found no current presidential candidate to be inspiring. But by watching the debates, knowing the issues and taking an occasional activist stance, Doolittle distinguishes himself.\u201cIt takes a lot of confidence and guts to put yourself out there,\u201d said Oakland outfielder Sam Fuld, the son of a former New Hampshire state senator. Fuld said players rarely discussed social causes beyond a few one-liners. \u201cYou\u2019ll never see us set up at a round table hashing out political issues,\u201d he said.Among teammates, there seems to be, at least, a certain respect for Doolittle\u2019s resolve to support issues that others would avoid. He is more than a player.\u201cI think it\u2019s great that Sean is outspoken about the things that he believes in,\u201d catcher Stephen Vogt said, \u201cand he goes to such great lengths to bring awareness to those areas that he is passionate about.\u201dAdvertisement"}

But Affymetrix\u2019s shareholders are scheduled to vote on that transaction this week, and shares in the target company jumped on Friday to $15.99 \u2014 suggesting that its shareholders believe that a bidding war may be brewing.Affymetrix\u2019s chief executive, Frank Witney, said in the statement that his company held preliminary conversations with the Origin executives last fall and invited them to submit a written proposal.\u201cWe heard nothing further from them for over four months until they announced their unsolicited proposal on March 18,\u201d Mr. Witney said. \u201cThe board of directors of Affymetrix is firmly committed to carrying out its fiduciary duties and maximizing value for our stockholders, while at the same time complying with the customary provisions of our merger agreement with Thermo Fisher.\u201dThermo Fisher pointed to the work that Affymetrix did for the United States government as one reason the government panel, commonly known as Cfius, would conduct a lengthy review of the Origin proposal and delay any closing of that transaction.\u201cThe proposal put forth to Affymetrix by Origin Technologies, a newly created shell entity relying on a vague and insufficient financing package from a Chinese firm, is highly uncertain and speculative,\u201d Marc N. Casper, Thermo Fisher\u2019s chief executive, said in a statement.Origin has argued that Centrillion is an American company and that any government inquiries would take place after Affymetrix shareholders are paid.A representative for Origin did not have an immediate comment.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Ex-Professor Upsets Ukraine Politics, and Russia Peace Accord", "Date": "2016-03-18", "News": "Supported byThe Saturday ProfileKIEV, Ukraine \u2014 WHEN she moved into her office as deputy speaker of Parliament a little over a year ago, Oksana I. Syroyid hung a large oil painting called \u201cThe Edge of the Sky Is Glowing.\u201d It shows a man turning his back on the viewer while flames burn on the horizon.A 39-year-old native of the Lviv region in the country\u2019s nationalist west, Ms. Syroyid talks boldly about Ukraine acting in its own interests, not those of outside powers. \u201cWe need to stop thinking of how to counter Putin, or how to please all our partners,\u201d she said in a recent interview.The question many here ask is whether Ms. Syroyid, a relative newcomer, can somehow master the byzantine structure of Ukrainian politics and emerge as the one to lead the country out of the morass of corruption and government dysfunction that threatens its future. Or, is she just another in a line of ambitious upstarts causing Western governments their latest headache in Ukraine and, possibly, taking the country down with her?One thing is certain: She is not afraid to take a stand.Last month, she pulled the Self-Reliance party out of the ruling coalition, inviting new parliamentary elections despite strong feelings in Brussels and Washington that Ukraine is too unstable to go through another round of voting.\u201cWe have to be ourselves,\u201d she said in a recent interview. \u201cAnd only if we are good at that will we have partners and friends.\u201dA BOOKISH, bespectacled expert on the Ukrainian Constitution, Ms. Syroyid put away her professorial turtlenecks when she entered politics and now dresses to the nines, saying she is taking a cue from Ms. Tymoshenko, the braided, crusading pioneer of female politicians in this patriarchal country.\u201cShe definitely is the brightest person in Ukrainian politics, and not only among women,\u201d said Ms. Syroyid, who earned a law degree in Canada. \u201cShe is very stylish, and has a very feminine look. At the same time she is known for her tough decisions.\u201dNone have been tougher than Parliament\u2019s de facto rejection of Minsk II, which takes its name from the capital of Belarus where President Petro O. Poroshenko and Russia\u2019s president, Vladimir V. Putin, signed it, with French and German mediation.Ms. Syroyid, who entered Parliament in 2014, has emerged as the face of this rejection, unabashedly rallying her fellow members of Parliament to stand fast against Western pressure. While politicians in Russia and Ukraine have taken turns blaming one another for stalling the implementation of Minsk II, Ms. Syroyid has proudly taken credit.After visiting Ms. Syroyid last month, and again hearing she would not budge, Germany\u2019s foreign minister, Frank-Walter Steinmeier, said this week that the credibility of the Minsk process was threatened. \u201cBoth sides need to perform,\u201d he said.Under paragraph 11 of the accord, Ukraine was supposed to adopt the constitutional amendment by the end of last year, but did not, as Ms. Syroyid worked tirelessly to dissuade her colleagues from voting for it.The change, Ms. Syroyid said, would allow the Kremlin to regain a foothold in Ukrainian politics by requiring the central government to recognize, and integrate, the Russian-backed leadership in the east. It would, for example, allow the rebel leadership, with a track record of holding sham elections, to fill 14 vacant parliamentary seats in Kiev. Until Russian soldiers leave the Donbas region, she says, Ukraine should refuse any integration and call it an occupied territory.\u201cRussia wants to destabilize Ukraine,\u201d she said. \u201cThis paragraph 11 of the Minsk agreement is an instrument just like the war. This is not for the sake of resolution of the conflict; it is for the sake of destabilizing Ukraine.\u201dPassage of the amendment requires a supermajority of 300 of Parliament\u2019s 450 members, an all-but-impossible vote now that Ms. Syroyid has unified the country\u2019s nationalist parties against the measure.To her critics, the obstinacy of Ms. Syroyid and her like-minded supporters in Parliament is mind-bogglingly irresponsible, the tantrum at the children\u2019s table after the adults of European statesmanship had prepared a healthy settlement.\u201cThis position stems from pure populism,\u201d Oleh Voloshyn, a consultant for the Opposition Bloc political party, said of her tactics.He said Ukraine had to face the reality that it was in the weakest possible position, having lost the war to Russia and surviving on a financial lifeline from the International Monetary Fund. \u201cThere are two options: You win the war, or you lose the war. And when you lose the war, you have to negotiate. That is the problem. You don\u2019t have any other alternative.\u201dSUPPORTERS say Ms. Syroyid has the backing of Ukrainian voters, whose anger at Mr. Putin is often evident. Any rejection of his demands is likely to win the voters\u2019 favor. Besides, they say, Mr. Putin needs a peace agreement now more than ever, to get the West to lift economic sanctions that are hurting his energy-dependent economy.\u201cIt\u2019s a difficult process not because of Syroyid per se, but because the Ukrainian public doesn\u2019t accept it,\u201d said Tymofiy S. Mylovanov, the president of the Kiev School of Economics. \u201cThe price is too high.\u201dMr. Poroshenko agreed to the terms as Russian Army units and Russian-backed rebels were closing in on a Ukrainian force of about 5,000 soldiers cut off from resupply in Debaltseve, a town in eastern Ukraine.In the talks mediated by Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany and President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande of France, the soldiers\u2019 lives were weighed against the cost of longer-term political concessions, some of which required passage in Parliament.The government has said 179 soldiers died in the battle, 81 went missing and 110 were captured, and Ms. Syroyid says Ukraine is on the moral high ground today in stalling on the political demands.Ms. Syroyid advocates abandoning the Minsk deal and declaring rebel zones occupied territory, for Russia to finance and feed, without a chance for integration until the Russian Army leaves.\u201cThis is not a victory; it is just common sense,\u201d she said.It was not easy, she said, finding a voice as a woman in Europe\u2019s gravest military crisis in a decade. The ambassadors of the United States, Germany and France all pleaded for her to carry out the accord, lest war begin again.\u201cMen by definition are treated as the appropriate specialists, but a woman has to prove herself as a super-specialist, just to be treated as a normal specialist,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I knew all that before I came to Parliament.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "New Doubts About \u2018Too Big to Fail\u2019 Banks Rattle Foundation of Regulations", "Date": "2016-03-02", "News": "Supported byGovernments around the world have built over the last few years a vast new system of rules that would allow banking giants to fail and shield taxpayers from bailouts.Though this new regulatory architecture is eye-numbingly complex, its builders contend that it has made the financial system much safer without having to resort to measures like forcing a breakup of the largest banks.But that reassuring view has taken a beating of late.Recent turmoil in European debt markets pointed to a possible weakness in a crucial part of the new regulatory system.Shares of large banks have been under pressure, trading at valuations that indicate investors have little faith in the companies\u2019 sprawling business models.Some mergers-and-acquisitions bankers on Wall Street are privately beginning to conclude that some of the largest banks may break up in the coming years.Then, last month, a new Federal Reserve official surprised many by declaring in his first speech on the job that the \u201ctoo big to fail problem\u201d had not been solved.The assertion was surprising because the official, Neel Kashkari, was at the Treasury Department in 2008 during the big bailouts. But having had time to survey the overhaul ushered in by the Dodd-Frank Act, he says that he believes more has to be done. \u201cWe need to act while we still remember how painful the crisis was,\u201d Mr. Kashkari said in an interview.Those behind the financial overhaul might be forgiven for being taken aback by the skepticism. They have achieved many important goals, and there are signs that the new regulations are causing the banks to shrink and, over time, they may even break themselves up to satisfy their shareholders.The gradualism of the current overhaul has a steely edge that the banks and their lobbyists have, for the most part, not been able to resist, supporters of the new rules also point out.Still, the largest banks remain huge.For instance, four United States banks have more than $1 trillion of assets, and two have more than $2 trillion. And now, if the fresh doubts about the overhaul grow, and market turbulence continues to weigh on the banks, politicians and regulators may press for much more direct policies to reduce the size and complexity of the largest financial firms.Officials at regional Fed banks do not write new banking regulations; that is the job of staff members of the Federal Reserve in Washington. Yet Mr. Kashkari\u2019s intervention makes it more likely that the debate over the banks will continue through the presidential election, in which Wall Street may become a prominent issue.\u201cThe regulators should take very seriously the fact that the public is still overwhelmingly skeptical of whether these reforms have fundamentally changed anything,\u201d said Sheila C. Bair, a former prominent banking regulator who is now president of Washington College.Proponents of the current overhaul contend that much has been done.Compared with 2008, the big banks have much higher levels of capital, which in practice means they use less debt to finance their loans and trades \u2014 a change that should make them more resilient to shocks and losses.Banks are also safer because they use far less of a type of borrowing that can evaporate in a crisis, causing a run. At Bank of America, for instance, this short-term borrowing was at the end of last year equivalent to just over 18 percent of the bank\u2019s assets, compared with nearly 36 percent at the end of 2008.And the higher capital requirements \u2014 which rise in line with a bank\u2019s size \u2014 appear to be pressing big banks to shrink. JPMorgan Chase, the nation\u2019s largest bank by assets, trimmed $220 billion of assets last year, done, in part, in response to stiffer capital regulations.When given the leeway under Dodd-Frank, regulators have mostly gone for a stricter approach. The Volcker Rule, which aims to stop a bank\u2019s traders from making risky wagers for its own profit , ended up being quite stringent, for example.And the Fed may not be done.It may, for instance, decide to use its annual regulatory stress tests to make capital rules more onerous.And big banks have to submit plans that would act as a road map for regulators if the banks collapsed. If the Fed and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, another bank regulator, conclude that these plans are not credible, they can require remedial actions that include making the bank unload some of its businesses.In the coming weeks, the Fed and the F.D.I.C. will announce the results of their latest assessments.One of the most potent criticisms of the overhaul, however, is that it is too clever by half.This point is directed in particular at a very important part of the overhaul that is intended to make it possible to wind down a dying bank without using taxpayer backing.Under this part of the overhaul, banks have to issue debt that can be turned into equity capital when a bank fails. The idea is that the debt would act as a source of new capital for the seized bank, removing the need for taxpayer funds.But some banking experts say this part of the overhaul might spread panic, not contain it. Before the collapse, the price of this debt could start to plunge in the markets. Investors might then flee the ailing bank and stop lending to other banks, even those that are in better shape.Mr. Kashkari asserts that, to reduce the risk of such contagion, it may make sense to not rely on the debt component and instead just have banks hold a lot more equity capital at the outset.\u201cWhy not get rid of all this complexity and ambiguity and make it equity?\u201d he asked.Such concerns gained some credibility after recent movements in the prices of special debt securities issued by large European banks. In a crunch, these securities can be transformed into pure equity capital. Those issued by Deutsche Bank fell steeply in price, prompting selling of similar securities issued by other banks.But making the banks finance themselves with more equity could cause their stock prices to fall even more than they have. To those who favor doing more, however, such a decline may underscore that banks still need to shrink in order to improve their profitability.Mr. Kashkari said he recognized that a stricter overhaul could add new costs to the banks, and he added that taxpayers might still need to bear some of the risks embedded in the banking sector. But he argued that voters had not yet been given a clear choice on that question.\u201cI want to be candid with the American people about which piece we have solved, and which piece we have not solved,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd we as a country could decide that we have done enough.\u201dAdvertisement"}

I\u2019m certain that he\u2019s guilty. All of our politicians are corrupt regardless of their party. That is our largest problem in Brazil.\u201d\u201cLula\u2019s dealings with construction tycoons and ranchers have nothing in common with his militant origins as a leftist,\u201d said Marcelo Rubens Paiva, a columnist for the newspaper O Estado de S. Paulo. \u201cHe was hanging out with figures that comrades on the left should be combating,\u201d he added. \u201cSo, let Lula explain the origins of his assets.\u201dMr. da Silva has repeatedly insisted that he is innocent of any wrongdoing, assailing the investigations as efforts to smear him and his Workers\u2019 Party.\u201cIf there\u2019s one thing I\u2019m proud of in this country, it\u2019s that there is not a living soul more honest than me,\u201d Mr. da Silva said recently. \u201cNot in the Federal Police, or in the Public Ministry, or in evangelical churches.\u201dHis foundation criticized the move by the lead prosecutor in the state case, C\u00e1ssio Conserino, saying in a statement that Mr. da Silva was being unfairly targeted.\u201cThis measure against the ex-president is yet another sad attempt\u201d by the prosecutor \u201cto use his post for political ends,\u201d the institute said.The focus on Mr. da Silva\u2019s business affairs offers a view into how the former president sided with the same elites whom he rallied against as a union leader campaigning as an anticorruption outsider.In the federal case against him, prosecutors say that five of the builders tainted in the Petrobras scandal paid Mr. da Silva the equivalent of about $2.7 million for speeches since 2010, when he left office. In addition, they say Mr. da Silva\u2019s foundation received about $5.5 million in donations from the same companies, some of which was channeled to one of Mr. da Silva\u2019s sons.Federal prosecutors are trying to determine whether the money used to pay Mr. da Silva was obtained in the Petrobras scheme, and whether he illegally lobbied on behalf of the companies in a quid pro quo.In the state case, investigators claim that a construction company paid for about $200,000 in renovations at a beachfront apartment. Mr. da Silva denies owning the property, but prosecutors say he had control of it and tried to mislead investigators about acquiring it.The scandal grew more serious for Mr. da Silva this week when prosecutors in S\u00e3o Paulo State charged Mr. da Silva with money laundering and misrepresentation of assets in connection with the penthouse apartment in the coastal city of Guaruj\u00e1, crimes that could involve jail sentences.Mr. da Silva\u2019s supporters are lashing out, arguing that powerful media groups are conspiring to topple Ms. Rousseff and to prevent him from running for president again in 2018, an ambition Mr. da Silva has embraced.Emir Sader, a sociologist and commentator who is one of Mr. da Silva\u2019s most outspoken supporters, said the evidence against the former president had been fabricated or based on promises to ease penalties on business figures who had reached plea deals with investigators.Supporters are also comparing the amounts that Mr. da Silva was paid with the bribes pocketed in the Petrobras scheme. One former executive at Petrobras has pledged to return $100 million in ill-gotten gains to the authorities as part of a plea deal.Even some of Mr. da Silva\u2019s strident critics questioned the need for the former president to be arrested.Diego Escosteguy, the editor in chief of \u00c9poca, a weekly magazine that has published investigative articles on Mr. da Silva\u2019s business dealings, called the request \u201cextremely fragile.\u201d\u201cOne thing is the quality of the indictment for crimes attributed to the ex-president, another is the quality of the request for his arrest,\u201d he said on Twitter.Mariana Sim\u00f5es contributed reporting from Rio de Janeiro, and Paula Moura from S\u00e3o Paulo.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Argentina Reaches Deal With Hedge Funds Over Debt", "Date": "2016-02-29", "News": "Supported byArgentina has agreed to pay $4.65 billion to four hedge funds in a deal that could put an end to more than a decade of mudslinging and legal attacks that had cut the country off from global financial markets.The agreement, announced on Monday, opens the door for Argentina to attract foreign investment needed to revive its stalling economy.\u201cThis is the equivalent of a giant albatross being lifted from Argentina\u2019s neck,\u201d said Brett Diment, the head of emerging market debt at Aberdeen Asset Management. \u201cThe litigation and lack of access to international capital has had a sclerotic effect on the country for years but it was facing a real financial squeeze this year,\u201d he said.The four hedge funds, which include the billionaire Paul E. Singer\u2019s NML Capital, were the last major hedge fund investors among a group that declared legal war on Argentina in the United States courts 12 years ago.And they went to great lengths to compel Argentina to pay \u2014 at one point persuading authorities in Ghana to seize an Argentine navy ship as collateral, with a crew of about 300 on board. They also moved to impound other government assets, including a satellite.Their ultimate victory illustrates the outsize influence hedge funds can have in the countries where they bet their money. And their legal tactics are likely to be used again by other investors contesting the debt obligations of sovereign powers.The four holdout firms, including Aurelius, a hedge fund run by Mark Brodsky, a former trader at Mr. Singer\u2019s Elliott Management; Davidson Kempner; and Bracebridge Capital, have agreed not to try to prevent Argentina from raising new money, which it will need to do in order to pay the settlements it has made.The deal will also depend on whether Argentina\u2019s legislature will repeal domestic laws that prevent the government from paying holdouts. The parties agreed on a deadline of April 14 to pay the settlement.The settlement will be extremely profitable for the hedge funds. Martin M. Guzman, a postdoctoral research scholar at Columbia Business School, has estimated that NML paid $48 million for some bonds it bought in 2008 and with the deal it will receive approximately $620 million for those bonds \u2014 an annual return of about 38 percent over eight years.For Mr. Singer, who has supported Republican candidates and gay marriage, principle was as important, if not more, than profit, in pursuing a nearly 15-year fight.\u201cBy being a country that scoffs at the rule of law, they sacrifice so much,\u201d Mr. Singer said in a recent interview. NML\u2019s investments in Argentine debt and other sovereign debt represented less than 2 percent of the $26 billion in assets that his hedge fund company, Elliott Management, manages over all, he noted.A spokesman for Elliott said on Monday that the firm was \u201cpleased to have reached an agreement.\u201dPressure had been growing on the holdouts to settle with Argentina after its newly elected president, Mauricio Macri, moved quickly to settle with other bondholders. His government struck a $1.35 billion settlement with a group of Italian investors and offered to pay $6.5 billion to the group of six hedge fund holdouts in February. Two of those firms, Montreux Partners and Dart Management, accepted the proposal.\u201cThis is a giant step forward in this long-running litigation,\u201d Daniel A. Pollack, the court-appointed mediator, said on Monday, adding that Argentina\u2019s decision to settle was \u201cnothing short of heroic\u201dThe $4.65 billion represents 75 percent of the full judgments for the four hedge funds and includes principal, interest and a payment to settle the claims outside of the court, as well as \u201ccertain legal fees and expenses incurred.\u201dAxel Kicillof, the former economy minister, even sought to question the impartiality of the mediator, Mr. Pollack, saying a year ago: \u201cIf he takes off his jacket you can see his feathers,\u201d referring to the vultures.\u201cFor the first time in 15 years, we can say that Argentina has really started to exit default,\u201d Alfonso Prat-Gay, Argentina\u2019s new economy minister, told reporters in Buenos Aires on Monday, adding that the situation had \u201cdrowned\u201d the economy.He attacked the Kirchner administration for refusing to settle the issue, adding that by letting the dispute fester, interest had accumulated and investors had lost confidence.These lost investments and central bank reserves used to service tens of billion of dollars of debt in recent years could have been poured into the economy, creating up to two million jobs, Mr. Prat-Gay said.Argentina would sell up to $15 billion in bonds from April to finance the payment, he added.\u201cArgentina is joining the world in an intelligent way,\u201d Mr. Prat-Gay said.That nation\u2019s legislature could take most of March to debate whether to revoke the law, and a decision should be expected by the end of the month, according to Sergio Berensztein, an Argentine political analyst.Despite the accord, Argentina\u2019s bonds were little changed on Monday, showing that investors had already priced in a deal.The reverberations from the legal battle with Argentina may be felt for years to come.In 2012, the holdout hedge funds achieved a stunning breakthrough when Judge Griesa ruled that whenever Argentina wanted to pay any of its creditors, it would have to also pay the holdouts. The move and its fallout led Argentina to default on its debt again in 2014.That move will have far-reaching implications, many analysts say. With his ruling, the judge has laid the foundations for future investors to contest the debt obligations of other countries.Anna Gelpern, a law professor at Georgetown University, said that the ruling created a new tool for investors.\u201cThe tool is a kind of financial boycott\u201d that would allow creditors to enforce equal payment in other instances, she added.Mr. Guzman went further, saying that the settlement created \u201ca problem of moral hazard in which this settlement incentivizes this type of behavior because it is profitable.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "E.U. Aims to Revise Proposed Migrants Deal With Turkey", "Date": "2016-03-16", "News": "Supported byBRUSSELS \u2014 European Union authorities sought on Wednesday to alter the terms of a provisional agreement brokered by Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany to curb the flow of migrants and refugees streaming into Europe through Turkey. The revised proposals were put forward by Donald Tusk, the president of the European Council, on the eve of a two-day meeting that was supposed to be the deadline for signing a deal with Turkey to ease the bloc\u2019s migration crisis.Under the deal backed by Ms. Merkel, Turkey would get visa-free travel to much of Europe for its citizens by the summer, accelerated prospects for joining the European Union and more financing to support the nearly three million refugees inside Turkey. In return, Turkey would effectively guard Europe\u2019s eastern shores and take back all migrants who enter Greece using clandestine routes. In addition, for each Syrian sent back, the European Union would resettle a Syrian refugee from Turkey.Yet the last European Union meeting 10 days ago ended in disarray because the leaders would not consent to the deal. Mr. Tusk\u2019s revised proposals, which were discussed by representatives of the union\u2019s governments on Wednesday, kept much of the plan put forward by Ms. Merkel intact. But Mr. Tusk, who represents the bloc\u2019s 28 national leaders, backed important modifications in a bid to tamp down a wave of complaints from human rights groups about the risk of forcible returns of Syrians as a result of that arrangement. Mr. Tusk also appeared to side with Cyprus, which had reacted furiously to the prospect that Ms. Merkel\u2019s agreement would immediately resume negotiations on European Union membership for Turkey, which has occupied the northern half of Cyprus since 1974.Turkey was prepared to make \u201ca commitment that migrants returned to Turkey would be protected in accordance with the international standards concerning the treatment of refugees\u201d while Greece would \u201censure that migrants already on the Greek islands would be transferred to reception centers on the Greek mainland,\u201d according to the proposals, which are subject to change before a final agreement with Turkey this week.Mr. Tusk, a former prime minister of Poland, also sought to reassure countries like Bulgaria and Italy that they would not be left exposed to waves of migrants seeking alternatives to Greece to reach other European Union countries.\u201cTurkey will take any necessary measures to prevent new sea or land routes for illegal migration opening from Turkey to the E.U.,\u201d the revised proposals said.But in a letter published Wednesday, Mr. Tusk warned leaders before the summit meeting that there still could be no guarantee of success.\u201cThe catalog of issues to be resolved before we can conclude an agreement is long,\u201d he wrote. With weather conditions improving, journeys to Europe could soon surge and deaths increase on the maritime route to Greece from Turkey across the Aegean Sea. That has raised the pressure on leaders to discourage migrants from taking clandestine routes to Europe.But the terms of the arrangement Ms. Merkel struck with Prime Minister Ahmet Davutoglu of Turkey incensed some European states.President Nicos Anastasiades of Cyprus suggested this week that allowing Turkey to resume union membership talks was tantamount to sacrificing his nation\u2019s interests for the short-term gain of bigger member states like Germany. Mr. Anastasiades threatened to veto the deal.The Hungarian government this week reiterated its opposition to Ms. Merkel\u2019s approach, suggesting that it was na\u00efve to rely on Turkey to guard European borders, partly because migratory routes can shift \u2014 and have. Hungary is also vehemently opposed to plans to offer refugees from camps in Syria resettlement in Europe.Even so, Mr. Tusk\u2019s revised proposals maintained the pledge to resettle one Syrian from a camp in Turkey in exchange for each Syrian who used an irregular route, like crossing the Aegean Sea, to reach Greece. The deal also would still give up about $6.6 billion in aid to help organizations look after the nearly three million migrants already in Turkey.Alison Smale contributed reporting from Berlin.Advertisement"}

And while they are sticking with the traditional general election battlegrounds for now, they are leaving open the possibility of expanding to other states. Saying that Republicans have been preparing for a billion-dollar campaign to \u00e2\u0080\u009cdistort Hillary Clinton\u00e2\u0080\u0099s record,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Cecil added, \u00e2\u0080\u009cHillary\u00e2\u0080\u0099s campaign is not taking anything for granted, including the primary, which is why it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s even more important that we prepare for the long road ahead to November.\u00e2\u0080\u009d He added: \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe have learned a valuable lesson from Republicans during the primary. We cannot take Donald Trump or any other Republican nominee for granted. It will take an unprecedented campaign and independent effort to communicate, register, mobilize, and turn out voters. There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s no time to waste.\u00e2\u0080\u009dThe group is preparing for either Mr. Trump or Senator Ted Cruz of Texas. And Priorities USA is also likely to be on the air before the Democratic convention in late July. The group\u00e2\u0080\u0099s strategists are trying to determine what can be gleaned from what was effective, and what wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t, in the Republicans\u00e2\u0080\u0099 efforts to derail Mr. Trump.But the $70 million is strictly for the postconvention ad buy, and that does not cover a radio and digital advertising component. By buying time early, Priorities USA hopes to target its advertising to precise shows, and, to potentially lock in better ad rates. \n\t\tFirst Draft provides fast-paced and comprehensive coverage of politics and elections by The New York Times.

{"Headline": "Nonprofit Linked to Mayor de Blasio Is Closing", "Date": "2016-03-17", "News": "Supported byA nonprofit group created by close advisers to Mayor Bill de Blasio to push his political agenda, using unlimited contributions from donors, has stopped raising and spending money and is in the process of shutting down.But Mr. de Blasio, a Democrat, said on Thursday that the scrutiny of the nonprofit had no bearing on its closing. He said that it had succeeded in its efforts, advocating his universal prekindergarten program in 2014 and an affordable-housing plan that was quite likely to pass the City Council next week, and that the time had come to end its work.\u201cThe work is done,\u201d he told reporters over the din of bagpipes at the St. Patrick\u2019s Day Parade. \u201cThat\u2019s the bottom line.\u201dThe group has raised and spent more than $4 million since its creation in 2014, according to voluntary disclosure forms. Donations included at least $1.3 million from unions, including $350,000 that the American Federation of Teachers gave during the mayor\u2019s push to create universal prekindergarten, and more than $1 million from real estate interests, including Two Trees Management and others with interests along the Brooklyn waterfront.Mr. de Blasio has consistently defended the group and its mission since the early months of his administration. Last month, he said that it should be judged differently from the opaque nonprofits supported by the conservative Koch brothers that similarly grew out of the Citizens United decision by the Supreme Court.\u201cThe Koch brothers are not doing what they\u2019re doing to help kids get pre-K,\u201d he said, adding that another key difference is that his groups voluntarily disclosed their activities.An investigation into the Campaign for One New York by the state\u2019s Joint Commission on Public Ethics over whether the nonprofit should have registered as a lobbyist last year remains active, according to several people briefed on the matter. The city\u2019s Campaign Finance Board and Conflicts of Interest Board are both considering the formal complaint by Common Cause, spokesmen for the city agencies said, declining to comment further.A spokesman for the Campaign for One New York, Dan Levitan, said that most of the money raised by the nonprofit had been spent, with the most recent spending going to United for Affordable NYC, and that the remaining funds would go toward the cost of shutting its operations down.Mr. Levitan declined to make available a list of contributors and spending since January, when the group last made a voluntary disclosure, saying it would stick to the six-month disclosure schedule it had established for itself.Mr. de Blasio is not the only politician to use such nonprofits, known as 501c(4)s, after the section of the federal tax code that governs their activities, in order to press for policy goals. The list includes Govs. Andrew M. Cuomo of New York, a Democrat, and Chris Christie of New Jersey, a Republican, as well as the governor of Michigan and the mayor of Los Angeles.Stephen Spaulding, the senior policy counsel at Common Cause in Washington, heralded Mr. de Blasio\u2019s move, saying it appeared to be a first by an active politician. \u201cI haven\u2019t seen that,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019ll see them wax and wane.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated the name of a nonprofit organization.

{"Headline": "Getting Workers to Save More for Retirement", "Date": "2016-03-25", "News": "Supported bySpecial SectionSaving for retirement should be simple arithmetic \u2014 the longer your money has to grow, the more money you should have when you stop working. But saving today for a distant tomorrow isn\u2019t so simple, and has a great deal to do with how people think about money.Sean Furlong, the director of finance and administration at Gilman School, a private secondary school in Baltimore, said he realized that while teaching a business class.He was teaching students, he said, \u201cbut then I realized I wasn\u2019t teaching my faculty and staff.\u201d\u201cThey didn\u2019t know the things I was teaching to high school students,\u201d he added. \u201cMany of them had missed that.\u201dMr. Furlong said he decided to ask the school for permission to begin a retirement education program. Its goal was to increase participation in its retirement plan and to educate people on thinking about their savings choices and investment options.Nearly five years after Mr. Furlong pushed for that education campaign, the school has an average contribution rate of 22 percent, up from 16 percent. (This includes Gilman\u2019s 8 percent match after participants contribute the first 7 percent of their salary.) At the highest end, people are contributing 35 percent of their salary.Changing how people think about the money they save for retirement is one of the central tenets of a movement that is based on behavioral finance, the approach to economics that aims to understand how average people, not rational economists, make financial decisions.After all, it\u2019s the way people behave around money that tends to derail their plans, not a lack of knowledge about what they need to do if they want to retire comfortably.\u201cThe biggest challenge is not saving enough,\u201d said Liz Davidson, founder and chief executive of the consultancy Financial Finesse and author of \u201cWhat Your Financial Advisor Isn\u2019t Telling You.\u201d \u201cHistorically, there\u2019s been a lot of focus on returns. The return is on what you save, and most people aren\u2019t saving enough.\u201dMs. Davidson, whose consultancy works with companies on their financial plans for employees, said that when it came to retirement, her company tried to get employees to think about how much they could set aside each day, and to forget about a larger monthly or annual number.\u201cMost people can save a few dollars a day or even $10 a day,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s doable. But if you say, \u2018Can you save $300 a month or a couple of thousand dollars a year?\u2019 people will say, \u2018Whoa.\u2019 \u201dAvoiding that \u201cwhoa,\u201d which is the hesitancy that can derail planning, is what consultants like Ms. Davidson are trying to do. Just as saving a bit more today is going to pay off in the future, not saving enough, failing to participate in a retirement plan or taking money out of a plan too early can significantly reduce the amount of money available decades later.Many of these efforts come back to seminal work by Shlomo Benartzi and Richard H. Thaler, behavioral economists who have researched how to get people to be better retirement savers.One of their conclusions is people need to be nudged by employers to stay on track, often in ways that keep them from missing the money they are saving. These strategies include automatically enrolling people in retirement plans, asking whether they would like to increase their contributions when they receive a raise and limiting the investment choices so they would need to opt out of a broadly diversified portfolio, which is likely to produce the best returns over time.As simple as the nudges seem, they have been proved to work.The National Football League\u2019s Players Association, which represents current and former players, moved to automatically enroll its players in 2007. Since then the participation rate has gone to 90 percent, from 82 percent.\u201cYou don\u2019t miss what you don\u2019t have,\u201d said Dana Hammonds, senior director of player affairs and development.At Gilman School, Mr. Furlong pushed to limit the number of investment options, cutting the funds its plan offered by 75 percent, while increasing the education about the ones that were available.\u201cIt used to be faculty and staff could be invested 100 percent in commodities funds and no one would care,\u201d Mr. Furlong said. \u201cNow the majority are in target date funds.\u201d(Target date funds are set up so that the allocation of a person\u2019s investment changes as the person gets older.)Increasing the amount people contribute has also been a challenge. The default rate used to be 3 percent, which wasn\u2019t enough, said Aimee R. DeCamillo, head of retirement plan services at T. Rowe Price, which provides plans for two million people at 3,500 companies. She said a savings rate closer to 15 percent, including the employer match, was better.One way it gets people closer to that number is to use behavioral finance tricks with its online portal. This comes into play with increasing the contribution rate. \u201cIf you\u2019re at 10 percent, we\u2019ll show you 13, 15, and 17 percent, knowing you\u2019ll go for that middle number,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s driving behavior in the right direction.\u201dAnother feature is what T. Rowe Price calls its \u201cconfidence number,\u201d which aims to predict the likelihood that you will be able to replicate your salary in retirement.\u201cIt drives you to an experience where you change assumptions,\u201d Ms. DeCamillo said. \u201cYou can change your retirement age. You can adjust your salary; you can pull in additional outside assets. It helps you build confidence that you have this control over the outcome.\u201dAetna, which has worked with Financial Finesse to develop its workplace program, began a yearlong initiative this month called Retirement Ready. Its goal is to help employees think about what they are saving but also about what that money might be used for in retirement.\u201cIt\u2019s about financial readiness but also the emotional and physical readiness for retirement,\u201d said Kay Mooney, vice president for benefits at Aetna. \u201cIt\u2019s critical for front-line employees who service our customers. We know the business is challenged if our employees are stressed financially.\u201dMs. Mooney said the company would measure the program\u2019s effectiveness based on how employees changed behaviors, like increasing contributions to their 401(k) plans or reducing their credit card debt.But success might also start by getting people to rethink what their retirement savings are for. \u201cFinancial independence is a phrase we found resonated very well,\u201d Ms. Davidson said. \u201cIt\u2019s living life on your own terms. Flexibility is very important.\u201dPaul Sullivan is the Wealth Matters columnist and author of \u201cThe Thin Green Line: The Money Secrets of the Super Wealthy,\u201d which was just published in paperback.Advertisement"}

It is about a 15-minute walk from crescent-shaped Seven Mile Beach and adjacent to the Cayman Islands Yacht Club, said Malin Ratcliffe, the owner-broker of West Indies Brokers Real Estate, which has the listing. The two-story white concrete home, about 9,000 square feet on a 0.58-acre lot, has a Caribbean-style limestone finish halfway up the lower level and a red tile roof. There are five bedrooms and five and a half baths, and furnishings are included in the asking price.A grand staircase with a limestone facade leads up from the front lawn and turns at a landing toward a covered porch and a 12-foot-high arched mahogany front door.With the main living areas on the second floor, the house enjoys canal and North Sound views, year-round breezes and \u201cvery advantageous additional protection\u201d during hurricane season, Ms. Ratcliffe said.A small foyer opens onto a grand hall with a coffered ceiling. This room and the dining room to its left have white Egyptian stone floors inlaid with hardwood. The rest of the house also has Egyptian stone floors. Beyond the dining room is the kitchen, a breakfast nook with a love seat and a 48-inch round mahogany table, a family room and two bedrooms with en-suite baths. A white wood bar is to one side of the grand hall.The kitchen has twin center islands topped with Carrara marble, two Viking refrigerators with freezer drawers, a Viking gas range, a pot filler, an electric oven, a warming drawer, a microwave, a dishwasher and a ceramic double sink.Open to the kitchen, the family room has a coffered ceiling, turquoise walls and accordion glass doors leading to a covered porch overlooking an inground pool, a large gazebo that serves as an outdoor living room and cocktail lounge, the canal and North Sound.\u201cYou can really take the inside out and the outside in when you open those doors,\u201d Ms. Ratcliffe said.A study, a guest bath and the master suite are to the right of the grand hall. The master bedroom has a four-poster bed and a coffered ceiling. A door leads to the porch.The master bath is tiled with Carrara marble and has a whirlpool tub and a separate walk-in shower.

The open layout downstairs incorporates a media room, a playroom, a billiards room and a game room opening to a covered patio with a heated whirlpool tub.Two downstairs bedrooms share a bath. All the bedrooms have ceiling fans; the house has five air-conditioning zones.Mature redwood, almond, mango and royal palm trees dot the lawn.Behind the gazebo, a slip on the canal accommodates a 20-foot boat.A dedicated slip for a 65-foot boat is at the Vista del Mar marina next door. There is also a tennis court in the development, which has about 27 homes. Restaurants, beach bars, shopping, resorts, hotels and spas are within walking distance on the nearby Seven Mile Beach corridor. Golf courses are also nearby. Owen Roberts International Airport is a 20-minute drive.MARKET OVERVIEW With about 58,000 residents, Grand Cayman, at 76 square miles, is the biggest of the three Cayman Islands, which are a British Overseas Territory in the western Caribbean.The island\u2019s economy lags two to three years behind that of the United States, said Sheena Conolly, the broker-owner of Cayman Island Sotheby\u2019s. Accordingly, 2011 and 2012 were \u201ctough years for the Cayman Islands.\u201dThe turnaround began in 2013. During the last nine months, the market has been \u201cextremely buoyant,\u201d Ms. Ratcliffe said. \u201cWe are seeing a definite uptick.\u201d With inventory falling, the buyer\u2019s market of the last few years is giving way to a seller\u2019s market.Rentals and tourism are also up. \u201cThe volume of transactions has gone up 90 percent in the last 12 months,\u201d Ms. Conolly said. \u201cPrice points are shifting up.\u201dThe biggest increase was on Seven Mile Beach, where prices for condominiums range from $500,000 to \u201cmany millions,\u201d Ms. Conolly said. In other beachfront areas, prices start at $350,000. Prices for canalfront, beachfront or oceanfront single-family homes begin at around $2 million, she said.Along Seven Mile Beach, condominiums in buildings ranging from three to 10 stories are often bought for investment and rented out. Canalfront single-family homes are typically primary residences for executives from nearby George Town\u2019s financial center, or vacation homes for buyers with a penchant for deep-sea fishing or sailing.WHO BUYS ON GRAND CAYMAN\u201cPeople from 130 countries live and work here,\u201d Ms. Conolly said. \u201cIt\u2019s very diverse and dynamic.\u201dAt least 75 percent of buyers come from the United States and Canada, Ms. Ratcliffe said, in addition to a smaller number from Europe and South America. Snowbirds living near cities in the United States with direct flights are prevalent among home buyers.BUYING BASICSForeigners are welcome to buy real estate in the Cayman Islands, as long as they \u201cprovide satisfactory due-diligence paperwork to comply with our money laundering legislation,\u201d said Ian Jamieson, a lawyer based on Grand Cayman. Potential buyers need to supply proof of identity along with references from a bank or similar financial institution plus references from a professional like a lawyer or an accountant.Financing of up to 90 percent of the purchase price is available to qualified buyers.\u201cThere is no title insurance here in Cayman, so it is advisable to have an attorney represent a buyer in a transaction from the outset, not just at closing,\u201d Mr. Jamieson said. Lawyers review and investigate the title, handle the closing and register the transaction and buyer information with the government\u2019s Lands and Survey Department.WEBSITES LANGUAGE AND CURRENCYEnglish; Cayman Islands dollar (1 dollar = $1.22)TAXES AND FEESQuarterly dues for the Vista del Mar homeowners association are $950.There are no property taxes in the Cayman Islands.There is a stamp duty of 7.5 percent of the property\u2019s value on real estate purchases, and an additional 1 percent to 1.5 percent on the amount being financed. Legal fees range from 0.5 percent to 1 percent of the purchase price, Mr. Jamieson said.Real estate commission, paid by the seller, varies from 5 percent to 7 percent, depending on the sales price. The commission on sales of more than $1 million is 5 percent; on sales from about half a million to a million dollars, the commission is 6 percent.CONTACTAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "AMC Deal for Carmike Would Create Biggest U.S. Theater Chain", "Date": "2016-03-03", "News": "Supported byIn a significant consolidation of movie theater holdings, AMC Entertainment will acquire Carmike Cinemas for about $737 million in cash, forming the country\u2019s largest chain with more than 600 theaters, the companies said on Thursday.The deal is the biggest by AMC since it returned to the public markets in a 2013 stock sale. And it represents a bold effort by AMC\u2019s controlling investor, Wang Jianlin of China\u2019s Dalian Wanda Group, to consolidate the American cinema industry.Dalian Wanda agreed in January to buy Legendary Entertainment, a film production and finance company, for about $3.5 billion. It bought AMC in 2012 for about $2.6 billion, and is building a large commercial and residential complex in Beverly Hills, Calif., adjacent to the Beverly Hilton hotel, where the Golden Globes and other Hollywood events take place.AMC, based in Leawood, Kan., is the country\u2019s second-biggest movie theater chain with 5,426 screens, behind the Regal Entertainment Group. It is particularly strong in large markets, including New York, Los Angeles and Chicago.With the announced acquisition of Carmike Cinemas, AMC Entertainment is poised to control one out of every five theaters in the country.Carmike, based in Columbus, Ga., has most of its 2,954 screens in midsize cities. The combined companies will be based in Leawood, they said.By comparison, Regal operated 7,361 screens and 572 theaters as of year end.AMC said the deal would increase the geographic spread of its theaters, while allowing it to trim expenses by consolidating administrative operations for the two companies. The company estimated the merger would yield about $35 million in annual cost savings.The deal is expected to close by the end of the year, pending approval from regulators and by Carmike shareholders.\u201cThis is a compelling transaction that brings together two great companies with complementary strengths to create substantial value for our guests and shareholders,\u201d Adam Aron, AMC\u2019s chief executive, said in a statement.Together with Regal, AMC owns Open Road Films, a movie distributor whose \u201cSpotlight\u201d was named best picture at the Academy Awards on Sunday.Debt financing for the deal will be provided by Citigroup, which also provided financial advice to AMC, while the law firm Husch Blackwell provided legal counsel.

{"Headline": "When It\u2019s Time to Buy Out Partners, but Money Is Tight", "Date": "2016-03-11", "News": "Supported byWealth MattersBRAD SACKS brought in two family friends who were older and wiser when he started his sauce company, More Than Gourmet, in 1993. They didn\u2019t invest any money, Mr. Sacks said, but for their help, he gave the men half of the company.Two decades later, the company, in Akron, Ohio, was booming, with lines of demi-glace and cooking stocks that were being used at the Capital Grille and the Hilton Hotel chain and sold at supermarkets like Wegmans. But Mr. Sacks said the two original partners were reaping the benefits of his work even though they were no longer advising the business.\u201cThe company had huge growth, but they weren\u2019t interested in me buying the company back,\u201d Mr. Sacks said. He called the negotiations \u201cugly.\u201dWhen the two sides finally agreed on a price, Mr. Sacks had to find a way to pay them without crippling the company, which has annual revenue of $25 million.His situation is typical of people who become wealthy through starting private companies but whose wealth is tied up in those companies. While the value of the company may continue to grow, the founders can only borrow so much against it before they are stymied.They can generally cover their expenses. But getting money to buy out existing partners or to invest in other businesses is another story. It gets more challenging if they don\u2019t want to give up control of the company.Mr. Sacks knew one thing: He didn\u2019t want to sell his business to buy out his partners. Soon after he started More Than Gourmet, the owner of the sauce-making plant he used sold to a larger competitor. The sauce maker thought he had freed up some of the money from the business and shed the burden of running the company. Six months later, the buyer ousted him.The best strategy for buying out partners is, not surprisingly, to have an arrangement set up in advance, advisers say.Rick Marcatos, senior vice president at UBS Wealth Management, said that there should be legal documents that discuss just how any buyout would occur. \u201cTo not hamper the company, you can do some payment structure \u2014 \u2018I\u2019ve been given 12, 18 months to pay you back,\u2019 \u201d he said.But, of course, that requires planning at a time when entrepreneurs are scrambling to bring their idea to life. When a buyout isn\u2019t so clearly delineated, the options are more complex.Banks will lend, but they are constrained as to how much. Part of the money Mr. Sacks needed was arranged as a loan from Key Bank, which is the company\u2019s bank. But the bank couldn\u2019t lend all that he needed without putting the company\u2019s debt ratio above the limits set by the Dodd-Frank financial reform law.Mezzanine financing is another option. This type of financing looks like debt but the mezzanine lender has the right to convert it to equity. That conversion happens when the company is doing better than expected, since it increases the return for the lender.\u201cIf the company is projected to be at $2 million to $3 million in a couple of years and it\u2019s at $5 million to $6 million, the mezzanine lender is going to convert to equity and there\u2019s nothing you can do about it,\u201d Mr. Marcatos said. \u201cThey dictate the terms because you need the money.\u201dMr. Sacks kept searching for other options. He could have ended up paying as much as 30 percent on the money from the mezzanine lender if the company performed as he expected it to.The other problem with using mezzanine debt to buy someone out is deciding on the value of the firm, said Ryan Budlong, managing director at Harris Williams & Company. He said he often advised clients to get two appraisals and then split the difference.Short of turning to a private equity firm, there are family offices and other private lenders willing to acquire companies and give the founders the opportunity to sell some portion of their company yet remain involved.William J. Kidd, the founding partner of Kidd & Company, a family office in Greenwich, Conn., said he looks to buy companies with net income of $3 million to $20 million a year that have more potential.\u201cThe businesses we\u2019re interested in have been taken by the founder from the floor to the table,\u201d he said. \u201cThey haven\u2019t been taken to the ceiling for a number of reasons. It takes a different skill set to take a company from the table to the ceiling.\u201dKidd & Company generally pays the founder 70 percent of the price in cash and then structures the remaining 30 percent as a five-year note, which could pay the founder above that amount if the company does well.\u201cThe key when you do this is to make sure the person we\u2019re dealing with has a role in the business that is meaningful to them and fun,\u201d he said.In the end, Mr. Sacks found a niche firm, New York Private Finance, part of Emigrant Bank, that was willing to structure something creative: It would make a personal loan to Mr. Sacks using his ownership in the company as collateral. When he then put that money into the company to buy out his partners, it would appear on the balance sheet as an infusion of equity.\u201cThe only real negative was the fact that it was a personal loan so you couldn\u2019t get away from it if everything fell apart,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I was all in.\u201dLeigh Hoagland, chief executive and chief credit officer at New York Private Finance, said the firm sought out entrepreneurs and lent to them personally, not to an operating company. While the borrowers will be responsible for the loan, they will not have to contend with the lender taking a board seat or exerting control over the company.Mr. Hoagland would not disclose the interest on the loan but said that there was a cap on how much the lender would be paid back, even if the company did better than expected. And the overall cost is less than mezzanine financing. \u201cFor people for whom this product works, it\u2019s an extremely important part of their wealth creation,\u201d Mr. Hoagland said.The loans are generally $4 million to $20 million for periods of three to seven years. Mr. Hoagland said the firm preferred to lend to people who had multiple businesses to act as security.That was the case with Joe Cambi, a private investor in Springfield, Mass., who built up a food service company there and sold it to Sysco in 2001 for $100 million.After the deal was done, he found he couldn\u2019t retire. \u201cI like the building process,\u201d he said.That led him to invest in several businesses, including a minor-league hockey team and a mortgage banking company. In 2008, the mortgage business was struggling and he took on an outside investor, whose money stabilized it.Last year, the investor, a billionaire, wanted to cash out his stake and wasn\u2019t inclined to wait. \u201cBanks aren\u2019t going to lend to someone like me to take out a partner,\u201d Mr. Cambi said. \u201cWe needed to go to a private equity firm, but we didn\u2019t want to give up a lot of equity.\u201dLike Mr. Sacks, Mr. Cambi got a loan from New York Private Finance to bridge the gap, in his case for $5 million of the $25 million the company needed to buy out the investor. Personally guaranteeing the money, he said, was worth it to regain control of the company.\u201cHe had 70 percent and we had 30 percent,\u201d Mr. Cambi said. \u201cNow, we have a lot of debt. It\u2019s heavy to bear, but it was better than having him in the nest.\u201dMr. Sacks shared that feeling. \u201cI was running this business and there was this shadow over my head,\u201d he said. \u201cThe company was limited based on that situation. By changing it, it changed the overall outlook.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Aleksandrov, one of two Russian servicemen detained by the Ukrainian military in the country\u2019s east in May.Ukrainian officials claimed the two were Russian officers on a military mission in Ukraine, but Moscow said they had resigned from active duty. In a video statement published by the Security Service of Ukraine, Mr. Aleksandrov admitted that he was on a reconnaissance mission in Ukraine at the time.The politically charged case has further strained ties between Moscow and Kiev.Two unidentified suspects were detained, and one of them helped investigators find the body. Mr. Matios said one suspect had fake Ukrainian identification documents and credentials. Mr. Grabovsky disappeared on March 5. The captors made him wear a special bracelet, telling him that it would explode if he tried to escape or reach out for help, the military prosecutor said. They also posted messages in Mr. Grabovsky\u2019s Facebook account. One post claimed he had left for Egypt and had to leave Ukraine \u201cagainst his will,\u201d but he never left the country.The suspicion of Russian involvement comes in part from a belief that Moscow is trying to undermine Ukraine\u2019s leadership in Western eyes.

A replacement for Justice Antonin Scalia, a conservative icon who died on Feb. 13, could hold the deciding vote on matters of abortion rights, guns, the environment, campaign finance and a wide range of other issues.The candidates whose names have leaked out share the distinction of appearing to have some degree of palatability to Republicans, whether because of ties to prominent Republican lawmakers, past support from them in confirmation votes or both. But Senate Republicans have vowed not to hold any hearings for Mr. Obama\u2019s eventual nominee.Judge Srinivasan and Judge Kelly were confirmed unanimously by the Senate in 2013. Judge Kelly had the enthusiastic support of a home-state senator, Charles E. Grassley, an Iowa Republican who is now the chairman of the Judiciary Committee. But he has said the next president should fill the court vacancy.Judge Garland also received substantial Republican support for his confirmation in 1997. Judge Jackson is married to the twin brother of Mr. Ryan\u2019s brother-in-law.Mr. Obama\u2019s team sent a handful of names to the F.B.I. last week for background checks that are expected to take 10 to 14 days, law enforcement officials said, speaking on the condition of anonymity because the investigations are confidential.Josh Earnest, the White House press secretary, declined to comment on Friday about any candidate Mr. Obama might be considering for the position. He said the president, who met privately with senior advisers to discuss the nomination process, would spend part of his weekend reading up on candidates and weighing his options.\u201cI know that there have been some sleepless nights on the part of his legal team,\u201d Mr. Earnest said.The president told his top advisers that he wanted the best person for the job, \u201cand I don\u2019t care if this person is a Democrat or a Republican,\u201d Mr. Earnest said, describing Mr. Obama\u2019s view.He said the president would evaluate the candidates based on their legal credentials, their judicial temperament and their life experience.Top White House officials have told allies in recent days that even they are unsure of the president\u2019s preferences or the process he is following. But as he deliberates, they are mounting an intense behind-the-scenes effort to prepare interest groups and activists for a major struggle to push through the nomination.On a conference call Thursday with more than 500 Asian-American leaders and other activists, Tina Tchen, the chief of staff to Michelle Obama, the first lady, said those listening should be ready for a challenging confirmation process, and recognize the need to educate the public about the stakes for the country.Since 1900, the Senate has voted on eight Supreme Court nominees during an election year. Six were confirmed.\u201cThe call was to connect with the obvious excitement in the Asian-American and Pacific Islander community around the possibility of an Asian-American Supreme Court justice, but also to make sure that people understand that whoever the president nominates, it\u2019s going to be a tough road,\u201d said Chris Kang, the director of the National Council of Asian Pacific Americans, who worked as a lawyer in the White House Counsel\u2019s Office under Mr. Obama.Jacqueline Nguyen, a federal appellate judge who is Vietnamese-American, has been mentioned as a plausible candidate for the court opening.Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky and the majority leader, has said he will not even meet with Mr. Obama\u2019s eventual nominee. Republicans on the Senate Judiciary Committee have signed a letter affirming that they will not hold hearings on such a nominee.But Mr. Grassley has insisted that even though he warmly praised Judge Kelly in the past and urged fellow senators to support her confirmation to the federal bench, he would refuse to consider her or any other Supreme Court nominee on the principle that Mr. Obama does not have the right to advance one.The president has said he has an obligation under the Constitution, which says he \u201cshall\u201d nominate Supreme Court justices, to fill the vacancy.

{"Headline": "Cities to Untangle Traffic Snarls, With Help From Alphabet Unit", "Date": "2016-03-17", "News": "Supported byWheelsMOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif. \u2014 In a world where taxi rides are summoned with a button and where people have become reliant on mapping applications to get around town, a paradox has emerged: Technology companies know a lot more about a city\u2019s traffic patterns than the city officials trying to solve the problem.On Thursday, the federal Department of Transportation announced a partnership with Sidewalk Labs, a unit of Alphabet, the same technology conglomerate that owns Google, that aims to funnel transit data to city officials in hopes of making traffic more bearable and figuring out newer, smarter ways of moving people and goods around the country\u2019s urban areas.The announcement is part of an continuing \u201cSmart City\u201d competition in which the Transportation Department is dangling $40 million in grant money in front of cities to prod them into using more technology. As part of the deal, Sidewalk will work with seven finalists to develop a traffic management system that will be one of the company\u2019s core software products.\u201cWe\u2019re taking everything from anonymized smartphone data from billions of miles of trips, sensor data, and bringing that into a platform that will give both the public and private parties and government the capacity to actually understand the data in ways they haven\u2019t before,\u201d said Daniel L. Doctoroff, Sidewalk\u2019s chief executive, who is a former deputy mayor of New York City and former chief executive of Bloomberg.Sidewalk was hatched out of Google last June as an independent company that will use technology to solve urban problems \u2014 yet another example of how the Internet giant has strayed far and wide from its initial mission in online search. The company is based in New York and was conceived by Mr. Doctoroff, along with a team of Google employees led by Larry Page, one of Google\u2019s founders and now Alphabet\u2019s chief executive.In June, Sidewalk announced that it would help finance a company called Intersection that is installing thousands of Wi-Fi kiosks across New York City, but the company has otherwise said little about its aspirations or what kinds of technologies it might develop.Thursday\u2019s announcement gave some insights. As part of the Transportation Department competition, Sidewalk will work with the seven finalists to develop a software platform called Flow to help cities diagnose and fix congestion problems.Flow looks a lot like Google Maps, and the search giant\u2019s mapping data is at the core of the product. But the idea is to help cities dive deeper.The Flow system makes inferences about where people are coming from or going, so planners could tap on a congested road segment and find out what kind of traffic \u2014 morning commuters, for example, or weekend traffic to a baseball game \u2014 was contributing to the problem. They would also be able to run virtual experiments such as how much traffic would be reduced if they added a bus route or car pool lane along the choke point.Sidewalk is still figuring out how it will try to make money from the system, but it is likely to use a subscription-based model in which cities pay for different tiers of data and higher levels of analytic and diagnostic abilities.Mr. Doctoroff said this idea of partnering \u2014 with private companies, but also governments \u2014 will be central to how he builds Sidewalk.\u201cOur mission is basically to leverage technology to solve big urban problems,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd often, in fact I would argue most often, the path by which you do that goes through at least one level of government.\u201dThe Transportation Department introduced its Smart City Challenge in December, and by February, it had 78 proposals for new ways to use data and technology to improve transportation. Most large and medium-size American cities applied. The winner will receive $40 million to carry out its proposal.The first round of applications was due in February. The Transportation Department announced the seven finalists \u2014 Columbus, Ohio; Kansas City, Mo.; Pittsburgh; Denver; Portland, Ore.; San Francisco; and Austin, Tex. \u2014 last weekend at the South by Southwest music, film and technology festival.Those finalists will now work with each other and Sidewalk to fine-tune their proposals, which, in turn, will help Sidewalk figure out what kinds of features or analytics to build into the Flow system. In addition to the $40 million check, the eventual winner, which will be announced in June, will receive various perks like use of the Flow system and 100 Wi-Fi kiosks that will provide free Internet in parts of the city.\u201cEmpowering disadvantaged communities to take advantage of technology and innovation is a key component of the Smart City Challenge,\u201d Transportation Secretary Anthony Foxx said in an emailed statement.Advertisement"}

Trump with a lifetime membership card at a campaign event on Sunday in Cincinnati, Mr. Trump asked the man to toss it to him over a phalanx of guards, not wanting an unfamiliar member of the crowd to get too close.Earlier in the day, at a rally in Illinois, Mr. Trump hoped to invite a Hispanic supporter from the audience to join him onstage and say a few words. But first he asked his security personnel if they would allow it.\u201cHe knows if he makes a move, he\u2019s going to get clobbered by these guys,\u201d Mr. Trump said, offering something of a warning to anyone who would do him harm.As Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign events have grown more vitriolic, the security presence surrounding him has been increasingly on edge. The shift has come months after people around Mr. Trump, particularly his children, urged him to tighten his protection out of concern that he would be attacked.The concern was amplified at an event in Dayton, Ohio, on Saturday, when a man hurdled a security barrier and tried to charge the stage before being tackled. Secret Service agents, who were assigned to him last fall, rushed to form a protective circle around Mr. Trump. The Trump campaign would not comment on security specifics, but local police officers, the Secret Service and his private detail are present at rallies. This security apparatus has gained attention, particularly after this weekend, for both its role in protecting the candidate and in ejecting protesters from his events.The phrase \u201cGet \u2019em out\u201d has replaced \u201cYou\u2019re fired\u201d in Mr. Trump\u2019s vernacular, offering him an air of iron-fisted authority to buttress the image of toughness he projects.But the handling of protesters at Mr. Trump\u2019s events has raised questions about the methods and makeup of his security apparatus and the rights of peaceful critics to speak without being silenced. Despite accusations of suppression by some protesters, legal experts say that campaigns have the discretion to remove people from private events as they see fit, as long as they are not doing so based on race.Mr. Trump\u2019s in-house security is led by Keith Schiller, a retired detective from the New York Police Department, who is omnipresent at his boss\u2019s side. Mr. Schiller, who in September punched a Latino protester in the face outside Trump Tower in New York, is fiercely devoted to Mr. Trump, and was the first person to leap onto the dais in Dayton when the activist came running. Mr. Trump employs several other security guards, some of whom, in recent weeks, have been seen moving in plain clothes into crowds to try to end disruptions. While their boss\u2019s language tends to be caustic, the security guards have seemed to try defusing tense situations instead of inflaming them. According to campaign finance filings, Mr. Trump has spent about $170,000 on \u201csecurity services\u201d throughout his campaign.While Mr. Trump\u2019s contractors handle some scuffles, in recent episodes in places like Fayetteville, N.C., it was local law enforcement that appeared to be involved in removing protesters. Mickey Nelson, a retired assistant director of protective operations with the Secret Service, said that agents coordinate with the police and would be involved with removing someone only as a last resort.According to the Associated Press, Donald J. Trump and Hillary Clinton have each won enough delegates to claim their party\u2019s nomination for president.\u201cSecret Service only gets involved if an individual poses a security threat or interferes with law enforcement activity,\u201d Mr. Nelson said.Seemingly frustrated with the frequent interruptions at his events, Mr. Trump has threatened legal action against protesters, or \u201cdisrupters\u201d as he has called them. On Saturday evening in Kansas City, Mo., Mr. Trump repeatedly said he would start filing charges against protesters in the future to teach them a lesson. As the night wore on, and disruptions became more frequent, Mr. Trump looked down at a woman protesting and called to law enforcement, \u201cArrest her. Arrest her.\u201d While Mr. Trump complains that protesters are violating his First Amendment rights, many of his critics wonder about their own ability to speak out. At a Trump campaign event held at Valdosta State University in Georgia last month, several black students complained to the police that they did not understand why they were kicked out.Lee Rowland, an attorney with the American Civil Liberties Union, said that because campaign events are considered \u201cpolitical theater,\u201d candidates who rent event spaces have the right to disinvite anyone they choose. Those who resist could be charged with trespassing.\u201cThe reason the ejection of protesters sits so ill with people is because protesters are being ejected from rallies where the individual holding the rallies is seeking the highest office in the land,\u201d Ms. Rowland said. \u201cThe first act of that office is swearing an oath to the Constitution, including the First Amendment.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "How Wage Insurance Could Ease Economic Inequality", "Date": "2016-03-11", "News": "Supported byEconomic ViewWage insurance may not be on your radar, but it should be. It helps people who have lost their jobs and cannot find new ones that pay as well. That assistance can reduce economic inequality while providing incentives for unemployed people to go back to work quickly.What\u2019s more, wage insurance has bipartisan support, at least in its current limited form. We ought to expand it, both through government and in the private sector.There is a catch, though. The Bush-Obama insurance is limited to people who have lost their jobs to foreign workers. If a computer is now doing the work you used to do, this insurance won\u2019t help you.The current insurance has other limits, too. It is restricted to American workers over the age of 50 who have been earning wages up to $50,000 a year, were employed full time and had to take a different, lower-paying job. For people in such circumstances, the insurance provides an amount equal to half the difference in pay, for two years, capped at a total of $10,000.But it remains insurance, and in a vibrant capitalist economy, expanding it makes sense on theoretical grounds. Insurance is a type of risk management. Rational people would want to pay for this benefit so that they could take promising but risky employment opportunities. It could help spur innovation in the economy.With a potentially expensive program, financing is critical. Like Social Security, an expanded wage insurance system might best be financed by a payroll tax. To be fair, people with wages just below the $50,000 limit \u2014 who might receive more money from the program than lower-income workers \u2014 should pay higher premiums. True insurance needs to be priced appropriately.There is another objection to wage insurance. It can create a moral hazard \u2014 an incentive to take a lower-paying, and perhaps less demanding, job than the one the person lost. Most people will agree that people who want to work harder and at unpleasant jobs to earn more income should not be discouraged from doing so. There is a safeguard against this in the current plan, which limits benefits to two years. That reduces moral hazard, but at the expense of providing benefits with a longer horizon. There are always trade-offs.The role of government is important in this case because for social insurance, governments have a significant advantage in putting into place big ideas that are difficult to market. That was true for federal Old-Age, Survivors and Disability Insurance in the Social Security system starting in 1935, which was followed by an explosion of additional private pension, life insurance and disability plans. Government is needed again now.But ultimately, there should be two insurance systems, a government one that is limited to assisting lower-income workers and a private one that allows everyone \u2014 including those with higher incomes \u2014 to buy insurance against wage loss.Appropriate pricing for livelihood insurance would also avoid selection bias \u2014 people with exceptionally insecure jobs signing up in disproportionately large numbers \u2014 a problem that government wage insurance can avoid by being offered to everyone.If the private sector offered livelihood insurance, people in riskier careers would be charged higher insurance premiums. At the same time, by reducing wage risk, the insurance would encourage people to be more adventuresome and entrepreneurial. Risk management and insurance costs might then become essential elements of career planning. Employers in risky industries might buy livelihood insurance for their employees as a benefit.If these concepts seem unfamiliar, that is partly because privately issued livelihood insurance is not common today, if it exists at all. But that could change quickly. Expanding government wage insurance now might clear the way for the private sector. At a time of rising economic inequality and job dislocation, wage insurance makes a great deal of sense.Robert J. Shiller is Sterling Professor of Economics at Yale.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "TransCanada to Buy Columbia Pipeline Group in $10.2 Billion Deal", "Date": "2016-03-17", "News": "Supported byTORONTO \u2014 After failing to obtain approval for its Keystone XL oil sands pipeline, TransCanada said on Thursday that it would buy the Columbia Pipeline Group for $10.2 billion.The all-cash deal will make the Canadian company a major force in the distribution of natural gas produced in the northeastern United States through hydraulic fracturing, or fracking.Russ Girling, the chief executive and president of TransCanada, said in a brief conference call that the deal was \u201ca rare, attractive opportunity that will create one of North America\u2019s largest natural gas businesses.\u201dGas recovered in the Northeast through fracking has been taking some markets for Canadian natural gas that TransCanada delivers to North American customers.Columbia\u2019s largest major assets include 11,300 miles of pipelines and 286 billion cubic feet of natural gas storage facilities in the Marcellus and Utica shale gas regions, the center of northeastern fracking. After the acquisition closes, TransCanada will own about 57,000 miles of gas pipelines.Columbia, which is based in Houston, is in the process of several expansions and renewals of its network. In another sign of the growing importance of natural gas from fracking, it is reversing a pipeline that traditionally moved gas from the Gulf Coast to the Midwest. That line will now carry gas from the Northeast southward.A majority of Columbia\u2019s business is regulated, Mr. Girling noted. While that eliminates the possibility of sharp growth during expansionary times, it also means that the pipeline company will not face pressures to cut its fees because of the currently depressed energy market.Mr. Girling said that the combined company would have contracts or revenue guaranteed by regulations of 23 billion Canadian dollars.Under the terms of the deal, Columbia shareholders will receive $25.50 a share \u2014 a premium of 10.9 percent to Columbia\u2019s closing stock price as of Wednesday. TransCanada will also assume $2.8 billion of Columbia\u2019s debt.TransCanada, which has its headquarters in Calgary, Alberta, plans to raise 4.2 billion Canadian dollars in new equity to partly finance the transaction. RBC Dominion Securities and TD Securities will lead that financing.Until last year, TransCanada had been focusing its expansion efforts on the oil transportation side of its business.In addition to the collapse in oil prices, the company was hit by the decision of the Obama administration in November not to grant a permit for Keystone XL, which was intended to bring oil sands production down to refineries on the Gulf Coast in the United States.The project became a lightning rod for American environmentalists who argued that the oil sands in Alberta were a particularly dirty source of energy. President Obama also expressed the opinion, which was rejected by the Canadian oil industry, that the project was also a way to get the oil-bearing oil sands\u2019 bitumen from landlocked Alberta onto tankers destined for export to countries beyond the United States.TransCanada\u2019s backup plan for its oil sands business is an all-Canadian pipeline it calls Energy East. Based partly on converting a natural gas pipeline to Ontario and Quebec to carry oil, it would open up the oil sands to refineries in eastern Canada that now largely rely on imported oil.If built, it would also expand the oil sands\u2019 presence in the United States in two ways. Tankers could complete the oil\u2019s American journey from ports in Eastern Canada. And the pipeline would service a refinery owned by privately held Irving Oil in New Brunswick, which ships a substantial portion of its gasoline production to New England.But like Keystone XL, Energy East has become politically volatile, particularly in Quebec. That province plans to conduct its own review of the plan in additional to the federal approval process.Some politicians and others in Western Canada are already demanding that the federal government approve Energy East if it agrees to a request from the Quebec-based Bombardier for $1 billion in assistance for its troubled program to compete directly against Boeing and Airbus in the market for airliners.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "After Oregon Standoff, Birding Is Back", "Date": "2016-03-21", "News": "Supported byPursuitsIn a lifetime of offbeat travel experiences, searching for mating sage grouse in a snow squall may rank as one of my oddest pursuits.My guidebook suggested that in March \u201clucky early morning visitors\u201d might experience the sage grouse\u2019s unique mating ritual while hiking on the Sagehen Hill Nature Trail in Harney County, Ore. But the wind was howling, a passing flurry was coating my glasses in a film of wet snow, and on a brisk walk I saw nothing but miles of the arid, melancholy High Desert landscape.It was almost 9 a.m. and the sage grouse were apparently either (very sensibly) courting in a more discreet place or enjoying a post-coital smoke somewhere. Birding, I was to learn, is a pastime that requires patience and a sense of humor.During my first two visits to this vast, largely unpopulated county in eastern Oregon, I was there as a reporter, marooned for stretches of time at an F.B.I. roadblock with a pack of media, and a small assortment of occupation sympathizers, two miles outside the entrance to the refuge.Dusty Wilson, the first person I met in the county, took me to the small home where he and his wife, Darre, raised 10 children, when I asked him where I could find a bathroom.\u201cI don\u2019t really trust media, but you seem all right,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can write your story here, and if you need a place to stay, we have a spare bedroom.\u201dBurns is an unpretentiously charming town of about 2,000 roughly halfway between Bend and Boise. Aside from the demise of the timber industry, it hasn\u2019t changed much since 1948, when The Saturday Evening Post called it an \u201cunsung\u201d place of \u201ceffortless fun\u201d whose residents had \u201cthe ability to look fate in the eye and wink.\u201dSeated behind a mountain of brochures in her downtown office, Chelsea Harrison, the executive director of the county\u2019s chamber of commerce, told me that locals had essentially done just that.\u201cBut we don\u2019t want sympathy visits,\u201d she said. \u201cWe want people to come here for the natural beauty, the solitude, the friendly people who live here.\u201dOutside her office, red \u201cunity\u201d bows line Broadway, the town\u2019s main drag. But more than a month after the end of the occupation, the town is still divided. When I called a woman whom I\u2019d interviewed on my previous visits, she declined to meet me at a business near the refuge, arguing that she didn\u2019t want to patronize this establishment because the owners were said to have been sympathetic to the Bundys, the now imprisoned brothers who led the occupation.\u201cWe got blindsided,\u201d she said. \u201cWe thought it was just a ranchers\u2019 meeting. We didn\u2019t know the Bundys were coming. But I swear, we didn\u2019t give them anything for free, and we\u2019re neutral.\u201dI met Jarvis Kennedy, a member of the Burns Paiute tribe\u2019s Tribal Council, at the Bella Java & Bistro in Burns, and he too underscored that the tribe and the wider community had not healed yet. The council had recently been granted access to parts of the refuge, and he spoke bitterly of the defensive trenches the occupiers had dug, and the damage they caused to tribal burial grounds and artifacts.\u201cThe best way I can describe it to white people is, imagine if someone went to Arlington National Cemetery and went to the bathroom on the graves and rode a bulldozer over them,\u201d he said.Mr. Kennedy told me about how in the 1870s the tribe, which now has about 300 members but was once much larger, was decimated after being forced off the land where the refuge now exists.Ms. Capernall led me to a display case featuring vintage feathered women\u2019s hats, and a photo from 1907, depicting plume hunters and a barn wall full of dead swans.\u201cYou see,\u201d she said, pointing to the photograph, \u201cThat\u2019s why we had to protect Malheur.\u201dTim Blount is a serious birder. He adores Malheur so much that he chooses to live and work on the refuge, an hour away from the nearest grocery store. He treasures it enough that he was willing to drive all night across the Cascades, from a speaking engagement in Salem, to spend a day birding with me at the refuge.\u201cYou don\u2019t have to thank me,\u201d he said, when I tried to do just that. \u201cI get to spend the day birding.\u201dAs we drove down lonely country roads on our way to the refuge, Mr. Blount\u2019s enthusiasm was infectious. \u201cLook, sandhill cranes!\u201d \u201cOver there, red-tailed hawk!\u201d he\u2019d exclaim.We parked on the side of a road, just outside Burns, to observe a flock of about 1,000 snow geese gathered on a field, and Mr. Blount told me how the occupation had upended his life and changed his job. He hadn\u2019t been able to stay in his home and had been living at another wildlife refuge near Portland.\u201cBut membership in the Friends of Malheur has gone from about 250 to more than 1,800,\u201d he said, passing me his pair of binoculars. \u201cThat\u2019s the silver lining.\u201dI was a little ashamed of my $29 binoculars, bought from Kmart years ago, and my inability to correctly identify birds. But Mr. Blount put me at ease and coached me on local etiquette, chiding me when I failed to wave at other drivers. \u201cWe wave hi to each other around here, Dave,\u201d he said more than once.The roadblock leading to the refuge was gone, and Mr. Blount explained that the Fish and Wildlife Service had decided to open the refuge, but not the headquarters area where the occupiers were based, without publicity. An officer waved us through the service entrance to the headquarters area, and Mr. Blount gave me a short tour, pointing to the bunkhouse where many of the occupiers slept, the tower where they stood watch (reportedly dislodging some nesting great horned owls), the tractors and bulldozers they commandeered, and the offices they occupied.A \u201cClosed for the Holidays\u201d sign that Mr. Blount had placed on the locked door of the refuge\u2019s visitors\u2019 center was still there. The last bird sighting \u2014 a white-throated sparrow \u2014 recorded on a magnetic board, was on Oct. 27. Some of the refuge\u2019s employees were back at work but most of the bird feeders were empty.I went to use a bathroom and Mr. Blount said, \u201cYou better not, they overflowed the sewer system.\u201d We took a walk and, despite the trenches and other damage, Mr. Blount said that the place was mostly as he remembered it. There were few birds around, but he said, \u201cThe season hasn\u2019t started yet, pretty soon all these trees will be full of birds and there\u2019ll be birders everywhere.\u201dInside the refuge\u2019s small museum, I learned more about the plume-hunting trade, which was the impetus for the creation of Malheur, the 19th of 51 refuges created by President Theodore Roosevelt (there are now 550 National Wildlife Refuges in 50 states, protecting some 94 million acres of land). A display claimed that in the 1880s, an ounce of breeding feathers was worth more than an ounce of gold.\u201cThe roadblocks killed us,\u201d he said, right before an older cowboy came in and ordered a Coors, as if on cue. \u201cAll the customers were scared away.\u201dWe took the long way back to Burns, traversing gravel roads, stopping often to view birds as the sun came out, reminding us that spring, and many more birds, would soon be here. On the Crane-Buchanan Road, known locally as \u201cRaptor Alley,\u201d Mr. Blount spotted a pair of majestic bald eagles. As I watched them in flight through his binoculars, I felt a surge of joy that is hard to describe. Before we parted, I asked Mr. Blount for tips on what I might see on my way back to Bend. \u201cLook up on the power lines right after you pass Hampton, a tiny little ghost town,\u201d he said.Sure enough, I saw a total of four bald eagles, one more magisterial than the next, right where he said they\u2019d be. Each time I spotted one, I pulled over and indulged in leisurely looks as cars zoomed past me, a few honking in disgust. I wanted to jump up and down, flag them, \u201cLook! Bald eagles!\u201d But they were all on cruise control, going 75, not noticing a thing, just as I had been on my previous trips.I may not have understood the point of birding when I was off looking for courting sage grouse, but in that moment I understood why birders are about to return to Malheur with a vengeance. We fly through life on cruise control, going 75, not knowing what we\u2019re missing. Birding forces us to slow down, to be observant, to savor our surroundings. As the last bald eagle I saw soared out of sight, I thought of the last bit of advice that Mr. Blount had given me, \u201cJust pay attention,\u201d he said. \u201cLook around, because you never know what you might see.\u201dThe Malheur Refuge is about a three-hour drive from Redmond Municipal Airport, or about four hours from the Boise Airport.Advertisement"}

Schiller, the former chief financial officer and a current board member of Valeant Pharmaceuticals International, refuses to leave quietly, and a quirk in the laws makes it likely that he will be around a bit longer.Valeant\u2019s board has accused him of \u201cimproper conduct\u201d related to a pending Valeant accounting restatement. Mr. Schiller has stood his ground. He has not only denied the charges but has refused to resign from the Valeant board.It makes for an uncomfortable situation at the struggling drug maker. But Valeant is stuck.As you may recall, Valeant got a head start as part of the first wave of tax inversion deals in 2010, moving its place of incorporation from Delaware to British Columbia, Canada, through a merger with a rival drug maker. At the time, shareholders seemingly cheered this move to lower the company\u2019s taxes. This advantage allowed Valeant to engage in a robust acquisitions strategy that doubled its size.Unfortunately, shareholders did not appreciate that they were buying into a different governance system. In some respects, this is a not a significant issue for Valeant. The Canadian system is broadly more shareholder-friendly than the American one, limiting takeover defenses such as the poison pill, for example.Although the law is more favorable to shareholders, its foreignness will make it a bit more difficult for Valeant\u2019s mostly American shareholders to navigate this morass. And it will mean that the litigation over Valeant\u2019s mess is not likely to focus on whether the board breached its fiduciary duties. There is just not the system for shareholder litigation in Canada that we have here (make your own judgments on that one).Instead, you will get regular stock-drop securities lawsuits. The irony, of course, is that the hedge funds that now have Valeant board seats, ValueAct Capital and Pershing Square Capital Management, will now be some of the biggest possible beneficiaries of this litigation (which, if they win, will be paid in part by the company, highlighting the sometime absurdity of securities litigation).There is the possibility of a court doing this, but Valeant would have to show that Mr. Schiller posed an immediate danger to the company by remaining a director.And so Valeant is stuck, at least until its next annual meeting, which is likely to be in May.Mr. Schiller is acting in his best interests. By staying, he has a bargaining chip with the board. He will want to make sure that Valeant honors the arrangements to defend him in litigation.It all means that Mr. Schiller will be busy.Valeant\u2019s board will try to function as best as it can. It is an odd board \u2013 it now has three hedge fund representatives on it, and the rest are primarily finance types. It is hard not to see them focusing on some financial solution to Valeant\u2019s mess, including a breakup.All eyes are focused on whether Valeant will file its audited financial statements in time to prevent a default on its debt. These types of defaults happen (not often, but often enough). You typically just get the debt holders to waive the default for a fee. This is likely to happen here, but things are so tumultuous for Valeant, anything is possible.One of Valeant\u2019s hedge fund directors is a top corporate lawyer, Stephen Fraidin, formerly a partner at Kirkland & Ellis and now at Pershing Square as vice chairman. Valeant will need him to deal with all its problems, including Mr. Schiller. For most decisions, the board will probably form a special committee that excludes Mr. Schiller. And then when nominations come for the next election in May, he will be excluded.Still, it is going to be a long few months.Advertisement"}

Through his destiny I want to interpret the emotions a man goes through in such situations, to assess the meaning of his striving.\u201dJan Nemec was born on July 12, 1936, in Prague. He played piano and clarinet and for a time thought of becoming a jazz musician until dissuaded by his practical-minded father, who convinced him that film was a more likely bet. He enrolled in the Film and Television School of the Academy of Performing Arts, known as FAMU, where the revered filmmaker Vaclav Krska encouraged him at every turn.\u201cDiamonds of the Night,\u201d which, like his student film, drew on Mr. Lustig\u2019s wartime writings, put Mr. Nemec at the forefront of the new Czech cinema.He was invited to contribute to \u201cPearls of the Deep,\u201d an anthology showcasing up-and-coming directors, with every segment based on a story by the Czech writer Bohumil Hrabal. Mr. Nemec\u2019s film, \u201cThe Poseurs,\u201d told the tragicomic story of two elderly residents at a clinic who spend their days bragging about their glamorous pasts but turn out to be complete nonentities.After being barred from the state film studios, he quickly made a short film, \u201cMother and Son,\u201d while attending a student film festival in Amsterdam, with financing from West German television and a Dutch film company, further straining his relationship with the Communist government.In 1968, he began filming the documentary \u201cOratorio for Prague,\u201d intended as a hymn to the new artistic freedoms under the reformist government of Alexander Dubcek. The film, which ended with scenes of Russian tanks rolling through the streets of Prague, had to be smuggled out of the country.He returned to the Czech Republic in 1989 and for a time taught film at the academy of performing arts, his alma mater. He made the documentary \u201cLate Night Talks With My Mother\u201d (2001).

We\u2019re not worried.\u201dHenken and Scutt, 23, will be among the youngest members of the United States sailing team when it is completed. Scutt was born in Britain before moving with her British parents to the Seattle area when she was 2. She came relatively late to competitive sailing, after playing elite soccer as a youth, and graduated from Stanford with a degree in biomechanical engineering. Henken is a part of a sailing family from Coronado, the small resort city just across the bridge from San Diego that was once one of the hubs of the America\u2019s Cup races.Henken\u2019s family moved there from San Clemente, where her father, Edmond, still has his orthodontics practice, in part to find a better sailboat racing program for Paris; her twin brother, Sterling; and their older brother, Hans.Hans, who sailed on the Stanford team and is dating Scutt, just missed making the Olympic team himself. He and his crewmate, Judge Ryan, are the alternates in the 49er class, the well-established forerunner of the 49erFX.McKee, a former Olympic medalist who has known Henken since childhood, said that she had an innate ability to embrace risk and that he had seen her smiling and laughing in daunting situations during races. \u201cThat is something that is very hard to coach or teach,\u201d he said.But there were no laughs in Marseille, France, in September 2013 when Henken and Scutt, competing in their first world championships in the 49erFX, sailed upwind during a race and came too close to a competitor heading downwind. Scutt, suspended out wide, was struck full force by the other boat\u2019s wing, fracturing her spine.\u201cThe boats didn\u2019t touch \u2014 it was just my body,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd both boats went from full speed to flipped over in a split-second.\u201dScutt never lost consciousness, and amid the intense pain she said she was reassured by being able to feel herself wiggle her toes in the water. \u201cI thought: At least I\u2019m not paralyzed,\u201d she said. Scutt said the major medical concern was internal bleeding from a lacerated kidney.Henken said she had nightmares after the accident.\u201cI\u2019m the one who steers the boat, and I thought I could have done something more to avoid it,\u201d she said. \u201cBut Helena and I talked right after she got out of the hospital, and she assured me it wasn\u2019t my fault and she didn\u2019t hold anything against me.\u201dWhen Scutt returned to Stanford for her senior year, she had limited mobility and needed a golf cart to make it to class. But she was able to resume sailing by winter break and, despite the concerns of her family and plenty of reflection of her own, she said she was eager to resume competing in 2014 even if close encounters with other boats still cause her to flash back on occasion.She and Henken have had to hustle and take chances to make their first Olympic team. They raised more than $100,000 on their own to supplement national program funding, and each put her studies on hold in December 2014. Henken took a leave from the College of Charleston after one semester; Scutt stopped work on her master\u2019s degree in mechanical engineering at Stanford.Both intend to re-enroll in the fall, and with financing secure for next season, they should be able to focus only on academics and sailing.But first is Rio, and the opportunity and risks now symbolized by Guanabara Bay, so scenic from afar and so dirty at closer range.\u201cI\u2019m not going to claim to know about the politics behind it all,\u201d Scutt said. \u201cIt\u2019s obviously a very populous city with a lot of economic challenges. I\u2019m not going to comment on that because I know it\u2019s far more complex than I could wrap my head around right now, but I just hope the sport is able to draw the attention and momentum not just to Rio but all over. Because it\u2019s really a world issue. It\u2019s not unique to Rio.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Dilma Rousseff, President of Brazil, Resists Calls for Her Resignation", "Date": "2016-03-24", "News": "Supported by\u201cWhy do they want me to resign?\u201d Ms. Rousseff, Brazil\u2019s first female president, asked in the interview. \u201cBecause I\u2019m a woman, fragile. I am not fragile. That is not my life.\u201d She said that investigators should leave no stone unturned in examining her actions. Asked whether she would accept a vote to impeach her, Ms. Rousseff, 68, said, \u201cWe will appeal with every legal method available.\u201dThe president appeared to be digging in her heels for what may be a protracted battle, offering heated responses to an array of questions posed by journalists from international news organizations in an interview that lasted more than an hour.Ms. Rousseff, who narrowly won re-election in 2014, also denied that her two presidential campaigns had received any illegal financing. Her campaign strategist, Jo\u00e3o Santana, has been arrested and accused of receiving millions of dollars in illegal payments in offshore accounts.The nomination of Mr. da Silva, 70, the most towering figure in the governing Workers\u2019 Party, set off a national firestorm, because the post would give him broad legal protection as prosecutors seek his arrest in connection to a graft investigation involving giant construction companies.Ms. Rousseff defended her nomination of Mr. da Silva in the interview, saying, \u201cLula is my partner,\u201d and citing the value of his talents for political negotiation at a time when her government is under intense stress. She brushed away complaints that the appointment would shield him from legal scrutiny, saying he would still be answerable in Brazil\u2019s highest court after he joined her cabinet.Sixty-eight percent of Brazilians are in favor of impeaching Ms. Rousseff, according to a new opinion survey by Datafolha, one of Brazil\u2019s leading pollsters. The poll, conducted in 2,794 interviews on March 17 and 18, has a margin of error of plus or minus two percentage points. Yet in Ms. Rousseff\u2019s favor, perhaps, skepticism also abounds over who would assume power if her government falls, reflecting widespread disenchantment with the country\u2019s political establishment.Brazil is in the midst of its deepest political crisis in decades, with its president facing impeachment proceedings and many in Congress facing criminal or corruption charges.Throughout the interview, Ms. Rousseff likened the impeachment efforts to a \u201ccoup.\u201d \u201cWho stands to benefit from this?\u201d she asked. \u201cI can assure you that they\u2019re in the backstage of power. The fallout from rupturing our democratic normalcy could last decades.\u201dCongressional leaders are pressing ahead with impeachment proceedings, based on accusations that the president\u2019s use of funds from state banks to cover budget gaps was improper and may have been illegal. Some economists argue that the moves eroded confidence in the government\u2019s accounting practices and made it more expensive for the state to borrow money.Ms. Rousseff contended in the interview that her predecessors had made similar moves, and that in any case, they were hardly grounds for ejecting her from office.\u201cEvery president did this,\u201d she said, \u201cand if you look closely, that didn\u2019t open the way for impeachment proceedings against them.\u201dThe complex process of impeachment in Brazil starts with committee deliberations in the Chamber of Deputies. If that chamber then votes to impeach Ms. Rousseff, she could appeal to the Supreme Court before a vote to open proceedings is held in the Senate. If the appeal fails and the Senate votes to commence impeachment hearings, Ms. Rousseff would be suspended from office for 180 days while she was tried in a process overseen by the chief justice of the high court, with the Senate acting as jury. Vice President Temer would provisionally take over in the meantime, with the authority to appoint his own cabinet. Votes in the two houses of Congress could come as soon as next month.Ms. Rousseff insisted in the interview that she was unaware of the colossal graft at Petrobras, even though she was chairwoman of the company\u2019s board from 2003 to 2010, when the scheme was flourishing.\u201cWho does the board receive its information from?\u201d Ms. Rousseff asked. \u201cThe senior executives. It\u2019s them who inform you.\u201dJustices on the Supreme Federal Tribunal, Brazil\u2019s highest court, have questioned the nomination on the ground that it could obstruct corruption inquiries overseen by a federal judge, since cabinet ministers are among the 700 or so senior officials in Brazil who enjoy privileged judicial standing.This special status allows these ministers to be tried only by the high court, leading to years of delays and rarely resulting in arrests.Ms. Rousseff said that such privileged standing was necessary for the political system to function. \u201cA member of Congress needs it to say what he thinks,\u201d she said. \u201cA minister has it because he is occupying a post.\u201dDespite the range of the challenges facing her, Ms. Rousseff said she remained sanguine.\u201cI\u2019m not going to say it\u2019s agreeable to be booed,\u201d she said, referring to the large street protests over the past year in which opponents have called for her removal from office. \u201cBut I\u2019m not a depressive person,\u201d she said. \u201cI sleep well at night.\u201dVinod Sreeharsha contributed reporting from Rio de Janeiro.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Clinton\u2019s Bold Vision, Hidden in Plain Sight?", "Date": "2016-03-17", "News": "Supported byOp-Ed ContributorsWith a string of major wins in Tuesday\u2019s primaries, Hillary Clinton finally seems to have a secure hold on the Democratic nomination. Yet her struggle to define herself in the race remains a top challenge of her campaign.Mrs. Clinton has put forth an ambitious and broadly popular policy agenda: family and medical leave, continued financial reform, improvements in the Affordable Care Act, investments in infrastructure and scientific research, measures to tackle global warming and improve air and water quality, and so on.But voters and pundits alike complain that she\u2019s a cold-eyed realist who hasn\u2019t articulated what George H. W. Bush once wistfully referred to as \u201cthe vision thing.\u201d Instead, it\u2019s Bernie Sanders who has been cast as the visionary in the Democratic contest, an idealist brimming with inspiring (if often unrealistic) proposals.But Mrs. Clinton does have an ambitious vision, and it\u2019s one that should be inspiring. The fact that it remains mostly hidden from view reveals more about our current political environment than it does about her \u2014 more about how we understand (or misunderstand) our nation\u2019s past and present than about the comparative merits of her governing philosophy.A few decades ago, Mrs. Clinton would have been seen as a common political type: an evidence-oriented pragmatist committed to using public authority to solve big problems. Her proposals clearly indicate that she believes in an active and responsive government that supplements, channels and polices markets. Moreover, unlike Mr. Sanders, she sees this role as primarily focused on correcting the shortcomings of weakly regulated markets rather than redistributing income and wealth. In a phrase, Mrs. Clinton believes in a \u201cmixed economy\u201d in which government serves as an essential supplement to and regulator of markets, using its strong \u201cthumb\u201d (as the political economist Charles Lindblom once described it) to assist and counterbalance the nimble \u201cfingers\u201d of the market.In the middle decades of the 20th century, this pragmatic problem-solving mentality had a prominent place in both parties. Some issues were deeply divisive: labor rights and national health insurance, for example, and civil rights. Nonetheless, a bipartisan governing coalition that included leaders from both business and labor proved remarkably willing to endorse and improve the mixed economy to promote prosperity.The embrace of an active government, working in creative tension with the private sector, also sowed the seeds for technological and health advances that are still flowering today, including the creation of vaccines and antibiotics to the development of sophisticated medical treatments for hypertension and cancer. Virtually every major computing technology \u2014 magnetic core memory, graphics displays, multiple central processors \u2014 has its roots in government procurement or financing.We are trapped in a vicious cycle: Disillusionment encourages dysfunction, and dysfunction empowers those who spread further disillusionment and dysfunction.Breaking out of this cycle is particularly hard for candidates for public office. Their primary imperative is to win an election, not change the conversation. A candidate who wants to buck the trend must be willing to take on more than just campaign opponents (and Mrs. Clinton will certainly face fierce attacks for proposing to raise taxes and create new programs in the general election). They must also overcome a juggernaut of organized anti-government forces: market-worshiping think tanks, right-wing media, a more staunchly conservative business leadership. In the face of a skeptical electorate, it\u2019s a tough sell \u2014 even for Democrats.Mrs. Clinton is heir to an enormously successful bipartisan governing tradition. Yet this tradition has been disowned by the Republican Party and has lost allure within a significant segment of the Democratic Party; it also runs sharply against the grain of current public sentiments about government and politicians. In this hostile environment, it should come as no surprise that Mrs. Clinton has proved reluctant to lead the charge for a more balanced discussion of government\u2019s role.Yet because Mrs. Clinton has had little success articulating her basic governing approach, the case for her has instead come to seem almost entirely instrumental \u2014 that she has the best chance of being elected or would be better at haggling with Republicans for incremental gains. In the context of widespread amnesia about what has made America prosper, pragmatism has come to be seen as lacking a clear compass rather than (in the original meaning of the word) focusing on what has actually proved to work in the real world.This is a problem, and not just for Mrs. Clinton\u2019s campaign. Our nation badly needs a dialogue that reminds Americans why a capable government is essential and how much we are paying for its erosion. Mrs. Clinton understands this, but she may have neither the opportunity nor the inclination to say it.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "American Airlines Doesn\u2019t Care for Its Gogo Wi-Fi, Either", "Date": "2016-03-14", "News": "Supported byItinerariesPassengers aren\u2019t the only ones frustrated by airplane Wi-Fi\u2019s high cost, slow speed and balky connections.A legal skirmish between American Airlines and the Wi-Fi provider Gogo broke out last month, highlighting the increased friction. American cited a clause in its contract with Gogo that permits it to end the agreement if a competing Wi-Fi provider offers a deal that Gogo cannot match. It said ViaSat, a Gogo rival, made such an offer.American later dropped its legal action after Gogo said it would submit a competing proposal.\u201cWe know in-flight connectivity is something our customers want and need,\u201d said Casey Norton, a spokesman for American Airlines. \u201cThey expect a living-room type of experience.\u201dBut there could be more to the dispute than just the quality of Wi-Fi service. Analysts point out that either switching vendors or renegotiating the terms of its contract could yield financial benefits for American, too.In the end, industry experts say the arms race for Internet connectivity at 35,000 feet is likely to lead to faster connections that cost less.This would be welcome news to travelers frustrated with paying high prices for inconsistent service.\u201cYou have no other choice,\u201d said Theresa Clement, a contractor and host of the blog MyFixItUpLife.com. She travels frequently for work and said she found the price not always reflective of the quality of the service.\u201cIt seems like the prices have gone up,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t find that it\u2019s faster, I don\u2019t find that it\u2019s more consistently working.\u201dA Gogo spokesman, Steve Nolan, said the average cost paid by a Gogo user was $13, but the cost of staying connected for a cross-country flight can be nearly $40.Ms. Clement said she felt obligated to pay for Wi-Fi even though it sometimes cut out or was slowed by an overload of users.\u201cIt is frustrating when you have to keep hitting refresh, especially when you have a client that\u2019s waiting for something from you,\u201d she said.\u201cIt\u2019s that combination of a service that\u2019s not terribly good combined with pricing many people find outrageous,\u201d said Tim Farrar, a satellite and telecommunications analyst at Telecom, Media and Finance Associates. \u201cThat backlash is starting to make airlines like American sit up and say, hold on a minute.\u201dTo alleviate complaints like those of Ms. Clement, airlines are shifting to newer, satellite-based Wi-Fi connections that promise higher speeds and a more consistent signal.\u201cWhat people are looking for is to get the kind of broadband connectivity on the uplink that they have on the ground, and that\u2019s becoming very demanding,\u201d said Hans Weber, president and owner of Tecop International Inc., an aviation consulting firm.For a number of years, passengers, airlines and Internet providers like Gogo were in a sort of standoff. Airlines did not want to invest in the technology if few travelers were going to use Wi-Fi. Travelers were loath to pay a high price for spotty service, but providers needed a critical mass of users before costs could come down.\u201cNot enough people are willing to pay the hefty fees, especially if it doesn\u2019t work,\u201d Mr. Weber said. \u201cThis is the chicken and the egg.\u201dBut that is changing. Much as home computer users moved from dial-up to DSL, and cable lines to fiber, in-flight Wi-Fi is undergoing a similar evolution, with ground-to-air transmission that uses cellular towers being supplanted by newer satellite transmission that promises more capacity and faster speeds.There are different types of connections, each with its advantages and drawbacks. But all would let more passengers on a flight go online and stay online, and most likely for a better price.\u201cAlternative service providers are offering faster, more reliable and less expensive satellite-based Wi-Fi services to airlines like United, Southwest, JetBlue and Virgin America,\u201d American said in its complaint.Charles Leocha, chairman of Travelers United, a consumer advocacy group, argued that it was disingenuous for American to put customers at the center of its legal stance.\u201cIt sounds like a commercial dispute and American is using consumers as a pawn,\u201d he said. He suggested that the airline was having buyer\u2019s remorse over its contract with Gogo and was using customer service as a pretext to get out of it.American\u2019s complaint had referred specifically to Gogo service on about 200 of American\u2019s older 737s.Gogo is putting in place more advanced satellite technology, known as 2Ku, on planes now. Mr. Nolan, the company spokesman, said the new technology would help ease airwaves congestion and address some pricing concerns.\u201cIt\u2019s going to be cheaper no matter what with 2Ku,\u201d he said.In the last month, Gogo also announced deals with the satellite operators SES and Intelsat to buy large amounts of capacity on new satellites scheduled to be launched in the future.\u201cThis deal will dramatically increase bandwidth and drive overall costs per bit down by orders of magnitude,\u201d Gogo\u2019s chief technology officer, Anand Chari, said in a statement about the deal with SES last month.In the view of Mr. Farrar at Telecom, Media and Finance Associates, any contract termination or renegotiation resulting from American\u2019s legal action would ultimately bring lower prices for travelers.Gogo offers its airline customers either retail or wholesale pricing. Under the retail pricing model used by American, Gogo charges passengers directly and pays a 20 percent commission to the airline. If American switched to a wholesale pricing plan either with Gogo or ViaSat, under which the airline would resell service to passengers, it could make more money without charging passengers more, Mr. Farrar said.\u201cThe landscape is changing here,\u201d said John Thomas, head of the global aviation practice for L.E.K. Consulting. \u201cClearly, American doesn\u2019t have that level of pricing flexibility.\u201dIndustry observers frequently point to JetBlue, which has upended the model by making basic Wi-Fi free, with a higher tier available for a fee for those who want to use services that require more bandwidth, like streaming movies.\u201cThe technology is really young and really immature, and hasn\u2019t sorted itself out,\u201d Mr. Weber of Tecop International said. \u201cIt\u2019s still up in the air.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Those opening sounds so filled the house that you felt as though you had been transported into an orchestra pit, cheek by jowl with the players.And so it went with the rest of the weekend\u2019s Wagner: compelling excerpts from \u201cG\u00f6tterd\u00e4mmerung\u201d on Saturday, with the soprano Heidi Melton giving full, rich voice to Br\u00fcnnhilde\u2019s Immolation Scene; and the Prelude and Good Friday Music from \u201cParsifal.\u201d The orchestra was obviously in its element, and here the strings could be as sweet as they were powerful.But the rest of the repertory was well suited to Mr. Gergiev\u2019s Slavic proclivities: the spare but exquisite Prelude to Mussorgsky\u2019s \u201cKhovanshchina\u201d; Mussorgsky\u2019s \u201cPictures at an Exhibition\u201d in Ravel\u2019s familiar orchestration, vividly drawn; and Tchaikovsky\u2019s \u201cManfred\u201d Symphony, which closed the series on Sunday.Given the credentials of both orchestra and conductor, this Tchaikovsky lover was counting on the \u201cManfred\u201d performance to convince him, finally, that the work offers much more than empty bombast, but it didn\u2019t work. The little \u201cPanorama\u201d from Tchaikovsky\u2019s \u201cSleeping Beauty,\u201d played as encore, offered more beauty and almost as much substance in a mere fraction of the time.No orchestra travels better equipped with encores than Vienna, and to the audience\u2019s predictable delight, Mr. Gergiev trotted out three chestnuts by Johann Strauss: the sublime \u201cKaiser Waltzes\u201d and the ridiculous \u201cPleasure Train\u201d Polka on Friday, and the \u201cThunder and Lightning\u201d Polka on Sunday. (The Saturday program being relatively short, you might have expected an encore or two if not for the awkward presence of a dramatic soprano onstage at the end.)Not to be lost in the shuffle of the familiar was \u201cMasaot/Clocks Without Hands\u201d by the Austrian-born Ms. Neuwirth, a Carnegie Hall co-commission in its New York premiere, though there wasn\u2019t much danger of that. \u201cMasaot\u201d (\u201cJourney\u201d) is a big, brash, brilliant showpiece, continuing in the raucous line of Stravinsky\u2019s \u201cThe Rite of Spring\u201d and Var\u00e8se\u2019s \u201cAm\u00e9riques.\u201d\u201cMasaot\u201d grew out of a request from the Vienna Philharmonic to Ms. Neuwirth for a work to commemorate the 100th anniversary of Mahler\u2019s death, in 1911. With Ms. Neuwirth busy on a couple of operas at the time, the commission had to be postponed until 2015, but Mahler remained a factor, undoubtedly contributing to the work\u2019s rampant eclecticism and its juxtapositions of heavenly moments with crude and rustic ones.Another factor was a dream Ms. Neuwirth had of a grandfather she never knew. For what she calls a \u201cshaped stream of memories,\u201d she sets up a shimmering foreground of constantly shifting sonorities that give way at times to banal half-formed tunes evoking Ivesian brass bands or Balkan dance melodies. All of these stand aside completely on two occasions for the bare ticking of metronomes set to different tempos, suggesting times out of joint.It was financed by the million-dollar award accompanying the Birgit Nilsson Prize, which the orchestra received in 2014. It is spending the money on the archives, which are moving to larger quarters.The new revelations offer more on the orchestra\u2019s dealings with Baldur von Schirach, the governor of Vienna from 1940 to 1945, and their renewed contact after Schirach\u2019s two decades of imprisonment at Spandau. Even more fascinating is the discussion of the great composer Richard Strauss\u2019s relationship to the orchestra.That Strauss was president of the Reich Music Chamber in Berlin from 1933 to 1935 is well known. But a decade or so later, he \u201cwas clearly aligned with Vienna instead of Berlin when it came to cultural policy,\u201d the study said.In return for various creature comforts and protections, the old lion \u201caccepted to be instrumentalized in the propaganda efforts of the Vienna variant of N.S.\u201d \u2014 National Socialist \u2014 \u201ccultural policy.\u201dObviously, many more revelations lie ahead.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "For Older Borrowers, Being Thrifty Can Tarnish a Credit Score", "Date": "2016-03-04", "News": "Supported bySpecial SectionJohn M. George, 63, the retired owner of a small oil-field service company, never had much need for credit. With assets now worth $4 million, he paid cash for his cars; bought his successive houses with small loans from relatives, the seller or a local bank; and had just one credit card, which he used for occasional airplane tickets or business needs and always paid off promptly. He paid off his most recent home loan in 2003.Then, two years ago, he saw a car he liked at a one-day-only sale price. He did not have his checkbook, but the dealer had an idea: a four-year loan at 2.9 percent interest. However, it was soon shot down. A check of Mr. George\u2019s credit history revealed he didn\u2019t really have one. \u201cMost of the credit bureaus had never heard of me,\u201d Mr. George said. Therefore, the interest rate would be 7.9 percent.Mr. George\u2019s situation \u2014 seemingly a perfect credit risk \u2014 captures the age factor. Lenders cannot discriminate on the basis of age. But some of the criteria that are legally permitted, like credit history and debt-to-income ratio, can tilt for or against older borrowers like Mr. George, with neither much of a credit history nor a high current income.One factor that usually favors older people is credit score, which is based on \u201cpropensity to repay a debt, regardless of your income or assets,\u201d said Rod Griffin, director of public education at Experian, one of the three large companies that report such scores in the United States. That\u2019s because they have had more years to establish a credit history.But some older people, like Mr. George, did not use credit often enough to get a score. Or, they built a trail of bad credit. Experts disagree on which is worse, a checkered history or no history.The second major credit criterion \u2014 income relative to debt \u2014 is more likely to hurt older borrowers. \u201cWhen people retire, they often have a lower level of income,\u201d said Lori A. Trawinski, director of banking and finance at the AARP Public Policy Institute, the lobbying group\u2019s internal research organization.John Fitzgerald, 72, expected that renewing the $300,000 home equity line of credit on his $400,000 house in Chicago would be routine when its 10-year term expired in September 2014. He drew on it rarely, viewing it mainly as a rainy-day fund. But during that decade, he and his wife, Judith, retired, he as a lawyer and she as an executive assistant. Although their assets more than doubled, to about $1.6 million, thanks largely to late-career earnings, investment returns and reduced expenses, their combined annual income dropped roughly in half, to $48,000.The bank ultimately granted a credit line of only $243,000. \u201cThey said it was based solely on my income,\u201d Mr. Fitzgerald said. \u201cThey ignored my assets and my long relationship with the bank and my credit score.\u201dRecent research by the Employee Benefit Research Institute, AARP and others casts doubt on a common assumption that because older people no longer need, say, a second car to drive to work or college loans for their children, their need for credit diminishes.Some retirees who long ago paid off an original mortgage may take out a new loan to buy a smaller home. During the recession, others piled their everyday expenses onto their credit cards, while others co-signed loans for children.Luckily for older consumers, it is not too late to improve their credit standing. \u201cMaintain a credit card and use it from time to time,\u201d making sure to pay the bills promptly, advised Matthew K. Beatman, a partner at the law firm Zeisler & Zeisler in Bridgeport, Conn., who specializes in bankruptcy. Similarly, many experts urge people to establish a line of credit before they retire, while their income is still relatively high.If there is no credit card record, \u201csometimes lenders look at utility bill history\u201d or another proof of stability, said Ms. Trawinski of AARP.Some people may even need to delay retirement. \u201cFor many consumers, adding a year or two to their work life will add to their credit,\u201d said Stacy Canan, the deputy assistant director of the Federal Consumer Financial Protection Bureau\u2019s Office for Older Americans.Advertisement"}

Trump linked his name to one of the older get-rich-quick ventures in the book: the real estate seminar. Enticed by the promise of their own quick riches in a then-hot real estate market, students gathered in hotel conference rooms for free introductory classes where instructors offered special knowledge and financing \u2014 but only if students signed up for additional, increasingly expensive classes.Broken dreams and lawsuits predictably followed.Variations on this theme have been around for decades, and this one would have been mostly forgotten, except for two things: Mr. Trump decided to run for president, and his real estate seminar was called Trump University. In this, Mr. Trump was getting in on another tried-and-true American hustle, one that continues to be run by for-profit and nonprofit schools alike: appropriating and exploiting the word \u201cuniversity.\u201dElevating colleges into universities is also widespread among traditional public and nonprofit institutions. In the 19th century, states created hundreds of \u201cnormal schools\u201d to train women to become public schoolteachers. Most are still in business today, and still prepare most new teachers. But nearly all have followed the same path of naming inflation: from normal school to teachers college to college to university. If you see a public university with a compass point or city designation in its name \u2014 Northern State University at Anytown \u2014 there\u2019s a good chance it was once a normal school.These institutions are not overtly trying to rip off anyone. But nor do they tend to have the full features we associate with universities: multiple schools and departments with a heavy focus on research, scholarship and training new Ph.Ds. Instead, they are mostly what they used to be called and have always been: colleges, with a few small master\u2019s degree programs added in order to edge over the unofficial university line.All of this creates exploitable confusion among prospective students, who have been taught by schooling and popular culture to trust any place called a university. In my own neighborhood of Arlington, Va., there is a storefront sign advertising \u201cCalifornia University\u201d next to a soon-to-be-renovated mall.Is it a branch campus of the world-renowned University of California? No. It\u2019s part of a tiny, wholly unrelated business and computer school whose other office is in Anaheim. Across the street and up the block, however, there\u2019s a branch of George Washington University, which really is a university. Pity those who can\u2019t tell the difference. In fact, this area is the Cambridge of inflated school names: No fewer than six other institutions of higher learning line this short stretch of Wilson Boulevard: Argosy University, Troy University, Strayer University, the University of Technology and Management, Grantham University and the Art Institute of Washington.While a few institutions like Dartmouth College have resisted the temptation, most have eagerly embraced it. Mr. Trump deserves to be criticized for selling real estate seminars that didn\u2019t deliver promised riches. But in exploiting the word university, he is in good company.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Whole Foods Plans 100 Rooftop Solar Systems", "Date": "2016-03-08", "News": "Supported byThings at Whole Foods are about to get even greener.The grocery chain plans to install as many as 100 rooftop solar systems, mainly through the power provider NRG Energy, on nearly a quarter of its stores and distribution centers, the companies said on Tuesday. SolarCity will also provide systems for the grocer, which could expand the rooftop solar program as the installations proceed.\u201cInstalling solar at Whole Foods locations across the country will increase the percentage of renewable energy that is generated in communities where we work,\u201d Kathy Luftus, global leader in sustainability at the company, said in a prepared statement. NRG plans to install systems in nine states, including California, Colorado, Connecticut, Massachusetts, Nevada and Texas.Solar energy is in keeping with the Whole Foods image but it will also save the company money, because the solar providers can offer electricity at prices below what the stores and centers would normally pay utilities.The grocer has been under pressure to reduce costs as it has faced increasing competition from other chains offering specialty and organic foods at lower prices.For NRG, the move shows that the company, in retreat from an ambitious attempt under its former chief executive, David Crane, to become the Google or Apple of green energy, will pursue the market for renewables on a large scale.The new chief executive, Mauricio Gutierrez, told investors last month that NRG was refocusing on its core business and was in negotiations concerning the fate of the home solar and electric vehicle charging divisions that he expected to complete in the second quarter of this year.\u201cSimplification of our business is an imperative, both for external perception and internal focus,\u201d he said on a conference call. \u201cNot all renewable businesses are viewed the same in terms of fit and value for NRG.\u201dThat means NRG, which has headquarters in Princeton, N.J., and Houston, will continue to invest in large-scale wind and solar, including rooftop systems for commercial and industrial customers like Whole Foods, said Craig Cornelius, senior vice president.The installations, which will range from five to 200 times the size of a typical home array, are attractive, Mr. Cornelius said, because the larger scale allows NRG to replicate a similar design across several sites.\u201cIt really just comes down to streamlined engineering design, economies of scale in equipment purchasing and construction, and the finance-ability of Whole Foods as a quality customer,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}

Garland\u2019s confirmation hosted Mr. Obama on Thursday on a \u201cstrategy call\u201d for thousands of supporters and activists.\u201cWe need to make sure the American people remind senators that they have a job to do,\u201d Mr. Obama told those who phoned in. Speaking to any Republican senators who might be listening, he added: \u201cBe fair. That\u2019s something we all learned in kindergarten.\u201dMs. Cutter, who also worked in the West Wing for Mr. Obama, will oversee the efforts by the new group, to be called the Constitutional Responsibility Project. Anita Dunn, the former White House communications director, is handling the news media, along with Amy Brundage, a veteran Obama aide. Also involved are Julianna Smoot, the chief fund-raiser for Mr. Obama\u2019s campaigns; Paul Tewes, Mr. Obama\u2019s top field operative in 2008; and Katie Beirne Fallon, the president\u2019s last legislative director.Established in recent weeks as a nonprofit organization, the group will solicit donations, develop advertising, coordinate messaging, help manage operatives in the field, respond to attacks on Judge Garland and collect opposition research on Republican opponents.It is essentially a miniature version of Obama for America, the formal name of Mr. Obama\u2019s presidential campaign operations in 2008 and 2012, but with a new mission: to serve as an umbrella organization for the constellation of liberal groups that typically wage fights on behalf of Democratic court nominees.Ms. Cutter and the other Obama alumni have held strategy meetings twice a week with representatives of MoveOn.org, the Center for American Progress, Americans United for Change, People for the American Way, the Lawyers\u2019 Committee for Civil Rights and others.\u201cNo one progressive and Democratic group can compete with the Koch brothers, which is why we believed it was essential to launch a coalition-based campaign,\u201d Ms. Brundage said. \u201cThe Republican Senate obstruction has brought together a large and diverse coalition unlike any other nomination fight in recent memory to fight for a fair process.\u201dStarting Monday, in fact, the Judicial Crisis Network, a conservative group, will begin a $2 million television, radio and digital media campaign in New Hampshire, Ohio, Colorado, North Dakota and West Virginia, according to Carrie Severino, the group\u2019s policy director. The campaign will target three Republicans and three Democrats: to thank certain lawmakers like Senator Charles E. Grassley, Republican of Iowa, for standing his ground to block the nomination; and to put pressure on other lawmakers like Senator Joe Manchin III, Democrat of West Virginia, by pointing to issues like what the group calls Judge Garland\u2019s anti-gun record.Merrick B. Garland is a candidate who had support from Republicans in the past but would still move the court in a progressive direction.Even with this relatively large early media buy, leaders of some of the conservative groups opposing Judge Garland say they suspect the liberal groups could end up with more resources at their disposal, given the dozens of different organizations, from labor unions, to environmental, women\u2019s, civil rights and gay rights groups that have joined the Obama-backed campaign.\u201cThere is no question, in my mind, we are going to be outnumbered,\u201d said Curt Levey, the executive director of FreedomWorks Foundation.But Mr. Levey said conservatives still had the advantage, because to force a vote on the nomination in the Senate would take at least 13 Republican votes if it ever got out of the Judiciary Committee and onto the Senate floor, which is unlikely, no matter how much noise the liberal groups make.On both sides of what is likely to be a prolonged fight, a key challenge is money.For the liberal groups, the presence of the former Obama advisers could be a draw. But many potential donors have financial relationships with the existing groups, and choosing which organization gets the next big check could be difficult. Officials for the new group declined to discuss their fund-raisingMoveON, which is organizing more than 50 rallies around the United States on Monday, mostly at offices of Republican senators, sent out a solicitation Thursday asking for donations of anywhere from $3 to $1,500 or more.\u201cNow, for the first time in decades, liberal justices could take charge of the Supreme Court \u2014 and not just for the next year or two, but possibly for a generation,\u201d the solicitation by MoveOn.org sent out Thursday said. People for the American Way had its own solicitation effort underway.On the conservative side, fund-raising efforts are also going on, although leaders of the groups declined to discuss how much they hoped to collect to finance their campaign.For both sides, avoiding conflicts among diverse groups may end up being tricky given how long the nomination could be stalled.That is in part, the former Obama advisers said Thursday, why they have created their new group. But an open question for leaders of some existing groups is whether money raised by the Constitutional Responsibility Project may hamper their fund-raising. Those groups have in the past used Supreme Court fights as a way to motivate their supporters and fill their coffers, and even if the project funnels some of the money it raises to the groups, there will still be a competition for resources.There could also be differences in approach when it comes to messaging and advertising. Some groups may want to produce attack ads aimed at Republican senators who refuse to consider Judge Garland\u2019s nomination. Others may favor softer approaches focused on the judge\u2019s personal background. How the former Obama officials navigate those differences could determine how much grumbling there is among the groups.Stephen Spaulding, legal director of Common Cause, one of dozens of liberal groups working on the Supreme Court effort, said the Obama group could help coordinate the effort. But even more important, he said, would be enlisting key Republican voices like Alberto R. Gonzales, the former Bush administration attorney general, and Kenneth W. Starr, a former appeals court judge who investigated President Bill Clinton, who have already called for the Senate to act.\u201cThese kinds of statements are almost more important,\u201d Mr. Spaulding said. \u201cWhat we need are voices that senators who are wavering will listen to.\u201dAdvertisement"}

The score was 4-4 with runners on second and third.

He went on to graduate from a much bigger college football school, Florida, but did not play for that N.C.A.A. Division I powerhouse. Rubio has shown off his football skills on the floor of the statehouse in Florida, catching passes from Dan Marino and Tim Tebow.Trump also recently feuded with the Ricketts family, who own the Chicago Cubs and have financed a political action committee that is trying to defeat him.But years before, the young Trump \u2014 nicknamed D.

She wondered: Why doesn\u2019t anyone sell something different?Then a Fulbright scholar doing research for her Ph.D. in sociology and business administration, she knew that novel ideas had the most potential for growth. Her curiosity that day over the lack of innovation at those food stalls later led her to extensively explore the relationship between poverty and entrepreneurship.The problem, Professor Doering explains, is that it takes time for consumers to become familiar with new products and services even if these services are only marginally different. And the Panamanian entrepreneurs had wanted to start a business quickly, during a financial crisis. Unlike someone with substantial savings or outside financing, they didn\u2019t have the luxury of waiting for the consumer tide to turn. They also didn\u2019t have time to test and tweak their ideas before introducing them to the market. That was probably one reason the snacks had been so similar at the rest stop, Professor Doering realized.Her conclusions, she says, have implications both in the developing world and in developed countries like the United States. In fact, in some ways, Panama offers an ideal situation for entrepreneurs because financial and regulatory barriers to starting a business are relatively low.Professor Doering would like to see government agencies or foundations set up business incubators for poor entrepreneurs, who would receive cash grants for living expenses while building their businesses with the help of teachers and mentors.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Don\u2019t Let Albany Ethics Reform Slip Away", "Date": "2016-03-30", "News": "Supported byEditorialThe more things change in Albany, the more they stay insane. Corruption remains the great, crippling defect of New York State government, tainting all that it does and fails to do.Two of the three most powerful leaders in New York State government were convicted of multiple felonies last year and are facing sentencing next month. The third, Gov. Andrew Cuomo, is mostly talking about the minimum wage and paid family leave, which are important policies worth pursuing. But fixing the voters\u2019 shattered trust should be the first and overriding goal of New York\u2019s tarnished government, and the time to make wholesale repairs is now, when the budget is being negotiated and Mr. Cuomo has maximum leverage over a Legislature wedded to the squalid status quo.But the moment is being lost. Mr. Cuomo; the Assembly speaker, Carl Heastie; and the Senate majority leader, John Flanagan, have been wrapping up closed-door negotiations in the rush to meet an April 1 budget deadline, but comprehensive ethics reform has not been part of those discussions. The leaders are promising to deal with it later. If they deal with it at all.After Sheldon Silver and Dean Skelos were toppled by the United States Attorney Preet Bharara, Mr. Cuomo included an ambitious package of ethics and campaign finance reforms in this year\u2019s executive budget. But he hasn\u2019t pushed very hard for it, and neither the Senate nor the Assembly has taken up his proposals. The Republicans who control the Senate show no sign of accepting some crucial components of reform \u2014 they oppose any limits on lawmakers\u2019 outside income, for example. The Assembly plan has its own weaknesses, like not forcing convicted public officials to forfeit their pensions. In Albany, this is how the stage gets set for each legislative house to praise itself and to blame the other for the failure, yet again, of meaningful reform, and for Mr. Cuomo to blame them both.\u201cIt\u2019s clear to me that they don\u2019t intend to pass a robust ethics package in the budget,\u201d Mr. Cuomo said this month, lowering expectations that he himself had raised.The list of what\u2019s needed is long and well known, including closing the loophole that allows secretive corporations to evade limits on campaign spending, strictly limiting outside incomes, publicly financing all candidates for state offices and otherwise curbing the influence of lobbyists and crooks. These parts all belong in a grand package, a blow for transparency and accountability to match New York\u2019s \u201cWatergate moment,\u201d as Blair Horner of the New York Public Interest Research Group put it.Mr. Cuomo could have, if he wanted to, been pushing the Legislature, rallying the voters, channeling their anger, cleaning the stables. But instead he has settled for self-congratulation. In a news conference this month, he asked New Yorkers to look at how far Albany has come: \u201cWe are already at the point where we have done more than ever before in terms of ethical reforms.\u201dThat may be true, to a point, but the changes are still not enough given the magnitude of the problem. Mr. Cuomo should be using his considerable leverage and political skills to take the problem as seriously as voters do.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Investors Increasingly Bullish on Energy Sector", "Date": "2016-03-14", "News": "Supported byIt was one of the darkest periods of the oil market slump. The global economy was showing fresh signs of slowing, and crude prices were collapsing so steeply that virtually every well in America was unprofitable.But when Diamondback Energy went out to raise $226 million worth of new stock that week in the middle of January, the oil and gas company found more buyers than it could accommodate. It had to nearly double the amount of shares it sold, to four million.Since Diamondback issued equity that day, the company\u2019s share price has increased more than 29 percent.Across the oil industry, investors have been placing their bets that prices have hit bottom. Risk-seeking investors like hedge funds and private equity firms, which were already lending money to struggling energy companies at high interest rates and onerous terms, are among those to have smelled opportunity in a potential comeback.Yet some of the biggest and most successful bets on oil are being wagered by mutual funds and index funds that are scooping up plain-vanilla equity offerings like Diamondback\u2019s deal in January.There is still a way to go before a full recovery. Many analysts caution that the recent recovery in prices could easily reverse itself. They argue that the tentative agreement between Saudi Arabia, Russia and a few other producing countries to freeze output at January levels will probably make little difference to global supplies.On Monday, fresh worries about supplies emerged as analysts expressed more skepticism about whether Iran would abide by a freeze. The United States oil benchmark fell 3.4 percent, to $37.18 a barrel on Monday.Prices, however, are still more than 40 percent higher than their lows in mid-February. And that has made investors more optimistic about energy.Oil and gas companies have issued about $11 billion in equity just in the two first two months of this year, according to the data provider Dealogic, putting the sector on pace to eclipse the $24 billion that was raised last year.Among the companies that have been able to secure capital from the equity markets are many midsize exploration and production companies that have been leaders in the shale revolution, like Marathon Oil, Devon Energy, Pioneer Natural Resources, Concho Resources, Parsley Energy, RSP Permian and Diamondback.The stock offerings are helping the companies maintain their oil fields, meet payrolls and keep up with debt payments at a time when production and revenue are falling.While that adds flexibility for many of the strongest companies, more than 100 mostly small oil and gas companies have been forced into bankruptcy in recent months, as banks call in credit lines and broadly curb lending to the industry.\u201cThe market sees the haves and the have-nots,\u201d said Robert Santangelo, co-head of Credit Suisse\u2019s equity capital markets in the Americas. \u201cAnd has done a good job allocating capital to survivors.\u201dSince the start of 2015, Credit Suisse has netted $126 million in revenue from underwriting equity deals in the oil and gas sectors, including the Diamondback offering, more than any other investment bank, according to Dealogic.Many of the equity issuers are active in the Permian Basin of West Texas and New Mexico, the source of more than 20 percent of the nation\u2019s production, which helps explain why the field\u2019s output has been more resilient than virtually any other field in the country. Production in early February exceeded two million barrels a day, up from 1.4 million barrels a day two years ago.Pioneer Natural Resources, for instance, announced in January a $1.4 billion stock offering intended to help fund its 2016 capital program, heavily weighted in the Permian Basin.Soon afterward, the company decided to reduce drilling when oil prices suddenly dropped by $10 a barrel. The cash from the added equity offering, however, gives the company one of the strongest balance sheets in the industry to increase production when prices stabilize and go up.\u201cIf prices recover mid-2016, if they recover late 2016, if they recover early 2017, we have tremendous firepower to start up faster than anybody else,\u201d Scott D. Sheffield, Pioneer\u2019s chief executive, said in a recent conference call.Over the last two and a half years, the oil industry experienced its deepest downturn since at least the 1990s.Even the strongest companies are not immune to pressure, however. Diamondback, for instance, had to discount its stock 3.5 percent from the market price when it issued new shares in January.Rebounding oil prices have at least temporarily quelled speculation by analysts that many more companies will go bankrupt or look to merge with larger competitors. There are tentative signs that the oil market is beginning to regain its balance between new supply and demand, but there is still a large glut of oil worldwide.United States oil production is dropping fast, by more than a half million barrels a day since last spring, and that decline should quicken: The oil rig count has fallen by roughly 75 percent from the peak in 2014. This is the first time since the 2009 recession that the rig count has fallen below 400 rigs.Now, with weather warming and refineries beginning their spring maintenance for summer blends, surpluses in gasoline inventories are beginning to ease.Crude production is also falling in Nigeria and Iraq as a result of insurgent attacks on pipelines. A wild card is Iran, which has been slow to meet its promise of exporting an additional 500,000 barrels of crude a day now that nuclear sanctions have been lifted. Nevertheless, tankers full of Iranian oil have left port in recent days destined for Spain, France, Romania and Tanzania.The ability of American companies to go to the equity market for capital is helping them finance production. And once the price of oil rises above $45 a barrel, there could be a revival of at least some of the dropped production. Many companies are waiting until oil and gas prices recover to put wells already drilled on line or fix wells that have been sidelined.\u201cThe equity raise isn\u2019t available for everybody out there,\u201d said Vance Scott, oil and gas leader for the Americas at Ernst & Young transaction advisory services. \u201cIf we see a firming of oil prices, in the $40 to $45 range,\u201d he added, \u201cthere are companies out there with good enough acreage position and cost structure that they can get the returns that they want.\u201dProduction costs have declined almost as steeply as crude prices because service companies have been forced to lower their rates and drillers have developed more efficient well designs. Rystad Energy, a Norwegian-based consulting firm that studies oil fields around the world, has estimated that the break-even price for production in the main shale fields of North America declined by more than 40 percent between 2013 and 2015.Although the future for oil prices remains uncertain, experts say the recent rise \u2013 if sustained \u2014 could mean more equity offerings, but only for strong companies.Mr. Santangelo, the Credit Suisse banker, says that while oil prices may still be volatile over the next few months, the shale industry is proving resilient.\u201cComing into this you heard shale would be the first to go,\u201d he said. \u201cThat is not happening. What\u2019s emerging is a healthy shale industry that is very competitive in the global market.\u201dAn article on Tuesday about growing optimism among investors that the energy market is poised for a rebound misstated the amount by which Iran has promised to increase its oil exports. The plan is for an additional 500,000 barrels a day, not 500 million.Advertisement"}

This is crucial as he expands his empire beyond e-commerce into areas such as finance. The process isn\u2019t smooth however: Jack has already encountered powerful vested interests such as opposition from state-owned banks alarmed by the rapid growth of his money market fund or plans for an online bank.Alibaba became famous for Taobao, the platform where small merchants or individuals sell a wide range of third-party products \u2014 including fake products, especially in the early days. Merchants who pass off fake products as real can expect to see their store ratings and business suffer. Alibaba can also shut down the Alipay accounts of repeat offenders, and use big data to analyze trading patterns.But Alibaba\u2019s success hangs increasingly on another platform, Tmall, where brand owners sell their own \u2014 real \u2014 products, or via large retailers, directly to consumers. Taobao was vital to Alibaba\u2019s past success. Tmall is the key to its future, as Alibaba generates a commission on every sale. By contrast, on Taobao, Alibaba relies purely on advertising revenue.But China will likely remain beyond Facebook\u2019s grasp. China has hardly stood still without Facebook: Tencent\u2019s WeChat is a dominant player in China already, superior in some important ways to Facebook especially in mobile. No doubt Jack and Zuckerberg have explored how they might work together, not least because Tencent is a formidable competitor to Alibaba in social and mobile.videovideoAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Groups Scrutinize White House Plan to Cut Drug Costs in Medicare", "Date": "2016-03-09", "News": "Supported by\u201cI deal every day with people fighting for their lives, and I am more sympathetic to them, their desire to live and to get the right treatment,\u201d said Ellen V. Sigal, the founder and chairwoman of Friends of Cancer Research, a public education and advocacy group, even as she noted her concern about rising drug costs.The announcement is only a proposal for a test, but it has huge implications for the pharmaceutical industry, especially for the big, fast-growing category of specialty drugs known as biologics. The proposal could, for the first time, link Medicare payments to the effectiveness of a drug and the cost of comparable medications \u2014 factors not normally considered in the current reimbursement formula, which is based on the average sales price of drugs, with an additional 6 percent allowance for storage and handling costs.For decades, Congress has legislated Medicare payment rates in minute detail. But the Affordable Care Act authorized the secretary of health and human services to test new \u201cpayment and service delivery models\u201d and adopt them nationwide if they save money without harming the quality of care.Sylvia Mathews Burwell, the health secretary, has shown she is willing to make aggressive use of this power, with the blessing of President Obama.The Republican chairmen of three powerful congressional committees denounced the administration\u2019s plan on Wednesday, describing it, in a joint statement, as \u201canother troubling example of unelected bureaucrats making decisions behind closed doors.\u201d The proposal could limit access to care for some of the sickest Medicare beneficiaries, said the statement, issued by Senator Orrin G. Hatch of Utah, the chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, and Representatives Fred Upton of Michigan, the chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, and Kevin Brady of Texas, the chairman of the Ways and Means Committee. The Obama administration said its proposal would not interfere in any way with the \u201cmedical judgment\u201d of doctors or their \u201cability to order reasonable and necessary Part B drugs as appropriate.\u201d It did say, \u201cWe intend to achieve savings,\u201d though officials could not say how much. The administration said it expected to change the \u201cprescribing behavior\u201d of doctors by giving them financial incentives to choose less expensive drugs that are at least as effective as more costly medications.Stacy J. Sanders, the federal policy director at the Medicare Rights Center, a consumer advocacy group, welcomed the proposal, saying it would reduce the incentive for doctors to prescribe drugs that are expensive and ultimately unaffordable for low- and middle-income people who have no supplemental insurance.Other advocates were cautious in their initial reactions.Leslie B. Fried, a health lawyer at the National Council on Aging, a service and advocacy group, said: \u201cIf this is a way to take account of the value of treatments and control Part B costs, that\u2019s a good thing. But we also have to be concerned about access to care for beneficiaries. It\u2019s a balance.\u201dIn a notice to be published in the Federal Register on Friday, the administration says it wants to require \u201cmandatory participation\u201d for doctors and hospitals that provide Part B drugs to Medicare beneficiaries in geographic areas selected for the test, a large part of the country. In three-fourths of the nation\u2019s 7,000 \u201cprimary care service areas,\u201d Medicare would pay for Part B drugs using reimbursement formulas different from the ones in the Medicare law.Congress has provided broad bipartisan support for Mr. Obama\u2019s plan to collect genetic data on one million volunteers so scientists can develop drugs and treatments tailored to the characteristics of individual patients. Some of the most enthusiastic supporters of this \u201cprecision medicine initiative\u201d expressed concern about the new Medicare drug payment model.\u201cWe are moving into an era of personalized medicine,\u201d said Leslie Ritter, a vice president of the Society for Women\u2019s Health Research, a nonprofit advocacy group. \u201cThe primary focus should be on the patient, not on costs. In many cases, we don\u2019t know what works best for patients because women and members of minority groups were not adequately represented in clinical trials.\u201dTwo influential lobbies, the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America and the Biotechnology Innovation Organization, strenuously opposed the administration\u2019s plan, saying it could put Medicare patients at risk. Prices for new cancer drugs often exceed $100,000 a year, and it is not unusual to see television commercials and magazine advertisements promoting such treatments.Dr. Allen S. Lichter, the chief executive of the American Society of Clinical Oncology, which represents cancer doctors, said the administration had identified a real problem, \u201cthe skyrocketing prices of drugs.\u201d But he added, \u201cDoctors did not create this problem, and it will not be solved by putting pressure on physicians.\u201dAdvertisement"}

As your article noted, on March 15, winner-take-all primaries will occur in Florida and Ohio. Several polls have Mr. Trump winning.If Senator Marco Rubio of Florida and Gov. John Kasich of Ohio lose in their home states, then this event will go down in political history as the day that Donald Trump crossed the Republican Rubicon.HANK McMANUSBrooklynTo the Editor:Anti-Trump Republicans are desperate to narrow the field and unite behind a single candidate to defeat Donald Trump. They are misguided. The only chance they have to defeat Mr. Trump is to ensure that he does not go to the convention with pledged delegates totaling more than the required majority, and thus to force a brokered convention that nominates somebody else despite Mr. Trump\u2019s leading delegate count.The only way to do that at this point will be to give primary voters lots of anti-Trump choices: Ted Cruz, Marco Rubio and John Kasich. Even that strategy, of course, may fail, if Mr. Trump wins consistently in winner-take-all states. But it is their only hope.ALAN HERSHEYPennington, N.J.To the Editor:The Trump voter is not a policy wonk. The Trump voter wants action. The Trump voter hates to hear that there will be \u201cno deal\u201d on a Supreme Court nominee, no deal on the federal budget, no deal on taxes, no deal on trade, no deal on immigration, no deal on economic policy, no deal on health care. The Trump voter wants the best dealmaker to make deals on all these issues.So until the Republicans stop being \u201cthe party of no,\u201d the Trump phenomenon will continue to roll on until he is the leader of the Republican Party. The Republican establishment just doesn\u2019t get it.EDWARD M. KAPLANBoca Raton, Fla.To the Editor:The Internet, the public and political pundits have had a field day trashing Gov.

It was embarrassing. It was hard to watch.But what cannot be ignored is that Mr. Christie\u2019s demeaning posturing is signaling the beginning of a Trump bandwagon. Scary, yes, but inescapable. Mr. Christie isn\u2019t stupid; he knew he would be bashed for saddling up to the Republican front-runner, but he wants a seat in that Trump cabinet.

{"Headline": "VW Financial Services Lowers Profit Outlook in Wake of Scandal", "Date": "2016-03-15", "News": "Supported byThe unit, Volkswagen Financial Services, reported its financial results on Tuesday, saying it had subtracted about 450 million euros, or about $500 million, from 2015 earnings after vehicles leased to customers lost more value than expected, in part because of the scandal. The unit still reported a net profit of \u20ac1.2 billion for last year, a 35 percent increase from the previous year.The emissions scandal has \u201cintensively challenged the entire Volkswagen Group and therefore Volkswagen Financial Services as well,\u201d said Lars Henner Santelmann, chief executive of the banking unit.Volkswagen Financial Services is one of Europe\u2019s largest banks, considered significant enough to be supervised directly by the European Central Bank. It has also been a major source of profit for Volkswagen, as well as a way to promote sales by providing customers with money to buy or lease Volkswagen vehicles.Volkswagen\u2019s financial reporting has effectively been delayed while the company negotiates with the United States government about the fines it must pay after admitting last year that 11 million cars, including about 600,000 in the United States, were equipped with software that generated low emissions only when the cars were being tested.Volkswagen admitted that 11 million of its vehicles were equipped with software that was used to cheat on emissions tests. This is how the technology works and what it now means for vehicle owners.At other times Volkswagen diesels emitted many times the allowed amounts of nitrogen oxide, a pollutant linked to serious lung ailments and premature death.Volkswagen has pushed back publication of its 2015 financial results to the end of April, from March 10, which makes it impossible for the financial services unit to prepare the documents required to sell bonds in the United States and Europe, company executives said. The financial state of the parent company is crucial information for investors, who need to know whether Volkswagen can provide financial backing to the banking unit if needed.Bonds are one of the main ways that Volkswagen Financial Services and many other banks raise money; Volkswagen uses the money to write loans to customers. While the Volkswagen banking unit will probably have to pay higher rates to issue debt this year, the cost is likely to be offset by exceptionally low interest rates in Europe.Volkswagen could benefit from new stimulus measures announced last week by the European Central Bank. As part of an effort to lower borrowing costs for European businesses, the central bank said on Thursday that, for the first time, it would use newly created money to buy debt issued by corporations.Bonds issued by Volkswagen would almost certainly be eligible for the purchase program. The central bank has already bought so-called asset-backed securities issued by Volkswagen under a previous stimulus program, company executives said. Asset-backed securities are car loans or other credit bundled for resale to investors, who acquire the right to payments on the loans.All of the major ratings agencies have downgraded debt issued by Volkswagen Financial Services, in part because of concerns that vehicles leased to customers would be worth less than expected when customers returned them. The company is required to subtract the decline in value from profit.The ratings agencies\u2019 concerns were confirmed on Tuesday when Volkswagen Financial Services said that it subtracted about \u20ac450 million from 2015 profit to cover such declines. That figure includes \u20ac96 million in depreciation of vehicles leased through VW Credit, Volkswagen\u2019s finance unit in the United States, which is a legal entity separate from Volkswagen Financial Services.Mr. Santelmann, the chief executive, said that Volkswagen Financial Services would earn an operating profit of at least \u20ac1.7 billion in 2016, compared with \u20ac1.9 billion in 2015.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Frank Zappa\u2019s House Can Be Yours for $9 Million", "Date": "2016-03-08", "News": "Supported by\u201cWe\u2019re private people, but we want the story to be told,\u201d Ahmet Zappa, one of Frank\u2019s four children and a trustee of the Zappa Family Trust, said in a statement about the film.Mr. Winter spoke this week about the film and the archive. Here are edited excerpts from that conversation.Q. How did this film and the archive project come about?Gail granted us, for the first time, access to the Zappa family vault, which is literally a vault \u2014 it\u2019s a giant, floor-to-ceiling space under their house in the Hollywood Hills that is filled with 40-odd years of unseen and unheard material. It\u2019s stuff that he wrote, family stuff, art, music and film. Some of it had been preserved by the family, but it\u2019s not been thoroughly archived.How bad a shape is the archive in?My guess is that the bulk of it is probably pretty good. It\u2019s also deteriorating, and possibly some of it is gone. Certain types of media are more frail than others \u2014 the reel-to-reel audio stuff, that\u2019s a very flimsy and fragile material. There is a lot of digital stuff, but some of it is in formats that do not exist anymore.It\u2019s the way the whole house is. I was walking around with some of the family members and they were like, \u201cYou know, it\u2019s not just the vault.\u201d They started opening cabinets, and there\u2019s media everywhere \u2014 three-quarter-inch tape, cassettes, DAT masters. It just goes on and on.That led to the Kickstarter. Frankly, it was just terrifying to see that there and think this is all of Frank\u2019s life, and it\u2019s going to be gone.How was it dealing with Gail Zappa? In a statement you are very diplomatic in calling her \u201cnotoriously discerning.\u201dWhere did the idea of selling the Zappa house for $9 million come from?What happens to the $9 million if somebody buys the house? Does it go into the making if the film, or does that money go to the Zappa family?It goes to both. We would give big portion of that to the family for the value of the house, and then do everything we need to do toward making the archive safe and making the movie we want to make. This would allow us to start the movie immediately.What do you want the film to portray?Frank is someone that a large part of the population absolutely adores, and probably a healthy part of the population doesn\u2019t like at all. That\u2019s really compelling to me. There are so many paradoxical aspects to him that represent the paradoxical nature of that period of history. On the macro side, I love what that allows me to do as a documentarian. But on the micro side, I\u2019m just really fascinated by who he was.How will what\u2019s in the vault help you make the movie?Because a lot of it is personal. It\u2019s not just outtakes from records. He would record video around the house. If NBC Radio came over to get one sound bite, he would set up a video camera and record the entire interview. No one has ever seen that stuff. It\u2019s all down in the basement, and there is tons of it.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Review: Vital, in Montclair, Whisks Diners to the Caribbean", "Date": "2016-03-10", "News": "Supported byDining | New JerseyI\u2019m not partial to Caribbean food but after several visits to Vital in Montclair, I fell in love with it. And I\u2019m not alone. Everyone I brought into the bright and festive restaurant on a busy stretch of Bloomfield Avenue was also smitten. The laid-back atmosphere is one reason; the large, colorful room accented with green walls and turquoise cloth napkins radiates that incongruous mix of luxury and insouciance that distinguishes the best Caribbean resorts. It\u2019s funky in the nicest possible way.Food, however, is the most important reason to visit Vital. Prepared by Kwame Williams, the chef who owns the restaurant with his two sisters, it is the most alluring Caribbean food I have eaten off-island.That he cares deeply about health and sustainable agriculture, and still manages to create rich, novel dishes that go far beyond the usual coconut-besotted, excessively salty, fried or jerk-saturated staples, adds to Vital\u2019s appeal.The name is also apt: Espoused by the Rastafari movement, Ital cuisine (the term derives from the English \u201cvital\u201d) celebrates natural foods and avoids those made with additives and preservatives. Ital food is vegetarian, but Vital\u2019s offerings include a mix of vegan, vegetarian and those made with goat, oxtail, chicken, seafood and beef that any paleo could love.The creamy callaloo dip, served as an appetizer, is similar in texture to a spinach and artichoke dip, but Mr. Williams has reconstructed it in a wholly wonderful and new way. Instead of the usual dairy components, like sour cream and cream cheese, he adds coconut milk. He carmelizes onions, muting the harsh flavor of the mineral-rich callaloo (a leafy vegetable). Flecks of scotch bonnet peppers leave a pleasant tingling sensation on the tongue.Finally, instead of frying up huge batches in the morning, Mr. Williams fries to order each serving of the whole wheat chips that accompany the dish. The results are crisp chips without an oily residue, the perfect vehicle for scooping up creamy mouthfuls of the dip.At Vital, hummus is boldly reconfigured. Mr. Williams substitutes the usual chickpeas with black-eyed peas that are similar to the pigeon peas used in Jamaica. Instead of tahini, he adds hemp seeds (for extra protein and to appeal to diners with nut allergies, he said). Concentrated lemon juice gives commercial hummus a metallic flavor. Mr. Williams replaces it with more mellow orange juice. The result is stunning. If only Whole Foods sold it.A chef\u2019s talent often shows in his rethinking of the mundane. Take Mr. Williams\u2019s spinach salad. Strips of fresh mango, ripe even when I ordered the dish in February, enliven the delicate leaves and strips of red pepper. Cilantro in the house-made vinaigrette highlights the juicy sweetness of the fruit. This is a salad that serves its actual purpose: to pique your appetite for the dishes that follow.The best of these include the chef\u2019s one\u2013of-a-kind cod cake, prepared with an abundance of fresh cod and only enough yam filler to bind the cake; a bowl of curried cauliflower ladled over coconut rice and kale saut\u00e9ed in canola oil; and his justly popular coconut shrimp.\u201cI fought the idea for as long as I could,\u201d said Mr. Williams, who did not want to serve a dish that had become a clich\u00e9. \u201cAfter the one-year mark, I caved and made it for parties. Then guests started clamoring for it.\u201dNo wonder they clamored. The fresh shrimp are soaked in coconut milk quickly and lightly fried to order in a coating of plantain flour.

A stronger factor is the food. Short of flying to the Carribean, I can think of no better way to escape winter.Very GoodAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "\u2018The Syrian Jihad,\u2019 by Charles R. Lister", "Date": "2016-03-15", "News": "Supported byWhen you purchase an independently reviewed book through our site, we earn an affiliate commission.When I last visited Syria in July 2011, four months after the protests had begun, around 2,000 Syrians had already died. The Syrians I spoke to during that visit were confident that their country would not collapse into civil war as Iraq had. Today, the death toll in Syria stands at over a quarter of a million, and half the population has been displaced from their homes. In \u201cThe Syrian Jihad,\u201d Charles R. Lister explains how a popular revolution calling for justice and better government metamorphosed into an intractable civil war with a prominent role for jihadists.When Bashar al-Assad became president on the death of his father, Hafez, in 2000, there was initial optimism that the youthful leader would bring about reform. And in the first few years of his rule, attempts were made to liberalize the country both politically and economically. Assad increased the representation of Sunnis, Christians and Druze within his Alawite-dominated regime, and won the loyalty of Damascus\u2019s business elite with a partial opening up of the economy. The beneficiaries, however, turned out largely to be Assad\u2019s cronies, while inequality increased. Rising fuel prices and reduced access to water resulted in lower living standards for the middle class, and drought forced many farmers to migrate from the countryside to the cities, where they struggled to make a living.Meanwhile, Assad maintained a pervasive security apparatus. He continued his father\u2019s strategy of \u201cinfiltrating and exporting internal threats,\u201d perhaps fearful of retaliation for the 1982 massacre of an estimated 10,000-40,000 Sunnis in the Muslim Brotherhood stronghold of Hama. And after 2003, he facilitated the entry of jihadis into Iraq to join the resistance against the American occupation.In March 2011, the detention and torture of children in the southern town of Deraa sparked peaceful protests, but the government responded with brutal repression. This had a reverse effect, with Syrians forming militias to protect themselves, and leading to the rise of the Free Syrian Army, the so-called moderate armed opposition.From the outset, Assad sought to portray the insurgents as Islamist terrorists in order to undermine them in the eyes of the international community. He consciously released Syrian jihadis from his jails so that they would assume prominent roles in the opposition.But as the insurgents succeeded in taking more ground, Assad\u2019s army found itself stretched to the breaking point. Although it was led by an Alawite officer corps, a considerable number of the foot soldiers were Sunni and therefore regarded as unreliable. By 2013, Assad was forced to turn to his closest allies, Iran and Hezbollah, for extra manpower, further sectarianizing the conflict.Lister painstakingly tracks the evolution of the insurgency month by month, from March 2011 to September 2015. With granular detail, he describes the myriad armed groups and how they compete against one another, attract outside support, change alliances and sometimes cooperate or fight among themselves. He argues that the rise of violent jihadi groups was due to the failure of the international community to back the moderates. But he also says that the Islamist groups were more successful at attracting recruits because they were better organized, more committed and better financed. He contrasts them with the Free Syrian Army, whose leadership was based outside the country in southern Turkey, and whose financial support came from different donors with different interests, leading to factions competing against one another.Lister dates the arrival of ISIS to spring 2013. In Iraq, the failure of the international community to uphold the 2010 election results, and the support of both Iran and the United States for a second premiership for the sectarian Shiite Nouri al-Maliki, had devastating consequences for the region. Maliki accused Sunni politicians of terrorism and drove them out of the political process. He stopped paying the salaries of the Sahwa (Sunni awakening) that, fighting alongside American forces during the 2007 surge, had defeated Al Qaeda in Iraq. He arrested Sunnis en masse. This created the environment that enabled ISIS to rise from the ashes of Al Qaeda in Iraq, presenting itself as the defender of the Sunnis \u2014 and then expanding into Syria.As Lister describes it, ISIS was particularly fearful of being stabbed in the back again by Sahwa, and through violent intimidation it attempted to suppress any potential opposition. Yet, at the same time, ISIS sought to hold and govern territory by winning the \u201chearts and minds\u201d of the local population. In Aleppo, for example, it held \u201cfun days\u201d where \u201cboth children and adults were encouraged to take part in interactive games. Children were challenged to speedily eat ice creams and watermelon, and also quizzed on their knowledge of the Quran, with prizes presented to winners. Adult men, meanwhile, took part in games of musical chairs, arm wrestling and tugs of war.\u201dAssad was able to benefit greatly from the opposition\u2019s internal rivalries. The infighting in Syria between ISIS and the Qaeda affiliate Jabhat al-Nusra (or the Nusra Front), for instance, led to their split and to Al Qaeda\u2019s disavowal of ISIS in February 2014. Lister also describes how in 2014 \u201cthe extremists and the moderates were now at each other\u2019s throats and the fight against the regime was temporarily demoted to second rank.\u201dLister\u2019s knowledge of the various groups is impressive. A visiting fellow at the Brookings Doha Center, he has met with the leaders of over a hundred opposition groups. He estimates that there are at least 150,000 insurgents spread across 1,500 groups. And over the course of the civil war, he calculates that at least 30,000 foreign fighters from over 100 countries have come to Syria to fight.\u201cThe Syrian Jihad\u201d is not easy going, mainly because of its level of detail. It is not for the general reader seeking an overall understanding of the Syrian civil war. But it is an indispensable guide to the different jihadi factions. It will also be invaluable to students of comparative civil wars, who will recognize the familiar patterns of how individuals mobilize; how regimes respond; how groups are formed, organized and financed; what motivates people to join them and the war-fighting tactics they use.What lesson should the United States draw from Syria? Surely not that the primary driver of the conflict is \u201cancient hatreds\u201d dating back to the schism in Islam in the seventh century. Lister comments that the rise of ISIS and its expansion has \u201crevealed the real threat that political instability and state collapse represents.\u201d The civil war is taking place in an environment where the legitimacy of regimes is contested, and in the midst of a larger geopolitical struggle between Iran and Saudi Arabia, which make use of religion to mobilize support.As with Iraq, the United States has missed many missed opportunities to help influence better outcomes in Syria. While the Obama administration weighed the cost of intervention, Lister laments that it never honestly examined the potential consequences of failing to back the moderate armed opposition. Nonetheless, the greatest blame must be laid at the feet of Assad himself, who was unwilling or unable to reform, while portraying himself as the only alternative to ISIS amid the chaos he helped engineer. Tragically, it is the Syrian people who continue to pay the price.Emma Sky is the director of Yale World Fellows and the author of \u201cThe Unraveling: High Hopes and Missed Opportunities in Iraq.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "As Economy Slows, Experts Call on China to Drop Growth Target", "Date": "2016-03-04", "News": "Supported byBEIJING \u2014 Every March, China releases a closely watched growth target for the year, a number that looms large for the world\u2019s economists, executives and policy makers. But a growing number of those experts are now calling for China to stop setting that goal, saying the target actually harms the economy and encourages officials to falsify data.On Saturday, at the start of the National People\u2019s Congress, the government announced a target for 2016 that acknowledges a worsening slowdown. It is a range, 6.5 percent to 7 percent economic growth over last year, rather than a number, suggesting that leaders are rethinking their adherence to hard-and-fast goals. Still, even the broader target is unlikely to reduce skepticism of official Chinese figures.The government\u2019s reading on the growth rate last year was 6.9 percent. The new target range means that leaders expect China\u2019s growth could dip this year, which would further depress the global economic outlook.Following tradition, Prime Minister Li Keqiang declared the new target at the legislature\u2019s opening session. The Chinese government also announced its intent to keep the annual growth rate at a minimum of 6.5 percent through 2020, according to a copy of the 13th Five-Year Plan released Saturday.Prime Minister Li Keqiang of China delivered his government's annual work report to the National People\u2019s Congress, the Communist Party-controlled legislature, on March 5. Here is a \u200bsearchable\u200b transcript of his speech.Economists say that is necessary to meet another goal China has set: having both the size of the economy and per capita personal income in 2020 be double that of 2010.The annual growth target \u2014 a product of China\u2019s mix of central planning and quasi capitalism \u2014 gives a general sense of what leaders think of the country\u2019s economic health, but no indication of how the growth is supposed to happen or what policies the leaders are adopting. Economists and investors want to know whether China is really addressing deepening economic problems.Though its service sector is growing, China is grappling with heavy debt and a glut of factories and homes, a legacy of years when the government pumped money into the economy to keep it humming. Global weakness has reduced demand for China\u2019s exports, while money is increasingly leaving the country.It also reinforces a growth-at-any-cost mentality that harms China\u2019s economy because it leads to wasteful investment and piles of debt. In January, the pace of lending reached a record level, with aggregate financing soaring to $525 billion.\u201cPutting too much emphasis on G.D.P. has become a habit,\u201d said Han Meng, a researcher at the Institute of Economics under the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, referring to gross domestic product, the focus of the annual target. \u201cNow we need to break that habit. We need to keep G.D.P., but at the same time not make it into a hard goal.\u201d\u201cThey\u2019re so obsessed with this G.D.P. target \u2014 it\u2019s not an economic narrative, it\u2019s a political narrative,\u201d said Leland Miller, president of China Beige Book, which provides independent economic data for investors.Now the propaganda value of hitting the target every year is wearing thin. Ordinary Chinese and foreign analysts say they doubt the economy is growing as quickly as the official rate indicates, given the facts on the ground: stagnant wages, mass layoffs and empty buildings nationwide, including apartment towers and shopping malls.They also point to missteps by Chinese leaders that highlight economic mismanagement in areas unrelated to the growth target, like the desperate, failed attempts in recent months to prevent a stock market rout.There is \u201cmuch more scrutiny on policy makers for their economic policy-making,\u201d said Mark Williams, chief Asia economist for Capital Economics, based in London. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t that long ago when the world felt the Chinese government could do no wrong when it came to managing their economy. But there\u2019s a lot more skepticism now, both in China and abroad.\u201dSome analysts say Chinese leaders should put more focus on measurements that give a much better sense of the nation\u2019s economic health \u2014 gauging quality of life or the purchasing power of households, for example.China\u2019s economy is faltering, prompting concerns that are now shaking global stock markets.Qi Jingmei, a senior economist with the State Information Center, which does economic research for central government agencies, said G.D.P. growth is \u201cnot the only number.\u201d\u201cWe want the public to care more about how and where the growth comes from,\u201d she said, \u201crather than only care about what the number is.\u201dChristopher Balding, an associate professor at the Peking University HSBC Business School, noted how the official growth number announced after the year ends always hews closely to the target set months earlier. Last year, the announced target was \u201cabout 7 percent,\u201d and the official achieved growth at year\u2019s end was 6.9 percent.As the economy stumbles, individuals and companies are pulling money out of China en masse, leaving the government scrambling to limit the outflows.\u201cIt\u2019s absurd how close they get to basically hitting their target,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve seen that pattern going back years.\u201dWhen gauging Liaoning\u2019s economy, Mr. Li preferred to look at three indicators, he said: electricity consumption, volume of rail cargo and the amount of loans disbursed.In December, Xinhua, China\u2019s official news agency, published a series of stories examining the problems in the lagging economies in the three northeastern provinces, including Liaoning. One article concluded that some local officials were falsifying data to burnish G.D.P. numbers and many other economic indicators.Analysts say the shift this year from one number for the target to a range is a move in the right direction, even if the change reveals uncertainty among policy makers about the strength of China\u2019s economy. Besides the central government, nine provinces are announcing ranges this year, according to official news reports.In 2014, Hu Shuli, founder of the influential Chinese economic magazine Caixin, wrote an essay that asked, \u201cIs the yearly G.D.P. target still important?\u201d She said there appeared to be a gap between the 7.5 percent target set that year and the economic slowdown already underway.\u201cWhen the growth goal originally set can\u2019t be met due to a change of economic climate, the government must meet the target using any favorable condition, or even create stimulus policies if there are no favorable conditions at all,\u201d Ms. Hu wrote.\u201cGrowth at any cost would cause policies to fail, leaving many illnesses such as overcapacity and high government debt, which will delay the economic structural shift.\u201dMia Li contributed research.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Smaller Down Payment, and No Mortgage Insurance Required", "Date": "2016-03-11", "News": "Supported byYour MoneyIt was a year of firsts: In 2015, Kristian and Michele Klein welcomed their first child, a daughter, and bought their first home \u2014 a freshly renovated four-bedroom Cape Cod in Glen Head, N.Y.But instead of making a traditional down payment of 20 percent \u2014 the magic amount often needed to avoid the added cost of mortgage insurance \u2014 they put down just 10 percent, still a significant sum, on their $685,000 house. Yet they managed to circumvent the insurance, saving more than $250 a month.How did they do it? They took out one loan equal to 80 percent of the purchase price, and another loan for 10 percent \u2014 something that has traditionally been called a piggyback loan or a second mortgage.With home prices on the rise in many parts of the country, coming up with 20 percent can seem an insurmountable task for prospective homeowners of all income levels. Last year, about 65 percent of all home buyers \u2014 or 1.9 million borrowers \u2014 put down less than 20 percent, according to an analysis by Inside Mortgage Finance that covered about 80 percent of all mortgages and excluded jumbo loans.Avoiding mortgage insurance won\u2019t always be possible. Nor will it always be the best or most economical decision. But the good news is that prospective home buyers have options, whether through a traditional bank, a credit union or a newer alternative lender.The Kleins said that having the extra cash on hand, rather than tied up in the house, gave them a stronger sense of security, particularly with a new baby.Here are several mortgage options for borrowers with smaller down payments, some with and some without mortgage insurance.\u201cWe would have some more wiggle room as opposed to giving and using all of your savings for the home,\u201d said Mr. Klein, 34, who works for a consulting firm that represents publicly traded companies. \u201cI would rather have the money in my pocket to work with.\u201dThe 20 percent down payment requirement is etched into the charters of both Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, which back or purchase most mortgages in the United States up to $417,000 (or $625,500 in higher-cost areas). Home buyers who want to borrow more than 80 percent need to buy insurance to protect the agencies, or another party must provide it for them.Most commonly, the borrower pays the insurance in the form of a monthly premium, which must be automatically canceled once the mortgage balance reaches 78 percent of the home\u2019s original value (though homeowners can petition to have it dropped once it reaches 80 percent). Mortgages from the Federal Housing Administration, however, continue to charge insurance for the life of the loan.Alternatively, lenders may pay for the insurance, though that generally raises interest rates for the borrowers \u2014 perhaps by 0.375 to 0.5 percentage points, loan officers said, depending on the borrowers\u2019 credit history, their down payment and other factors. The downside is that the rate is higher for the life of the loan, unless the borrower refinances.Other jumbo mortgage lenders, which generally make loans above Fannie\u2019s and Freddie\u2019s limits of $417,000, are also providing loans with slightly smaller down payments.Then there are the thousands of credit unions across the country that have a little more leeway in offering low-down-payment loans without insurance, largely because they keep their loans on their own books.The piggyback or second mortgage \u2014 not to be confused with the versions misused during the housing bubble, which permitted up to 100 percent financing \u2014 can take different forms. The second loan may be a home equity line of credit, which typically carries a variable rate that is based on the prime rate plus an additional margin set by the lender. It generally requires only interest-only payments, but adjusts to a principal and interest payment after 10 years. (Fixed-rate second mortgages, say over a 20-year term, may be also available, but rates are usually higher than the line of credit.)Using the line of credit can be a more economical option, even when factoring in principal payments. But the buyers need to be disciplined about paying down the principal. And there\u2019s the risk of rising interest rates, which is a reason some loan officers suggest using this option as shorter-term financing.\u201cThis is a great option for those borrowers that have high bonus or commission income who eventually want to pay off the second mortgage down the road and end up with just one mortgage,\u201d said Deb Klein, a loan consultant at Caliber Home Loans in Chandler, Ariz. Or they may be waiting for their previous home to sell, which will free up cash to pay down the loan.SoFi factors its costs into one interest rate and uses nontraditional means to vet borrowers, forgoing credit scores and instead looking at something in plain view: extra cash. SoFi requires income documentation for the last two years, and it reviews prospective borrowers\u2019 debt load in relation to their ability to pay the debt under consideration. But SoFi likes to see at least $1,500 left over each month after all debts, including the mortgage, are paid. \u201cWe don\u2019t focus so much on ratios as we do dollars of cushion,\u201d said Mike Tannenbaum, who oversees SoFi\u2019s mortgage business. \u201cWe underwrite mainly on free cash flow.\u201dNicole Armstrong, a corporate employment lawyer, and her husband, who works for a software services firm, recently purchased a three-bedroom white stucco home in the Easton Addition neighborhood of Burlingame, a costly market just outside San Francisco.Although they have two healthy incomes, a good portion of their assets is locked up in privately held companies, so securing a jumbo loan for the home proved challenging. But SoFi \u2014 which Ms. Armstrong said she learned about from a billboard along Highway 101 \u2014 ultimately let the family make a down payment of 15 percent and charged a competitive interest rate of 3.75 percent. \u201cIt allowed us to put a little less down compared to what the market trend was,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd we didn\u2019t need mortgage insurance.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Sotheby\u2019s and Christie\u2019s Adapt to Digital Age", "Date": "2016-03-11", "News": "Supported byArt for TomorrowThe top art auction houses had a carefree and comfortable time of it for most of the first couple of centuries of their existence, but lately they have been hustling to adjust to a radical transformation of their industry. New digital technology and new customers with new attitudes in new places, along with new competition from deft and nimble upstarts eager to cater to them, have forced the dominant companies, Sotheby\u2019s and Christie\u2019s, to develop new ways to do business.They are responding to the challenge by throwing their money and names around, buying or forming looser affiliations with rivals that understand the shifting realities of the marketplace, including a collector base increasingly inclined to buy art online and on the go, better than they do because the arrivistes helped create those realities. \u201cBusinesses need to evolve, and although the auction process has been around close to forever, the technology changes things; the way the market works changes things, and so does the global nature of the market,\u201d said Suzanne Gyorgy, global head of art advisory and finance at Citi Private Bank, a subsidiary of Citigroup. As with many businesses, the Internet presents the greatest threat to the established order in the art market and the greatest opportunity, too. Online art sales in 2014 reached 3.3 billion euros, or about $3.6 billion, according to the latest edition of the European Fine Art Foundation annual report. That represents about 6 percent of the global market in art and antiques and a 32 percent increase from 2013. Global auction sales totaled \u20ac24.6 billion in 2014, the report said. That was 48 percent of the market, but it marked just a 9.3 percent gain on the year before and was barely over the \u20ac24 billion recorded in 2007, the previous high-water mark. Tefaf and other organizations that monitor the market, such as Hiscox, an insurance company that specializes in art, among other niches, foresee growth of about 25 percent a year in online sales for the rest of the decade. To grab a piece of the action, the auction industry leaders have expanded vigorously online. Christie\u2019s, in 2011, set up an online-only auction platform that held 79 sales in 2015, said Jennifer Ferguson, a company spokeswoman. Last year Christie\u2019s bought Collectrium, a digital art collection management service. \u201cWe have made important hires to support a new marketing and content strategy in both print and digital across all our platforms, as well as strategic digital acquisitions,\u201d Ms. Ferguson said. \u201cNone of this happened in just the last 12 months, but has been happening over the last five years.\u201d Sotheby\u2019s raised its profile online last year when it began streaming its auctions live on eBay, the all-purpose auction website. \u201cWe want to create more channels and more ways for our collectors to be able to engage in and buy things that they love,\u201d said David Goodman, Sotheby\u2019s executive vice president for digital development and marketing.Perhaps more important, arrangements such as this give the company access to customers they might not have had otherwise. \u201cWe\u2019re able to see a different group of people from what we would normally have in the consignment auction process,\u201d Mr. Goodman said. \u201cIt\u2019s a way to expand our distribution and our brand and introduce new people to the world of collecting. We\u2019re excited about the momentum we\u2019re seeing in the online space.\u201d The marketplace is expanding in the real world, too, and auction firms are taking varied steps to cater to new buyers. Sotheby\u2019s recently bought Art Agency Partners, which provides collectors with advice on art, legal and investment matters. The acquisition is expected to help Sotheby\u2019s expand and enhance its private sales, an activity that the industry sees as a more lucrative way to sell art than the traditional auction business. Among the moves that Ms. Ferguson highlighted at Christie\u2019s is the opening of offices in Shanghai and in Mumbai, India, part of an effort that \u201chas helped nurture new growth across both the emerging collector and established collector sectors.\u201d The collectors that have emerged from places like China and India have become a critical segment of the global art market. They have been sources of tremendous growth for auction houses, but also sources of volatility and consternation. China accounted for 27.3 percent of global art transactions in 2014, according to a Citigroup report, compared with just 0.2 percent in 2000. But after years of surging growth, the Chinese art market, like its economy and stock market, has been slumping lately. Auction sales of Chinese contemporary art dropped 41 percent last year, according to a report by ArtTactic, a London firm that analyzes the art market. The report noted that sales in other Asian markets took up some of the slack, rising 14 percent in India, for instance, and 28 percent in Southeast Asia. In a survey of industry experts by ArtTactic, 19 percent more respondents said they expected the Chinese art market to shrink this year than to expand, worse than for any market except Russia. India was considered to have the best prospects, with a net 48 percent positive on the market. The American and European markets combined had a 16 percent net favorable assessment. The possibility that Chinese art sales may be leveling off leads Benjamin R. Mandel, global strategist for multi-asset solutions at J.P. Morgan Asset Management, to warn that the next 15 years for the global art market may not be as fruitful as the last 15. He is also concerned that the trend toward ever more extravagant prices for a handful of works amid so-so growth elsewhere is bound to reverse. \u201cChina\u2019s extraordinary period of catch-up growth has largely played out, while the inequality in auction prices may reach some natural limit,\u201d Mr. Mandel wrote in a recent report. \u201cAs a result, the slowing of these factors could subtract up to a third from the annual growth of the global market; that is, global growth would be on the order of 9 percent, rather than 13 percent.\u201d Whether or not the auction houses are taking such forecasts to heart, they are easing back on the splashy evening sales that they\u2019re best known for by combining different genres of art, such as Impressionism and Postwar Contemporary, and bunching sales together on the calendar. They present the moves as a means of catering to clients with eclectic tastes, but they also may reduce costs. The more traditional competition that auction houses face comes from brick-and-mortar galleries, and they are adapting and contributing to the evolution of the market, too. Alessia Zorloni, adjunct professor in art markets at Libera Universit\u00e0 di Lingue e Comunicazione IULM, in Milan, observed a trend among galleries to abandon the middle ground. \u201cThere are two choices for dealers today, either to run a lightweight, cost-effective operation that supports young artists or adopt the mega-gallery model,\u201d she said. \u201cThe high-end art market is controlled by a few dozen operators and characterized by a small number of large and powerful galleries, often organized as real commercial companies with a wide network of connections with other galleries, and in the most important cases, with branches in other cities.\u201d These galleries trade on the value of their brands and reputations, Ms. Zorloni said, just as the auction houses do. These are important aspects of any business but especially in one like art where the value of the main product is hard to calculate and based on subjective criteria. That\u2019s why the auction industry faces little threat at the top end from online entities, in her view. \u201cIf you think about this feature of the art market, there will never be competition with websites, even mainstream ones like Amazon and eBay,\u201d she said. \u201cThey are simply different market segments appealing to different customers. The power of auction house brands will remain strong. Not only do auction houses have access to first-class works, but obviously they also have access to the clientele that no one dealer can compete with.\u201d As time goes on, auction companies may embrace the distinctions between market segments even further: providing a premium service for high-end collectors centered on a few evening sales while using extensive online abilities to grant greater access to the market, with fewer frills, to a growing number of customers with thinner wallets. \u201cThe number of buyers in the art market has increased so dramatically in the last five years,\u201d said Ms. Gyorgy, of Citi Private Bank. \u201cDeveloping an online presence is really smart.\u201d As for the marquee sales, \u201cpeople really like the auction experience,\u201d she said, adding, \u201cIt\u2019s some of the best theater in town, but it\u2019s expensive theater to put on.\u201dAdvertisement"}

It is part of a new and growing state-financed program to introduce the refugees to Germany\u2019s cultural heritage \u2014 even, of course, when some of that heritage comes from the Middle East.The visits can be fraught. \u201cSometimes people say: \u2018The Germans have all our heritage! They stole it!\u2019\u201d said Razan Nassreddine, who led the Arabic-language tour that afternoon at the Museum of Islamic Art, which is part of the Pergamon Museum and filled with treasures from empires past. Often, the visitors say the art is probably better off in Berlin because so much in Syria has been destroyed by the war and the Islamic State, Ms. Nassreddine said.Other times, the tours bring up raw memories for visitors who have arrived in the last three months. At a painted marble wall niche from a house in Damascus that dates to the 15th and 16th century and was inhabited by Samaritans, a community related to Judaism, \u201csome people want to cry,\u201d Ms. Nassreddine said. \u201cWhen they see the colors and the shapes, they get chills.\u201dEducators from the museums are training the guides, many of whom had good jobs and social standing in Syria. \u201cThe nice thing is to give them something that gives them a purpose,\u201d said Stefan Weber, the director of the Islamic Art Museum. The program also serves to \u201copen up new public spaces for them\u201d and to help \u201cmany other newcomers find a way to the museums,\u201d he added.Multaka is one of a host of new public and private programs taking shape since last summer, when Germany began taking in the first of more than one million asylum seekers. The government has also been providing food and housing and offering language and training classes. Multaka seems representative of the spirit in which Berlin, Germany\u2019s cultural hub, has embraced the new migrants even as skeptics worry that they are straining the social welfare system.The museums have not kept track of how many visitors have come on the Arabic tours, but each week more people learn about them through word of mouth and social media. Guides are encouraged to point out the objects they find most interesting, and also to share their own experiences, \u201cto have an open discussion,\u201d Mr. Weber said.On a recent afternoon, Ms. Nassreddine\u2019s group included a dozen young teenagers from Neuk\u00f6ln, a Berlin neighborhood known as a melting pot, who arrived with the teachers of their intensive German-language course. They raced through the galleries and peppered their guide with questions.As it expanded across Iraq and Syria, the Islamic State destroyed many archaeological sites, looting them for profit and damaging some for propaganda.Mahmoud Khalil, a tall 14-year-old with light brown hair and lots of energy, said he had walked about 370 miles from Syria en route to Germany. He said his favorite part of the museum tour was the Aleppo Room, whose walls are painted red with elaborate floral motifs. (It originally decorated the home of a Christian merchant and was brought into the collection in 1912 by the museum\u2019s first director.)Helin Hasan, 14, the only girl in his language class, said her favorite part was seeing the high carved walls of the desert palace of Mshatta, built in the eighth century south of Amman, Jordan, for an Umayyad-era caliph. \u201cIt was the most beautiful,\u201d she said of the walls, whose ornate carvings reveal the intermingling of Eastern, Western and Byzantine motifs. Ms. Hasan wore a T-shirt and did not cover her head, like some of the other women on the tour.Mr. Alramadhani, the Iraqi economics student entranced by the Ishtar Gate, was visiting with a German-language class of older students. His journey had taken him from Turkey to Greece by boat, then through Macedonia to Germany. Asked what was harder, economics or German grammar, he laughed. \u201cSurely the German language,\u201d he said.Katja Gretscher-Sa\u00efd, one of the teachers in the teenagers\u2019 German course, said she welcomed the change of pace from classes. \u201cThey\u2019re very motivated, and very full of illusions,\u201d she said as she walked through the gallery. \u201cThey think that Angela Merkel will buy them a house.\u201dTwenty years ago, Ms. Gretscher-Sa\u00efd taught children who had just arrived in Germany from the Balkans and the former Soviet Union. Today, they are from Syria and Iraq. It pains her to think of her students\u2019 futures in Germany, where even menial jobs require training certificates. \u201cHere you have to have papers, papers, papers, papers,\u201d she said. Many German employers would prefer to hire someone named Oliver over \u201csomeone called Ahmed,\u201d she added.After the tour, Ms. Nassreddine was visibly moved. She said it had been her best to date. \u201cThey asked me \u2018What\u2019s this?\u2019 and \u2018Why\u2019s it here?\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cIt was really a dialogue.\u201dBecause of an editing error, an earlier version of a picture caption with this article misstated the location of the Ishtar Gate at the Pergamon Museum. As the article correctly noted, it is part of the Pergamon Museum, but of its Museum of the Ancient Near East, not its Museum of Islamic Art.An article on Tuesday about a program at the Pergamon Museum in Berlin to train refugees to be museum guides misidentified an Arabic-language tour guide there. She is Razan Nassreddine \u2014 not Zoya Masoud, another guide. The error was repeated in a picture caption. The article also misstated the religious affiliation of the Samaritans. (Ms. Nassreddine spoke of refugees\u2019 emotional reactions to a 15th- or 16th-century object at the museum that is associated with the Samaritans.) They are a community related to Judaism, not a Christian minority.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Patagonia to Help Fund Residential Solar Installations", "Date": "2016-03-10", "News": "Supported byPatagonia has made a name for itself as an environmentally conscious brand, linking the outdoors clothing and gear that it sells with a commitment to taking care of the planet.Now, it is taking that a step further by investing in placing solar panels on more than 1,500 residential rooftops over eight states. Patagonia announced on Thursday that it was working with four other companies to create a $35 million fund to finance the installations.\u201cI hope that other companies that are interested in having a positive impact will look at this as a model,\u201d said Rose Marcario, Patagonia\u2019s chief executive. She added that the faster clean energy takes off, \u201cthe better off we all are going to be.\u201dPatagonia\u2019s foray into home energy began when a solar developer whom Ms. Marcario knew introduced her to the concept of tax equity investing, a complex type of transaction that was limiting the pool of investors for clean energy development. Financiers of solar projects are entitled to a tax credit worth 30 percent of a project\u2019s cost, but not all developers have enough profit to use it.Over the years, some large companies like Google have taken advantage of the approach by investing in a variety of clean energy installations, as have retail chains like Walmart and Costco, which have the roof space to put in panels for their own energy needs.But not many companies have found a way to help families get over the financial hurdle of installing solar in their homes, a niche that Ms. Marcario decided Patagonia should try to help fill.Patagonia had already created a fund called $20 Million and Change to help start-up companies focused on solving environmental and other issues. Two years ago, through $20 Million and Change, the company formed a $27 million fund with Kina\u2019ole Capital, a solar finance company, to install 1,000 residential systems in Hawaii.Now, Patagonia is again working with Kina\u2019ole, as well as New Resource Bank, Beneficial State Bank and the installer Sungevity, all certified B corporations. Such companies are part of a growing approach that requires executives to take into account not just how decisions will affect profit and shareholders, but also how they will affect the public, generally defined as society or the environment.\u201cWe all recognized that the B-corp relationship created a kind of mutual interest in the business and the social and environmental side of how we run our businesses. That naturally led to a conversation that became this deal,\u201d said Andrew Birch, chief executive of Sungevity. \u201cThis is a new name providing new funding for the solar sector, and that\u2019s very important.\u201dThe systems will be available in Arizona, California, Connecticut, Delaware, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey and New York.An earlier version of this article misstated the incorporation category of Patagonia\u2019s partners in the solar installation fund. Only Patagonia is a benefit corporation, a legal status available in 30 states and the District of Columbia. Its partners are certified B corporations. Both corporate approaches require executives to take public benefits into account in business decisions.Advertisement"}

In 2012, the campaigns and related groups spent about $2.3 billion in total, way up from about $1.4 billion in 2000. Some people say it could be as much as $5 billion this year, although that sounds crazy high to me.

{"Headline": "Long Denied Pensions, Pioneers of the Women\u2019s Game Are Seeing Reasons for Hope", "Date": "2016-03-25", "News": "Supported byFor about 25 years, the women who helped build the Women\u2019s Tennis Association have not been eligible for a pension from the organization.At Indian Wells, a group of them, including the Hall of Famers Billie Jean King and Rosie Casals and lesser-known players like Trish Bostrom, met with the WTA\u2019s new chief executive, Steve Simon, to discuss pension proposals.They left feeling, for the first time, that a pension deal for the WTA pioneers was possible.\u201cThis would be very important and should have been done in the past,\u201d said Casals, who won 12 Grand Slam doubles and mixed doubles titles before retiring in 1988 and then moved into sports marketing. \u201cIf the WTA wants to do something about it, they can. Steve Simon can create his legacy if he addresses the issue.\u201dShe added, \u201cThe new generation of players doesn\u2019t have to worry about their future, and I feel we were responsible for that and we should have benefits of a pension plan, however small, to acknowledge us.\u201dThe WTA was organized at a meeting led by King in 1973 just before Wimbledon. The players agreed to put in a percentage of their prize money to finance the WTA.\u201cWe did take care of the business and make sure it prospered,\u201d Casals said. \u201cBut we fell short on the pension.\u201dThe men\u2019s tour, the Association of Tennis Professionals, started a pension in 1980, and around 1990 it grandfathered in qualifying players whose careers ran from 1972 to 1980. But when the WTA was creating its pension in 1991, those who retired before that year were left out.\u201cWe were very disappointed,\u201d said Pam Teeguarden, who retired in 1985 after 17 years, during which she won two Grand Slam titles in mixed doubles and another in doubles.The men\u2019s players were earning far more in prize money then, and the ATP has donated money to its annual pension fund while the WTA was not contributing money, instead taking it from the players\u2019 prize money, which is how the women\u2019s pension is funded today.JoAnne Russell, who won the Wimbledon doubles crown in 1977, said that in 1990 or \u201991, she was told by Kathy Jordan, the player who led the pension movement, \u201cWe don\u2019t have enough money.\u201dRussell said: \u201cThe decision was really frustrating. It was so shortsighted. The men have been really good to their older members.\u201dMartina Navratilova played well past 1991 and thus qualifies for the pension, but she supported the effort to extend it.\u201cThe women who built the tour got the short end of the stick while they were playing because the prize money was so low, and they have been getting it again with the pension deal,\u201d she said.Casals and Teeguarden said people tried approaching WTA throughout the years to no avail. But last fall, a new movement arose.\u201cThe difference between now and 1991 is social media,\u201d said Teeguarden, who started exploring Facebook only in October.She began chatting with other former players, like Bostrom, who is a lawyer, about the pension.\u201cWithin three days, 150 people had joined the conversation,\u201d Teeguarden said.Another change during the past quarter-century is the growth of the women\u2019s game, thanks to players like Steffi Graf, Monica Seles, Maria Sharapova and the Williams sisters, Serena and Venus. Prize money, sponsorships and television contracts have increased significantly.\u201cWe feel the WTA is now in a favorable position to do this,\u201d Teeguarden said.Teeguarden, Bostrom, Pam Austin and others began researching details for a possible pension plan and including it in conversations with ATP officials.\u201cOur very early estimate is that 200 to 250 women may meet the criteria,\u201d depending on how inclusive the plan is, Teeguarden said.\u201cWe had several different ideas, and more work needs to be done,\u201d Bostrom said.Teeguarden and Bostrom said that their suggestions were a starting point and that they would let the WTA decide on the final criteria. As a result, Teeguarden did not want to divulge the specifics of their various proposals.\u201cI\u2019m thankful that the new leadership seems open to this,\u201d said Bostrom, who had an eight-year career and was ranked as high as fifth in doubles and 30th in singles.Simon praised the women, saying he hoped the WTA could create programs \u201cthat truly embrace our history\u201d and find opportunities to bring these pioneers into the fold, whether it is mentoring younger players or working at clinics or with corporate partners.As for the pension proposal, he said he was \u201crolling up my sleeves and doing some homework.\u201dHe hoped to get back to the group soon with potential options.\u201cIf this is feasible, we will work toward it, and if it\u2019s not, we will move on,\u201d Simon said.Still, the women came away encouraged. Bostrom said she trusted Simon and his colleagues, such as the Women\u2019s Tennis Benefit Association executive Lisa Grattan, while Teeguarden said she was optimistic.\u201cThis is our last best chance,\u201d she added.The players said gaining a pension was as much about recognizing what their peers had gone through to establish the tour as it was about the money.\u201cWe are not expecting a huge windfall,\u201d said Teeguarden, who still teaches part time. \u201cThis will not change our lives drastically.\u201dBut she acknowledged that as the players age, facing hip and knee replacements and other medical problems, \u201cevery little bit helps.\u201dRussell, who also still teaches, said she was fortunate because her father had her saving money from her first paycheck.\u201cBut not everybody is like that,\u201d she said. \u201cFor some, $500 a month would be amazing; $1,000 a month would be nirvana.\u201dAdvertisement"}

As the founder of Zexi Investment, one of China\u2019s most successful hedge funds, Xu had consistently produced returns that were truly unbelievable: His worst-performing fund had grown by nearly 800 percent in five years. He had also survived countless corruption investigations, market falls, purges and other scares. Yet even as his legend grew, Xu remained intensely secretive. He had amassed a fortune by trading on knowledge and information no one else had, rumors no one else knew \u2014 a strategy perfectly crafted for China, where information is tightly controlled and reluctantly released. (Almost every source I approached for this article would only speak to me anonymously, fearing government reprisal or harm to their business.) Even as Xu grew richer and more powerful, he kept nearly every detail about his personal life and his trading techniques jealously hidden.That equilibrium seemed certain to crumble on June 12, when the Chinese stock market began a free-fall. In the span of three weeks, the market lost a third of its value. It continued to careen downward throughout the summer, with major declines on July 27 and Aug. 24. On the second of these, named Black Monday by The People\u2019s Daily, the Shanghai composite index fell by 8.5 percent, its worst single-day tumble in eight years. In the span of two and a half months, $5 trillion was wiped out of the market. The ripples were felt around the globe. On Black Monday, the Dow Jones industrial average fell more than 1,000 points shortly after opening, and the FTSE 100 index in London lost $116 billion. Yet Xu (pronounced shu) somehow managed to survive this free-fall unscathed.Despite his wealth, the party in Ningbo had been a low-key affair. Xu\u2019s family shared his taste for anonymity. His wife preferred the subway to her chauffeured car, and his grandmother still lived in the same middle-class neighborhood where Xu grew up. But the festivities were interrupted a little before 10:30 that Sunday, when Xu received a message bearing a warning: The authorities were coming for him.Xu left the party immediately and sped north on the G15 Expressway toward Shanghai. As he drove, he passed neighborhoods of squat gray apartment buildings with smog-stained walls, unkempt courtyards and barred windows. He crossed the Fenghua River, which bisects Ningbo, and curved along Hangzhou Bay, racing toward the bridge. But he didn\u2019t know about the police blockade. When he reached the bridge, the authorities ushered him from his car and shuttled him to the side of the expressway to an office of the highway patrol.Xu began trading while still in high school. He was entirely self-taught: His parents, a retired factory worker and a homemaker, knew nothing about investing. \u201cI studied the stock market by reading books and attending lectures and by studying foreign investment techniques,\u201d Xu later told Caixin, a Chinese news organization, in one of the few interviews he has given. After graduating from high school, he skipped China\u2019s infamous college entrance exam and borrowed 30,000 renminbi (roughly $5,000) from his parents to trade full time. He would later say that he had actually been born in 1993 \u2014 the year he first started trading stocks.At the time, millions of Chinese were opening stock accounts with an enthusiasm that proved long-lasting and transformative. Between Shanghai and a second exchange in Shenzhen, the market grew from a capitalization of $61 billion in 1993 to $10 trillion by the summer of 2015. Unlike in the United States, where institutional investors dominate the market, China\u2019s 200 million mom-and-pop investors make roughly 85 percent of all trades. According to a survey by the State Street Center for Applied Research, 81 percent of these trade at least once a month. But less-experienced individual investors are easily swayed by rumors and operate with a poor understanding of market fundamentals, making them easy prey for more systematic and sophisticated traders. \u201cAll these small individual investors are called \u2018chives\u2019 in the market,\u201d says Hong Yan, a finance professor at the Shanghai Advanced Institute of Finance. \u201cThey get cut over and over again, but they come back every time, like little weeds.\u201dIn his early days, Xu worked from the Galaxy Securities trading hall on South Liberation Road in Ningbo. Stock prices were written in chalk on blackboards, and arbitrary rule changes affecting stock issuance and corporate disclosure constantly jostled an already unpredictable market. In 1992, the Shanghai index grew by 167 percent \u2014 then tumbled roughly 75 percent between April 1993 and July 1994. The fact that China Galaxy Securities was a state-owned enterprise offered little protection; as Xu cut his teeth, the traders around him won and lost fortunes almost overnight.On an overcast Monday morning last December, I visited Galaxy. The building itself had hardly changed from the days when Xu first set foot inside. Located beside a pharmacy that glowed with blue lights, the eight-story structure seemed on the verge of physical collapse. A wide concrete staircase, littered with cigarette butts and sun\u00adflower seeds, led up to the main trading hall on the second floor, which, by 9 a.m., was packed with haggard-looking investors. Directly opposite the trading board, hung above a small statue of a golden bull, was a red banner urging traders to \u201cstay away from illegal securities activities.\u201dAs Xu\u2019s fame grew, so did his network. By the late 1990s, he became the unofficial captain of a group popularly known as the Ningbo Death Squad. The squad made its reputation by manipulating cheap, relatively unknown stocks, which in the Chinese market are not allowed to rise or fall more than 10 percent in a single trading day. To game the system, the squad devised a strategy: Out of nowhere, it would place a gigantic order for a chosen stock. Other traders, seeing the sudden upward movement in price, would flood in, pushing the stock toward its daily 10-percent limit. Once the stock hit the limit on the first day, the momentum became self-perpetuating. Eager traders rushed to buy the stock as soon as the market opened the next day, propelling it toward the 10-percent limit once again. The movement generated its own publicity and easy profits. After a few days, the squad would sell out, and the stock would tumble back to a lower price as other traders followed. In the American context, this tactic was reminiscent of present-day schemes in \u201cpenny stocks,\u201d but with much higher stakes, and playing out in a regulatory environment that mirrored the early days of the United States market. One Chinese day trader I talked to spoke in reverent tones about the turn-of-the-century American stock picker Jesse Livermore, who made and lost several multimillion-dollar fortunes before killing himself in 1940 at 63.As the squad gained notoriety, other traders began to monitor the buy orders coming from the Galaxy trading hall \u2014 any stock they picked was guaranteed to attract attention, and a corresponding surge in buy orders. Profit was almost unavoidable.Despite Xu\u2019s preference for anonymity \u2014 he eschewed flashy purchases while other squad members parked new sports cars conspicuously in front of the trading hall \u2014 the group took on a mythical status. There was a series of books by two self-proclaimed \u201cNingbo masters,\u201d as well as traveling seminars that promised to teach legions of novice investors the moneymaking secrets of the Ningbo Death Squad. Copycat death squads popped up in other Chinese cities.The attention was not all positive. After a 2003 article in The China Securities Journal raised questions, the China Securities Regulatory Commission, the country\u2019s chief market watchdog, assigned a special czar to investigate the trading practices at Galaxy Securities and five other Ningbo trading halls. In the process, the czar called in a number of big-name local traders for an \u201cinformal discussion session.\u201d The squad disappeared from the market, only to return a week later when the czar released a public statement saying he had found no evidence of wrongdoing. Whatever the traders\u2019 methods, they were pulling in millions, and Ningbo \u2014 and the greater Chinese economy \u2014 was thriving.It was only in 2005 that a revision to China\u2019s Securities Law helped pave the way for hedge funds. Those funds that decided to operate openly within the new framework became known as \u201csunshine funds,\u201d to distinguish them from funds who kept their participants hidden. As this was happening, a new class of wealthy Chinese, enriched by the country\u2019s rapid economic boom, suddenly found themselves with billions of renminbi to invest. \u201cIt was just the perfect storm,\u201d says Zhang Howhow, the director of strategy at KPMG in Hong Kong. \u201cPeople were starting to study the regulations more closely, more seriously, to find a relatively legal way to approach this as a business. The market was going up, and you have a group of high-net-worth individuals.\u201d This was Xu\u2019s chance \u201cto build a proper hedge fund in China \u2014 the biggest, the most successful.\u201dOn Dec. 7, 2009, Xu founded Zexi Investments with 30 million renminbi \u2014 a little under $4.5 million \u2014 in capital. The name was a homage to the two men Xu admired most: \u201cZe\u201d for Mao Zedong, the founder of the People\u2019s Republic of China, and \u201cxi\u201d for Emperor Kangxi, the longest-ruling emperor in Chinese his\u00adtory. In March 2010, Xu opened Zexi\u2019s first fund with one billion renminbi. It was technically a sunshine fund, but because it had fewer than 200 investors, he wasn\u2019t required to divulge the names of his clients.As a boss, Xu was obsessive and untiring. Friends say he had no hobbies or interests outside the stock market. He arrived at Zexi\u2019s sleek Shanghai office each morning at 8:45, and often stayed until 2 a.m. From his seat at the back of the firm\u2019s trading floor, he personally directed Zexi\u2019s investments, even as the firm\u2019s assets approached 30 billion renminbi. He remained intensely secretive. The firm\u2019s researchers did not know if he had heeded their stock recommendations until they saw their performance assessments at the end of each year. \u201cXu Xiang is always trading,\u201d a longtime friend said. \u201cIf he\u2019s not trading, he\u2019s thinking about trading.\u201dIn meetings, Xu was glued to two smartphones, one displaying market prices and the other pinging with news about economic developments. He preferred to let others speak, and when he did interject, his answers were brief and dismissive. One Western fund manager said he seemed as if he was \u201cbored of answering questions and would rather get back to trading.\u201d He dressed informally, sometimes in tracksuits.As he had in Ningbo, Xu regularly poured billions into big, risky bets that always seemed impeccably timed. He focused on buying stocks that were either small and relatively unknown or sinking toward bottom-dollar price, then pulled out as soon as he made a profit. The strategy was partly a reaction to the peculiarities of the Chinese market. Practices common among United States hedge funds, like short-selling stocks to protect against downturns in the market (in other words, hedging), are restricted in China, where regulators treat them with suspicion. Instead, fund managers rely almost exclusively on buying and selling stocks at just the right time.The results Xu achieved were unbelievable \u2014 perhaps literally. Between March 2010 and October 2015, Zexi\u2019s Fund No. 1 produced a return of more than 3,270 percent, even while the Shanghai Stock Exchange index grew by only 11.6 percent. Other Zexi funds grew at similarly startling rates. By 2015, Xu controlled at least 28 billion renminbi, the most of any Chinese hedge-fund manager. An adoring public, aspiring to his rags-to-riches tale, called him \u201cChina\u2019s Carl Icahn,\u201d \u201cXu the Legend\u201d and \u201cHedge Fund Brother No. 1.\u201dIn an elegant waterfront coffee house in Ningbo, I met a young stock trader who speculated about the web of political connections that had enriched and ultimately doomed Xu. \u201cXu was pushed onto the stage,\u201d the trader told me, as fashionable young women toting Gucci bags and wearing Cartier watches strode past us. \u201cThere are a lot of red capitalists in Shanghai, the children of leaders and important officials. They put a lot of money into his private fund to use as their personal bank account.\u201dBy the young trader\u2019s telling, Xu\u2019s entire operation was a cover for this simple scheme. \u201cXu had seven products,\u201d the trader told me. \u201cThe most successful are for the red capitalists. The others are rat funds\u201d \u2014 dummy products used to drive up stock prices and enrich Xu\u2019s clients.Nearly every one of the experts I spoke with repeated some version of the same rumor: that Xu was less a financial genius than a puppet of even larger powers. Most often, this explanation was deployed in response to a question that had been troubling observers of the Chinese financial world for months: Why hadn\u2019t Xu stopped earlier? Rumors of his illegal methods were an open secret, and he had already built the most successful hedge fund in China, reaping billions of dollars in personal wealth in the process. Why keep going and risk a reckoning?\u201cThat goes to the investor conspiracy,\u201d a former hedge fund researcher told me. \u201cThe people who give money to him to manage would not like to see the fund wound down.\u201d Whether Xu had begun as a willing partner or was coerced from the start was just further speculation. \u201cWhen you have someone very politically powerful and well connected coming to you who wants you to manage money for him or her,\u201d the researcher said, \u201cthen it\u2019s sort of difficult to say no, right?\u201dIf Xu was indeed tied to figures in the country\u2019s opaque political elite, his carefully protected anonymity was all the more crucial. In a nation where political and economic control are inseparable, and where the flashiest are often the first to fall, remaining unknown can serve as a survival technique. Even the true value of his assets remains a mystery. In 2015, the Hurun Rich List ranked Xu as the 188th-richest person in China, with a value of $2.2 billion. But that figure does not necessarily include all of Xu\u2019s earnings from privately managed funds, the money he controlled through family members or assets stashed outside Zexi. Xu\u2019s true wealth was unknown and unknowable.In late 2010, he began operating through a network of shell companies and affiliated investment funds with near-identical names, purchasing ownership stakes in companies. He took on the role of the activist investor, padding corporate boards with his associates, who would then implement investor-friendly policies \u2014 particularly dividend payouts.Between 2010 and 2014, Zexi invested in 45 companies that issued dividends \u2014 more companies than the average Chinese hedge fund had invested in altogether during that period. \u201cThat strategy was quite unique,\u201d the China-based Western fund manager told me. \u201cMaybe in part because there are only a few managers who can pull that off.\u201d But Xu had the leverage and the connections. A company\u2019s performance or fundamentals did not seem to concern him; if he could find a few winning stocks, he could use his tactics to ride them to huge profits. Zexi would use dividend payouts to purchase additional shares in the company, which it could then sell when prices rose, netting millions more in profits.To execute this scheme, Xu relied on a network of trusted proxies. Two of the most important were his parents. As executives at Zexi and controlling shareholders at several related companies, Xu\u2019s mother and father helped direct billions in investment in their son\u2019s name. They also ran many of the companies that made up Xu\u2019s secret empire. Through a Zexi-affiliated fund, Xu\u2019s father owned a large share of Ningbo Zhongbai, a department store company based in Xu\u2019s hometown. Other corporations, like an unprofitable apparel chain called Shanghai Metersbonwe Fashion & Accessories, were run by friends and allies.The stock rout last summer coincided with the apex of both Xu\u2019s success and his notoriety. The government\u2019s response to the crisis was swift and heavy-handed. Large shareholders were prohi\u00adbited from selling listed stocks; I.P.O.s were halted, and state-run institutions were ordered to maintain their positions or to buy shares. The government also mobilized a \u201cnational team\u201d of brokers and investors, backed by up to three trillion renminbi in state capital, to purchase shares and raise prices.But while the rest of the market was collapsing, Xu continued to thrive. From the beginning of 2015, one of Zexi\u2019s funds grew by 357 percent, ranking first among 1,649 funds in China. Another grew by 187 percent. All five publicly listed funds had growth of at least 20 percent during three weeks of the crash in mid-June.Xu benefited from seemingly miraculous luck and timing, according to The South China Morning Post. At least three of the stocks that Zexi held most heavily were purchased en masse by the \u201cnational team.\u201d More remarkable still, all the funds run by Xu seemed to exit the stock market at just the right moment, when it briefly re\u00adbounded during the late summer before plummeting again. By the end of the summer, the annual return on his funds was more than 200 percent.But as the market dried up, Xu became a target. In September, a social-media post implicating Zexi in corruption and insider trading went viral on the Chinese Internet. The post, written anony\u00admously, claimed that Zexi had conspired with Citic Securities, a powerful state-owned investment house, to direct buyers toward Shanghai Metersbonwe Fashion & Accessories, which saw its share prices surge during the worst of the market rout. Zexi denied that Xu had worked with Citic to manipulate the price of Metersbonwe, but the arrest of several Citic executives that fall only fueled more speculation.The same post provided a possible motive for the swindle. It began when a Shanghai princeling who held shares of Metersbonwe complained to Xu about the stock\u2019s low price during the summer rout. Xu called in a favor at Citic Securities, and in a matter of weeks the \u201cnational team\u201d purchased 15 percent of the company\u2019s total shares in circulation, sending prices soaring. The C.S.R.C. noticed the incident and began investigating. Almost immediately, the government placed restrictions on Xu\u2019s ability to travel outside the country.Nine days later, Xu was fleeing his grandmother\u2019s birthday party, trying to reach Shanghai. The timing was not coincidental. A special group organized by the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection was about to begin a top-to-bottom review of the activities and leadership of the C.S.R.C. Taking down Xu \u2014 especially in public, and with photographic evidence \u2014 was a display of force and competence from a government battered by a summer of bad economic news. \u201cIn China,\u201d one fund manager told me, \u201cthe compromising and bargaining is in the execution of the law, not the formulation. The government is using this case to show that from now on, they will enforce the law.\u201dXu himself seemed to sense the end coming. A year before his arrest, in November 2014, he moved to Beijing and opened an office less than half a mile from the headquarters of the C.S.R.C. According to colleagues, the move was the start of a yearlong effort by Xu to use his connections and money to avoid a reckoning. But despite his billions, Xu was an ordinary man from a poor family. By itself, Xu\u2019s market malfeasance might have been enough to spell his downfall; that he was said to be protected by some of the same corrupt officials targeted by the anticorruption push meant there was no escape.In the months since the crash, the Chinese government has instituted a sweeping crackdown on illegal practices in the financial markets. \u201cThere are many, many, many, many, many other managers in the market who could be apprehended for the same reasons,\u201d the Western fund manager told me. Xu proved an irresistible target not because of his own malfeasance, but because he offered a path to an even larger target \u2014 perhaps the clique of Shanghai princelings. \u201cIf you\u2019re going to knock somebody down, first you take out the whole row of people around them, the people who support them,\u201d the fund manager said. \u201cYou tighten the noose around them.\u201dFrom the beginning of 2015 through September of that year, 34 companies listed on the Chinese stock market reported officials as either missing or under investigation by the authorities, according to Bloomberg News. As of late November, Xinhua, the official Chinese news agency, had identified at least 16 major finance industry figures tied directly to the stock-market cleanup who were either arrested, under investigation or assisting the authorities. In early January, the chairman of Metersbonwe joined the list, disappearing without explanation for more than a week.\u201cThe level of corruption is beyond your imagi\u00adnation,\u201d a prominent Beijing-based hedge-fund manager told me over coffee several weeks after Xu\u2019s arrest. Like all my sources, this fund manager was extremely nervous about being interviewed. The irony of the crackdown was clear: Though a lack of transparency had clearly shattered the market, the Chinese government was responding with a crushing clampdown on information. The fund manager insisted that I could not use his name, for fear of being blacklisted or arrested. The ubiquity of wrongdoing, he said, did not make anyone safe. \u201cNo one knows who will be next. If they want to catch you, they will catch you.\u201dFor China\u2019s would-be tycoons, the stakes of the crackdown go far beyond the market. During my conversation with the Beijing-based fund manager, which took place in a cafe on a university campus, a young man wandered toward us, admiring a pair of paintings on a nearby wall. The manager went quiet, and shifted uncomfortably, watching the potential eavesdropper from the corner of his eye. When the young man had passed, the manager turned back to me. \u201cIn China,\u201d he said, \u201cthe losing side doesn\u2019t get to sleep at night.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "De Blasio\u2019s New York Feels Effects of Recovery to Relief of Business Leaders", "Date": "2016-03-07", "News": "Supported byWhen Bill de Blasio was running for mayor on a starkly liberal platform in 2013, some of New York\u2019s business leaders feared the city\u2019s economic well-being was doomed.\u201cThere was definitely something in the ether,\u201d said Alicia Glen, a deputy mayor whom Mr. de Blasio recruited from Wall Street. \u201c\u2018The lefties are taking over.\u2019 \u2018This is not a pro-business mayor.\u2019 \u2018They\u2019re going to ruin the economy.\u2019 I heard a lot of that myself.\u201dIt did not help that Mr. de Blasio was hoping to succeed Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, a self-made billionaire and a darling of business elites.Along with the steady increases in employment, the wages of workers in the city have risen at a fast pace over the last two years, helping them cope with the dizzying cost of living. Residential and office construction are booming. Tourism is at a high.Still, by virtually any measure, the city continues to do better than the rest of the country in rebounding from the financial crisis, economists said.\u201cFor the first time in this recovery, workers generally are enjoying the benefits of the recovery full-on,\u201d Mark Zandi, the chief economist of Moody\u2019s Analytics, said. \u201cIn the rest of the country we\u2019re not quite there yet.\u201dMr. de Blasio, a Democrat, inherited a city that had already begun recovering impressively under Mr. Bloomberg, a political independent whose businesslike approach to running New York was heralded as helping to rescue it from the depths of the recession.\u201cContrary to fears in the business community when the mayor first took office, the city economy has continued to do very well,\u201d Ms. Wylde said.Mr. de Blasio still scares corporate executives with some of his liberal ideas, Ms. Wylde added, like raising the minimum wage. \u201cBut that is a matter again of occasional differences on political rhetoric and, frankly, there\u2019s much less of that than many of them feared,\u201d she said.Before Mr. Bloomberg\u2019s three terms in office, from 2002 through 2013, business leaders did not typically expect mayors to become deeply involved in economic matters beyond tending to the city\u2019s budget, Ms. Wylde said.\u201cWhat we expect from mayors is they encourage private-sector economic activity and they don\u2019t screw it up,\u201d she said. Appraising Mr. de Blasio\u2019s performance so far, she said, \u201cIt\u2019s obvious he has not screwed it up.\u2019\u2019In fact, the city has a record number of jobs (4.2 million) and a record number of employed residents (four million), and attracted a record number of tourists last year (58.3 million). The share of the city\u2019s population that is employed is at its highest level \u2014 58 percent \u2013 in at least four decades.In the early years of the recovery, the bulk of the hiring was in lower-paying fields like retail and health care. But it has broadened to all sectors, including Wall Street, construction and even manufacturing.Wages, too, have begun to surge, and not just for white-collar workers at the upper end of the pay spectrum, said James Parrott, chief economist with the Fiscal Policy Institute, a union-backed research group. Mr. Parrott said that average wages for workers at all levels of pay had risen faster than inflation in the last two years, after being flat for the previous three years.\u201cThis last five or six years has been the most sustained period of job growth in the city,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019d have to go back to the \u201950s or early \u201960s to see anything like that.\u201dAnthony C. Roman Jr. is one of the newest beneficiaries of the city\u2019s growing prosperity. After months of searching for a job, he started on Friday in the marketing department of Bareburger, a fast-growing restaurant chain founded in Astoria, Queens.Armed with a degree in food studies from the New School, Mr. Roman, 25, said he had still found it difficult to land a job because of \u201can oversupply of highly educated people\u201d seeking work in his industry.\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of energy\u201d in the city\u2019s economy, but he said he would call it \u201cnot necessarily a boom, but a bloom.\u201dThough Mr. Roman and his fianc\u00e9e, who works in finance, now have jobs that pay well, he said they each planned to continue living with their parents until their wedding.\u201cWhen you look at the financial commitment of renting,\u201d he said, \u201cit\u2019s just a huge drain on any kind of hope or future that you have in the short term.\u201dSoaring commercial rents in the city have posed a problem for Bareburger, said Euripides Pelekanos, one of the company\u2019s founders. Bareburger is opening restaurants as far away as Tokyo and Dubai, in the United Arab Emirates, but Mr. Pelekanos said he gave up looking for a location in Harlem because landlords were asking too much.Mr. Pelekanos said he had no trouble finding students and actresses to hire as servers, but the intense competition among restaurants was making it hard to staff the kitchens. Another burger chain, he said, tried to poach Bareburger\u2019s hostesses and cooks.As for his sentiments about City Hall, Mr. Pelekanos said he opposed Mr. de Blasio\u2019s push for a minimum wage as high as $15 an hour.\u201cI don\u2019t think he fully understood the impact on local businesses, on small businesses,\u201d Mr. Pelekanos said, adding that such an increase would force restaurants to raise prices and reduce staffing.Helping to raise the wages of the city\u2019s lowest-paid residents is a priority for his administration, said Ms. Glen, who was an executive at Goldman Sachs before leaving for City Hall.The mayor may not have won over all of the doubters yet, Ms. Wylde said, but he had scored points with them by being \u201cvery fiscally responsible,\u201d referring to the mayor\u2019s budgeting process and the contracts his administration had reached with unions.Mr. de Blasio has also sought to diversify the economy and encourage job creation beyond Manhattan. Since Mr. de Blasio took office, employment has risen faster in the other boroughs as the city\u2019s unemployment rate has steadily declined, to 5.3 percent in January, from 8 percent in January 2014.The robust economy has helped people like Mulu Amlesom, a 36-year-old Bronx resident who bounced through a series of office jobs before returning to college to pursue a nursing degree. But after completing her studies, she said, she spent several months trying to find work at a hospital.She was ready to leave New York before she enrolled in a training program financed by the city\u2019s Small Business Services Department and a health care industry partnership. When Ms. Amlesom completed the training in late 2014, she was hired into a full-time position at Mount Sinai Beth Israel in Manhattan that pays more than $70,000 a year.Referring to the condominium she and her husband own in the High Bridge neighborhood, Ms. Amlesom said, \u201cNow we can actually pay the mortgage.\u201dAdvertisement"}

No. 1, it\u2019s obsolete. When NATO was formed many decades ago we were a different country. There was a different threat. Soviet Union was, the Soviet Union, not Russia, which was much bigger than Russia, as you know. And, it was certainly much more powerful than even today\u2019s Russia, although again you go back into the weaponry. But, but \u2013 I said, I think NATO is obsolete, and I think that \u2013 because I don\u2019t think \u2013 right now we don\u2019t have somebody looking at terror, and we should be looking at terror. And you may want to add and subtract from NATO in terms of countries. But we have to be looking at terror, because terror today is the big threat. Terror from all different parts. You know in the old days you\u2019d have uniforms and you\u2019d go to war and you\u2019d see who your enemy was, and today we have no idea who the enemy is.(Laughter.)Second interview begins:But during the period I\u2019ve been, I think very well versed on matters as we\u2019re discussing and many more than just what we\u2019re just discussing. Now as it gets \u2014 as we get you know closer to the end of the process it\u2018ll take place more and more. I\u2019m setting up a council, I\u2019m setting up \u2014 and I have other people coming in, I gave you the other few names I think that we added, we have a few more coming in. But I have a few more that are going to come in. I just don\u2019t want to I just don\u2019t want to mention them unless they give me approval, meaning they\u2019re on board.And we\u2019re going to have a very substantial council of very good people. And some of them are military. Look, the military is going to be very important because we have to do something with ISIS, David, and you know we do want the military. And I think that over the next few weeks I\u2019ll be able to give you some more names. People that are going to be coming in.See we should use our economic power to have them disarm \u2014 now then it becomes different, then it becomes purely economic, but then it becomes different. China has great power over North Korea even though they don\u2019t necessarily say that. Now, Iran, we had a great opportunity during this negotiation when we gave them the 150 billion and many other things. Iran is the No. 1 trading partner of North Korea. Now we could have put something in our agreement that they would have led the charge if we had people with substance and with brainpower and with some negotiating ability. But the No. 1 trading partner with North Korea is Iran. And we did a deal with them, and we just did a deal with them, and we don\u2019t even mention North Korea in the deal. That was a great opportunity to put another five pages in the deal, or less, and they do have a great influence over North Korea. Same thing with China, China has great influence over North Korea but they don\u2019t say they do because they\u2019re tweaking us. I have this from Chinese. I have many Chinese friends, I have people of vast wealth, some of the most important people in China have purchased apartments from me for tens of millions of dollars and frankly I know them very well. And I ask them about their relationship to North Korea, these are top people. And they say we have tremendous power over North Korea. I know they do.

He has threatened to put a 45 percent tax on Chinese imports \u201cif they don\u2019t behave.\u201dIf you take Mr. Trump\u2019s comments at face value, as president he would try to renegotiate a complex set of ties that has pulled hundreds of millions of Chinese out of dire poverty, made a wide range of goods available to American consumers at more affordable prices and contributed to the decline of American manufacturing.Here is a reality check on Mr. Trump\u2019s arguments. (It\u2019s also a way to understand the economic relationship between the countries.)\u201cWe have very unfair trade with China. We\u2019re going to have a trade deficit of $505 billion this year with China.\u201d \u2014 Mr. TrumpAmerica\u2019s trade deficit with China was $338 billion last year, and there\u2019s no reason to think it would swing by as much as Mr. Trump suggests in 2016 \u2014 but what\u2019s $167 billion among codependent trading partners? (Mr. Trump seems to be conflating the China number with the $505 billion total American trade deficit in 2014, which was first reported to be that much.)The central point, that the United States imports a lot more from China than it exports, is correct. To put it a bit differently, from 1999 to 2015 annual imports from China rose by $416 billion. In the same span, American exports to China rose by $145 billion.That said, many economists would argue that a trade balance shouldn\u2019t be viewed as a simple scorecard in which the country with the trade deficit is the loser and the one with the surplus the winner.So the question isn\u2019t whether there is a persistent, large trade deficit between the United States and China, but why. And that leads to another arm of Mr. Trump\u2019s argument, and one of the stronger ones.\u201cI have many friends, great manufacturers, they want to go into China. They can\u2019t. China won\u2019t let them.\u201d \u2014 Mr. TrumpIt\u2019s not that American multinational companies \u2014 heavy industry, technology or finance \u2014 can\u2019t do business in China. Rather, their executives complain of Chinese government restrictions that they see as arbitrary, unpredictable and highly favorable to domestic companies \u2014 so much so that in practice they are either shut out or can\u2019t make money in China.Doing business in China typically requires a partnership with a Chinese company, and that often means sharing crucial intellectual property that can enable the partner to become a competitor down the road. The rules of engagement can change capriciously, especially for American and European companies, rendering major investments worthless.This may reflect a faltering Chinese economy that is leading the government there to be more concerned than usual about protecting domestic companies.\u201cThey are the single greatest currency manipulator that\u2019s ever been on this planet.\u201d \u2014 Mr. TrumpMr. Trump\u2019s complaint about China\u2019s devaluation of its currency has a long, bipartisan tradition. It is also out of date.It is true that China intervenes in currency markets to influence the price of its renminbi against the dollar. And it is true that a decade ago, both the American government and independent economists tended to think that the interventions served to depress the currency, in the Chinese government\u2019s deliberate effort to make its exports more price competitive.But a lot has changed in the last decade. The renminbi was allowed to rise sharply from roughly 2006 to 2015, and is up 23 percent from a decade ago.\u201cAt least in 2006, 2007 or 2008, the yuan was undervalued \u2014 now it\u2019s probably not,\u201d said Derek Scissors, a resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute and chief economist of China Beige Book, an information service.Indeed, the Chinese government has been trying to restrict capital from flowing out of the country to stop the renminbi from falling any further. It would seem that the Chinese government and Mr. Trump are, for the moment at least, on the same side.Mr. Trump\u2019s broader argument is that a generation of unfair economic relations with China (and also Mexico, Japan and others) is a primary cause of the troubles of American workers.Mainstream economists are more sympathetic to this view now than they were even a few years ago. Traditional trade theory holds that the losers from global trade \u2014 factory workers who lose their jobs when that factory moves overseas \u2014 are more than compensated by other opportunities created by a more efficient economy.That said, it\u2019s easy to assign too much of the blame for the collapse of manufacturing employment to China or trade more broadly. Hundreds of millions of workers across the globe \u2014 many of whom were in dire poverty a generation ago \u2014 have become integrated into the world economy. That\u2019s a lot of competition, all in a short span, for American factory workers.At the same time, factory technology has advanced so that a company can make more stuff with fewer workers. The number of manufacturing workers in the United States has been declining as a share of all jobs nearly continuously since 1943, and the total number of manufacturing jobs peaked in 1979; China\u2019s trade with the United States didn\u2019t really take off until the 1990s.In other words, trade has been an important economic force over the last few decades, and the deepening of the United States\u2019 ties with China is one of the most important developments in global economics of the last generation. But to look at China as the sole force affecting the ups and downs of American workers misses the mark.Advertisement"}

The Federal Police temporarily detained Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva, the former president, for questioning earlier this month in connection with a huge \u2014 and expanding \u2014 graft investigation. President Dilma Rousseff, Mr. da Silva\u2019s handpicked successor, could be next.The corruption scheme under investigation unfurled from 2003 to 2010, during Mr. da Silva\u2019s two terms in office. Prosecutors allege that during that time Brazil\u2019s biggest construction firms; the state-controlled oil giant, Petrobras; and the country\u2019s political leaders traded bribes, padded contracts and political support in a vast, mutually beneficial scheme.So far, Ms. Rousseff has remained on the sidelines, but she is the one to watch. Over the past several weeks, the inquiry has gotten dangerously close to the president. She has let it run without interference. The danger is that now, with the investigation tugging at the bases of Brazil\u2019s power structures, she will be tempted to step in.Ms. Rousseff has reasons to worry. As Mr. da Silva\u2019s appointee, she was chairwoman of the board of directors at Petrobras, the center of this web of corruption. Key figures in her inner circle are toppling and could take her down with them.Corruption has been endemic in Brazilian politics for decades. An investigation as serious and far-reaching as this one is new for the country. For that reason, it is also inspiring.Because this investigation has remained independent and unafraid to go after the country\u2019s most powerful politicians, it has emerged not as a tool for coup-mongers, as some have charged, but as evidence of the country\u2019s maturing democracy. Despite the headlines and the scandals, Brazil is now a place where the law applies to all, equally. Ms. Rousseff should recognize that this is worth preserving \u2014 even if it costs her the presidency.Juliana Barbassa is the author of \u201cDancing With the Devil in the City of God: Rio de Janeiro on the Brink.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Donald Trump Is Finally Uniting Top Republican Donors \u2014 Against Him", "Date": "2016-03-20", "News": "Supported byThe prospect of a Donald J. Trump nomination is accomplishing what a diverse and talented field of Republican presidential contenders could not: uniting the party\u2019s big-money donor establishment.Some of the wealthiest conservative givers in the country are helping pay for a series of last-ditch attacks to wound Mr. Trump, disclosures filed on Sunday night revealed, even after previously backing rival Republican candidates. And officials involved with the political groups have made clear that they are aggressively raising more money to fight Mr. Trump, hoping to deprive him of enough delegates to win the Republican nomination outright. That would set the stage for a contested convention in July.Our Principles PAC, a group set up to highlight Mr. Trump\u2019s past liberal positions, took in $4.8 million last month, with a roster of donors that shows it has significantly expanded beyond the Ricketts family, which provided the group\u2019s early funding.The stream of new money confirms that the Republican Party\u2019s financial elite \u2014 who put hundreds of millions of dollars behind more conventional presidential candidates, only to watch almost all of them falter \u2014 believes that a focused and well-financed attack campaign could still halt Mr. Trump in his march toward the party\u2019s nomination.\u201cYou have all these people who backed different candidates, and now they are uniting,\u201d said Brian Baker, a political adviser to the Ricketts family. \u201cThese are people who backed Senator Cruz, Governor Kasich, Governor Christie, Senator Rubio \u2014 all stripes. And they are all conservatives.\u201dMr. Stephens and his brother also gave $2.5 million last month to a super PAC connected to the Club for Growth, a free-market activist group that was one of the first outside organizations to take on Mr. Trump. All told, the group, whose members met last week to discuss how to escalate their efforts against Mr. Trump, raised $4 million in February, three times as much as it had raised any other month this election cycle.An interactive delegate calculator that lets you simulate how the 2016 Republican nomination could unfold.Richard Uihlein, an Illinois shipping-supplies manufacturer and conservative activist, who backed Gov. Scott Walker\u2019s campaign last year, gave the Club for Growth $500,000. Several other donors with ties to Republican also-rans gave large contributions as well, including Richard Gaby, who gave $50,000 to a super PAC backing former Gov. Bobby Jindal of Louisiana, and Robert Arnott, a California-based investor who has poured hundreds of thousands of dollars into groups backing Senator Ted Cruz of Texas. In January, the group also raised $100,000 checks from other prominent donors allied with Mr. Trump\u2019s rivals, among them Robert Mercer, a longtime Club for Growth donor who is backing Mr. Cruz.Some of the new money is coming from donors to the political network led by Charles G. and David H. Koch. Their network, the biggest and deepest-pocketed independent political force in the conservative world, has for months weighed intervening in the Republican primary against Mr. Trump. But some of their donors have come off the fence: Those backing Our Principles include Stan Hubbard, a Minnesota radio and television station owner, and Tom Rastin, an executive at an Ohio-based firm that manufactures hydrofracking equipment.Mr. Rastin also contributed $300,000 to an independent group backing Gov. John Kasich of Ohio.A hint of how much more money the anti-Trump groups may be able to raise going forward could be found in disclosures filed Sunday night by Conservative Solutions, a super PAC that backed Mr. Rubio until he dropped out of the race on March 15.In February, as Mr. Trump began racking up critical victories in early primary states, prominent donors poured $25 million into Conservative Solutions, a huge amount for a single month. Its top contributors included Leonard Blavatnik, a Russian-born, London-based American investor whose holdings include Warner Music; Ronnie Cameron, an Arkansas poultry magnate who previously backed Mike Huckabee; and companies linked to Maurice Greenberg, the insurance executive and prominent Republican donor.Figures reported on Sunday now suggest that Mr. Cruz is the sole remaining Republican candidate with the financial wherewithal to challenge Mr. Trump. Mr. Cruz raised $11.9 million in February and, despite burning through $17.5 million over the course of the month, began March with $8 million in cash on hand. He also continued to raise substantial amounts of money from small donors, who can give repeatedly without hitting the contribution limit of $2,700. And a constellation of super PACs backing Mr. Cruz began March with more than $20 million in cash on hand.Mr. Trump reported raising and spending about $9 million during the month, most of it money he lent to his campaign. Mr. Kasich reported having just $1.3 million in cash on hand at the beginning of March.Sarah Cohen contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Apps That Make Saving as Effortless as Spending", "Date": "2016-03-25", "News": "Supported bySpecial SectionA new crop of electronic financial tools is trying to help Americans save.The fledgling apps are appealing to consumers like Brittney Gould, a 28-year-old retirement plan consultant in Rockville, Md. Ms. Gould dutifully maximizes automatic paycheck deductions to fund her own workplace 401(k) account. But for shorter-term savings, she uses the mobile app Qapital that lets users set multiple savings goals and have cash transferred into savings, based on rules the user sets.Users can, for instance, tell the app to save $5 every time they buy a latte.Ms. Gould likes being able to customize her account. When she peeks at her iPhone to see how much she has accumulated for pet expenses, she sees a photo of her dog. \u201cIt\u2019s more motivating, and meaningful,\u201d she said. Since she began using the app last June, she has saved about $5,000.Qapital, along with apps like Digit, Dyme, Acorns and many others, strive to use mobile technology to make saving easy and automatic. Aiming mainly at a young clientele, the new tools offer an updated take on traditional, somewhat stodgy savings advice \u2014 start small, contribute regularly and take satisfaction as your balance grows \u2014 in an effort to make saving fun.Americans are generally lackluster savers. Forty-one percent of households lack liquid savings to cover an unexpected $2,000 expense, according to research from the Pew Charitable Trusts, which also found that a lack of saving is a top financial worry, even among families with higher incomes.\u201cThe vast majority of people need to save more, and some should save much more,\u201d said Dan Ariely, a psychologist and behavioral economist at Duke University and the head of CommonCents Lab, which collaborates with Qapital and other financial tools to identify effective saving strategies. (Mr. Ariely was named chief behavioral economist at Qapital in October, and owns shares in the company).Why is it so hard to save? For one thing, our consumer culture is designed to encourage spending. \u201cEvery coffee shop,\u201d he said, \u201cwants you to buy another cup of coffee.\u201dTechnology has also helped make spending \u201cfrictionless,\u201d he said. Think of the convenience of using Uber: With the tap of a phone, a car ride appears.The new tools aim to reverse that pattern, by using technology to make saving as effortless as spending.Paula Pant, 32, a personal finance and real estate blogger in Las Vegas, has used Digit for about a year. \u201cIt pulls tiny amounts that you\u2019re not going to miss,\u201d she said. \u201cYou just let it hum in the background.\u201d After just a few months, she said, she had saved $814.The apps also use humor. Dyme\u2019s texts use \u201cpersonas\u201d like \u201cTerrible Parent\u201d (\u201cWhy can\u2019t you be more like your sister? Text to save $20. Because I said so.\u201d)The apps are not banks themselves, but act as a financial go-between, ferrying funds between the customer\u2019s checking account and a separate account at an actual financial institution, so the funds are F.D.I.C.-insured. One exception is Acorns, which puts money into investments.The apps are not without drawbacks, however. Perhaps the biggest hurdle for some consumers is that the tools, like many popular online budgeting tools, require users to share their checking account numbers and passwords, in order to link the account with the app so it can withdraw funds.Some apps go beyond simple savings and transfer funds into investment accounts, where there is some risk of losing money. Acorns invests the \u201cspare change\u201d from rounding up purchases in fractional shares in low-cost index exchange-traded funds, investments that are similar to mutual funds but trade like stocks. The tool recommends one of five portfolios, depending on their risk tolerance, and rebalances the investments periodically. (While other so-called robo advisers offer many more investment choices, Jeff Cruttenden, co-founder of Acorns, said Acorns offers fewer options by design, so users are not overwhelmed by choice.)Investing small amounts is less intimidating than investing a large lump sum, said Mr. Cruttenden. \u201cStarting with their change is approachable.\u201dWhile the strictly savings apps are free, Acorns charges monthly fees. The basic charge for Acorns accounts with balances of less than $5,000 is one dollar a month. Accounts with more than $5,000 pay 0.25 percent of the balance a year..Jonathan Jansenius, a 23-year-old state worker in Panama City, Fla., said he and his husband used Acorns to save for college for their two young children. \u201cWe have a regular savings account,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I\u2019d never put any money in it.\u201dBecause Acorns transfers small sums, he said, it fosters savings \u201cwithout feeling like it\u2019s taking more out of my paycheck.\u201d After about 18 months, their account has about $900. \u201cI\u2019m not an expert,\u201d he said, \u201c so it\u2019s an entrance into the market.\u201dWhat about the conventional wisdom that it\u2019s best to save first and invest only after establishing a substantial cushion? \u201cAbsolutely, people should save before they invest,\u201d Mr. Cruttenden said. \u201cBut if it helps them save when they otherwise wouldn\u2019t have, that\u2019s very powerful.\u201dIt is not known how successful the apps are in helping people save in the long term. Most of the emerging savings apps lack a clear current revenue source, and rely on start-up capital to fund operations. Qapital, for one, eventually plans to offer a debit card, so users can access their savings directly; the app would earn a share of the fees that the payment networks charge retailers for processing debit purchases.Ann Carrns is a freelance writer who covers personal finance for The New York Times.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "As India Collaborates With Japan on Islands, It Looks to Check China", "Date": "2016-03-11", "News": "Supported byBut the collaboration signals a significant policy shift for India, which has not previously accepted offers of foreign investment in the archipelago. The Andaman and Nicobar Islands are northwest of the Strait of Malacca, offering control of a so-called choke point that is one of China\u2019s greatest marine vulnerabilities.It is testimony to the unfolding relationship between India and Japan, which is also funding a $744 million road building project in the northeastern Indian border regions of Mizoram, Assam and Meghalaya. Like the Andaman and Nicobar chain, the northeastern region is a strategic area that has remained relatively undeveloped because of its separation from the mainland.A senior Indian official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations, said that China\u2019s project would be answered by \u201ca more decentralized, local but organic response.\u201dThe official described proposed infrastructure projects in the Andamans as \u201cnot of a big scale, and not of a big value,\u201d but added that New Delhi was intent on developing its \u201cfrontier\u201d regions.\u201cThe idea that the frontier should be left undeveloped, I think people have rejected that approach,\u201d the official said. \u201cThere is a realization that it doesn\u2019t help to leave part of any part of India undeveloped.\u201dJapan\u2019s vision for contributions in the island chain goes far beyond the proposed power plant. The plan was submitted in Tokyo more than a year after Japan\u2019s ambassador made a visit to Port Blair on South Andaman Island and, in a meeting with the territory\u2019s top official, offered financing for \u201cbridges and ports.\u201dAkio Isomata, minister for economic affairs in the Japanese Embassy, said the country\u2019s aid agency, Japan International Cooperation Agency, could only respond to \u201cformal requests\u201d from the Indian government.\u201cWe usually start with small projects and go bigger,\u201d he said.He said construction of the power station could start in the next fiscal year, which begins in April.The Andaman and Nicobar chain is made up of 572 islands, a vast majority of them uninhabited, stretching around 470 miles north to south.Used as a penal colony by the British Raj, the island chain was occupied by Japan for three years during World War II, a period that older islanders recall with dread. Jawaharlal Nehru, the prime minister of India at the time, secured the archipelago for his country in the distribution of property that accompanied the British withdrawal from the subcontinent, beating out bids by Australia and Pakistan.The islands\u2019 importance has increased along with China\u2019s naval expansion. The chain\u2019s location makes it an ideal base for tracking naval movements in the Strait of Malacca, a long, narrow funnel between Malaysia and Indonesia. The strait provides passage for China\u2019s fuel imports from Africa and the Middle East, around 80 percent of its total fuel imports.Nevertheless, change has come slowly to the islands, where almost all the undeveloped land is set aside for indigenous tribes and wildlife. A plan to lay undersea optical fiber cable from Chennai on India\u2019s east coast, so that residents can finally have high-speed Internet access, has been under discussion for more than a decade. Until last year, no flights landed after dark because there were no runway lights at the Port Blair airport.Defense analysts from the West regard the island chain with envy and a degree of confusion.\u201cAlmost every year, I see some senior Indian military official say we have major, major plans in store for the Andamans, and you\u2019re going to see them soon,\u201d said Jeff M. Smith, author of \u201cCold Peace,\u201d a book on the Chinese-Indian rivalry. \u201cEverybody waits for the big story to hit on the Andamans, year after year, and it doesn\u2019t happen.\u201dA decision to accept Japanese investment there, he said, \u201cwould be a sign that the Modi government is getting out of this feedback loop and moving on some of these aspirations.\u201dAirstrips at the northern and southern tips of the archipelago are being lengthened to accommodate the long-range surveillance planes.Japan is hardly the only country interested in taking a role in developing the island chain. India and the United States are said to be close to concluding a maritime logistics agreement, meaning that American ships might be allowed to make port calls in the Andaman and Nicobar Islands in the future, defense analysts say.The chain\u2019s location provides a \u201cperfect geographic position\u201d for maritime aerial surveillance, said Rory Medcalf, head of the National Security College at Australian National University.\u201cIf India were more open to allowing friendly foreign countries access and awareness in the Andamans, it would find them more forthcoming as well,\u201d he said.In Port Blair, there is the feeling that the outside world, once distant, is drawing nearer.The front page of the Andaman Express, a daily newspaper, is typically devoted to small-town news, like motorcycle accidents and stove explosions. But a report last fall on the rumored presence of a Chinese naval submarine in Andaman waters mentioned, almost as an aside, that the archipelago \u201cwould become the primary target of the People\u2019s Liberation Army if China and India go to war.\u201dTalk like that has brought an edge of apprehension to the quiet life on the island, said R. V. R. Murthy, a professor of history at Mahatma Gandhi Government College. Mr. Murthy lives on a hilltop, and in January, when officials in New Delhi announced the positioning of aerial drones at Port Blair\u2019s airport, he could peer down from his house and spot them.\u201cIn the old days,\u201d he said, a little wistfully, \u201cthis was the safest place in the world.\u201dHari Kumar contributed reporting from Port Blair, and Makiko Inoue from Tokyo.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Marriott Raises Bid for Starwood", "Date": "2016-03-21", "News": "Supported byMarriott International sweetened its bid for Starwood Hotels and Resorts Worldwide with more cash, greater synergies and a higher breakup fee. That still may not be enough to deter the Anbang Insurance Group of China and its co-investors from making a counteroffer \u2014 yet again.Last week\u2019s offer by the Chinese consortium of $78 a share, would be worth about $13.2 billion.Marriott\u2019s proposed deal may not be on the table for long. The Chinese insurer and its co-investors may come back with another offer, analysts say, as they seek to diversify outside of China by buying assets in the United States. Morningstar said Anbang and its private equity partners would have to offer around $86 a share to be competitive with Marriott\u2019s latest proposal.The structure of the new bid does not do much to deter a rival suitor, analysts said. Starwood agreed to increase the value of the breakup fee payable to Marriott to only $450 million from the $400 million from the original agreement. Starwood also agreed to reimburse Marriott for its financing-related costs, up to $18 million.\u201cThe breakup fee leaves the door open,\u201d said Dan Wasiolek, an analyst at Morningstar, in a phone interview. \u201cStarwood, that\u2019s what they have to do on behalf of their shareholders, is leave the door open the best they can until the process is complete.\u201dOn CNBC, Mr. Sorenson said that he did not tell Starwood that Monday\u2019s offer was the final one. But Marriott does not have much room to stretch.It is unable to offer much more cash because it wants to keep its investment-grade rating, said Mr. Wasiolek of Morningstar. It can increase its bid a little bit, but it is going to have to come from equity, he said. This is close to the final offer, he said.\u201cWe\u2019re in overtime in the March Madness competition here for the Starwood title, with a minute or two left on the clock,\u201d Mr. Wasiolek said.A representative for the Chinese consortium declined to comment on Marriott\u2019s revised bid.Shares of Starwood gained 4.5 percent on Wednesday to $84.19. Marriott shares declined 1.2 percent to $72.30.Traders are accounting for the additional value Starwood shareholders will receive from the previously announced spinoff of its time share business, which is to be merged with the Interval Leisure Group. That deal is worth about $5.83 a Starwood share, based on Friday\u2019s close. Accounting for both the spinoff and the Marriott offer, Starwood shareholders would be looking at a value of $85.36.Over the weekend, Starwood signed up to manage two hotels in Cuba, becoming the first American company to do so in more 50 years. Mr. Sorenson was also in Cuba on Monday, alongside President Obama on his historic visit. It was there that he took the conference call with analysts to discuss the deal on Monday, and was met with a unique set of technical difficulties, as the line kept cutting out.Marriott is the best long-term partner for Starwood, Harry C. Curtis, an analyst at Nomura, wrote in a note on Monday. If they go through with the transaction, the combined company will have the \u201clargest hotel platform, which should help it capture more market share, as loyalty program conscious travelers are drawn to the most flexible and broadest system,\u201d he said.Marriott said that it expected to achieve $250 million in annual cost savings two years after closing, compared with the $200 million in savings it had estimated in the original merger agreement.The combination of Marriott and Starwood has received the major regulatory approvals, but the companies must still obtain shareholder approvals. If the companies receive enough votes, they expect the deal to close in the middle of this year. Starwood shareholders would own about 34 percent of the combined company.Lazard and Citigroup are providing financial advice to Starwood, while Deutsche Bank is advising Marriott.

Workers there typically earn about $19 a day \u2014 less than what many on the assembly line here make in an hour. As boos and curses erupt from the crowd, the executive says, \u201cPlease quiet down.\u201dWhat came next was nothing of the kind.Within hours of being posted on Facebook, the video went viral. Three days after Carrier\u2019s Feb. 10 announcement, Donald J. Trump seized on the video in a Republican presidential debate and made Carrier\u2019s move to Mexico a centerpiece of his stump speeches attacking free trade.Jennifer Shanklin-Hawkins is one of those Carrier workers who listened to the announcement on the factory floor. After 14 years on the assembly line, she earns $21.22 an hour, enough to put her oldest son through college while raising two other children with her husband, a truck driver.And when she saw Mr. Trump talking about Carrier on the news, all she could do was shout \u201cYessss!\u201d at the TV. \u201cI loved it,\u201d she said. \u201cI was so happy Trump noticed us.\u201dIn living rooms and barrooms across Indianapolis, conversations with Carrier workers like Ms. Shanklin-Hawkins crystallize what has become an extraordinary moment in the American political and economic debate. As both political parties belatedly recognize the anxiety and deep-seated anger of blue-collar workers nationwide, the more-trade-is-good bipartisan consensus that has long held sway in Washington is being sundered.What isn\u2019t evident in the video \u2014 or in the furious debate it has spawned \u2014 is that both the company and its soon-to-be former employees are reacting to the same transformative quarter-century of American economic policy aimed at lowering trade barriers and staying globally competitive.\u201cWe have to look around the corner and see how this market will change in order to invest and stay in business for another 100 years,\u201d said Robert McDonough, a senior executive at Carrier\u2019s parent company, United Technologies. \u201cYou can blink and see your market position erode.\u201dThe rub is that the costs and benefits aren\u2019t distributed equally. Global trade has produced big gains for Americans, like more affordable goods \u2014 clothes, computers, even air-conditioners \u2014 and led to a more advanced economy.At the same time, a chronic trade deficit and an overvalued dollar have caused factory jobs to dry up, contributing to a deep divide between the political and economic elite and the rest of the nation. Perhaps a clash was inevitable.Consider the case of Ms. Shanklin-Hawkins. While she says she won\u2019t be voting for Mr. Trump and considers him a racist, she applauds his message on trade. She says she plans to vote for Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, who similarly blasts free trade, but from the left. The two populist candidates may be political opposites, but when it comes to the downside of globalization, Mr. Sanders and Mr. Trump are speaking to her with one voice.In fact, many Carrier workers here say that it was not so much Mr. Trump\u2019s nativist talk on illegal immigrants or his anti-Muslim statements that has fired them up. Instead, it was hearing a leading presidential candidate acknowledging just how much economic ground they\u2019ve lost \u2014 and promising to do something about it.Mr. Trump has repudiated decades of G.O.P. support for free trade, calling for heavy tariffs on Mexican-made goods from the likes of Carrier. This has helped put him within arm\u2019s reach of the Republican nomination.Opposition to trade deals has also galvanized supporters of Mr. Sanders, helping him unexpectedly win the Michigan Democratic primary this month. At the same time, it has forced his rival Hillary Clinton to distance herself from trade agreements she once supported, like the proposed 12-nation Trans-Pacific Partnership and the North American Free Trade Agreement, the 1994 deal with Mexico that is an important part of President Bill Clinton\u2019s political legacy.Exit polls after the Michigan primary , for example, showed that a clear majority of both Republican and Democratic voters believe international trade costs the American economy more jobs than it creates.Nicole Hargrove, a 14-year Carrier worker, said she was an undecided voter and was uncomfortable with Mr. Trump\u2019s attacks on immigrants, particularly Mexicans. \u201cBut I\u2019d like to turn him loose on the financial world,\u201d she said. \u201cMaybe if Carrier had to pay more to bring stuff in, they\u2019d think twice about moving jobs out.\u201dMark Weddle, 55, started work at Carrier 24 years ago and earns $21 an hour running a machine that makes heat exchangers. \u201cI have two brothers-in-law from Mexico,\u201d he said, explaining why he disagrees with Mr. Trump\u2019s anti-immigrant stance.But when it comes to Carrier, \u201cwe\u2019ve all worked our butts off,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd now they\u2019re going to throw us under the bus? If Trump will kick Carrier\u2019s ass, then I\u2019ll vote for him.\u201dThat\u2019s pretty much what Mr. Trump has threatened to do. At rally after rally, to rapturous crowds, he vows to impose a 35 percent tax on Carrier products from Mexico. Then, the laugh line: \u201cI want to do this myself, but it is so unpresidential to call up Carrier.\u201dAnd Mr. Trump vows not to take Carrier\u2019s calls until it agrees to change course. \u201cAs sure as you\u2019re here, they will call me up within 24 hours,\u201d he promises, and say to him, \u201c\u2018Sir, we\u2019ve decided to stay in the United States.\u2019\u201dIt is powerful talk.The relentless loss of American manufacturing jobs, however, goes back nearly half a century, driven largely by forces beyond the control of any president. The advances of technology, the diffusion of industrial expertise around the world, the availability of cheap labor and the rise of China as a manufacturing powerhouse would have disrupted the nation\u2019s industrial heartland even without new trade deals.Nor are tariffs likely to bring many of these jobs back, said David Autor, a professor of economics at M.I.T., who is one of the country\u2019s foremost specialists on the pluses and minuses of free trade. \u201cWe don\u2019t have silver bullets,\u201d he said.\u201cWhen I learned about the impact of trade agreements, the theory was that workers would be \u2018released\u2019 into the labor market and hired back at slightly lower salaries,\u201d Mr. Autor said. \u201cThat\u2019s not what happened. And no amount of cheaper air-conditioners will make these workers whole.\u201dOn a rainy Thursday afternoon this month, after their 6 a.m.-to-4:30 p.m. shift, a dozen Carrier workers gathered at Sully\u2019s Bar & Grill to talk about the decades they had spent at the low-slung, beige-and-white factory across the street.The group was diverse: black and white, male and female, old and young. And until the announcement of the eventual shutdown, most of them said they had loved working for Carrier, assembling furnaces and fan coils, hard as the work could be.The workers in the Indianapolis factory are represented by the United Steelworkers union. As has been the case in the auto industry, the union agreed in 2011 to a two-tier wage system in which new hires were paid less than veteran employees.\u201cI\u2019m more skilled with my hands than I am with my brain,\u201d said Robin Maynard, half joking. He holds two associate degrees, oversees a team of 15 and has worked at Carrier almost 24 years. \u201cBut I like working with my hands.\u201dMs. Shanklin-Hawkins emphasized that she, too, enjoyed her work, despite having little flexibility when it came to setting hours. \u201cI missed football games, graduations, you name it,\u201d she said.Her shifts can run 10 hours a day, six days in a row during summer and fall, when her line is busy, and mandatory overtime can total 20 hours a week. The pay, benefits and pension plan are all good, but it wasn\u2019t just the money that kept her on the assembly line, Ms. Shanklin-Hawkins said.\u201cIt\u2019s pretty cool working there,\u201d she said, describing how she carefully puts together \u201ctubular mixers,\u201d batches of rods that control the air flow in Carrier furnaces. \u201cAnd when you do it for 60 hours a week, people are like family.\u201dIt is painstaking work: Bend the rods, or force them into place, and the line can come to a halt, prompting a tongue-lashing from a supervisor. Despite that, like many of the 12 million American factory workers, Ms. Shanklin-Hawkins says the nation\u2019s leaders have simply lost respect for people who make things.\u201cThey didn\u2019t even thank us for our work,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was wrong.\u201dIndianapolis is far better off than many other cities in and around the Rust Belt. For the most part, it has successfully made the transition to an economy powered by services like health care, logistics and banking. The city\u2019s unemployment rate is 4.6 percent, below the national average of 4.9 percent.But many of the new jobs don\u2019t pay nearly as well as Carrier does. Next to the 49-year-old Carrier plant is an Amazon warehouse that opened in 2011, but with salaries there averaging just over $15 an hour, that\u2019s a lot less than the $20 or more an hour Carrier workers typically earn.Indiana politicians, who granted Carrier tax breaks and other incentives, are furious at the company and want their money back. They are also angry because Carrier\u2019s parent, United Technologies, is a major military contractor that receives $5.6 billion annually from the federal government.\u201cThat\u2019s financed by the taxpayers they just fired,\u201d said Senator Joe Donnelly, Democrat of Indiana. \u201cThey are trying to be the ultimate free rider.\u201dCarrier has said it will return public money in cases where the company has not kept its commitments to invest. But that\u2019s small change for United Technologies, a company with sales of $56 billion annually, more than Walt Disney, Coca-Cola or Goldman Sachs. And, in any case, it won\u2019t bring the jobs back.Carol Bigbee, 59, has worked at Carrier for 13 years. Her 32-year-old daughter has a college degree and the kind of job that many economists say is the future in postindustrial America \u2014 she works in a medical lab. The only problem, Ms. Bigbee said, is that her daughter\u2019s hourly pay is one-third less than her own pay at Carrier.\u201cI think it will be extremely hard to find a job that pays $22 an hour,\u201d Ms. Bigbee said. \u201cYou have to be really blessed to find a job that pays that kind of money.\u201d The few manufacturing jobs left require math tests, something she says she worries she could not pass.The first layoffs won\u2019t begin until 2017, and the final shuttering of the factory isn\u2019t expected to happen until 2019, giving employees time to prepare. In addition, United Technologies has offered to cover the cost of at least four years of additional schooling for Carrier workers. But that\u2019s cold comfort to people who can\u2019t afford not to work or those, like Ms. Bigbee, who are near retirement.She will be 60 in May, making retraining impractical. \u201cIf I were in my 40s, I\u2019d go back to school,\u201d she said.As Ms. Bigbee and her co-workers were talking over beers and Tequila Sunrises at Sully\u2019s in Indianapolis, executives from United Technologies were hosting a gathering of their own in New York City \u2014 at the Plaza Hotel, a property that was once owned, as it happens, by Donald Trump.That meeting was part of \u201cinvestor day,\u201d an annual ritual for many Fortune 500 companies in which management sits down with analysts and shareholders and tells them why their company\u2019s stock is a good buy. Carrier\u2019s message: Moving jobs south of the border is a major part of the company\u2019s strategy to increase profits.Manufacturing products in lower-cost locales isn\u2019t new for Carrier, which has had operations in Monterrey, Mexico, since 1969, decades before Nafta\u2019s passage.But Akhil Johri, the chief financial officer, noted that recent factory consolidation was among the reasons Carrier\u2019s management is eyeing a list of targets for future cuts. \u201cThey are painful\u201d but are necessary \u201cfor the long-term, competitive nature of the business and shareholder value creation,\u201d he said. \u201cWe feel good about being able to execute on that.\u201dUnited Technologies faces pressure from investors hungry for earnings growth in an economy that\u2019s only modestly growing at home, and falling in important overseas markets like China and the Middle East. Although the company\u2019s stock has vastly outperformed benchmarks in the last few decades, the shares have badly trailed the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index over the most recent five years.Wall Street is looking for United Technologies to post a 17 percent increase in earnings per share over the next two years, even though sales are expected to rise only 8 percent. Bridging that gap means cutting costs wherever savings can be found, as Mr. McDonough suggested at the meeting with analysts.Still he rejected the notion that pressure from Wall Street, or corporate greed, or even trade policy, had prompted the factory move to Monterrey. \u201cThis was a really tough decision,\u201d he said. \u201cThis will have a real impact on folks we care about and this community. We\u2019re an American company, but we compete globally.\u201dStaying competitive, raising profits and investing are among the reasons 400 white-collar jobs in areas like engineering and marketing will remain in Indiana.\u201cOur company, with American workers,\u201d he added, \u201cbuilds a heck of a lot of stuff in the U.S.\u201dLess than a three-hour drive south of Laredo, Tex., where the mountains meet the desert scrub near Monterrey, lies one industrial park after another. That\u2019s where Carrier and many other American manufacturers have built gleaming factories.Outside Carrier\u2019s plant on Hermenegildo Galeana Street in the suburb of Santa Catarina, a worker named Antonio Arroyo has nothing but positive things to say about his job, much like his colleagues in Indianapolis until last month. \u201cThe atmosphere is relaxed, a healthy environment,\u201d he said. \u201cEven the temporary workers are constantly trained.\u201dAs in the United States, the day shift starts around 6 a.m. and finishes about 4 p.m., with a break for lunch. Temporary workers, who have contracts lasting from three to six months, earn 163 pesos a day, or $9.40. Permanent workers make 330 pesos for a day\u2019s work, or $19.Hourly salaries in Indianapolis range from $15 to $26 an hour, as they do up the road in Huntington, Ind., where an additional 700 United Technologies jobs will be transferred to Mexico as well.United Technologies is not hurting like the American automakers or steel giants who lost billions when they were caught short by up-and-coming Japanese and South Korean competitors in the 1970s and 1980s. But the company says it fears it could end up in a similar situation if it doesn\u2019t make sure it is among the most efficient manufacturers in the world.Over all, United Technologies earned nearly $7.6 billion last year, and $2.9 billion of that came from the climate, controls and security division that includes Carrier. Those profits aren\u2019t under pressure; in fact, margins in the unit have steadily expanded in recent years.But that\u2019s not good enough, said Howard Rubel, a senior analyst at Jefferies, who notes that United Technologies has vowed to cut at least a half-billion dollars in costs annually for the next few years. \u201cThe stock hasn\u2019t done well,\u201d Mr. Rubel pointed out.United Technologies\u2019 board cut the bonus of its chief executive, Gregory J. Hayes, by nearly half for 2015. Still, with a total compensation package of $5.7 million, he made more last year than Carrier\u2019s factory workers could earn in several lifetimes. But in corporate boardrooms and country clubs, that\u2019s not the point.\u201cIt\u2019s embarrassing,\u201d said Mr. Rubel. \u201cThe stock didn\u2019t do well, and he got dinged. And whether it\u2019s the board or personal pride, no one wants that.\u201dBack in Indiana, smaller bonuses for top executives are the last thing state Representative Karlee Macer wants to hear about these days. Her district includes the Carrier plant, and for all their grit and noise and physical strain, manufacturing jobs aren\u2019t like many other positions available to Americans who lack a college degree, she said. For one thing, they pay more, giving the children of factory workers other options if they so choose.\u201cMy family has all been factory workers, including my grandmother, who came home with burn marks from welding,\u201d she said over breakfast across the street from the Indiana Statehouse. \u201cIs everybody who is not a white-collar worker supposed to earn $12 an hour?\u201dJuan Zertuche contributed reporting from Monterrey, Mexico.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "A Charity-Minded Lemonade Stand Meets Silicon Valley Churn", "Date": "2016-03-08", "News": "Supported byDeal ProfessorIf you think starting a social network business is hard, try selling lemonade.This was one of the many things I learned while catching up with Eric Harr and his attempts to turn his daughter Vivienne\u2019s social media stardom into a social purpose, for-profit business.Make a Stand\u2019s for-profit orientation raised interesting issues about the intersection of a for-profit company and charity. Was it O.K. for a company to have a charitable purpose and also to profit? Here, Make a Stand was building on new thinking put forth in a popular TED talk by Dan Pallotta, founder of the AIDS Ride \u2014that the nonprofit world was starving itself, and instead should encourage innovation and development, and, yes, even profit.Whatever your opinion of their idea, Mr. Harr and Vivienne exuded optimism and energy in those early days. They were going to change the world, an \u201cincredible journey\u201d as Mr. Harr put it.A year would pass before I caught up with the Harrs, and their enthusiasm remained. Vivienne was still the showpiece, still wearing princess dresses and, as Mr. Harr said, still his boss. She had met the Dalai Lama and traveled the country for her cause, writing a children\u2019s book for good measure.Fast-forward a year later to today. I wanted to catch up with Eric Harr. Before I did, I looked online. The website for the lemonade business was dark and the Facebook page had stopped being updated in December.The app business seemed to have taken a hiatus. It had begun in fall 2014 but then quickly went silent. However, it was started this year for another round of beta testing. The company had now been renamed simply Stand (stand.tc).I downloaded the app. There seemed to be a measure of activity, with people creating new stands, as they were called, crowdfunding for animals and other social causes. There was no huge explosion of posts, though, and only a steady flow of a few stands every day.Vivienne was still involved, was part of the Clinton Global Initiative and speaking at events on behalf of the business. Vivienne\u2019s 6-year-old brother had even helped out, starting a $6,500 stand for \u201cHeforshe,\u201d the United Nations\u2019 push to support women.There were some other signs that all was not well. I looked up Mr. Harr\u2019s Twitter feed, and between his nonstop promotion of new stands were phrases that entrepreneurs rely upon, like this one from the other week: \u201cFounders: as you go through the @bhorowitz \u2018struggle\u2019 \u2014 and you will \u2014 the key is to find your sense of grace and composure and lean into it.\u201d A Not Eric Harr account had popped up on Twitter, attacking him and Stand at every opportunity.So I contacted Mr. Harr and got the update. Stand continued to prosper, he said, raising close to $3 million in funding and growing to a team of 12 employees. Mr. Stone had even agreed to be chairman of the board.Mr. Harr was still filled with enthusiasm, but there was some weariness in his voice and a frankness I had not seen before. There had been some \u201creally dark times\u201d and \u201cdeep challenges\u201d as the product had not become an instant hit. Attracting users remained challenging because fund-raising apps are \u201ca dime a dozen.\u201d Mr. Harr put his best face on it: They had validated their concept, had hosted over a thousand \u201cstands\u201d and had raised thousands of dollars for charity.The lemonade business appeared to be doing much worse. When I asked about the nonfunctioning website, Mr. Harr told me the business was on hiatus, seeking funds. He hadn\u2019t been involved in over two years. He had handed off the business to \u201cfolks we trusted\u201d with \u201cexperience\u201d but \u201chired guns may not have been the best thing\u201d over a founder. It seemed that distribution was a problem and that although the lemonade now had four flavors, the social cause of donating 5 percent of revenue to end slavery had not propelled it to success.Mr. Harr simply seemed to have found more comfort in the app world. As he put it, the \u201cthick neck beverage folks feel like bullies\u201d while the web developers like Mr. Stone were the \u201cbullied.\u201d He preferred the \u201ckind and gentle.\u201d Vivienne was still involved but primarily for big rollouts. She is a sixth-grader now, he said.Mr. Harr acknowledged that the app was still trying to find a foothold. Stand was going to try again with a reboot, this time with a focus on what he termed \u201cGeneration Z.\u201d Stand\u2019s research and initial apps had discerned that this younger generation had empathy but also wanted fun and rewards. In addition, the Stand app was \u201ctoo Instagram and not enough Tinder.\u201d The new version of the Stand app, coming in a few weeks, would be for millennials to achieve rewards for altruism and sharing.Mr. Harr gave the example of sourcing your social friends to clean a beach. Stand had teamed with Toms Shoes and others, so once you completed your cause, you would then take a photo and get free Toms shoes and other prizes for your social entrepreneurship. The idea was to have young people compete and everyone would win. The new version of the Stand app would be about making compassion more fun.Mr. Harr\u2019s story is ultimately about venture capital and entrepreneurship. The Facebooks and Ubers are what you talk about, but day in and day out are thousands of other businesses, struggling through \u201cdark times\u201d for a model that can scale up often in a competitive environment where everyone is trying to mimic their ideas. They try and then if they don\u2019t get things right, they try again or run out of cash. And sometimes it works. Twitter, after all, took three years to get off the ground. Other businesses have crashed and burned as they ran out of time. And this is in the Internet world with its low costs and easy scalability. In the real world of selling lemonade, it is even harder to depend on mercurial things like finding a distribution outlet for your product.In the case of Stand, all of this is complicated by the idea of trying to do good while also making a profit. But even the space for giving is crowded with names like Chuffed and Plumfund.The search for success continues for Stand. I wish the Harrs, who seem so sincere in wanting to do good, the best of luck and whatever magical fairy dust is needed to succeed in the roller coaster world of entrepreneurship.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How the G.O.P. Elite Lost Its Voters to Donald Trump", "Date": "2016-03-28", "News": "Supported byThe manufacturing executives had gathered in an Atlanta conference room last year to honor their senior United States senator, Johnny Isakson, for his tireless efforts on their behalf in Washington. But as the luncheon wound down, Mr. Isakson found himself facing a man from Coweta County. The man, Burl Finkelstein, said trade policies with Mexico and China were strangling the family-owned kitchen-parts company he helped manage, and imperiling the jobs it provided. Mr. Isakson politely brushed him off, Mr. Finkelstein recalled, as he had many times before.In dozens of interviews, Republican lawmakers, donors, activists and others described \u2014 some with resignation, some with anger \u2014 a party that paved the way for a Trump-like figure to steal its base, as it lost touch with less affluent voters and misunderstood their growing anguish.\u201cThis is absolutely a crisis for the party elite \u2014 and beyond the party elite, for elected officials, and for the way people have been raised as Republicans in the power structure for a generation,\u201d said Ari Fleischer, who served as press secretary for President George W. Bush. \u201cIf Donald Trump wins, he will change what it means to be a Republican.\u201dMany trace the rupture to the country\u2019s economic crisis eight years ago: While Americans grew more skeptical of the banking industry in the aftermath, some Republicans played down the frustrations of their own voters.\u201cThey have to come to terms with what they created,\u201d said Laura Ingraham, a conservative activist and talk-radio host. \u201cThey\u2019ll talk about everything except the fact that their policies are unpopular.\u201dMost of these voters had long since given up on an increasingly liberal and cosmopolitan Democratic Party. In Mr. Trump, they found a tribune: a blue-collar billionaire who stood in the lobby of a Manhattan skyscraper bearing his name and pledged to expand Social Security, refuse the money of big donors, sock it to Chinese central bankers and relieve Americans of unfair competition from foreign workers.The Democratic Party is also reckoning this year with a populist insurgency, driven in part by economic pain and growing anger against Washington and Wall Street. But while Senator Bernie Sanders trails Hillary Clinton in delegates, Mr. Trump\u2019s unlikely campaign has become a seemingly unstoppable force, one that Republican lawmakers, donors and activists are only now fully confronting.\u201cThe Republican Party is being dramatically transformed,\u201d said Foster Friess, a Wyoming investor and philanthropist who is among the party\u2019s most significant donors. Republicans and Democrats alike, Mr. Friess said, had neglected \u201cthe people who truly make our country work \u2014 the truck drivers, farmers, welders, hospitality workers.\u201dSix years ago, as the 2010 elections neared, everything seemed to be falling into place.Republicans celebrated an impending repudiation of President Obama in congressional races, in which they would eventually pick up 63 seats. On the ninth floor of the storied Beresford apartment building on Central Park West, guests clinked glasses at a fund-raiser for Republican Senate candidates hosted by Paul Singer, the billionaire investor.\u201cThese voters would have loved someone to stand up and say, \u2018We should put someone in jail,\u2019\u201d said Matthew Dowd, former chief strategist to President Bush.Older white voters with little education beyond high school, under enormous economic stress, the Disaffecteds surged to the Republican Party early in Mr. Obama\u2019s first term. But they were as cynical about business as they were about government. They viewed immigrants as a burden and an economic threat. They opposed free trade more than any other group in the country.\u201cThey figured, \u2018These are conservative voters, anti-Obama voters. We\u2019ll give them the same policies we\u2019ve always given them,\u2019\u201d said James Pethokoukis, a fellow at the American Enterprise Institute. \u201cHigh-earner tax cuts, which people are skeptical of; business tax cuts, even though these businesses seem to be doing great. It didn\u2019t resonate with the problems in their lives.\u201dWhen Mr. Romney lost, the Republican National Committee commissioned a detailed review, as did the Kochs and other outside groups. Advisers to the Kochs, finding that Mr. Romney had increased the party\u2019s share of elderly voters, concluded that proposals to overhaul entitlements were not hurting Republicans.The committee\u2019s review made one notable recommendation on policy: The party should \u201cembrace and champion comprehensive immigration reform,\u201d or \u201cour party\u2019s appeal will continue to shrink to its core constituencies only.\u201dBut rank-and-file Republicans had other ideas. For many blue-collar Republicans, anger against Mr. Obama now extended to their own party\u2019s leadership, whom they viewed as not only failing to stand up to Mr. Obama, but also as colluding with him to make their lives worse.They saw illegal immigration not only as a cultural and security threat, but also as an economic one, intertwined with trade deals that had stripped away good manufacturing jobs while immigrants competed for whatever work remained.In 2013 in western New York, one of the last remaining American manufacturers of dinnerware went out of business, adding 110 lost jobs to the Rust Belt toll. Representative Chris Collins, a Republican from the Buffalo area, had been the plant\u2019s majority owner until the previous year, when voters elected him to Congress. His former firm had been undercut by Chinese imports that were a third cheaper, Mr. Collins argued, propped up by Chinese currency manipulation.\u201cI\u2019ve seen what happens when a country is allowed to undersell the U.S.,\u201d said Mr. Collins, who was the first member of Congress to endorse Mr. Trump. \u201cThose jobs were stolen. And the politicians let it happen.\u201dEd McMullen, a public relations executive who worked for the conservative Heritage Foundation in the 1980s, watched the gulf widen between the Washington establishment and the working people in his home state, South Carolina.\u201cThirty years later, the same people are sitting in Washington that I worked with, making a million a year, going to fancy dinner parties, and they\u2019ve done nothing to move the ball,\u201d said Mr. McMullen, who has joined the Trump campaign. \u201cTherein lies the great chasm between the think tanks, the ideologues and the real world.\u201dIn early 2014, a group of neighbors from a Florida mobile home community called Carriage Cove, near Daytona, took seats in a town-hall-style meeting with Representative Ron DeSantis, a Republican. It was a mix of Republicans and Democrats, almost all of them seniors living on fixed incomes.They had come to ask Mr. DeSantis why he had put his name on a letter urging Republican leaders to take up Mr. Obama\u2019s offer of a deal to overhaul Social Security. Mr. DeSantis seemed caught off guard, neighbors who attended the meeting recalled. He did not necessarily agree with everything in the letter, he told them. When they persisted, Mr. DeSantis left, explaining that he was not feeling well.That message helped propel Mr. Brat to victory, though many Republican leaders dismissed his election as a fluke. Elsewhere in the country, with the help of business groups, they tamped down insurgent conservative candidates. That fall, Republicans won control of the Senate \u2014 further confirmation, seemingly, that the party had corrected course.But some remained worried. In August 2014, Kellyanne Conway, a prominent Republican pollster, met with leading Republican donors at a law firm in Chicago. Among the party\u2019s base, immigration remained a simmering issue, one they should seize. Her polling showed \u201ca new open-mindedness to populist approaches, regardless of partisan or ideological preferences,\u201d Ms. Conway wrote in a memo to the party\u2019s donors.The donors responded tepidly, Ms. Conway recalled, and were wary of efforts to curb immigration. \u201cThey said, \u2018We need labor and we need votes.\u2019\u201dLast March, Republican members of the House Ways and Means Committee filed into a Capitol Hill conference room to discuss trade. The Obama administration, negotiating a trade pact with Pacific Rim nations, was seeking congressional approval to fast-track the deal. Opposition was intense not only among labor unions, but among many Republican voters, while the party\u2019s leadership, atypically, was supporting Mr. Obama\u2019s effort.Few issues were now as dangerous to them as trade, Mr. Luntz told the lawmakers, especially a trade pact sought by a president their voters hated. Many Americans did not believe that the economic benefits of trade deals trickled down to their neighborhoods. They did not care if free trade provided them with cheaper socks and cellphones. Most believed free trade benefited other countries, not their own.An interactive delegate calculator that lets you simulate how the 2016 Republican nomination could unfold.\u201cI told them to stop calling it free trade, and start calling it American trade,\u201d Mr. Luntz said in an interview. \u201cAmerican businesses, American services \u2014 American, American, American!\u201dThat message has resonated with lower-income voters, and helped drive Mr. Trump\u2019s string of successes. In Mississippi and Michigan, both of which Mr. Trump won, six in 10 Republican primary voters said that free trade cost the country more jobs that it produced, exit polls showed.But it has done little to convince Republican leaders that they need to rethink their approach or devise new proposals for blue-collar workers who are hurting.Mr. Ryan, who during the same interview called again for the overhaul of entitlements and the reduction of debt, rejected that idea.\u201cPeople don\u2019t think like that,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople want to know the deck is fair. Bernie Sanders talks about that stuff. That\u2019s not who we are.\u201dBut it is no longer so certain what the Republican Party is. This month, as the party\u2019s leading donors met at the Ritz-Carlton in Miami Beach, there was plenty of spirited chatter about Mr. Trump, but less discussion of the voters who fueled his rise, and little about what could be done to assuage them.Haley Barbour, a former party chairman, spoke as women in sundresses and men in dark suits sipped evening cocktails on a patio overlooking the Atlantic. In sometimes subdued tones, he told them that he could not predict what would come next.\u201cWe\u2019re cursed to live in interesting times,\u201d Mr. Barbour said. \u201cAnyone that tells you that they\u2019ve seen anything like this, they\u2019ll lie to you about other things. I don\u2019t know where we\u2019re going to end up.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Shaping Health Policy for Millions, and Still Treating Some on the Side", "Date": "2016-03-29", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 On weekdays, Dr. Patrick H. Conway is one of the most powerful doctors in America, steering federal health programs that spend nearly $1 trillion a year while shaping health policies that affect tens of millions of citizens.On many weekends, he is just another doctor in blue sterile gloves and a yellow gown with a stethoscope around his neck, comforting children and training young physicians, many of whom have no idea of his other role.Doctors and hospital executives have long complained that the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services is out of touch with the real world where care is given. As the Obama administration races to reshape the nation\u2019s disjointed, hugely expensive health care system, those complaints are widespread.But Dr. Conway, the centers\u2019 chief medical officer, is not a bureaucrat removed from the front lines of medicine. He treats patients every few weeks at the Children\u2019s National Medical Center here, in addition to serving as the No. 2 official at the federal agency, which provides health insurance to one-third of all Americans.On a recent Saturday, Dr. Conway, a pediatrician, examined a 5-month-old girl who had a heart defect and pneumonia, a cranky 2-year-old girl whose body was covered with a mysterious rash, and a 17-year-old patient with belly pain and an inflamed pancreas. (The president of the hospital, Dr. Kurt Newman, said he had not known that Dr. Conway worked there until the two encountered each other in an elevator several years ago.)Dr. Conway, 41, has a say in almost every significant or controversial health care policy change contemplated by the Obama administration.And by using financial rewards and penalties, he is trying to nudge doctors and hospitals to provide better, safer, more coordinated care at a lower cost.\u201cOur fee-for-service system is broken,\u201d Dr. Conway said. \u201cIt causes fragmented care. It pays not for outcomes but for outputs. It causes volume-driven care. So the question is, \u2018How do we shift that payment model?\u2019\u00a0\u201dDr. Conway said his experience at the children\u2019s hospital here had contributed directly to changes in federal policy, including a new rule that expanded the role of dietitians. In addition, he said, \u201cusing electronic health records as a physician in practice has informed the way I think about policy, both what\u2019s good and what needs to be improved\u201d \u2014 to ensure that electronic records \u201cdo not disrupt the doctor-patient experience.\u201dSome experts say federal efforts to measure the quality of care, though well intentioned, are out of control.The National Academy of Sciences has expressed concern about the proliferation of quality measures, including nearly 1,700 used by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.Many doctors doubt whether the government can reliably assess their performance. In the second round of incentive payments, announced this month, far more doctors received financial penalties than bonuses.\u201cIt\u2019s like a lottery,\u201d said Anders M. Gilberg, senior vice president of the Medical Group Management Association, referring to the payments. His organization represents physician groups.Despite skepticism or outright resistance from some health care providers, Dr. Conway exudes a boyish enthusiasm for his work.He acknowledges that critics have a point. \u201cWe do want to focus on smaller sets of measures when possible,\u201d he said. He promised that the government would concentrate more on the results of care, not just whether doctors gave the recommended tests and treatments.Consumer advocates like Debra L. Ness, the president of the National Partnership for Women and Families, see Dr. Conway as a kindred spirit who understands what is important to patients. \u201cHe has the experience of being a clinician, a direct provider of health care services, but also has an incredible grasp of the administrative and policy aspects of health care,\u201d Ms. Ness said.Some of that insight comes from firsthand experience. Dr. Conway was expelled from the delivery room when his wife received an epidural injection while giving birth to their fourth child last year.\u201cC.M.S. says you have to leave the room,\u201d said a nurse anesthetist, referring to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. Dr. Conway complied with the request, he said, though he later checked and found that the agency had no such regulation.Dr. Conway was the youngest of four children, and he realized that he liked working with children when he was a camp counselor in his teens. He received his bachelor\u2019s degree at Texas A & M, where his father was a chemistry professor and his mother was an assistant dean at the business school. He went to Baylor College of Medicine and did his residency at Boston Children\u2019s Hospital, where he met his wife, Heather, a pediatric intensive care nurse.In 2007, during the Bush administration, he came to Washington as a White House fellow and worked for Michael O. Leavitt, who was then the secretary of health and human services.\u201cI have no idea whether Patrick is a Republican or a Democrat,\u201d Mr. Leavitt said. \u201cHe came to government not for politics, but for policy.\u201d Voter registration records list the doctor as unaffiliated with any political party.When Dr. Conway speaks to groups of doctors or hospital executives, they often complain that federal rules are rigid and oppressive. But he has a way of disarming critics.After one speech, he recalled, a doctor buttonholed him and said: \u201cI always thought C.M.S. was evil. But you\u2019re not evil. You seem very nice. I could work with you.\u201dHis zeal to improve care is rooted in personal experience. He was frustrated, he said, at the fragmented care that his father, Dwight Conway, received when he was dying of cancer in 2007.He promised his father that he would devote his life to trying to fix the health care system. His father told him: \u201cYou can\u2019t. It\u2019s too hard. But you are persistent. If anyone can, it would be you.\u201dDr. Conway also supervises the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation, a test bed for new ways of financing and delivering care. In one such project, Medicare will make a \u201cbundled payment\u201d for hip and knee replacement surgery and 90 days of follow-up care, forcing hospitals to work more closely with doctors, nursing homes and home health agencies.Federal officials are continually trying to measure the quality of care provided to Medicare beneficiaries, and Dr. Conway applies similar techniques to his personal life. He has a large whiteboard at work to keep track of office projects, and on one side is a mission statement he and his wife wrote, outlining objectives for family life, including ways to be a good father and husband.\u201cHe evaluates his performance against those objectives,\u201d said Wesley R. Perich, a former deputy in the office. Using one such metric, Dr. Conway said, he got home for dinner with his family about 75 percent of the time.Some doctors worry that the administration is trying to do too much too fast, without considering the effects on patients.\u201cDr. Conway is a very smart man, and he is trying lots of innovative programs and ideas,\u201d said Dr. Thomas C. Barber, the chairman of the American Academy of Orthopedic Surgeons\u2019 Council on Advocacy. \u201cBut some of those ideas are being implemented before they are ready.\u201dAmong those providing unvarnished feedback to Dr. Conway is his sister, Dr. Kathleen C. Jurell, who specializes in physical medicine and rehabilitation.\u201cI hear from her about C.M.S.,\u201d he said, \u201cand it\u2019s not always good.\u201dBecause of an editing error, an earlier version of a picture caption with this article misspelled the given name of a pediatric resident. She is Mariana Montes, not Marina.Advertisement"}

This was the challenge as my siblings and I struggled to decide what would be carved on our mother\u00e2\u0080\u0099s footstone. You get a list of adjectives from which to choose: beloved, devoted, loving, and caring\u00e2\u0080\u0094but she was so much more in her 59 years than these simple, predetermined descriptions. She was generous, thoughtful, creative, selfless, curious and so much more.On birthdays, she would decorate our bedrooms while we slept so we\u00e2\u0080\u0099d wake up surrounded by feelings of love and joy. And each time I came home to visit, there was always a cooked artichoke waiting for me on the stove\u00e2\u0080\u0094my favorite, and she knew it. You can see why this task took us more than a year to complete. The hardest of all, of course, was the bookend the footstone represented, and maybe we weren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t ready to accept this.Death may be a universal experience, but every family experiences it so differently. After the third diagnosis of my mother\u00e2\u0080\u0099s breast cancer, my father learned he had pancreatic cancer. Our family lost its bearings. How could we have both of our parents in simultaneous treatment, together, for stage-four cancer? This reality took some getting used to, but time was not on our side and I think my parents were aware of this.As a photographer, I needed to find a way to process what we were going through as a family and naturally my camera became that therapeutic tool. It gave me a safe distance from the reality of what was unfolding in front of me\u00e2\u0080\u0094I was losing my parents and there was nothing I could do about it. In a world that was spiraling downward rapidly, my camera became my lifeline and documenting our story brought a different kind of healing to our pain.Here is when they taught us a lesson in courage. Rather than wallowing in their own sadness and grief, they chose to spend their final months living life. Yes, there was chemo, but there were also family dinners, late night movies, spontaneous vacations, and fireside chats. And I photographed this. I captured every moment because I needed to hold on to each memory, each frame. I wanted to hold onto the essence of who my parents were and who my family was, before the moments passed and they were gone.There is no cookie-cutter way of dealing with death. Fortunately, my family never quite fit the mold. A spoon full of Fluff to help the chemo pills go down? Mom certainly thought so. Swapping out a traditional Jewish shroud for his favorite Lawrence Taylor Giants Jersey for his burial clothing? Dad pretty much demanded it. And along that same rhythm, there I was, camera in hand, photographing both of their funerals.When the time came to bury Dad, and Mom 364 days later, almost everything had already been taken care of because my parents wanted to talk about their deaths, a conversation many actively try to avoid. We knew which plots they wanted; we knew their medical requests for their final days. Heck, we even knew what my father wanted said at his funeral because he wrote his own eulogy. Mom spent her final weeks banking blood at the local hospital to be used for future research after she was gone and also made a request for a sustainable wood casket so in death she would be doing what was best for the Earth.While these last three years have been the most difficult of my life, they have also been beautiful and filled with love, life, and lessons I will always hold on to. The Borowick way to share the many lessons would be in the form of a list, written on a colorful Post-It note. While I can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t give you the paper note, I can give you the list.Always be kind, no matter what the circumstance.Life is a gift, and we were never promised longevity.The people you love live on inside of you.They are already imprinted in the person that you are.Talking about death allows you to focus on and appreciate life.Courage isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t the absence of fear, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s knowing that you are afraid and doing it anyway.Eat dessert first.And I have my photographs, my record, which hold tight the moments of joy and pain, and together tell the story of what it truly means to live. So, even though I only had 28 years with my Dad and 29 with my Mom, I feel like I won the lottery."}

{"Headline": "Filmed in New York, Starring My Home", "Date": "2016-03-11", "News": "Supported byStanding on a leafy Brooklyn block in the 2015 film \u201cThe Intern,\u201d Anne Hathaway gazes at the handsome brownstone where her character lives, turns to Robert De Niro and says: \u201cI love this house. It just looks happy to me.\u201dMany others share her enthusiasm. The Clinton Hill townhouse, with four stories, five bedrooms and a library, took center stage in a Nordstrom holiday commercial that aired last year. It also turned up in print ads for West Elm, New Balance and Best Buy. In all, it was filmed on 10 separate occasions last year. Its owner, Merele Williams-Adkins, fields inquiries about it monthly.As the film industry expands in the city, the opportunities for New Yorkers to turn their homes into ad hoc film studios grow, too. And with that, of course, comes more reason for neighbors to complain about everything from film crews monopolizing parking spaces to autograph-seekers hogging the sidewalks.Last week, more than 100 projects, including television shows, movies and newscasts, had permits to film in the city, a typical week in New York.Still, it takes a certain amount of fortitude to stand by while your home is overrun by a harried film crew. Not for the nick-conscious or the ding-averse is watching your furniture being loaded onto a truck while the walls are being covered in red floral wallpaper, as happened once when a New York State lottery commercial was shot at a Victorian in Ditmas Park, Brooklyn. On another occasion, an area rug in the same Victorian emerged from a shoot looking like Rocky after a fight. The crew rolled it up, took it to a cleaner and returned it a few days later.\u201cWe\u2019re going to break something, we\u2019re going to scratch something,\u201d said Nick Carr, a location scout. \u201cAt the end of the day, your house is going to look a little off-kilter.\u201dAll the action could quickly alienate and enrage neighbors who rarely see any of the money, but invariably endure a good dose of the upheaval. Complaints from angry residents and business owners are on the rise, say elected officials and neighborhood associations, particularly in neighborhoods that drip with historic charm, a favorite of film crews. Tensions can run particularly high when neighbors can point to a lone brownstone on the block that is profiting at the expense of everyone else.When \u201cThe Intern\u201d was shot in 2014, Ms. Williams-Adkins and her daughter, Turiya, now 17, moved out for almost three months, staying in a hotel and a short-term rental, paid for by the production. Her son, Titus, now 21, was away at college. Ms. Williams-Adkins declined to say how much she earned for the deal, saying only that it was \u201cin the six figures.\u201dWhen they returned 11 weeks later, the place had been put back together \u2014 but not exactly as they had left it, which gave the family an unexpected chance to hit an emotional reset button, as Mr. Adkins had died just five months earlier. \u201cIt was actually quite cathartic,\u201d Ms. Williams-Adkins said.Not all properties are ready for prime time. Some directors are looking for living quarters that look like a page torn from a Pottery Barn catalog. But not always. Sometimes, they want shag carpeting, vintage bathrooms and dated Formica.And they always want enough space to accommodate a crew.\u201cIt doesn\u2019t have to be a pretty baby,\u201d said Barbara Wilson, an associate broker with Halstead Property who works as a liaison with location managers and scouts. \u201cAn episode is not always about rich people with huge apartments.\u201dThe city has been steering scouts to areas that haven\u2019t seen a lot of film activity, like the South Bronx. \u201cYou\u2019ve got a lot of neighborhoods that are yearning for filming because they recognize the economic need,\u201d said Julie Menin, the commissioner of the Mayor\u2019s Office of Media and Entertainment.In neighborhoods that are beyond discovered, many buildings bar the door, restricting film crews from using common areas or the elevators. \u201cThey perceive it to be an extraordinary inconvenience for not a great benefit,\u201d said Peter Ferrara, the president of the co-op board of 194 Riverside Drive on the Upper West Side, which feels differently and has been used for film locations for about 20 years.Last year alone, film crews were on the premises of the 1902 building a dozen times. The building, Mr. Ferrara said, has made appearances on television shows like \u201cBillions,\u201d \u201cOrange Is the New Black\u201d and \u201cThe Americans.\u201d Woody Allen shot a new project there, too.\u201cThe basement is a good place for drug addicts and murderers to hang out,\u201d Mr. Ferrara said. The lobby became a casino for the Showtime drama \u201cBillions.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re not raking in billions,\u201d he said. \u201cBut if your heating bill is $140,000, you can defray some of that.\u201dAn apartment building might receive around $10,000 to $15,000 for a few days\u2019 work, according to location agents.Because of the Moguls\u2019 film-friendly reputation, when the television show \u201c30 Rock\u201d was filming an outdoor scene on their block a few years ago, the crew paid the Moguls a few hundred dollars to let Tina Fey and Jon Hamm warm up inside. \u201cI said, \u2018That\u2019s fine as long as Tina talks to my wife for a few minutes,\u2019 \u201d Mr. Mogul said. \u201cMy wife had a great time.\u201d Dr. Mogul, 54, is a cardiologist.Some neighbors, however, are less than keen. The Moguls have appeased some with bottles of wine, but when one neighbor wrote them an angry note, that relationship soured. \u201cMy wife is not really friends with him anymore,\u201d Mr. Mogul said.Over in Clinton Hill, Ms. Williams-Adkins faced the same discontent during the filming of \u201cThe Intern.\u201d \u201cSome neighbors would call me or scream at the production crew,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was difficult. I think there are people who are still upset.\u201dFor some city residents, the fun ended a long time ago.\u201cI\u2019ve wanted to protest and chant in the middle of the filming,\u201d said Richard Rubin, 57, an editor who lives on West 94th Street in Manhattan. \u201cThere\u2019s just no reward for the neighborhood.\u201d Last September, while Mr. Rubin was walking his dog near Riverside Park, he noticed telltale no-parking signs ordering drivers to move their cars on Yom Kippur, one of the Jewish High Holy Days. \u201cIt was disrespectful,\u201d said Mr. Rubin, who once had his car towed by a film crew when he had not moved it in time.Parking needs for a shoot depend on the size of the project. A small production might request permits for one or two blocks for a day or two, whereas a large feature film with trailers for cast members could occupy five or six blocks for weeks, according to Michael Kriaris, who, as a location manager, oversees properties during productions.Ms. Menin, the commissioner of media and entertainment, said the benefits outweigh any temporary disruptions New Yorkers may experience.During the 75 days that Warner Brothers filmed \u201cThe Intern,\u201d the studio spent an estimated $45 million locally on vendors and payroll. \u201cThe economic impact for those businesses that are located in areas of filming is really impactful and very meaningful,\u201d Ms. Menin said. \u201cAt the same time we recognize that filming can have an impact on communities.\u201dAs of March 1, more than 40 neighborhoods were on the hiatus list, mostly in Manhattan, Brooklyn and Queens. In December, the city added a swath that includes 194 Riverside and the Mogul family\u2019s brownstone. The Riviera and the Grinnell, another vintage Washington Heights co-op, have been unable to participate in film shoots since crucial streets ended up on the list last April.The solution, said Bruce Robertson, an associate broker for Corcoran who lives in the Grinnell, is to change attitudes in the neighborhood. Residents of the Riviera and the Grinnell started a committee in the hopes of persuading nearby co-ops and condos that they, too, can profit from the film industry. The committee plans a neighborhood meeting next month; parking solutions will be on the agenda.\u201cNothing\u2019s a cash cow,\u201d Mr. Gross said. \u201cBut it takes the edge off the bills. It makes it a little easier.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Arizona Election Official Apologizes for Long Wait at Polls", "Date": "2016-03-28", "News": "Supported byAs the anger bubbled over within a packed State Capitol, a sheepish election official blamed the chaos on poor planning and a misguided attempt to save money by closing poll locations.\u201cI apologize profusely \u2014 I can\u2019t go back and undo it,\u201d said Helen Purcell, the Maricopa County recorder, during a hearing of the Arizona House Elections Committee on Monday as more than 100 voters listened.Maricopa County, which is Arizona\u2019s most populous and includes the greater Phoenix area, had slashed the number of polling places by 70 percent from 2012.Ms. Purcell, a Republican holding the office since 1988, tried to offer explanations for what went wrong as the county reduced the number of polling places to 60 from 200 \u2014 one site for roughly 21,500 voters \u2014 but the capacity crowd was having none of it.One man said, \u201cNot good enough.\u201d The audience cheered.More than 100 voters filled three interconnected rooms, and more than 30 signed up to testify. Security personnel stood on the sides, and at one point a handful of state troopers moved inside, threatening to remove anyone who was disruptive.The hearing ended in mid-session at 1:30 p.m. because committee members had to move to another hearing to vote on a campaign finance bill. One of the members, Ken Clark, a Democrat, urged audience members to follow them, and they did. A masked man screamed from the gallery; troopers soon surrounded him and took him outside in handcuffs, delaying the hearing\u2019s start.Ms. Purcell had already said that her office would make new plans for November, presumably adding more polling sites.Meanwhile, Michelle Reagan, the Arizona secretary of state \u2014 who told reporters before the hearing that she had known about the cutback in polling places, but had not wanted to \u201csecond-guess\u201d the county\u2019s decision \u2014 said she planned to hold four community meetings in the areas most affected by the long lines, all but one in heavily Hispanic parts of the county.Election officials said the location and number of polling places in Maricopa County had been determined by informed assumptions, using turnout by mail and at the polls from 2008, when the state hosted its last contested primary.In the end, the math did not hold up, foretelling some of the problems Arizona could face ahead of the November elections. Fewer voters mailed in their ballots, more people who had received ballots by mail showed up to vote in person and thousands of independents lined up to vote, unaware they were not allowed to participate in the state\u2019s closed presidential primaries.Though small, the discrepancies were significant enough to overwhelm the polling sites, proving that there just were not enough of them, Ms. Purcell said.\u201cThere\u2019s also the factor of money,\u201d which was not going to be enough for a \u201cfull-blown election,\u201d she said. \u201cSo we had to downsize.\u201dVoters in majority-minority South Phoenix, a working-class enclave, stood in line for several hours; the last ballot at South Mountain Community Center, the area\u2019s sole polling site, was cast at 12:12 a.m. on Wednesday, well past the polls\u2019 closing time. In North Scottsdale, one of the county\u2019s most affluent communities, waits were nowhere nearly as long.Some angry voters called for Ms. Purcell\u2019s resignation and even for a recount.\u201cStop pretending you represent us,\u201d Patrick Seifter, 30, who lives in Central Phoenix, said at the hearing, pointing at Ms. Purcell. \u201cWe don\u2019t want platitudes \u2014 we want action and accountability.\u201dThe mayor of Phoenix, Greg Stanton, has sent a letter to the Justice Department seeking a federal investigation, a call echoed by many of the voters attending the hearing.One after another, they stood up to register their complaints at the hearing as the committee\u2019s chairwoman, Representative Michelle Ugenti-Rita, a Republican, sometimes chided them, sometimes egged them on.\u201cSee how messed up this is?\u201d she said at one point.Danny Robinson, 61, spoke on behalf of his daughter, whom he said could not vote because she ran out of time to wait in line \u2014 she had to go back to work.The Rev. Jarrett Maupin, a Baptist pastor, urged the congregants who called him to \u201chold the line, hold the line,\u201d he said, even if it meant waiting well into the evening, as many of them did.\u201cWe delivered water, we delivered fruits, we delivered granola bars and we delivered encouragement \u2014 do not give up,\u201d Mr. Maupin said. \u201cOur right to vote is sacred and we have to keep on fighting for it.\u201dKrista Pacion, 39, gave up twice before finally showing up ready for the long wait: She brought her 3-year-old daughter in a wagon loaded with water and snacks.\u201cWhatever it took, I was going to vote that day,\u201d Ms. Pacion said.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "U.N. Urges Countries to Take in 480,000 Syrian Refugees", "Date": "2016-03-30", "News": "Supported byGENEVA \u2014 The United Nations secretary general, Ban Ki-moon, on Wednesday exhorted countries around the world to step up to their responsibilities and take in half a million Syrian refugees, rebuking political leaders who he said had instead resorted to demonizing asylum seekers.Opening a one-day ministerial conference in Geneva convened by the United Nations refugee agency, Mr. Ban called for \u201can exponential increase in global solidarity\u201d in urging countries to accept about 480,000 Syrians over the next three years.\u201cNeighboring countries have done far more than their share,\u201d Mr. Ban said, alluding to the nearly five million refugees received by Turkey, Lebanon, Jordan and Iraq. \u201cOthers must now step up.\u201dDemonizing refugees and migrants was \u201cnot only demeaning, offensive and counterproductive but factually wrong,\u201d Mr. Ban said, emphasizing the skills and other resources they brought to host countries. \u201cI call on leaders to counter fearmongering with reassurance, and to fight inaccurate information with the truth.\u201dThe 480,000 Syrian refugees amount to about 10 percent of those registered in surrounding countries. Counting pledges to resettle 179,000 refugees the United Nations refugee agency has received since 2013, that meant it was looking for commitments to take an additional 300,000 people.That target proved far beyond the scope of the meeting. Mr. Ban\u2019s appeal elicited many pledges of support and solidarity but adding up the commitments made on Wednesday, Filippo Grandi, head of the refugee agency, said the meeting had raised the number of places pledged for Syrians by some six thousand, although other promises could open the way for tens of thousands more.United Nations officials had expected little else, stressing the Geneva meeting marked the start of a longer term process aimed at recalibrating the global response to a crisis that has generated the highest levels of displacement since World War II.\u201cWithin all the gloom and doom of Syria it was a positive meeting; I come out of it with a lot of confidence,\u201d Volker Turk, assistant high commissioner of the refugee agency, said. \u201cIt has generated a positive momentum for the year.\u201dThat is expected to become clear in a series of high level meetings later this year, starting with the World Humanitarian Summit in Istanbul in May; a summit on the refugee crisis at the General Assembly in New York in September; and a summit meeting that President Obama will convene the next day, which is intended to generate firm commitments on humanitarian financing and refugee resettlement.Still, the studiously general comments ministers and officials delivered in Geneva on Wednesday underscored the gap between the humanitarian needs in what Mr. Ban called the greatest refugee crisis since 1945 and what governments were prepared to offer.International donors meeting in London in February had pledged $12 billion in humanitarian aid for Syrian refugees and the countries receiving them, but Mr. Grandi said less than half the funds had been allocated so far, calling for speedier disbursement.\u201cMuch more is needed,\u201d Mr. Grandi told the meeting. European Union countries had not shown \u201cthe required solidarity\u201d to share the resettlement of refugees, he said. \u201cWe cannot respond to a global refugee crisis by closing doors and building fences.\u201dMore than a million migrants reached European shores last year, and the European Union has struggled to come up with a coherent and effective response.Europe was \u201cready to take its fair share,\u201d the European Union\u2019s commissioner for migration, Dimitris Avramopoulos, told the conference, but he sketched opportunities for resettlement that appeared to fall well short of what the United Nations was seeking. Eleven European Union countries had agreed to accept 4,555 refugees under a program established in July, which would eventually bring in a total of 22,504 people, he said.Mr. Avramopoulos also proposed that union member states accept 54,000 Syrians under another program agreed upon last September that provided for relocating a total of 160,000 refugees.Six months later, that program has relocated just several hundred people, but Mr. Turk said the European Union statement would increase pressure on Europe to fulfill its commitments. \u201cThere is a high expectation this is now going to be delivered in real terms and it\u2019s not just a fiction,\u201d he said.For the United States, Deputy Secretary of State Heather A. Higginbottom said the Obama administration had increased the number of interviewing officials at refugee processing centers in the region so that it could resettle at least 10,000 Syrian refugees by the end of September.The Russian deputy foreign minister, Gennady Gatilov, calling on European countries to show more responsibility in dealing with the refugee crisis, said Moscow had doubled the number of places for Syrians to receive free university education \u2014 to 300.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Why Can\u2019t the G.O.P. Stop Trump?", "Date": "2016-03-01", "News": "Supported byOp-Ed ContributorIf Republican Party leaders dislike Donald J. Trump so much, why haven\u2019t they done more to stop him?They should be able to. In \u201cThe Party Decides,\u201d a book I wrote in 2008 with Marty Cohen, David Karol and John Zaller, we argued that the leaders of party coalitions have great influence over the selection of a presidential nominee.Before then, the conventional wisdom was that such broad and diverse coalitions of politicians, activists and interest groups within parties were largely shut out of the nominating process by primaries and caucuses in the 1970s. This led to a free-for-all among narrowly factional candidates. In 1976, Jimmy Carter emerged from a crowded field to win the nomination despite having no connections to most leaders in the national party.We argued that since that 1976 contest, party leaders had been exerting influence by coordinating on their choice during the \u201cinvisible primary\u201d \u2014 the period before any voting when the leaders observed, met with and vetted candidates \u2014 then supporting that candidate throughout the process.When party leaders work together, they nearly always win, we said.This year\u2019s election has not followed our script. Mr. Trump is the clear front-runner, but is loathed by the party establishment. Until the past week, almost no nationally prominent Republicans had endorsed him. Another top candidate, Senator Ted Cruz, is no more popular with Republican leaders.Party leaders have been obsessing and scheming, but until recently, they had barely taken any action. They seem to have finally settled on Senator Marco Rubio, far later than we would have expected. If Mr. Rubio wins, it would be at best a partial victory for \u201cThe Party Decides.\u201dThe parties converged on a favorite candidate early in eight of nine contested nominations from 1980 to 2000, with that selected candidate winning all eight. Since then, in only two out of six races has the favored candidate won. Either the theory was wrong all along, or at the very least, we need to think harder about why the party leaders can coordinate sometimes and not at other times. Here are some possible explanations.Several factors \u2014 the fragmented media market, super PACs, new media \u2014 have made it easier for factions both within and outside the party to coordinate on their own. The Tea Party and the progressive movement can empower candidates like Rand Paul, Ted Cruz and Bernie Sanders. Campaign finance laws have undermined parties and empowered individual candidates: Most think Newt Gingrich and Rick Santorum lasted longer in 2012 than they would have without super PACs.In several contests, party leaders were hesitant to challenge candidates who appeared to have independent support. In the 2004 Democratic contest, most party leaders did not want Howard Dean as the nominee, but his fund-raising was impressive. It took Mr. Dean\u2019s failure in the Iowa caucuses to embolden party leaders to back John Kerry.That the evolving political environment would give the party leaders trouble is no surprise. The invisible primary itself evolved as a response to the 1970s reforms, but it took party leaders a few cycles to work it out. They may yet work out these changes as well.We argued in the book that you should think of the party as a collection of different, often competing groups that nevertheless find ways to bridge their differences. Right now, the largest divide is between those groups that some call \u201cparty regulars,\u201d or the establishment, and more ideological groups \u2014 the Tea Party, religious conservatives and other movement conservatives.Jeb Bush was a clear early choice among many regulars, but he was just as clearly not the choice of movement conservatives. And Mr. Cruz, rejected by the national party, has been embraced by many movement conservatives. Before voting began, Mr. Cruz led in endorsements from politicians at the state level, where the Tea Party movement has been most effective.We argued that the party wants a candidate who is acceptable to all factions, not just half of them. Mr. Cruz or Mr. Bush is (or was) the first choice of his own group, but unacceptable to the other\u2019s. Neither is the choice of the whole party.Who could appeal to both sides, the way that Speaker Paul Ryan has tried to do in the House? Would it be Scott Walker, Mr. Rubio, Mr. Christie, John Kasich or someone else? The party never really decided.Party leaders might have pushed aside Mr. Trump if they\u2019d had an easy choice among the acceptable candidates. Since they didn\u2019t, the Trump distraction kept them from choosing anyone.In 2008, both parties failed to coordinate around a single candidate. We learned later that some Democrats who had been reluctant to oppose Hillary Clinton had privately encouraged Barack Obama to challenge her. After Iowa, his party support became public. That year, among Republicans, Mitt Romney and John McCain both had backing from different factions of the party.In most of these cases, party leaders seemed to use Iowa as a winnowing tool, recalling the way they used primaries before the 1970s reforms. Most famously, John F. Kennedy needed to show he could win the votes of non-Catholics in West Virginia before the party would back him in 1960. Lately, the leaders have let voters help them figure out which candidate, among the acceptable, they should coordinate on.In 2016, the Republicans may be very slowly doing just that.Mr. Rubio may join Mr. Dukakis and Mr. Kerry as someone party leaders flocked to after the voters narrowed the field. In the months before Iowa, many party leaders had already begun to back Mr. Rubio, and that support accelerated once voting began. It picked up even more once Mr. Bush dropped out of the race. If this were to end in a victory for Mr. Rubio, that would be meaningful from our perspective.But not jumping on the Trump bandwagon falls far, far short of making a decision. The longer it takes for the party leaders to find a champion, the less it looks as if they are deciding and the more it looks as if they are just following \u2014 even if they follow to a party-acceptable candidate.Let\u2019s say Mr. Rubio somehow does win the nomination: On the one hand, that means that the party leaders would have stopped a front-runner in the middle of the process, no minor feat. Unlike the way the House chooses its speaker, sequential primaries and caucuses are not suited to finding compromise.On the other hand, what took them so long?The Democratic Party has its own factions, but that conflict has mostly been worked out within party circles. This made the Democratic leaders\u2019 choice much easier. And having backed Mrs. Clinton, party leaders are now going to the mat for her, just as they have done when outsiders challenged their choice in previous elections.Mrs. Clinton\u2019s march to the nomination shows that parties are still able to make decisions. But Mr. Trump\u2019s success demonstrates that that ability may now be much easier to disrupt.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "An American Olympian Prepares, on the Enemy\u2019s Turf", "Date": "2016-03-15", "News": "Supported byRIO DE JANEIRO \u2014 Courtney Thompson, a veteran setter on the United States women\u2019s national volleyball team, stepped from the side door of the stifling hot gym and into a cool ocean breeze. The beach was close enough that waves could be heard crashing onto the sand. Sugarloaf, the bullet-shape mountain with a cable car to the top, familiar from Rio postcards, loomed overhead.It was winter back home, but midsummer in Brazil. Thompson\u2019s American teammates were scattered around the globe, in at least six countries on three other continents, playing in the type of professional indoor volleyball leagues that do not exist in the United States.But Thompson was here playing in Superliga, which might be the best women\u2019s league of them all, where almost the entire Brazilian national squad was clustered onto a few powerhouse teams. The United States and Brazil are fierce rivals and favorites to win the gold medal at the Summer Olympics in Rio. And Thompson had infiltrated enemy territory, like a spy doing reconnaissance for the Americans, on a team from Rio de Janeiro.\u201cThat\u2019s what they tease me about,\u201d she said. \u201cThey\u2019re learning about me, too. I may take a few tips back, but that was not my intent.\u201dTeammates called out to her. In a few months, Thompson will be on the other side of the net, perhaps with a gold medal at stake. Until then, she was here to learn.Brazil\u2019s two Superligas \u2014 one for men and one for women \u2014 are among the top professional volleyball leagues in the world. In Brazil, indoor volleyball and beach volleyball trail only soccer in popularity. Superliga games are routinely on television, and top players of both sexes are nationally known and recognized.But only about half of Brazil\u2019s national men\u2019s team stays home to play in Superliga, unable to resist the bigger paydays and growing talent pools offered in places like Russia, Poland and Italy. And there is no Superliga men\u2019s team in Rio de Janeiro.But the women\u2019s Superliga, while facing similar competition for talent around the world, has managed to keep most of the top Brazilian women at home. Only a couple of team members ventured overseas this season. The rest played together, or often against one another, on Superliga teams like Osasco and Sesi, in S\u00e3o Paulo. The best team all season, and for most of the league\u2019s history, has been the one in Rio de Janeiro, now named Rexona-Ades after its current sponsor, a deodorant. While Brazil\u2019s final roster will not be named until summer, as many as four of the 12 players are expected to come from Rio\u2019s team. With Thompson, it is basically a global all-star team.\u201cWalking around the streets, it\u2019s very different than the U.S.,\u201d Thompson said. \u201cPeople will say: \u2018Hey, Courtney! You\u2019re the American! How\u2019s it going?\u2019 I sat down at a restaurant the other night and the guy across from me, a Brazilian guy, said: \u2018Courtney, good to see you. How\u2019s the season?\u2019 You don\u2019t get that ever in the U.S. And the level of play? I\u2019m playing with half their national team.\u201dThompson came to Rio not just to play in Superliga, but to learn from Bernardo Rezende, known as Bernardinho. A two-time Olympian as a setter in the 1980s, Bernardinho coached the Brazil national women\u2019s team for a decade and has coached the men\u2019s national team since 2001.As Brazil\u2019s economy and the value of its currency, the real, collapses, it is increasingly difficult to keep Superliga filled with the best Brazilians and to attract outsiders. Top players might make 400,000 reais (about $108,000) per season in Brazil, Bernardinho said, but could command 600,000 euros (roughly $665,000) in well-financed leagues in places like Turkey.The two members of Brazil\u2019s national team who played the season overseas (one in Russia, one in Turkey) were looking for money, Bernardinho said.\u201cIt\u2019s not about whether they are going to grow, technically speaking, or if it\u2019s a stronger league,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s about the comparison of currency. When foreign players come here, they know they won\u2019t be getting the best contract. They could be abroad and make more money. But they like to grow and increase their level of playing.\u201dThat is what attracted Thompson. She wanted to do anything she could to make the United States Olympic team again, and she thought Brazil and Bernardinho offered the best chance. Her American teammates were spread across the globe. Four played for the same team in Italy.Thompson liked the style of play in Brazil, which she had seen from the other side of the net. It is a bit like soccer, the \u201cbeautiful\u201d game, full of speed, skill and finesse but moving toward size and power.\u201cThey play fast,\u201d Thompson said of the Brazilians. \u201cThey know the game well. It\u2019s almost like a dance. It\u2019s very fluid. Their ball control is very good; their defense is good; they see the game well. They\u2019re not always the most physical \u2014 of course, their national team is \u2014 but as a whole, they\u2019re just smart. And you can tell that when you\u2019re playing with them.\u201dShe said that the Brazilians have at least one built-in advantage over the Americans \u2014 volleyball is part of the national consciousness.\u201cThey grow up around the game, it\u2019s so popular,\u201d Thompson said. \u201cWe play twice a week, and the men play twice a week, so four nights a week you see really high-level volleyball on television. That\u2019s the way to learn. You watch it; you go out and try to do it. It\u2019s like watching video \u2014 you just don\u2019t know it.\u201dStill, Superliga can feel far from big-time sports like soccer in Brazil and football, basketball and baseball in the United States. Practice is at an un-air-conditioned gym on a military base (with extraordinary views). Most team members ride bikes or walk to the games at the Tijuca Tennis Club, set deeply into one of central Rio\u2019s compact, leafy neighborhoods. The gymnasium there, with its high, arched ceiling and capacity of about 3,000, has the feel of an old college field house, with four rows of seats on three sides (20 reais, or about $5), plus 10 rows of concrete bleachers above them (15 reais).The matches are spirited, family-friendly affairs, with banners, T-shirt guns and a mascot. Banners and photos of each player hang on the wall over one end of the gym. But while game results make their way into newspapers and onto television, few members of the news media come to practices or games, and the league does not track results or statistics online. The team\u2019s website is a Facebook page \u2014 though one with more than 450,000 likes.The volleyball, however, is world class. The eight-team playoffs, which started last weekend, attract sellout crowds, and Rio usually moves at least some matches to nearby Maracan\u00e3zinho, an arena with a capacity of nearly 12,000, that will be the site of the Olympic volleyball tournament in August.The intensity ratchets up several notches, especially between teams loaded with Olympians.\u201cSuperliga has most of the best Brazilian players,\u201d said Rio\u2019s Gabriela Braga, known as Gabi, an outside hitter expected to star at the Olympics. \u201cThe playoffs get really, really hard, so we play at a great, high level, and a high physical level. It gets us in good shape for the Brazilian national team.\u201dThe women on the national team see Superliga as an advantage, and most are willing to give up more money for the chance to stay home, play in front of familiar faces and prepare for the Olympics in ways that the Americans cannot.\u201cPlayers want to come here because we\u2019ve won the last two Olympics, and people around the world wonder, What are they doing in Brazil that is so good?\u201d said the defensive specialist Fabiana Alvim, a two-time Olympic and eight-time Superliga champion in Rio who is known as Fabi. \u201cWe get enough money to compete. And the teams can play.\u201dThat is what attracted Thompson. When she arrived in the fall, it did not take her long to see what she had gotten into in Brazil.\u201cWe played at Osasco, our big rival, right before Christmas,\u201d she said of a match in the S\u00e3o Paulo suburbs. \u201cProbably one of the coolest opposing gyms I\u2019ve ever been to. It was packed when we walked in there, and you could hear booing before we got out of the locker room. It was fun, you know? I think everyone here is pretty passionate, in all walks of life. It\u2019s a really fun place to live and see their culture. But they aren\u2019t afraid to let you know they\u2019re not happy, those fans. I love it. But also, when you\u2019re doing well, it\u2019s the coolest thing you\u2019ve ever seen.\u201dThompson and the rest of her American Olympic teammates, wherever they are around the world, will come see for themselves in just a few months.Helena Rebello contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Plan for Nazi-Era Arms Dealer\u2019s Collection Sets Off Backlash at Zurich Museum", "Date": "2016-03-03", "News": "Supported byBut since bulldozers started excavation early this year for the expansion project, a massive sandstone rectangle designed by the architect David Chipperfield, the work has dredged up sensitive issues involving the city\u2019s Jewish history and the Swiss role in the trade of art looted by the Nazis in World War II.At the urging of a group in New York, hundreds of Orthodox Jews have staged demonstrations outside Swiss embassies and consulates in London, Montreal, New York and Tel Aviv, calling on the museum to protect a 14th-century Jewish burial site that they say is under the new building\u2019s construction site.Other critics are questioning whether it is proper for a publicly financed institution to give prominence to the B\u00fchrle collection in a new wing, given that Mr. B\u00fchrle was a Nazi arms dealer who bought art that had been looted from Jewish owners. A book about the collection published last year by two Zurich historians, including a former administrator of the Kunsthaus, argues that the museum should be more transparent about his biography.\u201cWe were playing with open cards about the past when the vote took place in 2012,\u201d said Bj\u00f6rn Quellenberg, a spokesman for the Kunsthaus. \u201cThat was the time to discuss it. No one saw any major obstacle with the fact of the Jewish cemetery\u201d and, he added, Mr. B\u00fchrle\u2019s past was \u201chotly debated.\u201dThe expansion project, expected to be completed by 2020, is being financed by the city and the state government, or canton, of Zurich and the museum\u2019s association of 21,000 members, who have pledged to raise more than $88 million. The B\u00fchrle Foundation, created by descendants of the arms dealer to oversee the collection, will contribute an undisclosed amount.The expansion of the Kunsthaus was approved by voters in 2012, and the foundation pledged to loan about 200 works to the museum until 2034 on condition that they would be displayed together in the new building.But despite this broad show of support, the new building has exposed divisions. Leaders of Zurich\u2019s Jewish community are bristling at the demonstrations abroad by the Orthodox rabbis, who in turn contend that those local leaders are too intimidated to challenge the museum project.No one disputes that a Jewish quarter was marked on the old maps. But city officials say they have uncovered only remnants of a 16th-century city wall. Urs Spinner, a spokesman for the city\u2019s engineering department, said the construction crew had searched for a burial site by drilling almost the entire terrain with holes every 10 feet at depths up to 164 feet.\u201cThat\u2019s why it is almost certain that there is no Jewish cemetery anymore,\u201d Mr. Spinner said. \u201cThe Jewish communities in Zurich with their rabbis are working closely with the local authorities. The protests are grounded in false information floating around.\u201dThree orthodox rabbis from Zurich have issued a blunt public letter in Hebrew, saying that the cemetery search is a local matter and that outsiders should not \u201cmeddle\u201d in it.The Swiss federation is also wrestling with the implications of displaying the B\u00fchrle collection. The Kunsthaus sells a slim book published by the foundation that notes that Mr. B\u00fchrle, who died in 1956, was forced by a Swiss court to return 13 looted artworks that he had bought during the war to their owners or descendants. He later bought back nine of them, including a Degas that had once been in the possession of the Nazi leader Hermann G\u00f6ring.In August, Guido Magnaguagno, a former vice director of the Kunsthaus, and Thomas Buomberger, an art historian, published \u201cB\u00fchrle\u2019s Black Book,\u201d in which they argue that the museum should be more open about the entire B\u00fchrle collection of some 600 works and its history.Around 300 works are privately owned by his three grandchildren rather than by the foundation.\u201cIt\u2019s obvious that the very difficult paintings remain in the private collection,\u201d Mr. Magnaguagno said. To avoid glorifying Mr. B\u00fcrhle, he argues that the museum should create a documentary room in the new wing that chronicles his wartime activities.Mr. Quellenberg, the museum spokesman, said the Kunsthaus and the foundation were preparing a new biography of Mr. B\u00fchrle that would explore his past and would also be explained in audio tours. The museum will also house all of Mr. B\u00fchrle\u2019s archives, he said, but there are no plans for a documentary center. \u201cWe are not a historical museum,\u201d he said.The B\u00fchrle foundation is preparing a catalog of all the works, private and public, Mr. Gloor said. .

Four weeks ago, two New York plainclothes police officers were shot by someone using a Ruger .357 revolver, she said in the letter.Sturm, Ruger is vulnerable to additional public scrutiny, litigation and regulatory attention, all things potential investors would want to know, she said.Another activist group, Trinity Church in Lower Manhattan, is pressing the sporting and outdoor goods retailer Cabela\u2019s to stop selling weapons that can fire more than eight rounds without reloading. The church is asking Cabela\u2019s shareholders to vote on the proposal at their annual meeting; the retailer has been fighting to keep the proposal off its shareholder proxy.An earlier campaign by Trinity Church resulted in Walmart agreeing to remove some weapons from its shelves last August, but only after a court battle between the two over Walmart\u2019s attempt to block Trinity\u2019s shareholder proposal from its proxy.In recent months, Ms. James has also called on TD Bank to stop financing Smith & Wesson, which is based in Springfield, Mass. Last summer, she convinced New York\u2019s largest pension fund to explore selling its holdings of gun retailers such as Walmart and Dick\u2019s Sporting Goods.Advertisement"}

As usual their stories did not disappoint. Here are a few of our favorites, from a woman traveling the country as a volunteer to the late-in-life rabbi to the 70-year-old yoga instructor. From Mailman to Teacher\u201cUpon retiring from a 30-year career as a humble mailman, I began volunteering in my granddaughters\u2019 school. I quickly found that I really, really liked working with kids, and I spent a year training with Americorps as a reading tutor for struggling students. This training has given me an encore career as a substitute special-education assistant in the public schools. It\u2019s joyful, very challenging and immensely satisfying, maybe even rejuvenating. Compared with my old days, as Bob Dylan says, \u2018I was so much older then, I\u2019m younger than that now.'\u201dFrank Robertson, SeattleThe Professional Volunteer\u201cAfter a 45-year career as an administrative assistant, most of that time as a single parent, I would have loved to retire, but without adequate financial resources, what could I do? It it was time to be creative.I received a call from friends saying they had found a a small college in Sitka, Alaska, where the administration welcomed volunteers, offering free room and board. I began to rethink retirement. After all, all I needed do was get there!It was a full calendar year before I was ready. In July, 2005, I retired.  Feeling like Joan of Arc, I drove out of my driveway on my way to Alaska and never looked back. I found that I was welcomed by any organization I approached to help, that college in Alaska, Heifer Ranch in Arkansas, Menaul School in New Mexico, a wildlife refuge in Florida, plus many others. I have traveled the entire country on a fixed income, getting out and giving back, always receiving more than I contribute, making many new friends in the process.\u201dThe Later-In-Life Rabbi\u201cAfter having a successful career as a screenwriter for 25 years, I decided to become a rabbi. I entered rabbinical school at age 54 and it took nine years for me to graduate. Today, at age 66 I am one of eight rabbis at Wilshire Boulevard Temple, the biggest and oldest synagogue in Los Angeles.\u201dThe Lawyer Who Became a Chaplain\u201cAfter 40 years working as an attorney, I retired from the law in 2014 to enter a six-month chaplaincy internship program at Brigham and Women\u2019s Hospital. This led to volunteering as a chaplain at Boston Medical Center for six months and then a six-month chaplaincy internship at Boston Medical Center. I was later hired by Boston Medical Center as a per diem chaplain to help out on the weekends and one day a week. The chaplaincy work is intense, typically comforting patients and families whose lives have changed dramatically and precipitously. As a 70-year-old, I feel incredibly fortunate to be able to engage the world in this way.\u201d The Financially Savvy Actress\u201cIn 2008, I graduated college with a degree in drama and boarded a plane to the Philippines as a cast member on the international tour of \u2018Cinderella,\u2019 the musical. While performing in Asia, however, the American economy was in the midst of a meltdown. So, by the start of 2009, I was back in New York City, a young, recently unemployed actress at the height of the financial crisis.I now use my love of theater and storytelling to teach young audiences how to leverage the powerful tools of personal finance and entrepreneurship to build a life on their own terms. The messages of change, progress and gratitude I receive in reply are more gratifying than any curtain call or on-stage bow I\u2019ve ever taken.\u201d  Back to School at 53\u201cAfter 14 years doing a combination of engineering, teaching English in China and social justice work, I decided to take stock of my life. I\u2019m now 53 years old and in my second year of graduate school studying for a master\u2019s degree in clinical mental health counseling. Reading articles, writing papers and engaging with my much-younger peers has invigorated my mind and energized my desire for my soon-to-be new vocation. While many of my peers are trekking to work, I\u2019m in my jeans and sneakers making my way to classes with plenty of caffeine and snacks as I plow through my coursework. Frankly, it\u2019s hardly work to me. Rather, it\u2019s just part of a journey of not only reinvention but rediscovery of who I am and what I care about. It\u2019s taken me nearly 30 years but I\u2019m getting there!\u201dThe 70-Year-Old Yoga InstructorI\u201d retired from a job with the state of N.Y. about 15 years ago. At the time, I had been practicing yoga for about 20 years. I was offered an opportunity to teach at a senior center in the area and agreed to do it. I based my classes on what my teachers had been teaching me over the years. About seven years ago, I began training to be a yoga teacher at the age of 70. That was very challenging for someone who had taken her last college course many years earlier. I was the oldest person in my class to complete the training. Today, I teach about five classes a week, some at my home where I have transformed my former dining room into a small studio. Most of my students are older and have some limitations physically and I try to accommodate my students\u2019 needs. This \u2018new\u2019 career brings me great joy and satisfaction.

When the job market for financial executives became more challenging during the recession, I looked around for a back-up plan. I found assisted living after helping a friend\u2019s mother who was sick. After helping her, I volunteered at a local assisted living. I loved working with seniors! I got my master\u2019s degree in gerontology and started a position as business director of an assisted living community within a few months of each other.

{"Headline": "In New Economic Plan, China Bets That Hard Choices Can Be Avoided", "Date": "2016-03-05", "News": "Supported byBEIJING \u2014 As economic growth has fallen while debts and excess industrial output have risen, Chinese leaders have faced growing questions about whether they will carry out the painful policy surgery many experts say is needed to cut away the financial dead weight on the economy.The Chinese economy, Mr. Li said, is \u201chugely resilient and has enormous potential and ample room for growth.\u201dThose may have been reassuring words for workers worried about losing their jobs at failing mines, steel mills and industrial plants. Mr. Li said the government\u2019s policies could help create more than 10 million jobs in towns and cities this year, and more than 50 million by the end of 2020.But many economists and investors have become much less confident that China can manage such rates of unstinted growth without piling up more bad lending and misused capital.\u201cI think the 6.5 percent growth target is very challenging,\u201d Shen Jianguang, the Hong Kong-based chief Asia economist at Mizuho Securities Asia, said after hearing Mr. Li\u2019s plans. \u201cThey want to choose a path that maintains real growth now and defers tough times for later.\u201d\u201cAs the government report said, setting this target is also aimed at anchoring expectations and confidence,\u201d Tao Wang, the chief China economist for UBS in Hong Kong, said in emailed comments. \u201cWe think this ambitious growth target signals more policy easing.\u201dBut such financial easing implies more debt, at a time when many Western economists and policy makers are already worried that total leverage in the Chinese economy has far outstripped economic output. The increased debt may help the government achieve its target of 6.5 percent to 7 percent economic growth this year, but at the price of burdening banks with even more loans to struggling businesses, or even effectively insolvent ones. That policy may also water down leaders\u2019 promises to shut companies that are producing unwanted industrial goods.\u201cIn China we have a new saying: \u2018Reform running idle,\u2019\u00a0\u201d said Yao Yang, an economics professor at Peking University.\u201cWe talk of the reforms, but the reforms are never being implemented. That\u2019s the problem,\u201d Mr. Yao said. \u201cWe know that monetary expansion is not going to have a huge effect.\u201dIn his speech, Mr. Li appeared guarded about saying how any cuts would be administered. He did not specify how many workers could lose their jobs as part of the government\u2019s plan to close, merge or restructure mines and factories weighed down by excess capacity.The government will set aside $15.3 billion to support laid-off workers and hard-hit areas, he said. On Monday, a labor official estimated that 1.8 million workers in the steel and coal sectors would be laid off, around 15 percent of the work force in those industries.\u201cThey definitely are relatively cautious in those areas like how boldly we tackle excess capacity, because they still want to grow,\u201d said Louis Kuijs, the chief Asia economist for Oxford Economics, an independent research firm. \u201cWhat I am particularly worried about is the overcapacity is probably going to get worse before it gets better, given the timidity of the approach.\u201dTo a surprising extent, the economic vision unveiled by Mr. Li echoed policies in the United States, the European Union and Japan, all of which have depended heavily on their central banks to expand money supply and keep growth aloft. The International Monetary Fund and many independent economists have strongly called for the world to shift from this reliance on monetary policy.Of the Chinese government\u2019s plan, Mr. Kuijs said: \u201cThe wording is that we will have proactive fiscal policy and prudent monetary policy, but if you look at the numbers, it\u2019s actually the other way around.\u201dThe government\u2019s plan said the target for this year\u2019s fiscal deficit at the national level would rise to 3 percent, from a target of 2.3 percent last year. But by most estimates, the actual deficit last year was already over 3 percent.China\u2019s central bank, like the Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank, has been wary of carrying almost the entire burden for sustaining economic growth through monetary policy, and one of its officials even publicly suggested recently that the fiscal deficit could be safely pegged as high as 4 percent.China\u2019s central government has a fairly low debt by international standards; what are deeply indebted are the country\u2019s corporate sector and local governments. But the Ministry of Finance has nonetheless been reluctant to allow a large, persistent deficit to form, particularly as China may yet face very heavy costs to help banks with the costs of large loans to nearly insolvent state-owned enterprises.Since the global financial crisis, there have been many calls in the West for broadening value-added taxes to encompass financial services, which could encourage more orderly and systematic accounting for many transactions. But Lachlan Wolfers, the head of indirect taxes in China for KPMG, a global accounting and professional services firm, said he was not aware of any countries other than Argentina and Israel that had taken steps as specific as China\u2019s to tax financial services.Chris Buckley reported from Beijing, and Keith Bradsher from Hong Kong.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "25 Songs That Tell Us Where Music Is Going", "Date": "2016-03-10", "News": "By Nitsuh AbebeBy then, though, the song had become such an intense focus of discussion at the digital water cooler \u2014 to the point where it felt difficult to turn on a computer without someone\u2019s views about \u201cFormation\u201d and its various sociopolitical valences reaching out and grasping for your throat \u2014 that my not having heard it acquired some kind of political dimension. A decision had to be made. Either I needed to dutifully consume this object of conversation and develop an opinion about it or I needed to develop a defense of why I hadn\u2019t yet done so.The point being: Here, for a moment, was music that actively dragooned me into paying attention to it, based not primarily on sound, performance or composition, but on the rolling snowball of perspectives, close readings and ideological disputes accreting around it.It\u2019s songs that do this now; individual songs and mass opinion, working in tandem. This wasn\u2019t always the case. We\u2019ve spent the past century or so trying, in creaky and convulsive ways, to figure out what music is even for, and how we intend to use it. When and where will we listen to it? Will other people be there? Should people own music? Who should write it \u2014 the performers? What\u2019s a normal amount to release at once? How will we find out about it? Will there be pictures? Are you absolutely, definitely sure we have to pay money for it? For the moment, there\u2019s only one answer to these questions that seems to connect strangers in a truly monocultural way: We shall gather in huge, fawning riots around towering pop singles to trade politicized takes on them.It\u2019s not the worst thing. One of the great tricks of pop music is that no matter how much we like to imagine it\u2019s about musicians expressing themselves, it tends to be more useful as a way for listeners to figure out their own identities: Each song lets us try on a new way of being in the world. For a long while, the idea was that young people could use music to shape their style \u2014 their clothes, their haircuts, their sense of cool. Then came high-speed Internet and a touching enthusiasm for the idea of playlists: With so much of the world\u2019s music at our fingertips, we\u2019d express our intelligence and taste by playing D.J. and curator, sorting through songs to assemble our own reflections. That didn\u2019t last, either. Showing off your eclectic, handpicked treasures? This has become such a common online performance that there\u2019s no one left in the audience.So these days it\u2019s the song, and the scale of the event surrounding it. One song, one digestible thing, with millions of people standing in a circle around it, pointing and shouting and writing about it, conducting one gigantic online undergraduate seminar about it, metabolizing it on roughly the same level that cable-news debate shows metabolize a political speech. This is an ever-greater share of the public life of music. A song like \u201cFormation\u201d isn\u2019t set up as a story, or an interior monologue \u2014 it\u2019s set up as Beyonc\u00e9, the public celebrity whose biography you already know, addressing the world, like an op-ed with drums. Thus can we argue not about what the song says to us, but about what we think the rest of the world needs to be told, and whether Beyonc\u00e9 is telling it right. What do we make of her dancers\u2019 Black Panther styling? Is she \u201callowed\u201d to work with beloved artists from New Orleans or use references to the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina? How does the song sound through a feminist lens, through a queer lens, through an anticapitalist one? Can we have a conversation about her daughter\u2019s hair, and also about police violence? People talked about these things until, three days in, I\u2019d been quoted every last line of a song I still hadn\u2019t heard.How the pop star won us back with a disappearing act.By Mary H.K. ChoiThe second single from \u201cPurpose,\u201d Justin Bieber\u2019s fourth studio album, \u201cSorry\u201d is an infectious confection \u2014 a Dorito for your ears. There are two official videos for it: a dance video that stars a diverse cast of young women who seem to have been dressed by magpies let loose in a Delia\u2019s catalog; and a lyric video, which is sort of like that footage they use in karaoke bars, but slightly more polished. Between the two, there have been well over 1 billion views. At no point in either does the Canadian heartthrob appear. He simply doesn\u2019t need to.In previous years, by contrast, he was everywhere. He had transformed in the public eye from a teen-star brat to a grown-up brat, with the D.U.I. arrest to prove it. He had become a hollow hashtag of a person. When he visited the Anne Frank house, he wrote in the guest book that he sincerely hoped Frank would have been a \u201cBelieber.\u201d Not only did he come off like Joffrey Baratheon with a Hitler-youth haircut, his callow bad-boy affectation reeked of a keening need to be cool \u2014 anathema, as any teenager can tell you, to actually being cool. But the backlash to the backlash is here, and much like both videos, it has less to do with Bieber \u2014 the actual Bieber \u2014 than you\u2019d expect.Because get this: The most inspired part of Justin Bieber\u2019s reinvention is its erasure of all previously identifiable Bieberish elements. \u201cSorry\u201d is unlike anything Bieber has made in the past. It has been classified as \u201ctropical house\u201d and \u201cdancehall,\u201d but everyone seems to agree on one thing: It\u2019s a banger. The song is about a relationship Bieber has screwed up, and in the lead-in to the hook, he asks, \u201cIs it too late now to say sorry?/\u2019Cause I\u2019m missing more than just your body.\u201d But by the time the actual chorus arrives, Bieber lets the production take over: All you hear is a cooing arpeggio that feels like a gentle breeze on your brain. It\u2019s the best part of the song, and Bieber seems to appear in it only as a sample.This song is a triumph of music over narrative in the hellscape that is the pop music-industrial complex. Consider, for example, the confusing, protracted drama of Kanye West\u2019s latest album release, which involved a huge fashion show, several tweet storms and title changes all leading up to \u201cThe Life of Pablo,\u201d a record that\u2019s being finished in real time on a platform no one wants to pay for.So what is it, exactly, that we want from Bieber? Likability? Yes, Justin Bieber is a contrivance. Yes, Justin Bieber\u2019s lyrics are insipid \u2014 worse still, disingenuous. Yes, his tattoos stink. Yes, he\u2019s lousy at skateboarding. But what does any of this actually matter? In case you missed it, Bieber won. You used to hate him, and now it\u2019s pointless. So who\u2019s sorry now? \u2666Even if you can\u2019t score tickets, the cast album is its own transcendent experience.By Wesley MorrisThere\u2019s being locked out of heaven. Then there\u2019s being locked out of \u201cHamilton.\u201d And with all due respect to Bruno Mars (and God), being locked out of \u201cHamilton\u201d is crueller \u2014 as farce, but still. The musical is sold out \u2014 for, like, ever. And the resale market has achieved spit-take-level hilarity. To wit, this Craigslist ad: \u201cI bought tickets for the wrong night. These are legitimate \u2018Hamilton\u2019 tickets for Friday March 11, 8 p.m., purchased though Ticketmaster. I just want to get back what I paid for them. Great seats! $933.80 per ticket.\u201dBack on Earth, there\u2019s the cast album: a 46-number souvenir for an experience most of us won\u2019t be experiencing. At less than $20 on iTunes, however, where it has been in and out of the Top 10 for months, and Amazon, this is a more-than-adequate substitute for the budget-conscious. It\u2019s a gateway to obsession. To know someone who has this album is to know someone who needs a restraining order.This is to say that the cast recording is its own experience. In an age in which the album is notional \u2014 musical Tupperware \u2014 this one works as a complete concept and doubles as its own playlist, crammed with jams. There are King George\u2019s long-distance interludes, in which, under the mostly brown circumstances, white power sings the same, out-of-style song over and over and over. Meanwhile, the first five numbers alone \u2014 \u201cAlexander Hamilton\u201d; \u201cAaron Burr, Sir\u201d; \u201cMy Shot\u201d; \u201cThe Story of Tonight\u201d; and \u201cThe Schuyler Sisters\u201d \u2014 get halfway to a greatest-hits collection. Pilfered dabs of R.&B., show tunes, rock and rap recombine until identifying whatever you think you\u2019re hearing becomes its own sport.The rapping that Hamilton, played by Lin-Manuel Miranda, the show\u2019s creator, does at the start of the song sounds like some sweaty couplet from LL Cool J\u2019s \u201cI Need Love\u201d from 1987. The \u201cnos\u201d from the ensemble echo the \u201cwhoas\u201d and \u201cheys\u201d from Naughty by Nature\u2019s \u201cHip-Hop Hooray,\u201d from 1993. When Miranda gets to the chorus (\u201cLord, show me how to/Say no to this/I don\u2019t know how to/Say no to this/But my God, she looks so helpless/And her body\u2019s saying, \u2018hell, yes\u2019\u201d) handclaps and guitar licks gently join the percussion and bass line. And suddenly all I can hear is Champaign\u2019s 1981 love jam, \u201cHow \u2019Bout Us.\u201d Pairing those Greek-chorus \u201cnos\u201d with the ecstatic sounds of a harp as Hamilton and Mrs. Reynolds (presumably) do it generates moral tension. The bass line is where \u201cSay No to This\u201d gets both its erogenous nerve and antique heat. Your head spins as the song proceeds to combine sounds from a half-dozen old-school districts.The Karl Ove Knausgaard of grumpy independent musicians.By Sam Hockley-SmithMark Kozelek, who used to front an epically moody band called Red House Painters, is known as something of a jerk.

But on the records he now releases as Sun Kil Moon, he examines his life with plain-spoken brutality, saving the most cutting remarks for himself.\u201cI Watched the Film the Song Remains the Same\u201d occupies more than 10 minutes of \u201cBenji,\u201d the album he released in 2014. It begins as the story of the first time Kozelek saw the Led Zeppelin concert film \u201cThe Song Remains the Same\u201d as a child; it ends as a song about nostalgia, chronic sadness and the way people drop in and out of your life. One moment Kozelek\u2019s admiring the electric piano on \u201cNo Quarter\u201d; the next, he\u2019s sharing memories of being a \u201cvery melancholic kid,\u201d or apologizing for the time he punched a classmate in school. The way he writes isn\u2019t so different from Karl Ove Knausgaard, also in his late 40s; both men spent long careers skirting the spotlight, then found new renown when they started excavating their own biographies for details.So on \u201cBenji,\u201d Kozelek sings about his relationship with his parents, about buying lampshades, about death. A second cousin\u2019s death sets him thinking about family; James Gandolfini\u2019s sets him thinking about his prostate troubles. He approaches each topic as if flipping through a disorganized photo album, and the more insular and lived-in the details, the more enthralling they seem. At the end of \u201cI Watched the Film ... ,\u201d he says he\u2019s headed to Santa Fe to visit a friend he hasn\u2019t seen in 15 years. Close Googlers can deduce that friend must be Ivo Watts-Russell, who signed Red House Painters to his 4AD label back in 1992; Kozelek, grave and grateful, says he\u2019s going to New Mexico just to say thank you. \u2666How to chart your own path in a post-label music industry.By Jenna WorthamWatch the virtual-reality film that accompanies this article by downloading NYT VR.The women in attendance seemed especially mesmerized by Sydney Bennett \u2014 better known as Syd tha Kyd \u2014 the frontwoman, whose Tiger Beat sex appeal gave her performance a depth charge. Bennett, 23, brown-skinned with a blond-tinged Mohawk, has the swayback stance of an adolescent skater and dresses like one too: On the \u201cKimmel\u201d set, she wore black vans, a black T-shirt and black jeans low on her hips. As she sang, she roamed across each quadrant of the small stage, staring deep into the throng, as if to find out whether her crush had bothered to make an appearance at the show. To create her stage presence, Bennett studied the R.&B. singer D\u2019Angelo, whose 2000 video for \u201cUntitled (How Does It Feel)\u201d features nothing but his extremely defined and extremely nude upper body dripping with sweat for four and a half minutes. It showed. Bennett flirted with the crowd, peeking at them through her heavily lashed eyes, shooting sly smiles at fans and gently lifting her chin to acknowledge those she knew \u2014 among them, her mom, Janel, and her godmother, Sheryl.The TV appearance was a rarity for the members of the Internet, who, as their name suggests, live online and work from home. Two of the band\u2019s three albums were created and recorded almost entirely at the house where Bennett lives with her parents in L.A.\u2019s Mid-City neighborhood. But their most recent record, last year\u2019s \u201cEgo Death,\u201d caught the attention of the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences, and it was nominated for a Grammy in the Best Urban Contemporary Album category. (Past nominees in the category include Frank Ocean, Rihanna and Beyonc\u00e9.) The \u201cKimmel\u201d performance was a dip into mainstream media that the Internet has largely succeeded without.The band\u2019s name itself hints at an irreversible and inevitable shift in the way music works. For decades, the music industry fancied itself an apparatus for tastemaking, but as technology has made labels\u2019 role less relevant, that has ceased to be the case. Listeners decide what\u2019s popular now, and record labels have to find a way to attach themselves to it. Aside from a few big-name acts, most artists are doomed to languish in relative obscurity with middling profits. This is usually seen as a tragedy \u2014 the death of a musical middle class \u2014 but it has also presented an opportunity for artists to avoid the suffocating effects of the label machine. And so the Internet has carved out an entirely new corner of R.&B., thanks mostly to Bennett: an androgyne who sings seductive incantations about falling in and out of love with women.After the performance, a small constellation of cousins, little sisters and girlfriends milled about, snacking on doughnuts in the greenroom and helping the band pack up. After the equipment was loaded into a caravan of modest sedans and S.U.V.s, the band stood in a circle behind the studio, and someone produced a celebratory blunt. As the smoke drifted overhead, the conversation turned to the next day.The group needed to practice for the first stop on their upcoming tour, which would start a few days later in Japan. Jameel Bruner, who plays the keyboard, wouldn\u2019t be able to come until he was done with his shift at Amoeba Music, where he works as a clerk. There was drama to discuss, too. The 17-year-old guitar player, Steve Lacy, had been photographed smoking weed, and someone had texted the picture to his mother, who was not happy. Despite the chilly El Ni\u00f1o air, the band lingered, seeming reluctant to leave and break the spell of the evening. They eventually agreed to regroup at their home base, Bennett\u2019s house, to make sandwiches, catch their performance on \u201cKimmel,\u201d smoke again and, eventually, crash.The new virtual-reality film from NYT VR takes you inside Sydney Bennett\u2019s home studio as the Internet prepares for a world tour. You\u2019ll experience the rehearsal process as Bennett teaches her band a new song, then get onstage with the band as they perform it for the first time.Turner may have been reacting to the banality of the question, but his answer also illuminated a changing dynamic for rap, which has historically been categorized by regional sounds. People Turner and Bennett\u2019s age are defined by a completely different geography, the social networks and websites they spend their time on. Odd Future was the epitome of this new statelessness: They were neither engineered by a label nor hometown heroes, but something wildly different.Odd Future dominated many conversations about pop culture and the future of music by the end of 2010. They had released all of their early work \u2014 a barrage of clever mixtapes, striking artwork and bizarro music videos \u2014 for free on Tumblr and YouTube. Their sound was prodigious. And not only was their music different but they also looked different too, a bunch of black weirdos who skated in their free time and moshed onstage.The frenzy surrounding Odd Future reached its peak in 2011: Cartoon Network gave the group their own television show; plans for an Odd Future retail shop were in the works. Labels were desperate to sign deals with the group, and Sony Music Entertainment succeeded. The crew had the upper hand and persuaded the label to give them their own imprint, and to award each member a cushy solo record deal. Bennett, the D.J., got one, too.Music came naturally to Bennett. Though her parents are 9-to-5 people \u2014 Janel is a city clerk and her father, Howard, owns a manufacturing company based in China \u2014 her uncle, Mikey Bennett, is a producer in Jamaica. (He co-wrote Shabba Ranks\u2019s 1993 hit \u201cMr. Loverman.\u201d) When she was young, the family took vacations to the island, and Bennett hung out in the studio and watched her uncle work. \u201cAt some point, I started listening to music a little differently,\u201d Bennett said. \u201cRather than being like, Yo, this is dope \u2014 who made this? it started being like, I wish I made this.\u201dWhen she was 16, her parents let her transform their guesthouse into a studio, where she worked on her own songs and recorded local musicians. In high school, she took music-technology classes and piano lessons; at night, she devoured beat-making tutorials and messed around with music software. She downloaded tracks from LimeWire (a file-sharing network like Napster) and remixed them using Pro Tools and GarageBand. She didn\u2019t need much capital to be a producer, just good Google skills and a wealth of persistence and patience.Bennett gravitated toward artists who had pioneered brand-new sounds: The sonic spaciness of Missy Elliott, the stanky soul of Erykah Badu and the acid jazz of Jamiroquai. Pharrell Williams, the original black skater weirdo, is her patron saint. And like most kids interested in music and living in Los Angeles in the mid-2000s, Bennett knew about a teenager named Tyler Okonma who called himself Tyler, the Creator. He had a sizable following on MySpace, where he released his music. \u201cHis production drew me in,\u201d she told me. \u201cIt didn\u2019t sound like what everyone was making \u2014 it was different and hot.\u201d Bennett noticed that one of the people at the top of his friend list was a kid named Matt Martin (who goes by Matt Martians). She browsed through his page, listening to the songs he posted, too. She admired his ability to create deeply complex soundscapes, and she eventually messaged him, seeking advice on ways to advance her own style.The two became friends, trading feedback on songs, which put her into Okonma\u2019s orbit. And when Okonma needed a place to record the early Odd Future mixtapes, Bennett offered up her home studio. She produced some of their early tracks and eventually became the group\u2019s D.J. In old footage of early Odd Future shows, Bennett plays songs from a laptop on a table at the back of the stage. Tomboyish, in a muscle tee and a short haircut, she crackles with the manic energy that Odd Future shows were famous for. She was generally indistinguishable from the boys in the group.From the beginning, Odd Future was meant to be a galaxy of loosely knit projects; the whole point was for the members to collaborate and spin off solo efforts. Christian Clancy, one of the group\u2019s managers, had also been a marketing executive at Interscope Records, and around 2011 he took notice of Bennett and Martin\u2019s tight friendship and encouraged them to start recording together. After all, they liked the same sounds: jazz, old-school slow jams, neo-soul. So they began experimenting, and these experiments would eventually lead to the formation of the Internet.Odd Future was a rare example of a viral sensation with lasting power; the music industry is rife with the ghosts of web talents who couldn\u2019t be repackaged as megastars. The terms of the Internet\u2019s deal with Sony \u201callowed us to shape ourselves,\u201d Bennett says. The band is artistically cocooned, trying to create, as she sees it, an entirely new style of R.&B., one that includes all types of desire. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t a conscious thing,\u201d she emphasizes. \u201cI just like women.\u201dBennett personally related to the themes that lent Okonma\u2019s music its emotional gravity: alienation, isolation, loneliness. She felt they shared a connection, one born of \u201cnot being a typical black kid or even a popular kid.\u201d But eventually the hypermasculinity and caustic sense of humor wore on Bennett, who is naturally low-key. She made tearful calls to her mother from the road, wondering aloud whether she should quit. Bennett also struggled with depression, worsened by the stress of touring and feeling disconnected from her family and her girlfriend at the time. She says that no one in the group \u2014 other than Martin \u2014 seemed to care. \u201cI couldn\u2019t talk to any of them about it,\u201d she says. \u201cWe weren\u2019t all that close, and they never seemed to want to hear it.\u201dNot long after, Bennett began training her little brother, Travis \u2014 who goes by Taco \u2014 to take her place as Odd Future\u2019s D.J. Her musical experiments with Martin had begun to congeal into the core of their first album, \u201cPurple Naked Ladies,\u201d an amorphous but promising collection of experimental jam sessions and fuzzed-out, vibey tracks. One morning while Odd Future was on tour, when the group was watching the sun crest over a beach in Australia, Bennett broke the news that she was leaving. She says it was not well received. It felt like a divorce, like a family \u2014 however dysfunctional \u2014 falling apart.\u201cThey weren\u2019t happy about it,\u201d she says. \u201cI was their get-out-of-jail-free card. It\u2019s easy to say they aren\u2019t homophobic because Syd is there.\u201dBennett\u2019s exit came at a time when gender norms were blurring. Artists now feel more emboldened to hint at sexual fluidity; it\u2019s edgy, if not outright trendy. Musicians like Wiz Khalifa and Jaden Smith have been photographed wearing skirts and dresses. Angel Haze and Shamir have said they\u2019re genderqueer. But being openly gay can still feel especially difficult in the world of hip-hop and R.&B., where artists who are suspected of being closeted can face harsher scrutiny. Lesbianism is often fetishized, made into a hypersexualized performance. While Young Thug can get away with wearing nail polish, female artists who give off an even slightly masculine air, like the rapper Dej Loaf, are hounded about their orientation.Minya Oh, the hip-hop journalist who goes by Miss Info, thinks Bennett has benefited from upheaval in the industry. \u201cI\u2019m sure that on some level of the major-label and old-establishment industry, there are execs and agents who think homosexuality is a liability,\u201d she says. On the other hand, she adds, \u201cthere are more and more handlers and mentors and facilitators who will see a new artist who is gay as either an opportunity to tap into a new market or, at worst, just a talking point.\u201d But even more important than all that, Oh says, is that artists like Bennett may not even have to pander to the mainstream anymore: \u201cAs fragmented as music audiences are these days, it would be difficult to alienate fans who are already bunched into nomad tribes.\u201dBennett\u2019s outward manner is so nonchalant and mellow it can start to seem like an affectation, but as soon as the words left my mouth, Bennett put down her forkful of pancake and slid me a sideways look, the kind you give someone when your patience is wearing thin but you still feel obligated to be polite.The Internet \u2014 the network \u2014 has a way of normalizing fringe ideas, marginalized identities and emerging artists that old media tends to ignore. It has done such a good job, you could argue, that people like Bennett \u2014 black, queer and weird \u2014 can exist without the burden of having to represent something larger. Bennett will never be something she\u2019s not. She\u2019s not looking for validation from record labels, or even really from audiences. Later that night, as thousands of Mexican teenagers rushed the stage, singing along in English and screaming her name, Bennett looked completely at home, and completely herself. \u2666A song as salve in an age of rancor.By George SaundersHow does a song work? What does it actually do? It doesn\u2019t instruct, exactly, or teach, necessarily. A song, I\u2019d say, causes the listener to assume a certain stance. Through some intersection of melody/lyrics/arrangement, it causes a shadow-being within us to get a certain expression on its face and fall into a certain posture. (Argent\u2019s \u201cHold Your Head Up,\u201d for example, would cause my 1970s teenage self to assume a, well, Thor-like posture: stoic, windswept, capable of enduring any hardship while, you know, holding my head up.)How does the song accomplish this? Was that the intention? I\u2019m not sure. Like much of Wilco\u2019s work, it\u2019s fundamentally a damned good popular song (simple chords, compelling melody), rendered symphonic by a process by which the song, seemingly rebelling against its own simplicity, seems to be seeking higher levels of emotionality via sonic complexity. This led me to assume the song had to be a result of weeks of arranging. But reportedly the band recorded it in one take, learning it from the songwriter Jeff Tweedy as the tape rolled. The song starts with a catchy eight-note guitar riff, to which it keeps returning, like a well-intentioned guy steering back to his mantra. Via inventive instrumental fills and a false ending (from which it rejuvenates with renewed purpose), it manages the strange task of seeming contemplative while escalating like crazy. It puts me in mind of a group of lifelong pals on a front porch, trying to musically solve some existential problem they can\u2019t quite articulate.The effect of all of this on the listener \u2014 this listener anyway \u2014 is transformative. Listening to \u201cOne Sunday Morning\u201d (every time) fixes me \u2014 like some sort of aural medicine. I feel a positive alteration in my body and mind: a renewed sense of humility at the sadness of the world, and a corresponding resolve to keep trying to be better; freshly reminded of the stakes of being alive, and of the fact that there are, at my disposal, more positive resources than I am currently employing. In this, \u201cOne Sunday Morning\u201d serves, for me, as a reliable 12-minute prayer. \u2666The radical act of ending an album in midsentence.By Jace ClaytonAt first, I thought my MP3 must have been corrupted. There\u2019s a springy, up-tempo beat that kicks off \u201c\u201906,\u201d the last track on Vince Staples\u2019s 2015 debut double album, \u201cSummertime \u201906,\u201d whose 20 songs are stark portrayals of a childhood caught between gangs and the police in Southern California. A lengthy instrumental stretch in \u201c\u201906\u201d gives the listener a break. When Staples appears with a fulsome \u201cGood mornin\u2019! Hope you had a good time last night\u201d and starts rapping, it\u2019s one of the most optimistic-sounding moments on the album. He\u2019s midway through the first verse (\u201cI\u2019m finna bring the gang in the buil\u2014\u201d) when the song cuts to a blast of loud static, followed by silence. The effect is so jarring that it can easily be mistaken for an error, a glitch in the stream.When I learned that this tear into white noise was intentional, I was shocked. This went beyond breaking the rules. \u201c\u201906\u201d plays an entirely different game than most music. Its words and sounds don\u2019t matter. What matters here is the rupture. The track uses white noise to depict a kind of death, yet it\u2019s also the sound of a channel being changed or a TV or radio shutting off: Someone is controlling this switch. A young man has been unexpectedly silenced. When it\u2019s over for him, it\u2019s over for the listener, too.His compressed rhymes sparkle with aphoristic detail. The opening lines of \u201cSummertime \u201906\u201d are \u201cHey, I\u2019m just a nigga until I fill my pockets/And then I\u2019m Mr. Nigga, they follow me while shoppin\u2019/I feel like Mick and Richards, they feel like Muddy Waters/So tell me what\u2019s the difference, so tell me what\u2019s the difference?/My momma was a Christian, Crip walkin\u2019 on blue-waters.\u201d The references multiply into serious depth. Yet before we have time to consider the Rolling Stones\u2019 relationship to the blues or how churches and gangs may offer similar types of belonging or anything else, Staples has raced ahead to end the verse with a punch: \u201cUber driver in the cockpit look like Jeffrey Dahmer/But he lookin\u2019 at me crazy when we pull up to the projects.\u201dThere are no radio-friendly singles here. Staples likes to call out things as they are, but he is not a stern moralist; if he were, he probably wouldn\u2019t have landed his gig as a brand ambassador for Sprite. (\u201cDifferent \u2019cause I\u2019m just like you\u201d he says in a recent national TV ad for the soft drink.) The preternaturally gifted rapper dresses in unflashy T-shirts and jeans. He\u2019s straight edge (no alcohol or drugs), a shrewd experimentalist with a complex politics.The song that precedes \u201d\u201906,\u201d \u201cLike It Is,\u201d clues us in to what the shocking signal crash might mean. Over a lurching, industrial beat, Staples explains: \u201cYou looking at a person, telling them that they story don\u2019t matter really no better than me/walkin\u2019 down the streets tryna shoot at somebody.\u201d To deny the validity of another person\u2019s story, he says, is to deny them life. And even when one can voice his or her mind freely, to be a successful black rapper is to perform your persona before a predominantly white audience, whose aggregate opinion determines your worth. This is a problem Staples continually addresses, whether discussing how one of his ambitions is to leave the rap game (and move on to more reliable ways of earning a living) during interviews, or in songs like \u201cLift Me Up\u201d: \u201cAll these white folks chanting when I asked \u2019em \u2018Where my niggas at?\u2019/Goin\u2019 crazy, got me goin\u2019 crazy, I can\u2019t get with that.\u201d Rapping about it only aggravates the paradox; those lines have been among the most quoted in reviews of his album, used to praise his self-awareness.Then comes the static.Staples knows that possibilities for mainstream black visibility are few and fraught. Black entertainers in the celebrity spotlight mark one extreme, the grainy videoclips of African-Americans dying at the hands of the police, whose name-recognition is always posthumous, another. How to speak against that? You can\u2019t. You can only unplug.\u201c\u201906\u201d adds to a growing body of work by black artists who flirt with disappearance in order to trouble the idea of representation itself. In \u201cConcerto in Black and Blue,\u201d David Hammons\u2019s 2002 piece for a series of pitch-black rooms in a large SoHo gallery, visitors were invited to explore with tiny blue flashlights. Their looking was the only thing to see. When the dancer-choreographer Storyboard P performs for video, he exploits the camera\u2019s two-dimensional limitations to create on-screen moves that appear simultaneously awkward and impossibly fluid. He dances as if he doesn\u2019t want to be captured, in gravity-defying bends and evasions \u2014 all escape, no center. The poet Claudia Rankine, in her 2004 book \u201cDon\u2019t Let Me Be Lonely,\u201d opens each section with an image of a TV showing static. \u201cThe years went by and people only died on television,\u201d she writes. \u201cIf they weren\u2019t Black, they were wearing black or were terminally ill.\u201dThe jagged conclusion of \u201c\u201906\u201d asks what it might mean to turn away from self-representation in sound. White noise is a spray of pitches and volumes that contains all audible frequencies. It is constant and patternless. Quite literally, it\u2019s the sound of undifferentiated possibility. One can think of Staples\u2019s provocative noise as the opposite of a stereotype, or freedom in sonic form. His signal fritzes into static with a snarl of hope: Noise and silence mark the edges of what can be considered music. To end an album like this points to a world beyond the song and to hands manipulating the transmission. What can be said outside the culture\u2019s limiting expectations, and who might we become if we learn to listen to it? \u2666A singular voice, aching with desperation and resolve.By Carlo Rotella Price usually drops down in pitch when she sings the second syllable of \u201cbottle,\u201d but sometimes she takes it up a bluesy interval instead, turning a honky-tonk lament into a call to arms. The two deliveries of the line play up countervailing qualities of desperation and resolve in her voice. Together they make it sound as if she\u2019s exerting considerable strength of character to keep despair and bad luck from carrying her song off the road and headlong into a telephone pole. This instantly detectable tension in her voice causes listeners to become alert, even alarmed, the moment she starts singing.\u201cHurtin\u2019 \u201c is the first single from Price\u2019s album \u201cMidwest Farmer\u2019s Daughter,\u201d which will be released by Jack White\u2019s Third Man Records on March 25. She\u2019s being rolled out with the fanfare appropriate to the next big thing out of Nashville, as the appearance on Colbert suggests, but she\u2019s not on country\u2019s standard ing\u00e9nue track. At 32, having weathered lean times and near misses, she\u2019s more of a hard-bitten classicist. Her album title evokes Loretta Lynn\u2019s \u201cCoal Miner\u2019s Daughter,\u201d and her diction, especially the way she chews on the word \u201cpain,\u201d raises echoes of Tammy Wynette; her mask of barroom bravado over tender vulnerability recalls Merle Haggard; and her band, the Price Tags, favors old-school arrangements, with Luke Schneider\u2019s pedal-steel guitar weaving prominently around her voice.As attention has built around Price, she has sometimes found herself placed in a cohort with Chris Stapleton, Sturgill Simpson and other scruffy dissenters who have recently made inroads into the dominion of the bro acts currently ruling Nashville\u2019s major labels and country radio. As the underground rocker-turned-\u201dcountry/garage\u201d producer Jonathan Bright has suggested, if current Nashville stars like Luke Bryan and Florida Georgia Line are the equivalent of M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce and other such glam-pop acts who dominated rock in the late 1980s, Price and company could be part of country\u2019s long-awaited back-to-basics riposte. Roots-music boosters are always announcing that the inevitable cyclical swing back to hard-country twang has begun, but listening to Price \u2014 or watching the growly, uncute Stapleton clean up at the Country Music Association Awards last November \u2014 you can begin to believe that maybe it\u2019s really happening.The songs on \u201cMidwest Farmer\u2019s Daughter\u201d mine the experience of further hard knocks. Her parents lost the family\u2019s corn-and-soybean farm in Buffalo Prairie, Ill., and her father went to work as a prison guard. Price endured a run of professional disappointment and personal sorrow after arriving in Nashville in 2003. With her husband, Jeremy Ivey, who plays bass in the Price Tags and writes songs with her, she tried her hand at rock and soul and made a brief, unhappy foray into writing commercial country music. Serially turned away, ripped off and let down by operators in the music industry, she grew used to selling her meager possessions to pick up and start over, waitressing, hoping for some luck. \u201cI can\u2019t count all the times I\u2019ve been had,\u201d she sings in \u201cThis Town Gets Around,\u201d her ode to the lecherous manager, fraudulent publicist and other Music Row animals who preyed upon her.Five years ago she gave birth to twin sons, one of whom died of a rare heart ailment two weeks later. She sank low after that and couldn\u2019t pull herself out of it. Drinking didn\u2019t help. \u201cIt just snowballed,\u201d she says. \u201cI felt as if I was cursed, some kind of running cosmic joke.\u201d A long weekend in the Davidson County jail after a drunken-driving incident persuaded her to get help and break the downward momentum. \u201cWeekender,\u201d a jail song on the album, is a good girl\u2019s rueful acknowledgment that the women in lockup are tougher and less fortunate than she is. \u201cThey were hard, and I was really scared,\u201d she says. \u201cThey could tell by your shoes that you were just a weekender.\u201dShe and Ivey sold their car to finance the recording of \u201cMidwest Farmer\u2019s Daughter\u201d at Sun Studio in Memphis. The album was rejected all over Nashville and eventually picked up by a label they didn\u2019t even consider approaching. Despite having a Nashville office, Third Man Records isn\u2019t widely known for producing country music (though Jack White produced a comeback album for Loretta Lynn in 2004). But Price\u2019s habit of putting vocal soul shadings into even the most straight-ahead country songs makes her an impure traditionalist, and therefore a surprisingly good fit for Third Man. Ben Swank, who runs the company with White and Ben Blackwell, says, \u201cWe\u2019re coming from a punk-rock, indie-rock background that discovered blues and American music in reverse,\u201d an aesthetic that tends to value emotional power over stylistic orthodoxy.Swank believes that Price\u2019s career travails might have fortuitously delayed her album just long enough to allow Third Man to take advantage of a new openness to \u201ca classical sound\u201d in country music. Another name for that sound is Americana: high-gloss corporate country\u2019s earthier foil and partner, which embraces not only folk traditions but also vintage commercial styles drawn magpie-fashion from bygone eras. Pointing in particular to the career of Stapleton \u2014 who went from writing pop-flavored radio fare for established stars to become a major-label juggernaut singing spare, bluesy songs in the outlaw country mold \u2014 Swank says: \u201cNow there are others who have knocked on the door. If she had come along two years earlier, maybe it\u201d \u2014 the next-big-thing buzz \u2014 \u201cwouldn\u2019t have happened.\u201dPrice\u2019s son, Judah, climbed on and off her lap as a stylist enlarged her blond hair. Friends and family were temporarily shooed away as she put on something tight and fringed. Foot traffic milled in and out of other dressing rooms along the hall, and from one came a furious burst of picking as a bluegrass band warmed up.Out on the main stage, Price sang her allotted two songs, ending with \u201cHurtin.\u2019 \u201c The band came to a full stop for her honky-tonk cadenza: \u201cThat don\u2019t touch . . . the paiiiinnnnn . . . you put . . . on . . . meeeeee,\u201d with a slow-rising two-note flourish on the final word. Robust applause followed, and then Mike Snider, the banjo player who serves as one of the Opry\u2019s chief traditionalist voices, said: \u201cGood job, Margo, you sweet little old thing. Good to have somebody come out here and sing country again.\u201d There was laughter, some knowing and some a little too hearty, in the crowd and among the house musicians onstage and the insiders thronging the wings. \u201cBy golly,\u201d Snider said, \u201cthat was stronger than new rope.\u201d \u2666The world\u2019s greatest session drummer confronts the machine age.By Jeff HimmelmanChamberlain, 48, is a session player paid by the project, a below-the-radar rock star who often shows up only in the liner notes. If you watched MTV in the \u201990s, you heard him drumming with Pearl Jam in their \u201cAlive\u201d video or with Fiona Apple or Tori Amos or the Wallflowers. He has appeared on records by everyone from Bruce Springsteen and David Bowie to Frank Ocean and Kanye West, toured with the Indigo Girls and Soundgarden, spent a season as the drummer for the \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d band. He played drums on the \u201cFrozen\u201d soundtrack for Disney. In a world of dwindling recording budgets and increased automation, he could well be the last one drumming before software takes over completely.At Blackbird Studio in Nashville, Urban told Chamberlain that he had \u201cJohn Cougar\u201d down on his acoustic guitar, but it felt too formulaic. He\u2019d been listening to the rapper Kendrick Lamar and wanted a groove that could not only propel the song but inspire an altogether new sound for it. Chamberlain assembled a drum loop \u2014 a small-scale mechanical repetition born more of hip-hop than country \u2014 and then played live drums over the loop, deepening the timbre and also providing accents and fills when the movement of the verses seemed to require it. Urban pronounced the whole package \u201csexy\u201d; in the sought-for moment of inspiration, he would put down his acoustic guitar in favor of an electric bass. Within a couple of hours, the drums-bass-and-voice opening and the entire vibe of the song were effectively complete. The catchy arrangement and on-the-nose country twang of the title and chorus eventually sent \u201cJohn Cougar\u201d to the second spot on Billboard\u2019s U.S. Country Airplay chart.This is the work of the modern session drummer, and it is why, when a major-label project needs drums, Chamberlain is often the first person producers call. When we met in Los Angeles in February, he posed his value proposition as a question: \u201cWhat can you add to a situation that\u2019s totally out of context but works?\u201d Chamberlain is good enough at playing his instruments \u2014 and at reading what producers and artists want \u2014 that they\u2019re willing to pay him well to make that kind of determination for them. And so he lives at an odd intersection, or perhaps a vanishing point; part virtuoso whose skills have never been more relevant, part John Henry figure, hammering away as music is increasingly composed and performed by machines.\u201cI do more and more work out of my studio because nobody has a budget anymore,\u201d he told me. \u201cThe Keith Urbans of the world can fly me to the studio because people still go to Walmart and buy country records.\u201d For the people who can\u2019t afford to fly him out, Chamberlain offers his services remotely from Van Nuys. He has a full recording studio set up: a control room stocked with vintage gear and a large soundproof tracking room where two drum kits sit miked and ready to go. There are drums everywhere, more than anybody should rightly own, stacked on top of each other and hanging from racks: multiple rock kits, a Brazilian pandeiro, Tibetan bells, a 40-gallon oil can rigged with a spring that Chamberlain pounded with evident joy and a built-in cupboard with 20 slots for different snares, each of which is filled. He has a vintage Ludwig Supraphonic (\u201cWhat John Bonham would have played\u201d), a 1930s Slingerland Radio King (\u201cFat and dead\u201d), a 1900s snare with a calfskin head. As he finished giving me a tour, he said: \u201cYou know sample libraries? These are the physical versions of the samples.\u201dWhen I stopped by, Chamberlain was tracking drums for a British singer named Hattie Webb. The first track had some programmed electronic drums already attached as a guide; Webb\u2019s producer had asked Chamberlain, via email, to \u201cbuild it, make it electronic-y with some acoustic elements.\u201d Chamberlain listened to the song twice, charting out its structure on a legal pad, and then he went into the tracking room, where he had a little setup that he called his \u201celectronic/analog kit\u201d \u2014 a small kick drum, a tiny snare that he had purpose-made for work like this and a cymbal with holes in it to sharpen the sound.He cued up the track and then, without any practice, played along with it, sounding so much like the programming that it was almost hard to believe it could be a live performance. And yet his playing also ebbed and flowed in ways that the programmed drums didn\u2019t, or couldn\u2019t. After that single immaculate take, Chamberlain returned to the control room, listened for about 30 seconds and said, \u201cThat sounds cool.\u201d He then set about making a drum loop to go along with the part he had just played. Within an hour or two, the track acquired shaker, tambourine and four flourish-filled runs on a full drum kit, just to give the production team some different options.Chamberlain is an elegant player; no movement is wasted. He plays with a traditional underhand grip, which is more often associated with jazz than rock. Sometimes, looking at him, you can\u2019t believe the range and sheer volume of sound he\u2019s producing. By 6:30 p.m., Chamberlain finished the second of the tracks Webb had sent to him and uploaded both to his Dropbox account to be accessed by the producers in England. Then he went home to make pasta with his wife.North Texas State (now the University of North Texas) accepted him into its music program on a scholarship, but he lasted less than a year. One of the percussion teachers threw a plastic piece of excrement at him while he was performing; another banged a gong in the middle of a piece and yelled, \u201cGo practice!\u201d It wasn\u2019t exactly the atmosphere he had imagined. \u201cI just wanted to play drums,\u201d he says. He didn\u2019t help matters by getting himself thrown out of his dorm for smoking pot. For a while he slept in his practice room with his head on the pillow in his kick drum.After he left school, Chamberlain moved to the Deep Ellum neighborhood of Dallas, about 40 miles away, where he played in several bands, often just for food or enough cash to put gas in his car. He eventually found himself living next door to Brad Houser, the bass player for Edie Brickell & New Bohemians, and after some problems with their original drummer during the recording of their first album, the band hired Chamberlain to tour with them. \u201cWhat I Am,\u201d the first single off \u201cShooting Rubberbands at the Stars,\u201d blew up so fast that his first major gig with the band outside Dallas was on \u201cSaturday Night Live.\u201d Chamberlain had just turned 21. He toured with Brickell for a couple of years and recorded a second record, \u201cGhost of a Dog,\u201d with the band, which broke up around the time Brickell married Paul Simon. (The band, without Chamberlain, has since reunited.)Chamberlain spent a summer touring with Pearl Jam, then returned to \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d as drummer for the house band \u2014 a job that for many musicians would be a career capper. TV gigs in general, and the \u201cS.N.L.\u201d gig in particular, offer the kind of steady, high-paying work that is pretty much impossible for musicians to find anywhere else. After a year, though, Chamberlain decided to move to Seattle. \u201cI had a whole house with a buddy of mine in a decent part of town, we could play music in it all day long and we each paid $250 rent,\u201d he told me, laughing. \u201cHow do you beat that?\u201dIn 1994, Chamberlain got a call from a little-known band called the Wallflowers, fronted by Bob Dylan\u2019s son Jakob. The band liked Chamberlain\u2019s drumming on \u201cGhost of a Dog\u201d and wondered if he\u2019d help them out in the studio. That work resulted in a single called \u201cOne Headlight\u201d that helped the band sell several million records. The Wallflowers\u2019 manager also represented a new and promising artist named Fiona Apple, and he asked if Chamberlain would play the drums for her too. Both albums \u201cdid really well,\u201d he told me, in characteristically understated fashion. \u201cSo that\u2019s kind of how you end up being a session musician. If you\u2019re not in a band, you\u2019re the guy who played on those records.\u201dChamberlain\u2019s network of producers and friends has continued to expand, and that\u2019s mostly how he gets his work. Over the last 15 years, he has played hundreds of sessions with some of music\u2019s biggest names, put out several side-project records and toured with Tori Amos and others whenever he could. A high-level studio musician in Los Angeles like Chamberlain can pull in as much as $2,000 for a day of work, though Chamberlain\u2019s rates fluctuate widely, depending on whom he\u2019s working with. He acknowledged that, with changes in the music business brought on by streaming and other technological innovations, \u201cthe herd is getting thinned\u201d in terms of the number of artists with sizable recording budgets. But demand for his services remains strong. In a poll to be published later this year, the readers of Modern Drummer have named him the best studio player in the business.Ryan Gruss, the Loop Loft\u2019s chief executive, showed me the sheet he had prepared for a previous session with the legendary drummer Omar Hakim, who has played for the likes of Michael Jackson, Madonna and Miles Davis. For Hakim, Gruss had typed out descriptions of beats and suggested tempos to go along with them, but there was no such list for Chamberlain. As an engineer got the kit sounding right in the control room, Chamberlain roamed over the drums and settled into a rhythm that Gruss liked. They set up a click track \u2014 a metronome that plays in Chamberlain\u2019s headphones \u2014 at the same tempo, then Chamberlain let loose for about five minutes, cycling through grooves, chorus feels, different patterns of the same basic beat.Over the next four hours, Chamberlain would roll through nine other grooves and five different setups, swapping out drums and cymbals in search of new sounds and textures. For one set of beats, he moved to the small \u201celectronic/analog kit\u201d and played it with Brazilian shakers instead of sticks. The 1900s snare with the calfskin head made an appearance and, somehow, sounded almost entirely synthetic and computerized, which Chamberlain hadn\u2019t anticipated. The Loop Loft team was happy just to sit back and watch, one of them muttering \u201cJesus\u201d under his breath whenever Chamberlain really let fly.\u201cI\u2019m a working musician,\u201d Chamberlain said to me at one point, with an emphasis on \u201cworking.\u201d Because he\u2019s not a songwriter or a member of a band, he doesn\u2019t get many residual checks or royalty payments \u2014 what musicians refer to as \u201cmailbox money.\u201d Even when times are good, he has to hustle. Sometimes he\u2019s in the studio with the Loop Loft; sometimes he\u2019s the guy Adele\u2019s producers call when she\u2019s writing in Los Angeles (for a track that didn\u2019t make her latest record); sometimes he\u2019s the guy the billionaire Paul Allen hires for a vanity rock project featuring, among other top-tier musicians, the Eagles guitarist Joe Walsh. (Sample song title: \u201cSix Strings From Hell.\u201d) Even on days off, Chamberlain goes into his studio and practices for a couple of hours.When the Loop Loft session was over, Chamberlain wandered in and out of the control room, packing up his gear for another recording stint with Keith Urban. This time the sessions would include the Welsh bassist Pino Palladino, one of the most respected players around. Instead of adding drums to a previously recorded track, Chamberlain would be playing live with Palladino in the studio. Chamberlain loves playing live above all else, for those moments when the music takes an inexplicable turn but somehow everybody stays together. No machine could match it. \u201cWith great musicians,\u201d he said, \u201cyou feel like you can\u2019t do anything wrong.\u201d \u2666A pop star claims a little time for herself.By Doreen St. F\u00e9lixMusical duets are usually ordered by heterosexual difference and its various dramas. As in: She gives, he takes. He pleads, she refuses. They may reconcile, but the performers always observe the classic sex distinction \u2014 making the circumstances of the female vocalist a good barometer for the circumstances of female speech in general.But Rihanna, pop\u2019s great maven of self-gratification, is a known loner, and she flouts that kind of reciprocal identity all the time. So it follows that even on her latest album\u2019s true duet, she would choose a vocal mirror, not a vocal foil. On \u201cConsideration,\u201d the first track on \u201cAnti,\u201d Rihanna and the genre-fluid singer SZA are two branches of the same river, braiding in and out. The women put on their respective versions of a placid attitude \u2014 Rihanna sings with cheek, SZA cheerlessly. Each is calm but, you suspect, coursing toward some possible furor. They sing into each other; their vocal registers match so closely that on first listen, you might even miss that Rihanna isn\u2019t singing by herself. The closeness approaches uncanny, suggests an erotics of the self. Rihanna\u2019s voice sinks into SZA\u2019s, which rises back into Rihanna\u2019s, the voices first crossing on these: \u201cWhy you ain\u2019t ever let me grow?/When I look outside my window/I can\u2019t get no peace of mind.\u201d If \u201dAnti\u201d has a thesis, it\u2019s this declaration of insolence.I almost used the usual expression \u2014 a \u201cdeclaration of independence.\u201d Then I remembered how secretive the two women sound, the complete disinterest the lyrics communicate. The way Rihanna likens herself to our most uncivil cultural child, Peter Pan: \u201cI came fluttering in from Neverland/Time can never stop me.\u201d I hear her indignation; I hear a clear defection from the typical girl-power conceit. \u201cConsideration\u201d could not care less about sounding like a feminist anthem in the proper way, one that telegraphs passive misandry in the service of forcing female communion. It\u2019s an anti-anthem, a song for the individual in a world full of cheap calls to solidarity \u2014 a misanthrope\u2019s chorus, built for people who would rather be alone, unseen and isolated from the work of being a girl. (\u201cWould you mind giving my reflection a break/from the pain it\u2019s feeling now?\u201d) Michael Jackson, long reviled for his identification with the boy Peter Pan, might have originated this kind of audacity, refusing to relate to society as much as society wanted to relate to him.Rihanna often returns to Barbados, the landmass that bore her. Like that island country, \u201cConsideration\u201d connects to nothing outside itself; it\u2019s a salve for those of us seeking mental and political quiet, an adult lullaby castigating the spectacle of public life. The song is haughtily against the \u201coutside\u201d; it invokes the private air of an enclosed room. I\u2019d like to stay inside, too, looking out the window, listening to the echo of my own voice. \u2666Riding a lo-fi sound to semifame.By John Wray\u201cI\u2019ll see discussions sometimes, on message boards online, about the sound I get from my guitar,\u201d Mac DeMarco said one overcast February afternoon as we drove around Far Rockaway, Queens. \u201cIt\u2019s kids, mostly, trying to figure it out: \u2018How does he get that freaky tone? What kind of pedals? What amp?\u2019\u201d He turned to me and grinned, showing the gap between his teeth. \u201cWhat they don\u2019t realize is that the guitar I\u2019ve played since I was 16 is a no-name piece of garbage that I bought at a pawnshop for about 30 bucks. It\u2019s got a loose neck, its pickup magnet is broken into tiny pieces and the pick guard is a piece of siding that I got from my Hasidic neighbor\u2019s house in Montreal.\u201d He laughed. \u201cFor a while there were bugs living in it. Actual bugs. It was cute.\u201dWe were driving along Rockaway Beach Boulevard in a borrowed car, because DeMarco\u2019s station wagon wouldn\u2019t start. At the owner\u2019s request, DeMarco was grading the CDs in the glove compartment with a pen: B+ for Morrissey, C- for Belle and Sebastian, an enthusiastic A+ for the Grateful Dead. \u201cMy life is stupid right now,\u201d he told me. \u201cI put a pair of my sneakers on eBay a while ago \u2014 partly to raise money for this girls\u2019 rock camp in Brooklyn, but mostly just as a joke \u2014 and some dude pushed the bidding up to 21 grand.\u201d He grinned again. \u201cIt turned out he didn\u2019t have the money, because he was, like, 13 years old. But that\u2019s still pretty sick.\u201dGiven the turn DeMarco\u2019s career has taken, his attitude of giddy disbelief makes perfect sense. In the course of four albums in as many years \u2014 \u201cRock and Roll Night Club,\u201d \u201c2,\u201d \u201cSalad Days\u201d and \u201cAnother One,\u201d all released by the pint-size Brooklyn label Captured Tracks \u2014 DeMarco has progressed from quasi squatter to bona fide indie-rock star, playing sold-out shows from New York to Los Angeles and basking in a degree of Internet fame that he finds hard to comprehend. In \u201cBacker,\u201d a bleakly hilarious clip, featuring none of his music whatsoever, DeMarco impersonates a depressed loser from Edmonton who guides cars into parking spots for a living. It has received around 400,000 views on YouTube. \u201cSalad Days,\u201d his 2014 breakout album, has been played more than five million times on YouTube, more than the Wu-Tang Clan album \u201cA Better Tomorrow,\u201d released the same year. DeMarco\u2019s brand of fame, however, is far from the rarefied, untouchable variety that stars like the RZA or Jack White enjoy: The more famous DeMarco gets, the more accessible he seems to become. \u201cKids think of me as a guy who\u2019d hang out with them and actually enjoy myself,\u201d he told me. \u201cAnd they\u2019re basically right.\u201dThe house he rents in Arverne, Queens, is an unprepossessing four-bedroom cottage in a lower-middle-class neighborhood, with cigarette butts peppering the lawn. When I rang his bell, he came to the door in boxers and a rumpled Hugo Boss T-shirt, greeted me with slightly bleary-eyed politeness, then led me past guitar cases and piles of laundry and a cluster of half-inflated party balloons to the kitchen, where Kiera McNally, his girlfriend of five years, was baking gluten-free banana bread. Over a cup of diner-style coffee \u2014 from an industrial steady-drip machine that DeMarco pointed out to me with pride \u2014 I asked what the repercussions of inviting hundreds of thousands of fans to his house had been.\u201cIt\u2019s cold outside now, so it isn\u2019t too bad,\u201d DeMarco said. \u201cRight after the EP came out, in August, we were averaging maybe 50 kids a day.\u201d He glanced toward McNally, who was diplomatically focusing on the banana bread. \u201cThe only thing that bugged me about it, personally, was the feeling I got that some of them hadn\u2019t even heard my music. I\u2019m basically a meme to a lot of these kids. It can get a bit weird.\u201dThe music DeMarco makes has been enthusiastically received by critics, but reviews of his albums can be frustrating to read: They tend to lean heavily on labels like \u201cslacker rock,\u201d \u201cchill wave\u201d and \u201cblue wave,\u201d to name only a few. \u201cWhat the hell does \u2018blue wave\u2019 even mean?\u201d DeMarco said. \u201cI have no idea.\u201dThe first song of his that I heard, \u201cBlue Boy,\u201d from \u201cSalad Days,\u201d is a bright, airy trifle, almost a lullaby, in which heartfelt advice to an insecure friend \u2014 \u201cNo use acting so tough/come down, sweetheart, and grow up\u201d \u2014 is subtly undercut by the ever-so-slightly camp vocals and even more so by the lead guitar, which seems to drift woozily in and out of tune. King Sunny Ade came to mind as I listened, as did Jerry Garcia, an acknowledged influence, but I found it nearly impossible to pin down the music I was hearing, or even to date it. Like many of DeMarco\u2019s best songs, \u201cBlue Boy\u201d sounds like the work of someone who spent his formative years combing through record-store bargain bins, carefully discarding anything that might conceivably be characterized as tasteful. It\u2019s an approach that has yielded dividends for musicians in the Internet age before \u2014 Washed Out comes to mind, as does Ariel Pink \u2014 but none of those artists\u2019 albums can claim five million YouTube plays.The family has musicians on both sides: a lyric soprano, a jazz saxophonist, an uncle who lives in London and sings standards. Agnes herself had a stint, as a teenager, singing at parties and weddings around Edmonton.At 16, Mac started recording songs in his room, by himself \u2014 the way he still records all his music \u2014 and playing in a band called Belgium with two friends from high school, Alec Meen and Peter Sagar. \u201cWe were trying to sound melodic and indie, like Pavement or Dinosaur Jr., even though all I knew how to play were Jeff Beck-style blues riffs,\u201d he told me. \u201cThey kept the band going after I moved to Vancouver, which was fine with me; it was pretty much their thing, anyway. I always hated the name Belgium.\u201dIn Vancouver, where he lived for a time in the boiler room of a printmaking studio for 200 Canadian dollars a month, DeMarco continued recording songs, posting them on Myspace under the name Makeout Videotape. \u201cThe first time you\u2019re out somewhere and some guy comes up to you and says: \u2018I heard that song you put up online. Pretty cool,\u2019 it\u2019s the weirdest thing,\u201d he told me, shaking his head. \u201cI got to be part of a scene that had started around this club called the Emergency Room, with bands who were already touring in the U.S. They were all these great, noisy, lo-fi bands, and I halfway fit in, mainly because I had no idea how to record. But I was trying to write Beatles songs the whole time.\u201dWhile performing at a music festival in Calgary, DeMarco reconnected with McNally, whom he knew in high school, and within the year they moved to Montreal together. \u201cWe had a hard time in Montreal,\u201d he told me. \u201cI worked the night shift at this cheap grocery store called Segal\u2019s, a 50-cents-for-a-wheel-of-brie kind of place.\u201d The job at Segal\u2019s, joyless though it was, provided a pivotal ingredient in his evolving aesthetic: a daily dose of schmaltzy classic rock. \u201cHearing that kind of music all the time \u2014 Dire Straits, Toto, Van Halen \u2014 it affected me,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can either embrace that stuff or let it drive you insane.\u201d He paused for a moment. \u201cTo tell you the truth, I\u2019m not a big Dire Straits fan, even now. But I found something in those songs that I could use.\u201dAfter a barely perceptible hesitation, he played the songs gently, sincerely and with a devotion and skill that were never entirely obscured by the grin on his face or the jokes he cracked. (\u201cA D.U.I.? I don\u2019t think so. I take a helicopter to work. I\u2019m Billy Joel!\u201d) Before his third and final song \u2014 \u201cStill Together,\u201d the closing track on \u201c2\u201d \u2014 he brought McNally out onstage to join him, beaming like a schoolboy, and kissed her lovingly but chastely on the cheek. I was reminded, watching them together, of something DeMarco told me on our drive. \u201cGrowing up in Edmonton, the horizon is so far away, you don\u2019t even realize it\u2019s there,\u201d he said. \u201cThis might all be over in six months, but there\u2019s nothing wrong with my life now. Not a thing.\u201d He nodded to himself for a moment. \u201cThe only thing I\u2019ve got to do is fix my car.\u201d \u2666Let\u2019s get it on. Or not.By Jia TolentinoCharlie Puth\u2019s brand is blandness: he\u2019s a pop star for the age of sponsored content. A fresh-faced, vanilla-flavored, Berklee-trained 24-year-old, Puth landed three singles on Top 40 radio in the year before he released his 2016 debut album, \u201cNine Track Mind.\u201d His style is marked by retro aesthetics and an almost haunting level of glibness, as encapsulated by his first single, the recent radio smash \u201cMarvin Gaye.\u201dYou may think you\u2019ve never heard \u201cMarvin Gaye,\u201d but it\u2019s possible you just haven\u2019t listened to it. It\u2019s a song that tends to register via alternate senses, a clamminess on the nape of your neck or a cloying taste, like children\u2019s cough syrup, in the back of your mouth. The platinum-selling doo-wop duet features the artist Meghan Trainor (who, like Puth, has thus far used her considerable songwriting talent to create songs so depthless they feel like waxworks).It\u2019s a song about sex that induces not lust but a feeling of desolation. \u201cLet\u2019s Marvin Gaye and get it on,\u201d sing Puth and Trainor brightly. \u201cYou got that healing that I want. Just like they say it in the song: until the dawn, let\u2019s Marvin Gaye and get it on.\u201dThe chorus feels like a bouncy castle inflated with hot air and ghosts, but in a technical sense, it\u2019s perfect. Its phrasing follows the classic AABA doo-wop format, and its four-chord progression (I, vi, IV, V) is emblematic of the genre: These are the ice-cream chords of \u201cHeart and Soul,\u201d \u201cBlue Moon\u201d and \u201cPlease Mr. Postman.\u201d Tweaked, the same progression can take on depth and winsomeness \u2014 with a 7th thrown in, you get \u201cUnchained Melody\u201d and with a 9th, \u201cEvery Breath You Take.\u201d But with the exception of a verse that has Trainor singing over a beat Puth describes (inaccurately) as a \u201chard-ass distorted 808\u201d drum machine, the track replicates the late \u201950s with unimaginative servility. Sonically, it lives a decade and a half before the song it\u2019s referencing; Marvin Gaye released \u201cLet\u2019s Get It On\u201d in 1973.In 1965, Gaye recalled to his biographer, he was listening to one of his songs playing on the radio when it was interrupted by a news bulletin about the riots in Watts. \u201cWith the world exploding around me, how am I supposed to keep singing love songs?\u201d No such scruples trouble Puth, who wrote his track as a \u201cmusical icebreaker,\u201d he told Billboard. \u201cIf you hear it on the radio or at a bar, it\u2019s a way to say: \u2018Hey! Let\u2019s Marvin Gaye and get it on.\u2019\u201d And so \u201cMarvin Gaye\u201d got its new use and meaning as a pickup line, dreamed up by an artist whose means is glibness and end is comfort, who can\u2019t imagine the fight that Gaye\u2019s love was built on, who sings about sex as if it\u2019s his due rather than a port of call in a storm. \u2666Who gets to say how black people see themselves?By Marlon James \u201cButterfly\u201d arrived at an unprecedented moment in pop. Black artists, as they conquered the mainstream, were getting even blacker. Kanye might have gotten there first (at least he probably thinks so) with \u201cNew Slaves\u201d and \u201cBlack Skinhead,\u201d and now even Beyonc\u00e9 is place-checking New Orleans and image-checking the Black Panthers. But Kanye was still speaking to the white gaze, the hatred and desire in it, and taking revenge by getting all black-sex-machine on somebody\u2019s white wife. \u201cButterfly\u201d is instead Toni Morrison circa \u201cSula\u201d: not looking outside for either validation or opposition. Black love, black empowerment, black history and black wisdom are explored so deeply and intelligently that you assume that conservative media fetish, black-on-black crime, will never show up. But then, in the third verse of \u201cThe Blacker the Berry,\u201d when Kendrick is waxing lyrical on Trayvon Martin\u2019s death, it does. All of a sudden \u201cBlacker\u201d becomes a song about black accountability while black men are being murdered and the implausible logic of slamming two ideas into the same thought. I was right there with him until that third verse.You can\u2019t be a hip-hop head and not be hit by \u201cThe Blacker the Berry.\u201d It brings the boom-bap from the get-go, dropping funk on the one, like an update of the drum break that opens NWA\u2019s album \u201cStraight Outta Compton.\u201d And even though I was tired of people\u2019s mapping anger onto blackness, Lamar\u2019s detonation of rage and wit was (and is) unmatched in hip-hop. He grabs at stereotypes as if they\u2019re slipping out of his fingers (\u201cMy hair is nappy,\u201d he says. \u201cMy nose is round and wide\u201d) and throws them right back at whoever would deploy them. He\u2019s not even rapping so much as spitting fire, jumping on a line, retracing it, firing it back at you, like the boxer Jack Johnson when he said: \u201cI\u2019m black, they never let me forget it. I\u2019m black, all right, I\u2019ll never let them forget it.\u201d Kendrick fuels his \u201cI\u2019m black\u201d with the knowledge that ain\u2019t a damn thing changed. He leaves it to the Jamaican DJ Assassin to bring backup in the chorus, drawing the line from plantation to street corner and the switch in who controls black self-determination, from the \u201cwhips left scars \u2019pon me back\u201d to the \u201cthe big whip parked \u2019pon the block.\u201dThe last couplet on the second verse echoes the first, with a crucial change: \u201cYou sabotage my community, makin\u2019 a killin\u2019/you made me a killer,\u201d turns into, \u201cHow can I tell you I\u2019m making a killin\u2019?/You made me a killer\u201d \u2014 and the different spin on \u201ckilling\u201d weighs a ton. In the first instance, exploitation and indifference make him a killer. In the second, his success comes from America\u2019s obsession with his assuming he looks like one. It was almost unbearable to anticipate what this prophet of rage was going to drop next.And then he dropped it.I could feel the verse pulling away from me as soon as he got halfway into it. It turned into call-and-response, me and this third verse, which went a little something like this:\u201cIt\u2019s funny how Zulu and Xhosa might go to war. ...Remind me of these Compton Crip gangs that live next door.\u201dMe: Hold up, K-dot, what is this you\u2019re dropping? No, dude, those are two nations going to war. And fine, war is hell, but if Britain and France aren\u2019t called thugs for Waterloo, if Lancaster and York aren\u2019t called bangers despite literally being family killing family, then why do Zulu vs. Xhosa get compared to gang warfare? Because it weakened them both in the face of the real enemy? Either all war is hell, or all war is thuggery. I\u2019m fine with either, but not with a special distinction when Africans do it.Kendrick continues:\u201cSo don\u2019t matter how much I say I like to preach with the PanthersOr tell Georgia State \u2018Marcus Garvey got all the answers\u2019Or try to celebrate February like it\u2019s my B-DayOr eat watermelon, chicken and Kool-Aid on weekdaysOr jump high enough to get Michael Jordan endorsementsOr watch BET cause urban support is importantSo why did I weep when Trayvon Martin was in the streetWhen gangbanging make me kill a nigga blacker than me?Hypocrite!\u201dMe: No, brother, no! Here was a black man invoking the detestable slogan of black-on-black crime to prevent himself from mourning the unjustifiable homicide of a black boy by a Neighborhood Watch vigilante. All I could think was: Where the hell was Kendrick going?\u201cWhat happened to [Michael Brown] should\u2019ve never happened,\u201d he said. \u201cNever. But when we don\u2019t have respect for ourselves, how do we expect them to respect us? It starts from within. Don\u2019t start with just a rally, don\u2019t start from looting. It starts from within.\u201dKendrick wasn\u2019t the first, and he won\u2019t be the last, to make the statement that black deaths are in some way blacks\u2019 fault and that black lives might be a matter of personal responsibility, right down to clothing choice. The idea that a sudden dose of self-respect is part of what is needed to stop the police from killing us is not only ludicrous \u2014 Amadou Diallo wasn\u2019t a gangbanger, but he was shot at 41 times anyway; I think we can assume that the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. had it all right within, but that didn\u2019t protect him from being brutalized by all sorts of authority, nor did his dressing impeccably prevent him from arrest \u2014 it is also old. It\u2019s a belief that the black person has a role to play in the erasure of hate toward herself. That kind of thinking almost suggests that racism makes sense.But racism makes no sense. It is perverse and aberrant yet such a constituent part of the American make up, so normalized in all its forms, that it\u2019s no surprise that the black person would scramble for answers as to why it exists. And in scrambling for answers, you look everywhere, even within: Did I do something to bring this on? Was a part of this outcome in even the slightest way my fault?Fact is, black people have always believed in respectability politics. It\u2019s also at the core of the non-American black\u2019s perspective on race, and I should know, because as a non-American black, I\u2019ve traded in that belief for years. It\u2019s particularly acute with us Jamaicans. Our stories are everywhere: How despite racism, or rather the black American\u2019s self-destructive perception of it, we worked hard to excel and gain respect. We achieved. Everybody knows how hard we Jamaicans work. That\u2019s why I have that job and you, black American, do not. Maybe you should stop whining about your troubles and own up to your laziness. Maybe if you do what I did, you would be manager of that Chase branch on the corner, just like me.Bootstrappism is the chocolate echo of white racism. You can find it in black self-help and how-I-became-a-millionaire books. Prince with \u201cAmerica,\u201d Ice Cube with \u201cLook Who\u2019s Burning.\u201d Lauryn Hill berating black girls who get hair weaves to look like Europeans. Nearly every time Steve Harvey addresses black people. President Barack Obama telling Morehouse College students at their 2013 commencement that there\u2019s \u201cno time for excuses,\u201d a lesson that the fact of their existence proved they didn\u2019t need. It\u2019s a road that leads to the granddaddy of the bootstrap, Bill Cosby, who declared in a 2004 speech that black kids were being shot because they were going around stealing Coca-Cola and poundcake.But Kendrick\u2019s conclusion is far more sophisticated than anything Cosby has ever said. In fact, it\u2019s not a conclusion at all. It was Kendrick doing what he does better than anybody else: complicating a discussion at exactly the point where everybody, including me, tries to simplify it. And this is what he was aiming for all along, questioning what even many black people would never dare question, arguing that yes, every argument, even this one, has two sides. More sides. Adding layers we might need but don\u2019t want. And that\u2019s what he did next, not on wax, but on MTV.\u201cKnow who I am first,\u201d he said. And then he said more than that:\u201cWhen I say, \u2018Gangbanging made me kill a nigga blacker than me,\u2019 this is my life that I\u2019m talking about. I\u2019m not saying you; you might not even be from the streets. I\u2019m not speaking to the community, I\u2019m not speaking of the community,\u201d he continued. \u201cI am the community.\u201dFast-forward to near the end of 2015, and I\u2019m on a flight to New York. Thirty thousand feet above everything, I put on \u201cButterfly,\u201d and something that never happened before happens. This incredible clarity, as if I\u2019d been listening to the soul brother all year but only now was finally hearing him. And then I got to that song, No. 13, the sticking point, the one reason I hadn\u2019t been able to join the best-of-the-year showering of praise, and I realized something that felt sudden yet inevitable. That this song, with its booming beat, the loudest on the record, that seemed to herald it as some global political statement, was in fact Kendrick\u2019s most deeply personal. Almost implosive. That the moment wasn\u2019t about we at all, it just sounded that way. It\u2019s his most \u201cI\u201d moment, reflecting a reality that I couldn\u2019t possibly connect to, only witness and try to understand. It\u2019s as personal as Ice Cube\u2019s \u201cDead Homiez.\u201d He\u2019s not speaking to the community or for the community. He\u2019s speaking for himself or, rather, a version of himself. The smarter me looked in the mirror and asked: \u201cWell, who\u2019s the one playing representational politics here? Who is the one expecting the black man to be Everyman, black man to reflect the universal good will, or at the very least a carefully curated black rage directed at a carefully identified target?\u201dHip-hop has always been about spinning clever fictions, doing what great narratives do: inventing stories that tell the real truth. But post-Biggie and Tupac, it\u2019s so easy to fall hard for hip-hop\u2019s insistence on keeping it real that I\u2019m surprised how easily I still fall for it, thinking that \u201cButterfly\u201d is either confessional or reportage, when it\u2019s neither. We do this over and over, judging artists of color based on a warped idea that legitimacy can come only from experience. You would think I would know better, given that as a novelist, I deal with the same assumption in nearly every interview. One journalist even congratulated me for escaping the ghetto through \u201cthe power of the pen and not the gun.\u201dMy last novel was about Jamaican gang members manipulated by politicians into an attempt on Bob Marley\u2019s life. Young men, murderers before 15, murdered before 18. Nearly everybody assumed that I had experienced some of this. In fact, the first time I heard a live gunshot was watching Martin McDonagh\u2019s play \u201cA Behanding in Spokane.\u201d And once each interviewer was convinced that there was no blood on my hands, then came the skepticism, the disbelief, the doubting: By what authority was I telling these stories? As if knowledge, talent and imagination weren\u2019t enough for a writer of color to make art; as if a work of art can\u2019t be personal and fictitious at the same time, invented and meaningful.And here I was doing the same thing to Kendrick. He was just a man wondering how someone gets to be part of the Black Lives Matter conversation when black lives don\u2019t matter to him. How someone can feel rage at murder while being fine with suicide. He was exploring these themes as concepts \u2014 you know, that thing that artists do. He was posing tricky, difficult questions, for which there were no answers, getting into the middle of his song, feeling it, breathing it, but still inventing. I wonder how much of what I thought my problem was with \u201cThe Blacker the Berry\u201d stemmed from me doing what is still being done to me: Questioning the black gaze, assuming that it must have sprung from something other than the storyteller\u2019s gift. That it must be autobiography or documentary. I\u2019ve never listened to Radiohead\u2019s \u201cA Wolf at the Door\u201d and wondered if Thom Yorke ever paid ransom money for his kidnapped children. Or thought Johnny Cash ever murdered anybody or knew anyone who did. Just like those songs, \u201cThe Blacker the Berry\u201d is several things at once, but mostly, at its essence, it\u2019s just that thing we call art. \u2666Rap and politics, inseparable as ever.By Bijan StephenRap is rooted as much in place and time as it is in rhythm and bass; it\u2019s hyperlocal and organic, if not always cage-free. (Free Max B!) You can tell a song\u2019s provenance from its sound; you can hear what was happening when the record was pressed. A cultural ferment, frozen in amber.Killer Mike & El-P, a.k.a. Run the Jewels, continue to push boundaries with their latest music video. Watch it in virtual reality. Download our NYT VR app.Earlier on the album, on \u201cClose Your Eyes,\u201d Killer Mike, El-P and Zack de la Rocha \u2014 former frontman of Rage Against the Machine \u2014 rap about a prison riot. Listening makes the blood rush to your cheeks, your heartbeat pulse behind your eyes. The value of the album is held between those two songs: It captures the variegated sides of black life in America and its specific feeling, a dizzying mix of frustrated helplessness and joyous survival.Perhaps it\u2019s not surprising that the group\u2019s aesthetic choices are very Public Enemy, which is to say, pretty \u201cretro.\u201d Public Enemy was among the first acts to grasp that for all its durability as an art form, rap is inescapably tied to the black experience. It\u2019s always political, because to live as a black person in America is to be politicized. Run the Jewels gets this. If you listen closely, through their artful grandstanding, you can hear a radical politics. Which is another way of saying the truth; listen, and hear the world change. \u2666A sound like the music on a holistic-medicine website \u2014 but cool.By Max ReadIt used to be, if you wanted to vibrate at the same frequency as the Mayan spacemen, you needed to move to a Southwestern city that specialized in horse art. It used to be, if you wanted your aura photographed, you had to go to a cramped Chinatown crystal shop. These days, there\u2019s a boutique around the corner from my apartment in Brooklyn with a pop-up aura-photography tepee. On a whim, I went to have my aura\u2019s picture taken, only to learn the photographer was fully booked days in advance. New Age is back, and turning up where you wouldn\u2019t have expected it a few years ago \u2014 in places where the young and culturally sophisticated congregate. Places that are, for lack of a better word, hip.It used to be, if you bought an album from a small Vancouver electronic-music label, you could expect some kind of weird minimal techno. These days? You get CFCF\u2019s \u201cThe Colours of Life,\u201d a 40-minute instrumental suite that layers airy synths, noodling guitars, marimbas and, God help us, panpipes over simple, propulsive rhythms. You could talk about it in terms of record-nerd touchstones \u2014 \u201cThe Colours of Life\u201d sounds a bit like the minimalist composer Steve Reich in places, or the Krautrock god Manuel G\u00f6ttsching in others \u2014 but really, it sounds as if it should be advertised on basic cable with stock footage of candles. Or like a cassette tape you would buy from a bookstore with an entire section devoted to \u201cAngels.\u201d Or like seduction music played by a barefoot European man with a soul patch. Do you catch my drift? It\u2019s cool, but it sounds as if it were recorded using a dreamcatcher as a pop filter. It sounds like the music for a 40-minute director\u2019s cut of an airline commercial. It sounds like a poster of a wolf. It sounds like a hologram sticker of a dolphin. It sounds like a tattoo of an open eye. It sounds like the font Papyrus. It\u2019s also really, really good.The assumption always seems to be that the New Age revival is weird, if not insincere in some unspecified, \u201cironic\u201d way. Why would urban-dwelling gentrified-Brooklyn types embrace the atavistic philosophies of conspiracy theorists and mononymous zither players? One answer is that this is how cool works: Things that used to be uncool become cool, and vice versa.But I think maybe it\u2019s the wrong question in the first place. We live in an age of aggressive positivism, a world overtaken by metrics and markets. To accuse New Age revivalism of insincerity \u2014 reducing the possibilities of belief to a binary \u2014 is to miss the point. The gentle woo-woo spirituality of New Age is attractive because it refuses the grinding realities of life spent in the shadow of Wall Street and Hollywood and Silicon Valley. Why wouldn\u2019t people overwhelmed by a slick and well-capitalized culture machine seek their pleasure in something defiantly corny? You can lie, and you can cook the books, but you can\u2019t fake a vibe. If a 40-minute New Age symphony can make you feel good \u2014 instead of harried or judged or pandered to \u2014 why should you care that it sounds like the soundtrack to a 1980s nature documentary? \u2666Is Coldplay bland? The future won\u2019t care.By Jeremy GordonA band that signs up to play the Super Bowl halftime show is making a declaration of immense confidence in its ability to hold a spotlight. It would seem contradictory for that band to then immediately cede that spotlight, but that\u2019s just what Coldplay did. They were contracted as the headliners at this year\u2019s game, but they wisely let Beyonc\u00e9 and Bruno Mars \u2014 both infinitely more charismatic \u2014 take control. As those two stars hit the stage, ready to trade hits and dance moves, the band\u2019s singer, Chris Martin, clung to the background, as if worried he might burst into flames if everyone appeared in the same frame.Coldplay\u2019s deference masks a steady success: For nearly two decades, they\u2019ve written a great many memorable songs, combining earnest Hallmark sentiments with anthemic melodies, worming their way into impressionable hearts and onto the charts. They\u2019re successors to U2, another band that crystallized the ineffable grandeur of the human experience into countless four-minute, radio-ready rock songs. Millions of Super Bowl viewers knew what it meant when Martin sat down at his piano, preparing to bang out the opening chords to \u201cClocks.\u201d As the rapper Future put it in a widely circulated tweet: \u201c#Coldplay legendary forever.\u201dThis brand of wide-screen pop attracts easy put-downs: edgeless, corny, white. But music has never lacked anodyne cornballs who didn\u2019t get their props until years later. Phil Collins used to symbolize the worst of slick \u201980s excess, but over time he has been recognized for his pop craftsmanship and technical innovations (especially the big drum sounds \u2014 you know, that fill in the middle of \u201cIn the Air Tonight\u201d \u2014 that blew a million rappers\u2019 minds). Jokes about how mawkish he seemed in the \u201980s are increasingly irrelevant to young people, who can care only so much about what anything seemed like before they were born.This is likely to be Coldplay\u2019s trajectory, too. Like Phil Collins, Michael McDonald, Abba or any number of desperately unhip artists, their \u201cimage\u201d will evaporate, while their songs will weather the years. In 2009, the Brooklyn band Grizzly Bear conscripted McDonald to sing a version of one of their singles, \u201cWhile You Wait for the Others,\u201d at the peak of their own rarified cool. Chris Martin might be asked to fill a similar role for tomorrow\u2019s Grizzly Bear. Imagine it: Sincerity will once again be on its way out of music, only for a familiar and tender voice to ring throughout the future blogosphere. Because when it\u2019s no longer certain what\u2019s cool, what will be more comforting than an elder statesman who never worried about it to begin with?A few weeks before the Super Bowl, Coldplay and Beyonc\u00e9 released a music video for \u201cHymn for the Weekend,\u201d a collaboration from the band\u2019s most recent and potentially final album. High-profile pop songs like this are conceived as nothing less than events, ready to be performed at mega-happenings like the Super Bowl halftime show. The actual Super Bowl halftime show featured both Coldplay and Beyonc\u00e9 but not the song. Martin said \u201cHymn\u201d was too new and wouldn\u2019t have been \u201cquite right.\u201dWhat his audience wanted was the warmth of familiarity. They wanted \u201cClocks.\u201d The live performance would have been an event, but Martin knows there will be plenty of opportunities in the future. The band is built to endure. \u2666Jeremy Gordon is deputy news editor for Pitchfork.Yes, darling, but is it feminist?By Jamie Lauren KeilesAs good-and-evil Christian morality falls out of fashion among the women in my social universe, a new binary has arisen to organize our outlook. In the heavens, there is all that is feminist: Beyonc\u00e9 singles, the selfie, menstruation ads on the subway and the dream of a woman in the White House. In hell, there is everything else. There are no nonbelievers, and there is no limbo. As new things come into being, we sort them accordingly by asking ourselves, \u201cIs this feminist?\u201dBy June 2015, Fetty Wap\u2019s \u201cTrap Queen\u201d had already claimed its place as the hot song of the summer. Beyond just the pleasures of a classic party anthem \u2014 an infectious hook, synth chords to ramp up your heart rate \u2014 the song offers an American love story for the ages. Fetty is a drug dealer weak-kneed for the girl who can match his hustle. When he cooks crack, she cooks crack with him. When he dreams of Lamborghinis, he dreams in matching pairs. Fetty\u2019s queen doesn\u2019t ride in the passenger seat. The couple make money together, and they spend it together too \u2014 at strip clubs, on weed, on gifts for each other. It\u2019s a vision of a love we can believe in, even outside the dreamland bubble of a rom-com plot. What could be more romantic than two equals teaming up to build their fantasy in a difficult and unjust world?For a summer, \u201cTrap Queen\u201d was everywhere. It would ultimately spend 25 weeks in Billboard\u2019s Top 3. We sang about cooking crack with our babies in the aisles of Duane Reade and on the dance floors of bat mitzvahs. Like Fetty himself, we landed seasonal crushes with \u201cHey, what\u2019s up? Hello!\u201d as our deceptively simple opening line. Rattling trap snares drowned out the sound of ice-cream-truck jingles, and summertime was better for it. But eventually it came time to ask the inevitable: Is \u201cTrap Queen\u201d feminist?I wonder about the purpose of this exercise. Why, in order for \u201cTrap Queen\u201d to be good, must we find a way to wedge it inside the narrow boundaries of white women\u2019s feminism? Is it not good enough on its own? Feminism and \u201cTrap Queen\u201d both spent the last year exploding ever further into the mainstream, and in both cases, we\u2019re still struggling to nail down exactly what they mean. Is the gutted, feel-good pop feminism of that Bustle post the same one that moves a panel of black women to declare Fetty Wap a feminist? Or perhaps the more important question is this: If \u201cTrap Queen\u201d is declared feminist in one system, does it suddenly belong to all feminists, regardless of race, of class or of circumstance?In the year that conversations about identity finally entered the small-talk realm of white folks, we seem to have lost sight of the fact that not everything is created for us \u2014 not even all feminist things. Identity politics is not always about identifying. \u201cTrap Queen\u201d is an immaculate song \u2014 a compelling love story and a true club banger. Perhaps, in the future, we can find a way to say so without needing to claim it for ourselves. \u2666A magnificently cheesy ballad that we\u2019ll never stop listening to.By Jody RosenLionel Richie\u2019s \u201cHello\u201d begins discreetly, almost sneakily, floating a sour little synthesizer melody over tiptoeing piano chords. The song crept into the collective consciousness in similarly stealthy fashion. It arrived in late 1983, buried on Richie\u2019s \u201cCan\u2019t Slow Down,\u201d the second solo album by the former Commodores singer. Reviewers took little notice of \u201dHello\u201d; Richie was ambivalent, cutting the song from \u201cCan\u2019t Slow Down\u201d at one point during the recording sessions before reinstating it. But when \u201cHello\u201d was released as a single in February 1984, it shot to No.1 on Billboard\u2019s Hot 100 and topped charts across the globe.In the decades since, \u201cHello\u201d has never said goodbye. It\u2019s one of those adult-contemporary ballads that has taken up residency in the ether, seeping from the walls of dentists\u2019 offices and tinkling on the phone line while you await a customer-service representative. It\u2019s a song, in other words, that has been judged soothing and innocuous enough to serve as Muzak \u2014 not necessarily an insult, but definitely a misapprehension of the fearsome beast that \u201cHello\u201d is. The song\u2019s narrator is a lovelorn weirdo who is both hapless \u2014 \u201cTell me how to win your heart/For I haven\u2019t got a clue/But let me start by saying/\u2018I love you\u2019\u201d \u2014 and vaguely sinister. The refrain, \u201cHello? Is it me you\u2019re looking for?\u201d sounds benign, but in the video, a dazed-looking Richie stalks the halls of an art school, mooning over a blind sculptor at least 15 years his junior.The revival of \u201dHello\u201d is a curiosity \u2014 a piece of pop flotsam borne back into the mainstream by the Internet\u2019s swirling surf. But it\u2019s also a testament to the magnetism of Lionel Richie, 66, a more durable presence, and a finer musician, than many have cared to admit. The meme-ing of \u201dHello\u201d has coincided with a wider Richie resurgence. \u201cTuskegee\u201d (2012), Richie\u2019s 10th studio album, was a surprise hit that paired the singer with country stars in new renditions of \u201dEasy,\u201d \u201cSay You, Say Me\u201d and other chestnuts. Richie has spent several years barnstorming arenas, quietly re-emerging as a top-grossing touring act. Last June, he played the Glastonbury music festival in England, drawing raves and a crowd of nearly 200,000, the festival\u2019s largest.Back in the \u201980s, I had mixed feelings about Richie: affection for his inescapable hits and regard for his craftsmanship, tinged with disdain I had absorbed from rock critics. He had been the Commodores\u2019 resident softy, the maudlin voice of \u201cThree Times a Lady,\u201d almost too genteel for the band\u2019s tame brand of funk-soul. Critics offered respect, but scorn leaked through: \u201cunctuous,\u201d \u201cmilquetoast,\u201d \u201cwhite-bread.\u201d The bottom line: Richie was talented, but too slight and sappy to be taken seriously.Today he stands as the biggest \u201980s pop star who is not quite canonized. He has sold tens of millions of records worldwide, most of them in the \u201980s, when he strode lofty heights alongside Michael Jackson, Madonna and Prince. But Richie couldn\u2019t match the charisma of those dynamos, and unlike all of them, he has gotten nowhere near the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. The industry celebrates his hit-making: There was an all-star Richie tribute at last month\u2019s Grammys. Still, the highest sort of esteem is denied him.A reappraisal may be in order. What hits me hardest is the robust beauty of Richie\u2019s voice \u2014 a smooth baritone roughened by hints of grit \u2014 and the casual virtuosity with which he puts it to use. Listen to the 1981 Diana Ross duet \u201cEndless Love,\u201d in which Richie enfolds his partner\u2019s rather colorless singing in plush, precise harmony vocals, airlifting the song to its rightful place: the honeymoon suite of a very posh hotel. That mix of understated and overwrought is pure Richie. He deploys one of pop\u2019s subtlest skill sets in the service of ferociously corny songs.The miracle is that Richie makes such sentiments stick. Credit his melodic gift and his knack for arrangements that wash over listeners in cresting, tumbling waves. \u201cHello\u201d is typical, with stately verses that open into a wind-whipped chorus. When the song rears up into its final refrain (\u201c\u2019Cause I wonder where you are ... \u201c), the effect is that of a unicorn rising on its hind legs, mane flashing, to meet the purple dawn.In short, Richie is a great singer-songwriter and a world-historical cheeseball. A century-plus of pop history has not erased the squeamishness we feel when faced with ballads like Richie\u2019s. Today\u2019s music critics have largely abandoned old snobberies, embracing commercial pop in all its gaudy splendor. Yet songs like \u201cHello\u201d remain for many a bridge too far, a musical pleasure we still take with a side helping of guilt.But pop culture has evolved a nifty system, allowing us to luxuriate in music we pretend to hold at arm\u2019s length. The campy karaoke performance, the TV comedy sketch, the \u201cRickroll\u201d \u2014 these bring songs back to us under the cover of irony. It\u2019s canon-making, 2016 style: We mock-venerate old records as kitsch and, lo and behold, they get inscribed in the Celestial Songbook.Richie knows how this game is played \u2014 how to laugh at himself, politely, and all the way to the bank. Last fall, he appeared on \u201cThe Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon,\u201d or rather, his disembodied head did: Richie played the role of the Lionel Richie bust, duetting with Fallon in a \u201cHello\u201d spoof. When Richie performs, though, the irony melts away.That\u2019s what happened at Glastonbury, where a crowd of mostly white rock fans greeted Richie in high tongue-in-cheek mode, waving banners with slogans lifted from memes. But when the opening strains of \u201dHello\u201d sounded, the throng erupted, joining Richie in a singalong as joyously cathartic as any you will hear. Suddenly, \u201cHello\u201d wasn\u2019t a tacky \u201980s artifact \u2014 the song was a communal hearth fire, casting a rosy glow over 200,000 souls. It was an example of pop\u2019s mysterious sorcery, the way that certain alchemical blends of music and words strike us right in the gut, circumnavigating our high-minded aesthetic ideals and studied postures. It was a reminder that some of the most powerful songs are the most gauche, scrambling together beauty and vulgarity, exquisite craftsmanship and appalling taste, exalted chivalric love-oaths and the queasy come-ons of a dork with a mullet. As for that Clay Head From the Lionel Richie \u201cHello\u201d Video: It works equally well as a platter for your cream-cheese dip and a bust on pop\u2019s Mount Rushmore. \u2666The master producer opens up his workshop.Photographs by JRA \u2018classical\u2019 musician with legions of unclassical admirers \u2014 including Kanye West.By Mark LevineA few years ago, Shaw, then 30, shocked the classical-music world by becoming the youngest-ever winner of a Pulitzer Prize in music. Shaw won for a piece she wrote for the cultish vocal group Roomful of Teeth, which specializes in otherworldly sounds that hardly suggest the word \u201cclassical,\u201d and which she is a member of. In swift fashion, Shaw emerged as the face of a flourishing scene of young composers \u2014 people like Nico Muhly, Gabriel Kahane and Missy Mazzoli \u2014 who were blurring the lines between classical and indie music. For the previous month or two, raw video footage from a fund-raiser held by the Democratic National Committee in San Francisco, and attended by President Obama, had been circulating online, showing Shaw singing a long, hypnotic, wordless introduction to Kanye West\u2019s performance of his song \u201cPower.\u201dIn Iowa, Shaw came onstage and sat cross-legged on her chair among the string players. Small and pixieish, she could easily have passed for a college student. She prefaced her work \u201cBy & By,\u201d a setting of three gospel songs, by saying that she was hoping to restore some authenticity to commercialized old-time music, and then began singing in an unadorned, incantatory alto shaded with both sorrow and fervor. Her slow, ribbonlike phrases, hovering just this side of harmonic resolution, might have risen from the Middle Ages as much as from the middle of Appalachia. The players plucked their instruments with picks, banjo-style, and occasionally broke into odd, agitated strumming or sawed away at their strings with the wooden part of the bow. Shaw and JACK could seem to be drifting into different songs, Shaw\u2019s vocals lost in plaintiveness while the quartet fought through bouts of improvisatory chaos. But the strewn-out pieces of sound kept finding their way back to one another. For all the hints of disruptiveness in the music, this was crowd-pleasing stuff, and the young members of the audience responded with shouts.Not long after the concert, Shaw and I struck up a phone and email correspondence. She grew up in Greenville, N.C., where her mother, a violin teacher, started her on the instrument at 2. \u201cI was a straight-up suburban Suzuki kid,\u201d she told me, reared on a strict diet of classical music. \u201cI lived under a rock for many years.\u201d She went to Rice University to study violin, then moved on to Yale for a master\u2019s in performance. While there, she sang in church choirs for $15 an hour to help pay the bills and got a job as an accompanist for dance classes, work that required her to improvise music on demand for a variety of rhythms, tempos and styles of movement. \u201cIf you\u2019re a good accompanist,\u201d she says, \u201cno one notices you. It\u2019s a way of making music to serve something that\u2019s larger than you, but something that\u2019s very human and simple, which is dance.\u201dAfter Yale, she moved to New York and gravitated toward the edges of the classical-music scene. She played a lot of thorny contemporary music, which often left her yearning for the full-bodied pleasures of traditional harmony, and which set her to wondering what she might have done differently had she written the score herself. She had also developed into a specialist in Baroque violin and sang early music in the choir of Trinity Church in Lower Manhattan. In 2009, she heard about an a cappella group that was being put together to explore vocal practices rarely found in standard classical music. \u201cIt was a gig, yes, but what a crazy adventure to learn things like throat singing and yodeling,\u201d she says.That summer, the group, Roomful of Teeth, met for the first time in a three-week residency at Mass MoCA, the contemporary art museum in North Adams, Mass. The eight young members settled in to study with a master throat singer from Tuva, a region of southern Siberia. The group\u2019s director, Brad Wells, invited them to write music for their first performance. Shaw worked late into the night after each day\u2019s rehearsal, \u201ctrying out these chords,\u201d as she puts it, \u201cand moving things around. I had it in my mind that I wanted to hear a mass of people talking, saying things that didn\u2019t have any particular content. Then I wanted to hear the talk break down into a guttural sound, \u2018vocal fry,\u2019 with no words, just vowels \u2014 the kind of thing kids do, just play with sound. And then I wanted to hear that strange sound turn into a big, beautiful chord, sung by all eight of us, a split second later.\u201dAfter 10 days, Shaw had a draft of a piece, \u201cPassacaglia,\u201d to take to rehearsal. It gave the group a chance to practice some of the effects they had been working on, like the lawnmowerish textures of throat singing and the sudden transition between head and chest voice that characterizes yodeling. There was a spoken text \u2014 from \u201cWall Drawing 305,\u201d by Sol LeWitt, on display at Mass MoCA \u2014 which, torn from context, came across as surreal and vaguely menacing. The work\u2019s opening harmonies, though, were straight from classical tradition. The audience at the first concert cheered and applauded when the swarming, crackling sounds of the vocal meltdown in \u201cPassacaglia\u201d resolved, suddenly and triumphantly, by returning to the piece\u2019s opening D-major chord.The following two summers, Roomful of Teeth returned to Mass MoCA, and Shaw wrote three more pieces, which she put together as a four-movement work called \u201cPartita for Eight Voices.\u201d The range of vocalizations expanded to include whispers, sighs, grunts, gasps, murmurs, whoops, heavy breathing. For a work written by a relative novice, \u201cPartita\u201d bristled with assurance. On a lark, Shaw wrote a check for $50 and submitted \u201cPartita\u201d to the Pulitzer committee, thinking it a useful way to get the high-profile judges to listen to Roomful of Teeth. She was walking along the Hudson on a spring afternoon when a friend called to tell her she had won the prize. Nine months later, Roomful of Teeth, which had mounted a Kickstarter campaign to help finance its first recording, which included \u201cPartita,\u201d won a Grammy. The group now has bookings for close to 75 performances this year.Last May, Kanye West heard Roomful of Teeth perform \u201cPartita for Eight Voices\u201d at Walt Disney Concert Hall in Los Angeles and came backstage afterward to meet the group. \u201cHe just seemed like someone who is honestly curious and interested in finding something new,\u201d Shaw recalls. \u201cWe exchanged phone numbers and started talking.\u201d West asked Shaw to produce a new version of his song \u201cSay You Will,\u201d a track from his 2008 album \u201c808s & Heartbreak.\u201d \u201cThere was no assignment given,\u201d Shaw says. \u201cI just did what I wanted to, and he really liked it.\u201d West released the remix on SoundCloud and added Shaw to the legion of collaborators on his new project, \u201cThe Life of Pablo,\u201d bringing her to Los Angeles for three weeks of studio work. She ended up co-writing, co-producing or contributing vocals to several songs.\u201cI\u2019m not really allowed to talk about it,\u201d Shaw told me. But she went on: \u201cThe work was really fun. It was like being given an amazing coloring book and being told to use all your crayons, use your paint and scissors, anything at all.\u201d At first, Shaw had little familiarity with West\u2019s music. She recognized an affinity, though. \u201cEverything is tightly, tightly controlled, held back, held onto. And then the moment comes and it just breaks out, everything explodes.\u201d Shaw paused seriously for a moment, then laughed. \u201cI kinda love that.\u201d \u2666\u2018Mr. Worldwide\u2019 speaks in pan-Caribbean code.By Julianne Escobedo ShepherdThere\u2019s a reason Pitbull christened himself \u201cMr. Worldwide\u201d: The bombastic party rapper is a global phenomenon. He also tends to be served a global helping of ire. In February, he closed out the Grammy Awards with his reggaeton single \u201cEl Taxi,\u201d in a slot normally reserved for rock music (and, occasionally, rock-rap hybrids); by the song\u2019s end, several Twitter users, including the \u201cBroad City\u201d comedy writer Chris Kelly, had likened the performance to the Zika virus.Jamaica and Cuba have enjoyed a friendly relationship since the early 1970s, when the former lobbied the Organization of American States in support of the latter. More important, though, there\u2019s Miami, the spiritual home of the \u201cEl Taxi\u201d sensibilities \u2014 where Caribbean immigrants have for decades melded and commingled culture and influence, with itinerant communities cross-pollinating and building off one another. Chaka Demus certainly approved of \u201cEl Taxi\u201d building on his original, \u201cthe biggest dancehall song of all time,\u201d as he told The Jamaica Star. (Besides, he said, \u201cI have lost track of the amount of persons who have copied the song already.\u201d)Diasporas live and thrive in these sonic interchanges, which work almost like a code among the communities that create them \u2014 a point of conversation among very different peoples whom the mainstream holds equally at arm\u2019s length. Pitbull described himself, in a 2015 Billboard interview, as \u201cthe epitome of the American dream, the underdog, the fighter, the forever hungry, forever appreciative.\u201d Some may be reasonably allergic to the strobe-light pulse of his Miami party zone. But every beat clearly illustrates the way immigrants have learned to flip that disdain to their advantage. \u2666The return of perfectly imperfect soul.By Amanda PetrusichThe R.&B. singer D\u2019Angelo once took a 14-year retreat from his public. After a tour for the 2000 platinum-selling \u201cVoodoo\u201d \u2014 during which grown women were reportedly shrieking, nightly, for D\u2019Angelo to reveal his carved abdomen, then so acutely defined that it seemed unreal, phantasmagoric \u2014 he split, using booze, drugs and solitude to numb his disappointment with a business that seemed to have everything backward. \u201cI\u2019m going to go in the woods, drink some hooch, grow a beard and get fat,\u201d is how he put it to his friend and collaborator Questlove.The decade-plus of pop music that D\u2019Angelo sat out was driven, in large part, by neurotic precision. Some of this is surely attributable to the Swedish superproducer Max Martin, who favors a punchy, airless, symmetrical approach to rhythm. You hit the beat and hit it squarely. Martin\u2019s aesthetic is ubiquitous \u2014 he has worked with Taylor Swift, Katy Perry, Adele, Maroon 5 and dozens of others \u2014 and doesn\u2019t allow for much creative meandering. In the Martin era, so much pop music has been violent in its fastidiousness: no stumbling, no retreat, no lackadaisical exhalations.It\u2019s not that \u201cReally Love\u201d is muddy or inexact \u2014 although by Martin\u2019s yardstick, it probably is \u2014 but that it\u2019s gentle, unstressed, forgiving of itself. This is not so unusual in R.&B. and soul, formative genres for D\u2019Angelo, but it has become anomalous within pop. While a listener might find it easier, at first, to holler along with a more fastidious singer like Taylor Swift (It is extraordinarily satisfying! Shouting each fixed syllable! Participating in the one! And only! Way! The song! Allows for!), D\u2019Angelo\u2019s vocal performance encourages something softer and less preordained. Even the few seconds of gritty crackle included at the end \u2014 a turntable\u2019s needle jerking into a run-out groove \u2014 suggest a way to quiet the mind, let the edges blur a little, like when you accidentally fall asleep in a poolside chaise, drink still in hand. It is hard, now, not to read D\u2019Angelo\u2019s departure as a reiteration of a creative ethos, writ larger; slowness, here, is not ignoble or archaic. It feels, instead, like a subversive act: a revolution of patience. \u2666From a jailed star, a soundtrack for Jamaica\u2019s cynical politics.By Miriam MarkowitzThat is, the party\u2019s political opposition, the Jamaica Labour Party, was too weak to have committed the crime. Riffing on another line from \u201cWeh Dem Feel Like,\u201d Vaz exhorted his listeners to \u201cload up the guns,\u201d before a D.J. played a few bars of the song. In newspapers for days afterward, politicians and private citizens denounced Vaz for his carelessness: On the eve of an election, a time when Jamaica\u2019s fragile political peace has historically been rived by violence, Vaz had channeled the menace of Vybz Kartel.Jailed on suspicion of murder in 2011 and convicted in 2014, Kartel is Jamaica\u2019s pre-eminent entertainer and a quandary for the political class, which has long defined itself in opposition to the nation\u2019s popular music \u2014 first reggae and now dancehall, its rude, raucous up-tempo successor. Jamaican artists like Buju Banton, Bounty Killer and Beenie Man popularized dancehall abroad in the \u201990s, and later crossover stars like Sean Paul and Shaggy scored stateside hits with \u201cGimme the Light\u201d and \u201cBoombastic.\u201d But dancehall\u2019s influence is even more profound, having grown from an indigenous genre into the ghost in the pop-music machine. It seeded the evolution of rap, drum and bass and electronic dance music, and has infiltrated American pop from Justin Bieber to Beyonc\u00e9. \u201cWork,\u201d the newest single from the Barbadian superstar Rihanna, is effectively dancehall, as was her first hit, \u201cPon de Replay\u201d in 2005.Here in Jamaica \u2014 where dancehall is the soundtrack to life, blasting every day and late into the night from car stereos and jury-rigged home speakers, in rum bars and barbershops \u2014 Kartel remains the genre\u2019s reigning monarch, despite having spent the last five years in prison. Born Adidja Palmer, Kartel built his reputation with graphic songs about guns, sex and unapologetic social transgressions, like bleaching his skin. His empire has extended beyond music to products, including a line of cake soap and \u201cdaggering\u201d condoms, named after a dance move in which a couple simulates rough sex on the dance floor. In 2014, he was convicted of murdering an associate, Clyde (Lizard) Williams, who disappeared in 2011 and whose body was never recovered. Kartel, who maintains his innocence, has continued to dominate the airwaves and awards circuit and somehow seems to be recording music in prison; a new album, \u201cViking (Vybz Is King),\u201d appeared last year.As the two political parties fought to form the next government, Vaz was not the only politician to take his cues from Kartel and dancehall. In November, Andrew Holness, the Jamaica Labour Party leader, toured Montego Bay wearing Clarks, Jamaica\u2019s most fashionable footwear, whose prices doubled on the island in 2010 after Kartel penned an ode to the British brand. Holness tweeted a picture of himself dusting off a brown shoe in Kartel\u2019s preferred style, the \u201cdesert boot,\u201d and Twitter went wild. \u201cA weh yuh get dah new Clarks deh daadi?\u201d Holness wrote, echoing the question posed to Kartel by Popcaan, another dancehall superstar and Kartel\u2019s now-estranged prot\u00e9g\u00e9.The People\u2019s National Party, meanwhile, has its own house D.J., Foota Hype. In January, Lisa Hanna, the party\u2019s minister for youth and culture and a former Miss Jamaica, posted lyrics on Instagram from \u201cSchool,\u201d one of Kartel\u2019s newer songs, in which he implores students to study hard and to refrain from bleaching their skin. Hanna might have been returning a compliment paid to her by Kartel, who late last year released a song, \u201cBoss Lady,\u201d that praised Hanna and also Portia Simpson Miller, then the prime minister.In their appeals to dancehall fandom, these politicians hoped to inspire an electorate exhausted by empty promises. Since 1989, when the previously socialist-leaning People\u2019s National Party embraced economic neoliberalism, the ideological gap between the two parties has collapsed. Jamaica\u2019s debt-to-G.D.P. ratio has reached 125 percent, making it one of the world\u2019s premier debtor states; I.M.F.-imposed austerity measures have yielded high unemployment rates and a declining standard of living. For young people \u2014 almost half of whom would, according to a recent poll, relinquish their Jamaican citizenship to live abroad \u2014 party politics is increasingly dispiriting. Dancehall is the perfect accompaniment to their mood: a jaded and bacchanalian lament for the Jamaican future as envisioned by its young.In \u201cWeh Dem Feel Like,\u201d Kartel asks about his enemies, \u201cDem skin too tough fi bleed?\u201d \u2014 a fitting question, too, regarding Jamaica\u2019s frequently violent politics. All told, before the voting, at least four people were shot to death at campaign events, and dozens more were injured in a stampede. When the votes were tallied last month, the nation got what it expected: a virtual tie between two nearly identical parties, with the Jamaica Labour Party eking out a slim majority. Vaz, Holness and Hanna won their seats handily. It was considered, by Jamaican standards, a peaceful election. \u2666110 million views and counting.By Jayson GreeneWhere on earth is the monoculture in 2016? It\u2019s clearly not dead. There is a song out right now: It\u2019s called \u201cStressed Out,\u201d and it is by a group called Twenty One Pilots. I discovered it recently, while poking around online during an office lunch break. As I watched the video play in its tiny YouTube window, I was dismayed to discover something. This song, by this group, of whose existence I had not been even dimly aware, had been viewed 110 million times.Bowled over, I consulted the Billboard charts and saw that \u201cStressed Out\u201d by Twenty One Pilots was the No. 3 song in the nation. (And seriously: Twenty One Pilots? Was this name invented by a spambot? Was their Twitter icon an egg?) A sense of the uncanny crept in: What else didn\u2019t I know about? Where was I, in relation to everyone else? Digging around more, I learned that the duo used to loiter outside a Chick-fil-A in their hometown, Columbus, Ohio, hawking tickets to their shows. Now, just a few years later, they\u2019re scheduled to play 75 arenas and counting in 2016. Their success has a certain \u201cAlex from Target\u201d feel to it, in which incomprehensible unseen forces conspire to lift an arbitrary phenomenon up into the national spotlight.In pop culture, \u201cincomprehensible unseen forces\u201d can reliably be shortened to just \u201cteenagers.\u201d And sure enough, dipping into Tumblr and Vine and Twitter \u2014 alone, again, on my office lunch break \u2014 reveals the band has a deep and devoted learner\u2019s-permit fan base. The appeal of \u201cStressed Out\u201d for teenagers is easy enough to grasp: It sounds like a cheery telegram from turn-of-the-century MTV \u2014 a kind of singsong rap that transforms, in the chorus, into emo pop. The backbeat instantly recalls Eminem\u2019s \u201cMy Name Is,\u201d and the verses take you back to Crazy Town\u2019s \u201cButterfly.\u201d Sometimes Tyler Joseph, their singer, picks up a ukulele, in the manner of so many YouTube stars. The whole thing is like a microhistory of the last 20 years of suburban white people.Music can take you to unexpected places.By Jazmine HughesI\u2019ve held onto that idea \u2014 a song as a route \u2014 ever since. The trick to music, though, is that it doesn\u2019t really take you anywhere; you take yourself. The song is just the ticket, the map, the conduit. You arrive at the destination entirely on your own.That sound brings me directly to my grandmother\u2019s church in Roanoke, Va., where I received my first blessing as a human baby (I don\u2019t remember), learned my first proper hymn (I don\u2019t remember) and, as a toddler, stood up on the pew and interrupted the service in which my Mema received special accolades from the pastor (I don\u2019t remember, but I wish I did). Hearing an organ is my own vibrant Sunday morning: slicing the thick air with a paper fan, tightening my stomach muscles to quiet any rumbling until lunch, trying not to sweat out my freshly pressed hair, searching for a lesson within the sermon that I could believe in. The song made me 2 again, then 5, then 12 and then (and now) 24, in the room but ever-so-slightly out of place, seeing love and trying to feel it. \u201cSunday Candy\u201d took me down South, took me back, put me back into my grandmother\u2019s lap for four generous, holy minutes. Church, still, is a strange sort of refuge: I never want to go, but I\u2019m always glad I went. I really go only whenever I visit my grandma.\u201cSunday Candy\u201d ends the way my grandma\u2019s church service always began: with the choir. The superb, slowed-down version Chance performed on \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d in late 2015 is as close to a hip-hop gospel song as I\u2019ve ever heard, due mostly to the outsize presence of that choir with its call-and-response approach to repetition. Chance ends the performance with a breathless, ecclesiastical freestyle not unlike the climax of a sermon, marrying the spiritual transcendence of a Sunday service with his artistic one.In buttoned-up Bulgaria, a viral sensation who plows through every taboo.By Mac McClellandBorn in Bulgaria\u2019s only women\u2019s prison (his mother was arrested for selling imported clothes before the fall of Communism), Azis was, he says, marked since birth \u201cto be different.\u201d He was gay in a culture that rejects homosexuality and Roma in a country \u2014 one of several \u2014 that continues to persecute the group. \u201cBeing gay and being Roma are highly discriminated against in Bulgaria,\u201d Azis continued. \u201cThey\u2019re both words that people here hate. For me, I\u2019m carrying the burden of the two.\u201dNonetheless, Azis\u2019s mother was determined to make her son a star, and after she got out of prison, she dragged him to endless auditions. But \u201cnobody wanted a Gypsy kid,\u201d Azis went on. \u201cThey just didn\u2019t want a Gypsy in their choir, a Gypsy standing in front, on TV, anywhere; it was beyond imagination to have somebody like me there.\u201d Eventually, this string of humiliations \u201ccrushed\u201d his mother. They moved to West Germany when Azis was 8. He returned to Bulgaria a few years later, after the wall came down; his mother\u2019s dream became his own the night he sang in a restaurant with live accompaniment. \u201cI felt really intoxicated by performing,\u201d he recalled. In his early 20s, he signed with a music agency in Sofia and a year later won best artist at a Bulgarian music festival.

Lou Reed\u2019s parting shot was extreme, even for him: a harsh art-metal collaboration with Metallica that reimagines Frank Wedekind\u2019s violently sexual \u201cLulu\u201d plays. But Reed was always a button-pusher. \u201cThe greatest disappointment/Age withered him and changed him,\u201d he snarled on \u201cJunior Dad,\u201d a song as mercilessly cleareyed as Reed\u2019s signature \u201cHeroin.\u201d Bowie is said to have called \u201cLulu\u201d his friend\u2019s \u201cgreatest work,\u201d a judgment colored, perhaps, by his own exit-music plans.In an era when our deaths are generally scripted by a profit-driven medical establishment, these conscious farewells are inspiring. Death is one of life\u2019s main events: Shouldn\u2019t it be our own composition? Reed died at home, surrounded by friends and family, with a posthumous, invite-only tribute at the Apollo Theater.

A mall security guard once demanded that he show identification to use a public men\u2019s room.But soon Mr. Berry will have a space of his own: a center for transgender people.The Bronx Trans Collective, the new drop-in center near Yankee Stadium, will aim to bring together people who are often overlooked or disconnected even in New York City, which is considered to be the birthplace of the modern gay rights movement. The center will help transgender people get surgeries, hormone treatments, mental health counseling and assistance with legal name changes and job searches, among other services. It will also host regular support groups, youth counseling, meditation and yoga classes and cookouts on its back terrace.\u201cThe center is important for me because it is going to give me convenience, safety and a sense of community,\u201d said Mr. Berry, 28, a Consolidated Edison worker who plans to stop by the center every week.\u201cTransgender New Yorkers of color living in poverty face a level of discrimination most of us will never know,\u201d Mr. Torres said. \u201cWe\u2019re creating a model for the rest of the city to follow.\u201dThe Bronx center will open next month, at a time when the challenges and the concerns faced by transgender people have gained national attention. Though they have traditionally been part of the larger gay rights movement \u2014 often identified as lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender \u2014 transgender people and their advocates have pointed out that their needs tend to be different because their experience is primarily about gender identity, while the others focus on sexual orientation.Mr. de Blasio, who established a commission on gender equity last year, said in his State of the City address last month that the IDNYC card had provided a transgender woman with the identification required to pick up her nephews from school.Though an accurate count is difficult to establish, city officials estimate that there are roughly 25,000 transgender residents across the five boroughs. Many live in the Bronx, where services can be limited or not well publicized. Some transgender people said they would go to a center in Manhattan to find out about services in the Bronx.Alisha King, 31, a single mother in the Bronx, used to take two trains to a Manhattan clinic for hormone therapy and mental health counseling. But with the help of Community Kinship Life, she was able to find treatments closer to home last year. Ms. King said the Bronx center would bring more opportunities.\u201cI\u2019m excited,\u201d she said. \u201cWe need a safe space \u2014 a nonjudgmental space \u2014 where we can be ourselves and get to know each other.\u201dThough the center will focus primarily on reaching residents of the borough, it will serve anyone who walks in, its organizers said.\u201cI\u2019m a community member, and I believe in equality for all people,\u201d said Victor Rivera, the chief executive of both organizations, who is a friend of Mr. Torres\u2019.Sean Coleman, the executive director of Destination Tomorrow, said the organizations were aiming to raise at least $65,000 to pay for operations, as well as to supply meals and MetroCards to people who use the center. So far, the members of the coalition have worked well together, he said.\u201cWe all understand this is bigger than us,\u201d Mr. Coleman said. \u201cThere won\u2019t be any fighting.

The Justice Department said the companies decided who would win the leases and the winner would allot an interest in the leases to the other company. \u00e2\u0080\u009cHis actions put company profits ahead of the interests of leaseholders entitled to competitive bids for oil and gas rights on their land,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said William J.

Chesapeake\u00e2\u0080\u0099s stock price has been sinking for five years now, especially since it was revealed that Mr. McClendon had taken a personal stake in Chesapeake wells and used it as collateral for up to $1.1 billion in loans used mostly to pay for his share of the cost of drilling those wells. Gordon Pennoyer, a spokesman for Chesapeake, said the company was cooperating with the antitrust investigation and did not expect to face prosecution or fines related to the matter.This creates a culture of \u00e2\u0080\u009chaves\u00e2\u0080\u009d and \u00e2\u0080\u009chave-nots,\u00e2\u0080\u009d where a vote is worth everything or nothing.

Asahi Group Holdings of Japan has also agreed to buy Peroni and Grolsch, as well as parts of SABMiller\u00e2\u0080\u0099s European operations, for about $2.8 billion. The complexity is a result, in part, of the constant jockeying among exchanges to win business from the biggest traders, many of which are so-called high-frequency trading firms that make money by capitalizing on small changes in prices. RBC Capital Markets, found that the New York Stock Exchange, Nasdaq and other exchanges make frequent small tweaks to their prices, influencing trading behavior in ways that are hard for even sophisticated investors to understand. At one exchange highlighted in the research, EDGX, the pricing tiers, for example, include the \u00e2\u0080\u009cInvestor Tier,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the \u00e2\u0080\u009cUltra Tier,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the \u00e2\u0080\u009cMega-Step-Up Tier 1\u00e2\u0080\u009d and the \u00e2\u0080\u009cMega-Step-Up Tier 2,\u00e2\u0080\u009d among others. These tiers, though, were just the first layer of complication that big investors have to navigate to determine the price of buying or selling a stock. The research is likely to strengthen the hand of IEX, a company that is  asking regulators for approval to become an official stock exchange. The founders of IEX were the protagonists in the Michael Lewis book \u00e2\u0080\u009cFlash Boys\u00e2\u0080\u009d and are hoping to provide a more straightforward way to trade stocks.

Stressed out and headed to a meeting at Madewell, where she works as a social media copy editor, Ms. Clarke saw that the wall\u2019s location was on East Eighth Street in Manhattan at a meditation studio called MNDFL, which opened in November.The next morning, Ms. Clarke, 29, went to the studio and spent 30 minutes in a meditation class led by Lodro Rinzler, one of MNDFL\u2019s founders.Since that session last December, Ms. Clarke has attended classes nearly every other day, often early in the morning, before work. \u201cHaving a place with a stripped-down aesthetic and a menu of classes makes it feel very approachable and promotes a sense of calm amid the craziness,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s a time-efficient way to quiet my mind so I can think more thoughtfully in life and work.\u201dThe cozy, contemporary lounge area at MNDFL fills up before and after each class with people hanging out and sipping tea. Ethan Herschenfeld, a 47-year-old actor and opera singer, took his first meditation class in December and has since gone to classes almost daily, experimenting with MNDFL\u2019s varied offerings (Breath, Mantra and Heart, for example), which are each based on a different tradition. \u201cMeditation brings me serenity and helps me deal with the things that are out of my control,\u201d he said.All sorts of people are finding themselves sitting together. \u201cOur customer is everyone, because there is an investment banker sitting next to a tree hugger next to a doctor next to a stressed-out mom,\u201d said Suze Yalof Schwartz, owner of Unplug, which is based in Los Angeles and is expected to open a New York location later this year. \u201cI see how people feel better after coming to the studio one time, and the more they come the more I see their attitude toward life changing.\u201dA sense of community \u2014 and freedom from distraction \u2014 draws New Yorkers together for an activity that can actually be practiced alone. \u201cMany people in this city don\u2019t have enough physical space to set up an area to meditate, and they\u2019re always going to be distracted by the stain on the carpet or their to-do list,\u201d said Mr. Rinzler. \u201cHaving a dedicated space where you can go to meditate really brings the practice to life for people.\u201dMNDFL has grown quickly since it opened, Mr. Rinzler said. \u201cPeople sign up to give it a chance for a month and can then practice on their own, but they come back because it\u2019s the community that supports the endeavor,\u201d he said. The fee for the first month at MNDFL is $50 for unlimited classes, and after that jumps to $200 a month. Individual classes are priced at $15 for 30 minutes and $25 for 45 minutes. Normal classes seat 22, but when an event features relatively well-known teachers like Sharon Salzberg or Elena Brower, they\u2019ll squeeze in a few extra cushions so 40 people can attend.The Path offers its customers a chance to meditate but without a home base. The business has formed partnerships with places like ABC Home and the Standard hotel in the East Village, which host sessions. The weekly \u201csits\u201d \u2014 30 minutes long with meditation and tea \u2014 at the Standard cost $24 and are free to hotel guests; a monthly membership of $85 includes admission to the weekly sits and some meditation-related social events.The Path\u2019s larger social gatherings include events like a February session with Thom Knoles, a master vedic (a form of mantra meditation) meditation teacher. It drew 100 people to a SoHo apartment, where those who paid $68 could have dinner; those who had paid $200 could stay for tea in a smaller group with Mr. Knoles. \u201cThe Path has developed relationships with people and event spaces that are a win-win for everyone,\u201d Ms. Kaplan said. \u201cOur social events have become so popular because people want to meet others who are not checking their cellphones every two seconds.\u201dLast August, the Rubin Museum began offering a weekly mindfulness meditation series that is free for members and open to ticket buyers. \u201cIt\u2019s been massively popular from the beginning, where we were selling out even in the middle of August,\u201d said Ms. Eshelman. \u201cMuseums are considered reflective places that inspire us to look at the world more deeply, and the boomerang effect is that we look more deeply within ourselves.\u201dAt a recent session, Dr. Bloom saw the room fill with people from the area: a young couple who had just moved from Australia, a crew in their 20s and an older woman in a wheelchair. \u201cRight away people appreciate the benefits and say, \u2018Oh yeah, that felt really good,\u2019\u201d she said.Some doctors have recommended meditation for patients who have illnesses like heart disease and high blood pressure, or are just plain worn out. \u201cFor these stressed-out finance dudes, they are not stumbling across meditation because they want something more spiritual, they are coming because of the health benefits,\u201d Mr. Rinzler, a MNDFL founder, said.A picture caption in some editions last Sunday with the continuation of a cover article about the growing number of people practicing meditation in New York City misstated the surname of a class instructor shown at the Harlem branch of the New York Public Library.

{"Headline": "For China Banks, Swapping Stock for Debt Is a Stopgap With Pitfalls", "Date": "2016-03-10", "News": "Supported byHONG KONG \u2014 A new approach to managing China\u2019s corporate debt burden may offer temporary relief for banks but spell further difficulties for the country\u2019s economy: having deeply troubled companies use stock to pay overdue loans.Early evidence of the strategy emerged late Thursday, when a heavily indebted Chinese shipbuilder disclosed that it would issue equity to its creditors, instead of repaying $2.17 billion in bank loans.If Chinese companies were to broadly adopt the approach for their debt issues, banks could temporarily shore up their balance sheets by replacing troubled loans with shares that have at least some value. But accepting stakes in highly indebted companies is likely to make banks even more reluctant to shut them down.And that could mean China will be stuck with enormous overcapacity in industrial sectors including shipbuilding, steel and cement, hampering economic growth for years to come.\u201cThe program amounts to a sleight of hand that beautifies bank balance sheets but hardly comes to grips with the basic problems of bad loans, distorted incentives in the banking and state enterprise systems, and weak financial regulation,\u201d said Eswar S. Prasad, an economist at Cornell University who used to lead the China division at the International Monetary Fund. \u201cThis is a classic case of putting lipstick on a pig. Bank balance sheets may look prettier but nothing fundamental changes.\u201dThis latest strategy has some advantages. It would allow companies to cut their debt loads. In doing so, they could potentially improve their credit profiles, borrow more from banks, and keep their businesses running.It also makes banks\u2019 loan books appear healthier, since they can reduce the amount of past-due loans. Financial markets have been fixated on Chinese banks\u2019 portfolios of so-called nonperforming loans. And halting the recent expansion of these loans has become a high priority for Chinese bank executives.While repaying loans with shares might seem a quick solution to China\u2019s enormous debt overhang, it could make the problems more pernicious.In effect, it is just another way for troubled Chinese companies to put off making hard choices, like laying off employees or closing operations. Rather, businesses can continue to limp along, even when their underlying operations are not making money and customer demand has evaporated.Such problems have been at the root of China\u2019s economic issues, as many state-owned enterprises, or S.O.E.s, and private companies have continued to roll over the debt and keep their operations going. The government has supported the tactic, in an effort to avert mass layoffs and maintain social stability.The new approach is \u201cin a nutshell, very bad news for S.O.E. reform and, more specifically, for the solvency of Chinese banks,\u201d said Alicia Garcia Herrero, the chief economist for Asia at Natixis, a French investment bank.At this point, it is unclear how widespread this strategy has become among Chinese companies. The shipbuilder, China Huarong Energy Company Limited, had to disclose the move only because it is listed on the Hong Kong stock market. Mainland companies not listed overseas do not face the same stringent rules.Officials at the People\u2019s Bank of China, the country\u2019s central bank, and the China Banking Regulatory Commission could not be reached for comment late Thursday night. Zhou Xiaochuan, the central bank\u2019s governor, and three of his deputies are scheduled to hold a news conference on Saturday morning in Beijing, near the session of the National People\u2019s Congress.The debt issue is core to the debate over where China\u2019s economy is headed.China avoided most of the ill effects of the global financial crisis by ordering the state-controlled banking system to engineer a major increase in the money supply. Those banks channeled huge loans to companies and to government construction projects.China\u2019s economy is faltering, prompting concerns that are now shaking global stock markets.While the stimulus helped stoke growth, the country\u2019s debt burden ballooned.Overall debt in China was equal to slightly more than one year\u2019s economic output as recently as 2008. It now stands at 2.5 years\u2019 economic output \u2014 above levels considered dangerous in other countries. The debt is still rising, and most of it is owed by companies.The stock-for-debt strategy speaks to the underlying trouble at many companies.China Huarong Energy has been a dismal performer on the Hong Kong stock market. Its shares have tumbled even more steeply than broad mainland Chinese stock indexes, falling 83 percent since late April 2015.The stock-for-debt swap is taking shape as Hong Kong financiers say that China\u2019s bad debt problem has worsened appreciably in recent weeks. The problem, they said in recent interviews, is that more companies are stopping payments on their loans from mainland Chinese banks with the country\u2019s economy continuing to slow.That has begun to produce ripples in China\u2019s financial system. Desperate borrowers have pledged in recent weeks to pay several percentage points in extra interest to borrow in Hong Kong, after finding that banks and other financial institutions on the mainland were reluctant to lend.HSBC warned on Thursday that allowing borrowers to pay in shares was a limited solution to bad debt problems. International bank standards on capital assign a large penalty to holdings of shares, meaning banks must hold extra money against the stock.But China\u2019s five biggest banks have somewhat more capital than the standards require. So they may be able to swap some loans for shares without falling below the required minimums for capital, but are unlikely to resolve large portions of their portfolios of troubled loans through this method.\u201cWe think it is unlikely to be of significant scale given there are limited ways of replenishing\u201d capital once it has been allocated to offset equity holdings, HSBC said in a research note.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Harold Ickes, Mentor to Mayor Bill de Blasio, Builds Lobbying Victories", "Date": "2016-03-19", "News": "Supported byWhen New York City banned whole milk from public schools in 2006, seeking to reduce obesity and improve students\u2019 health, a trade group for the American dairy industry hired a well-connected Washington lobbyist to fight back.The man who would one day succeed Mr. Bloomberg, however, was more receptive.On his path to becoming mayor, Mr. de Blasio, a Democrat, has long leaned on Mr. Ickes, whom he calls his closest mentor. A friend for three decades, Mr. Ickes, 76, has advised Mr. de Blasio\u2019s campaigns, introduced him to wealthy donors and recommended him for a breakthrough job managing Mrs. Clinton\u2019s run for United States Senate in 2000.Mr. de Blasio, a politician who values loyalty deeply, has found ways to give back.Shortly after the mayor\u2019s election in 2013, Mr. Ickes opened a New York branch of his lobbying firm. Although he had not lobbied in the city for nearly a decade, Mr. Ickes proved a quick study, collecting about $1 million in fees and securing wins for major clients.In emails to aides to Mr. de Blasio, Mr. Ickes personally suggested changes to the bill\u2019s language, records show.The mayor has said his friendship with Mr. Ickes does not influence his decision-making, or the city\u2019s treatment of his mentor\u2019s clients. But an examination of emails and other public records obtained by The New York Times shows that the men\u2019s close relationship has given Mr. Ickes extraordinary access, enabling him to push his clients\u2019 interests directly to the city\u2019s top officials.Interlocking InterestsThe mayor\u2019s aides, contacted for this article, said he pursues all policies on their merits, and pointed out that initiatives like raising wages for low-paid bus drivers are consistent with his goal of helping working-class New Yorkers. Still, some of Mr. de Blasio\u2019s interests have undeniably dovetailed with those of his donors, a fact that can clash with the image he works to project as a liberal, progressive reformer. Lobbying revenue in the city has grown by 37 percent since Mr. de Blasio took office, and lobbyists with ties to Mr. de Blasio have flourished. James Capalino, an early and prodigious donor to the mayor, and Sidney Davidoff, a longtime friend, have seen their revenues rise sharply. Their firms remain far bigger players in New York than Mr. Ickes\u2019s, most of whose business is still in Washington.Allies of the mayor said that unlike Mr. Bloomberg, a billionaire, Mr. de Blasio relied on supporters to finance his ambitions. \u201cNobody could say Bloomberg did something because of a political contribution; he got to avoid ever having that sentence in a story about him,\u201d State Senator Liz Krueger, a Manhattan Democrat, said. \u201cThat\u2019s never going to be the case about anybody else in elected office, at least so far in New York City\u2019s history.\u201dMr. Ickes, who declined to be interviewed for this article, is a wily and well-respected figure in government circles. The liberal son of a cabinet secretary under President Franklin D. Roosevelt, he became a left-leaning voice within the Clintons\u2019 inner circle, where he remains an important adviser. He met Mr. de Blasio, then a gangly junior operative, on David N. Dinkins\u2019s mayoral campaign in the late 1980s. Mr. Ickes had an easy affinity with black and Latino leaders, which Mr. de Blasio studied, friends recalled. Some described a bond born of difficult childhoods: both men\u2019s fathers died while they were teenagers.\u201cThe person who mentored me the most in management was Harold Ickes; I don\u2019t have any question about that,\u201d Mr. de Blasio said in an interview in 2013, adding, \u201cHarold is fascinating to me.\u201d Asked about his best boss, the future mayor replied, \u201cHarold, definitely.\u201dAnd as Mr. de Blasio climbed the political ladder, Mr. Ickes was there to give him a boost.In 2012, Mr. Ickes hosted a fund-raiser at his townhouse in Washington\u2019s Georgetown neighborhood for Mr. de Blasio\u2019s mayoral run.\u201cI think most of the people in the room were there because Harold asked them,\u201d recalled Kenneth R. Feinberg, a lawyer and the supervisor of the September 11 victim-compensation fund, who attended the event at Mr. Ickes\u2019s invitation and contributed $1,000.Playing an Early RoleWhen Mr. de Blasio was elected mayor, he placed Mr. Ickes on his transition team, around the time that Mr. Ickes was moving to expand his lobbying practice to New York. On the ninth day of Mr. de Blasio\u2019s administration, his team received a message: Mr. Ickes wanted to talk.The topic was wages for school bus drivers, a concern of a longtime Ickes client, Amalgamated Transit Union Local 1181. Mr. Ickes emailed the mayor\u2019s top political aide, Emma Wolfe, saying he was informed by the mayor \u201cthat if there are others from the administration who should be involved, you will direct me to them.\u201dThree days later, on Jan. 12, 2014, Ms. Wolfe responded that the de Blasio administration would arrange a discussion with the city\u2019s Office of Labor Relations, \u201cand we\u2019ll help facilitate and participate.\u201d On Jan. 14, Ms. Wolfe wrote to Mr. Ickes that Avi Fink, another top mayoral aide, \u201cis going to convene these folks with your folks ASAP,\u201d according to messages obtained by The Times under a Freedom of Information Law request.At the time, Mr. de Blasio, along with other Democratic mayoral candidates, criticized the deal, calling it unfair to workers, who in some cases would have their salaries reduced to $24,000 a year. He pledged to revisit it if he were elected mayor.But on May 7, 2014, with no resolution in sight, Lawrence J. Hanley, the international president of the A.T.U.\u2019s parent union, emailed Mr. de Blasio directly \u2014 with Mr. Ickes copied on the note \u2014 saying he wanted to meet. Mr. de Blasio replied seven hours later.\u201cLet\u2019s meet soon \u2014 ideally next week,\u201d the mayor wrote. Seven days later, in a conference call that included Mr. Ickes and Anthony Shorris, the first deputy mayor, the parties agreed \u201con the necessity to find a solution,\u201d according to an email from Mr. Ickes.\u201cWe have some work ahead of us and are ready to roll up our sleeves,\u201d Mr. Shorris replied.Raises, and DonationsWhen the idea was first proposed to City Council leaders that July, there were many objections. Could the Council amend a settled contract? Why did this union deserve special treatment? And what would voters think of a taxpayer-funded raise for private-sector employees? The group, including the Council speaker, Melissa Mark-Viverito, set the bill aside.But Mr. de Blasio stepped in, pressing Ms. Mark-Viverito, a Democrat like the mayor, to introduce the measure. Mr. Ickes and Robert Linn, the head of the mayor\u2019s office of labor relations, were also exchanging emails about the language of the legislative draft. Mr. Ickes suggested numerous changes on behalf of the union, some of which Mr. Linn agreed to, emails show.Claude M. Millman, the city\u2019s chief procurement officer from 1998 to 2000, said he believed the city had never before \u201cdecided to issue grants to a group of private contractors to supplement already-awarded contracts.\u201dThe day of the vote, Aug. 21, Mr. Ickes emailed Mr. Linn and Mr. Shorris. \u201cThank you for all you have done on this,\u201d he wrote. \u201cPlease pass on the mayor my thanks.\u201d\u201cThanks for all your patience on this,\u201d Mr. Shorris replied. \u201cYour wise head was a great help here.\u201dMr. Linn wrote back as well, telling Mr. Ickes, \u201cI really enjoyed working with you.\u201dTwo months later, Alex Lodde, whose Texas bus company, MV Transportation, holds a city contract, contributed $100,000 to the Democrats\u2019 effort to win control of the New York State Senate, a push the mayor was leading. A spokesman for Mr. Lodde said Mr. Ickes was not involved with the donation.Mr. Lodde had never before contributed to a political race in New York State. Under the grant program, his company received public funds to raise its workers\u2019 wages.The grants, which benefit about 1,200 workers, were renewed by the administration in 2015. \u201cNobody wants to see hard-working men and women who look after our kids and get them safely to school each day reduced to poverty wages,\u201d Wiley Norvell, a spokesman for the mayor, said in a statement, adding that the city was seeking state legislation to make the higher wages permanent.Turning Losses Into WinsThis year, another Ickes client, AEG Live, was disappointed when the Parks Department rejected its plan for a music festival in Flushing Meadows-Corona Park, Queens, an idea advanced by Mr. Ickes\u2019s team that fell apart after local officials objected.But AEG Live, which is owned by the conservative activist Philip F. Anschutz, received a lucrative consolation prize: permission to host a festival on Randalls Island. Rival promoters, whose Queens applications were also rejected, said they were never told by the city that Randalls Island was available as an option.The de Blasio administration said the decision was fair and wholly unrelated to Mr. Ickes, who bundled nearly $20,000 in contributions for Mr. de Blasio\u2019s re-election fund in the four days preceding the announcement of the AEG Live event. Another client of Mr. Ickes\u2019s has unfinished business before the mayor: Despite having made an early pledge to revive Mr. Bloomberg\u2019s size limits on soft drinks, Mr. de Blasio has not taken action on the matter. In this case, the mayor\u2019s inaction works to the benefit of the client, the American Beverage Association, which pays Mr. Ickes\u2019s firm $20,000 a month and has brought Mr. Ickes along for conversations with top city health officials.Mayoral aides said Mr. de Blasio was still committed to reducing sugary drink consumption in New York City and was exploring options to do so; they also noted that the City Council, which must approve any measure, remained opposed.Some warned that Mr. de Blasio, with his promise of a new era in city government, must tread carefully.\u201cYou have to be particularly concerned about it if you are a progressive mayor, positioning yourself as a tribune of the people,\u201d said David S. Birdsell, dean of the School of Public Affairs at Baruch College. \u201cLobbyists are people too, but we don\u2019t usually think of them in the same meaning of the word.\u201dAdvertisement"}
