{"Headline": "Corporations Grow Nervous About Participating in Republican Convention", "Date": "2016-03-30", "News": "Supported byAn array of activist groups is organizing a campaign to pressure the companies to refuse to sponsor the gathering, which many of the corporations have done for the Republican and the Democratic Parties for decades.The pressure is emerging as some businesses and trade groups are privately debating whether to scale back their participation, according to interviews with more than a dozen lobbyists, consultants and fund-raisers directly involved in the conversations.Apple, Google and Walmart are among the companies assessing their plans for the convention, which will be held July 18 to 21 in Cleveland.\u201cI have talked to several people at companies who have said, \u2018I\u2019ve always gone to the convention, I\u2019ve always participated at some level, but this year we\u2019re not putting it in our budget, we\u2019re not going, we\u2019re not going to sponsor any of the events going on,\u2019 \u201d said Carla Eudy, a Republican fund-raising consultant.Walmart, which contributed $150,000 to the Republican convention in 2012, has yet to commit to contributing this year. \u201cWe haven\u2019t made any decisions,\u201d said Dan Bartlett, executive vice president of corporate affairs at Walmart, who emphasized that even before Mr. Trump\u2019s rise, the company had been discussing reducing its involvement.Apple and Google declined to comment.\u201cThese companies have a choice right now, a history-making choice,\u201d said Rashad Robinson, the executive director of Color of Change. \u201cDo they want riots brought to us by Coca-Cola?\u201dThe situation is especially delicate for Coca-Cola, which is based in Atlanta and has devoted significant resources for decades to appeal to minority groups.In the company\u2019s Washington office, executives have been locked in conversations about how to handle the convention, according to two people directly involved in the discussions. In addition to donating cash, the beverage giant usually provides in-kind contributions, including sodas and other drinks.In a statement, Mr. Landers, the Coca-Cola spokesman, said the company had also provided $75,000 to the 2016 Democratic convention, adding, \u201cThe Coca-Cola Company is a nonpartisan business and does not endorse presidential candidates or nominees, nor do we endorse any specific party.\u201dEmily Lauer, a spokeswoman for the Cleveland 2016 Host Committee, played down any concerns about fund-raising. She said corporations and other donors had already pledged $54 million of the $64 million needed.But a senior Republican official with direct knowledge of convention fund-raising said there was growing worry inside the party about whether donors would follow through with their pledges if Mr. Trump became the nominee.According to the Associated Press, Donald J. Trump and Hillary Clinton have each won enough delegates to claim their party\u2019s nomination for president.Asked how much of the $54 million the committee had in hand, Ms. Lauer said, \u201cthe majority.\u201d The State of Ohio, the City of Cleveland and Cuyahoga County are contributing generously, she said, along with local businesses.But the question of what to do about the Republican convention is more complex for businesses than simply deciding whether to contribute to the host committee: They are also grappling with whether they should send their executives, whether they can just quietly give to ancillary events benefiting other Republicans, and even whether they ought to have their names removed from the off-site concerts that are often convention favorites.The issue is a touchy one for American businesses, which until now have largely avoided the delicate choice between possibly offending Mr. Trump\u2019s passionate followers by distancing themselves from him, or angering the equally vocal constituencies opposed to his candidacy.\u201cThese are Maalox months for everyone,\u201d said Bruce Haynes, a public-relations consultant at Purple Strategies, a Virginia-based bipartisan communications firm. \u201cIf this is going to look like 1968, there will be people that say, \u2018That\u2019s not where I want my product placement,\u2019 \u201d he added, referring to clashes between the police and protesters at the Democratic convention in Chicago.The Color of Change campaign is now being joined by Hispanic, Muslim and women\u2019s rights organizations. While Coke has been the focus of the convention push so far, the advocacy groups have also been in contact with Google, Cisco and AT&T and said the companies would be targeted if they did not withdraw their contributions and vow to give no more.She added, \u201cWell, there\u2019s no greater threat to women and people of color in this country than Donald Trump.\u201dRepresentatives from Cisco and AT&T issued statements pointing to their technological support for both parties\u2019 conventions in the past. They indicated that they would offer the same in-kind assistance this year, while emphasizing that their support was aimed at benefiting the democratic process. They declined to comment further.In a letter sent to Coca-Cola last month, Color of Change implored the company to withdraw its support for the Republican convention, saying the move would be \u201ca sign of corporate leadership.\u201dThe push by Color of Change got the attention of the Coca-Cola executives, who quietly reached out to Mr. Robinson, the group\u2019s executive director, and, in a series of previously undisclosed telephone calls and email exchanges, sought to mollify the activist group.\u201cWe walked them through what a public campaign would look like,\u201d Mr. Robinson recalled, explaining that he described possible protests outside Coca-Cola headquarters and in Cleveland against the company.Coca-Cola has not sought a refund of the $75,000 it gave to the Republican convention, nor has it agreed to refuse to make in-kind contributions.Other companies are hoping to avoid the controversy altogether. Some trade groups, including ones representing airlines and broadcasters, say they are planning to take a smaller role at both parties\u2019 conventions this year.In addition to the strong feelings Mr. Trump generates, there are fears that fewer elected officials, to whom sponsors like to gain access at conventions, might attend if Mr. Trump is the nominee.The question of corporate involvement is not the only challenge. For the first time since the Nixon era, federal funds will not be provided to defray the cost of the conventions, putting a greater burden on the parties to raise money.Conventions are unwieldy productions that often exceed their budgets. In 2012, Mitt Romney\u2019s national finance team helped raise money to cover the costs of the Republican convention in Tampa, Fla., and in 2004, when the Republican Party had its convention in New York, Michael R. Bloomberg, then the mayor, wrote a personal check to cover the host committee\u2019s $2 million shortfall.Ashley Parker contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Review: \u2018The Hundred We Are\u2019 Explores Aging and Delusion", "Date": "2016-04-08", "News": "Supported byIn the annals of \u201cthe show must go on\u201d stories, the New York production of the Swedish drama \u201cThe Hundred We Are\u201d stands out for its gallantry. Jonas Hassen Khemiri\u2019s original script, a portrait of a woman at war with her various selves, calls for a cast of three.Audience members in search of enlightenment are advised to read the lengthy explanatory essay included in the program. In it Erwin Maas, the show\u2019s director, says that \u201conly days before opening, we arrived at a point of no return.\u201d The problem, evidently, was that the eldest of the three actresses was having trouble remembering her lines.Mr. Maas writes: \u201cI felt we had two options: 1. To try and hide the struggles most of us have, or will have, as we grow older, ie. Run away from them, like most do, or 2. to run toward these embarrassments, taboos, and this uncomfortable reality, and, instead, openly expose and address it.\u201dThe sentiments expressed here are honorable and refreshing. In practice, they don\u2019t meld easily into the presentation of a play that is in large part about evasion and denial. And if you confine yourself to the immediate experience of the production, which is the ideal way to watch a play, you find yourself nagged by questions that go beyond the purposes of the text.These involve not only the issue of why one actress (Kitty Chen as Actress 3) is hesitantly acting out the words of another (Caitlin Cisco, as Shadow) but also the dialogue being projected on the wall behind the audience. (I noticed several people looking over their shoulders to follow along with the written lines as they were spoken.)Normally, I\u2019m pretty flexible in stretching my imagination to accommodate the meta-theatrical. But darned if I can make a persuasive case for what\u2019s going here as an illumination or amplification of the play\u2019s themes.Mr. Maas writes in his director\u2019s note that \u201cHundred\u201d is in part about \u201cthe trials and tribulations of questioning memory.\u201d Yet Mr. Khemiri\u2019s script seems to be less about faulty recollection than willful delusion.As best as I can determine, Ms. Cassidy is the dominant ego figure here \u2014 the one who tries to accommodate herself to the social traditions of a husband-centered, bourgeois existence; Ms. Sithole would seem to be the inner rebel and artist, while Ms. Chen and Ms. Cisco \u2014 well, I\u2019m still a bit confused on that part.The show has been staged in an unadorned gallery space, so the burden of interpretation falls entirely upon its cast members and how they interrelate. The four women register as a mutually empathic and protective ensemble, which doesn\u2019t really make sense when their characters are trying to kill one another. But Ms. Cassidy brings a wry edge of subliminal satire to the proceedings, while Ms. Sithole is appropriately angry as the maverick within.Ms. Chen finally gets to speak, quite affectingly, a concluding monologue in which all those selves dissolve into one slowly receding entity. This soliloquy provides the play with its most \u2014 and arguably only \u2014 grippingly focused moment.Advertisement"}
