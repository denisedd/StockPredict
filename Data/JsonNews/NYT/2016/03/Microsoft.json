{"Headline": "Microsoft to Close 2 Game Development Studios", "Date": "2016-03-07", "News": "Supported bySEATTLE \u2014 Microsoft said it planned to shut down two of its game development studios based in Europe, including the maker of the Fable fantasy series.Additionally, Microsoft said it planned to close Press Play Studios, based in Denmark, and cease development of a game called Project Knoxville.In a blog post, Hanno Lemke, general manager of Microsoft Studios Europe, offered no explanation for the company\u2019s decision to shutter the two studios, describing the moves as \u201ctough decisions.\u201dIn a separate statement, Microsoft said the \u201cchanges were not made lightly, but were done as we continue to evaluate how all the games in our portfolio fit with our long-term vision to make Xbox and Windows 10 the best places to play.\u201dMicrosoft has been looking for ways to cut costs and close unprofitable projects. Sales of the company\u2019s latest games console, the Xbox One, have fallen behind that of Sony\u2019s PlayStation 4.Initially, Microsoft priced the Xbox One higher than the PlayStation 4 because it bundled its Kinect camera sensor with the console. It has since released a less expensive version of the Xbox without the Kinect.With a smaller base of console owners to sell the latest games to, publishers have less opportunity to profit, which makes games with more narrow audiences tougher to justify.Michael Pachter, an analyst at Wedbush Securities, said he had little doubt that Microsoft would continue to develop top-selling games like Halo and Gears of War for the Xbox, along with smaller projects.But he said some games like Fable, with significant development budgets and middling sales, were no longer worth the investment for Microsoft. Mr. Pachter estimated that the Fable games, over more than a decade of history, have sold around seven million copies.\u201cIt\u2019s just not impressive,\u201d he said. \u201cThey weren\u2019t getting what they bargained for.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "As a Data Deluge Grows, Companies Rethink Storage", "Date": "2016-03-14", "News": "Supported byMOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif. \u2014 John Hayes, cleareyed and wild-haired, stood before his silent creation. Big as a slim refrigerator, it held 16 petabytes of data, roughly equal to 16 billion thick books.\u201cPeople are going to have to think about things to put into this,\u201d he said, surrounded by the clutter of his office at a Silicon Valley company called Pure Storage. \u201cBut that won\u2019t take long \u2014 there\u2019s a demand for data that nobody was ready for.\u201dEach month, the world\u2019s one billion cellphones throw out 18 exabytes of data, equal to 1,100 of Mr. Hayes\u2019s boxes. There are also millions of sensors in things ranging from cars and appliances to personal fitness trackers and cameras.IBM estimates that by 2020 we will have 44 zettabytes \u2014 the thousandfold number next up from exabytes \u2014 generated by all those devices. It is so much information that Big Blue is staking its future on so-called machine learning and artificial intelligence, two kinds of pattern-finding software built to cope with all that information.Making storage products has long been a major part of the tech industry. It has also been one of the dullest, with little in the way of innovation. Now the surge in data is leading both start-ups and some of tech\u2019s biggest companies to rethink how they approach the problem.Pure, co-founded by Mr. Hayes, a 38-year-old former video karaoke engineer, is one of several companies trying new approaches.Mr. Hayes\u2019s box, which was unveiled on Monday, holds five times as much data as a conventional storage device, thanks to a combination of so-called flash storage technology and clever engineering. Sometime in 2017, he said, it will hold twice that much, as Pure tweaks the product. Power consumption, the company says, is 4 percent of the current standard.While traditional storage works much like a record player, with data stored on and fetched from spinning disks, flash storage gets data directly on and off a semiconductor. Flash storage has become common in consumer tech products like smartphones.The new Pure system is also built in blades, which act like building blocks. Add a blade, and the overall system reconfigures to raise efficiency. There is space on the device for additional processing, so a blade could easily be added.\u201cIt\u2019s not just about Google and Facebook,\u201d said Joe Unsworth, an analyst with Gartner. \u201cHealth care, manufacturing and natural resources companies can all justify owning this much storage. In 10 years, a big sanitation company with sensors on its Dumpsters to manage pickups could have tens of petabytes.\u201dPure is hardly alone in working on new ways to handle the world\u2019s immense data deluge. The industry leader, EMC, has both traditional and advanced storage, including flash. EMC was bought by Dell in October for $67 billion. \u201cIf Dell hadn\u2019t bought them, I\u2019d wonder what Dell was going to do,\u201d Mr. Unsworth said.Netflix, which offers streaming video to 75 million people in 190 countries, ships dozens of custom-built appliances a week to hundreds of local Internet service providers. The newest, a mix of flash and traditional storage, can store five petabytes \u2014 enough, the company figures, to hold almost anything from its catalog that anyone, anywhere would want to watch, for now.The company analyzes data to figure out both the kind of content it should offer next, and the Internet\u2019s capacity to stream all that entertainment. \u201cWe arguably have the most insight of anybody,\u201d said Ken Florance, vice president of content delivery at Netflix. \u201cThere are networks in Kenya that are better than some networks in the U.S.\u201dCapturing and analyzing masses of data already touches improbable corners, like championship auto racing. Mercedes AMG Petronas, the racing arm of the Daimler car company, is an early customer of the new Pure blades.Mercedes AMG has about 300 sensors on each high-performance car. Much the way human athletes are regulated for substances, racing officials now limit the amount of computation cars can use, including wind tunnel simulations between races, so it pays to move data quickly.\u201cThey audit the amount of processing we use,\u201d said Matt Harris, the head of information technology for Mercedes AMG. \u201cIf we can cut a few seconds off each job with faster storage, that\u2019s an extra simulation a month.\u201dPure is in a race of its own. The company went public in October, and since then its stock has fallen one-third from the highs reached soon after. The new flash blade product line will not be important for revenue this year, but the company\u2019s chief executive, Scott Dietzen, hopes it will calm disappointed investors.\u201cNo one can look at all their data anymore; they need algorithms just to decide what to look at,\u201d he said, adding that he planned to offer 10 times the performance of competing products, at a lower cost. \u201cThis market is at least as large as our original storage business, and a lot bigger over time.\u201dMr. Hayes didn\u2019t set out to shake up a once-staid storage world. In 2006, he was a software engineer at a company that did online karaoke talent searches, when it was purchased by Yahoo.When Yahoo killed the product, he became a promoter of Yahoo\u2019s social networks, then quit in 2009. His old bosses at the karaoke company, backed by venture capitalists, were looking at a way to use flash and needed a good coder.The first Pure Storage product came out in 2012.By mid-2013, he was thinking about how he would build his product for a world of falling memory prices, and rapidly rising amounts of data inside cloud computing systems.Working with Mr. Dietzen and investors, he set up a venture inside Pure but away from the rest of the company, hiring a team of experienced people from places like Oracle, Microsoft Research and Facebook. Mr. Dietzen hopes investors will now see where some formerly unexplained research and development money has gone.\u201cHe got people you couldn\u2019t recruit if you were a start-up \u2014 midcareer \u2014 who wouldn\u2019t work at a place that was going to run out of money, but wanted to be in something small and challenging,\u201d said Par Botes, an early hire who was chief technology officer at EMC. Like others in the effort, Mr. Botes has a LinkedIn profile that says only that he is at a \u201cstealth mode start-up technology company.\u201dFrom an original group of five people, the quiet project inside Pure has grown to 80, and Mr. Hayes sees a need for many more.\u201cI\u2019ve talked to companies planning for hundreds of petabytes,\u201d he said. \u201cEven a body camera on a cop adds up data pretty quickly.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Explaining Valeant: The Main Theories", "Date": "2016-03-29", "News": "Supported byDeal ProfessorWhether experiencing schadenfreude or finding insight, many think they know what is responsible for the turmoil at Valeant Pharmaceuticals International as it falls from a darling of Wall Street to its punching bag.Commentators and analysts have drawn lessons, but few of them are convincing and many seem similar to the kinds of snap judgments that led to this mess.Let\u2019s review the various explanations for Valeant\u2019s woes:The Enron theory is seductive, but Valeant is a real operating business that by all accounts is profitable. Unlike Enron, Valeant is not using accounting to cover up huge and unsustainable losses. Indeed, so far the accounting restatements have amounted to only $58 million worth of revenue. And while there may be more accounting restatements on the horizon, there is no indication of outright fraud.This view has gained traction in recent weeks. Valeant\u2019s chief executive, J. Michael Pearson, is a former consultant at McKinsey, having spent 23 years there. And he apparently surrounded himself with former McKinsey people on his team.So did Valeant\u2019s problems arise from a McKinsey-driven ethos devoted to driving shareholder value through financial machinations? Arguably, in the name of these McKinsey principles, Valeant was moved to Canada, shut down large portions of its research and development operations and became a vacuum swallowing up other pharmaceutical companies, all key to its growth strategy.For good or bad, McKinsey advises thousands of companies, including many drug companies that do not engage in Valeant\u2019s business strategy.This argument asserts that Valeant\u2019s business choices are coming home to roost. Valeant built itself on spending a reduced amount on research and development. Instead, it paid to acquire drugs and in some cases built profits by raising prices. This business strategy created its downfall \u2014 by failing to focus on developing drugs, Valeant left itself exposed to failure.The foundation of this theory is the nonsensical notion that research and development can never be bad. Many drug companies, however, have been unable to capitalize on billions of dollars in research and development and are now resorting to purchases. Gilead Sciences, for example, made itself into a $100 billion company largely through the acquisition of a hepatitis C drug.Shareholder activists are currently taking aim at technology companies for excessive spending on research and development without results. Not focusing on R.&D. was part of Valeant\u2019s business model, but that was not necessarily a problem in today\u2019s world. Indeed it made economic sense for Valeant. The company focused on sales and pricing \u2014 something at which it excelled, at least for a while \u2014 while others did the development.The first problem with this theory is that we don\u2019t have transparency around Valeant\u2019s pricing, or indeed that of any pharmaceutical company. Valeant\u2019s headline price increases were most likely fought by insurers, and the actual increases were no doubt reduced in those battles.It is clear that to the extent Valeant\u2019s expansion strategy relied on increasing prices, that is no longer a viable road to growth. But that does not mean there should be a sudden collapse of Valeant. After all, the drugs in its current stable of products are priced where they are and still sell.ValueAct also pressed Valeant to focus on cutting research and development (something that the fund also pushed at Microsoft) and use acquisitions as a substitute. For a time, this was an extraordinarily successful strategy. Even now, ValueAct is still in the black on the Valeant investment.The problem with targeting ValueAct is that this explains the business strategy, but it does not help us understand what went wrong.There is certainly blame all around for the hedge funds that bid up Valeant\u2019s stock price. The Sequoia Fund, for example, inexplicably put more than a quarter of its portfolio into Valeant. (In a you-can\u2019t-make-this-up sidelight, Sequoia\u2019s chairman is Roger Lowenstein, the author of \u201cWhen Genius Failed,\u201d about the collapse of Long-Term Capital Management.)These investors should have known better than to chase returns, but this again has nothing to do with Valeant\u2019s business.It is clear there are problems at Valeant, but if Wall Street built Valeant, it is now running away from it. And the velocity of the turnaround has distorted all views of the company. It has created a volatility untethered by reality. In the Wall Street worldview, Valeant is worth either zero or it is worth $100 a share.But Valeant is a real company. It does not make sense for a company with earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, or Ebitda, of about $5 billion a year to be worth only $9 billion. A rival drug company, Allergan, for example, with Ebitda of $7 billion a year and $40 billion of debt, is worth $110 billion.To be sure, Valeant has about $30 billion in debt upon which it might technically default if it cannot file its annual financial statement by April 29. But such a situation is not that uncommon. Companies typically pay a fee to the banks and get a waiver from the debtholders.There is no doubt that Valeant has taken a major hit. The crisis has crushed its previous business model of raising prices and making acquisitions. This has left it a company in transition. Valeant may still take some wrong steps, but wherever it goes from here, one can\u2019t ignore the business it already has \u2014 with billions of dollars in earnings.The intrinsic worth of that business remains essentially the same. It is the company that is suffering from a crisis of confidence. The flight by Wall Street shut down Valeant\u2019s old business growth model, not its business.But understanding requires thinking that is a bit too clear-eyed for Wall Street, which when things go bad, prefers the worst. And sometimes it creates a self-fulfilling frenzy. Remember the financial crisis, after all.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "CrowdSignals Aims to Create a Marketplace for Smartphone Sensor Data", "Date": "2016-03-22", "News": "Supported byWords and pictures, culled from across the web, have been the digital grist for remarkable gains in computing tasks like image recognition and speech translation. But another huge data resource \u2014 sensor data from smartphones \u2014 lags behind as a fuel source for major research advances.CrowdSignals, a new initiative to collect, label and pay for mobile sensor data, seeks to overcome that shortfall. The organization\u2019s approach relies less on innovation in technology than on economics and creating a marketplace for sensor data.\u201cWe haven\u2019t even begun to tap the potential of smartphone data,\u201d said Evan Welbourne, a computer scientist who heads the CrowdSignals project.The promising future of mobile data, experts agree, is that it can point the way to new insights in health care, transportation, urban planning and the social sciences.But such mobile data is typically costly and time-consuming to collect for researchers, and it is difficult to interpret.The big improvement in fields like vision recognition have come from vast data sources and steadily improving software techniques in a branch of artificial intelligence called machine learning.Yet that high-tech wizardry relies on human help. The software is trained on sets of data that have been labeled by humans \u2014 identifying, for example, the pictures of cats, dogs and horses.Building human-labeled data sets is straightforward with pictures and words. Humans can identify images quickly and accurately.The labeling challenge is trickier with mobile sensor data. For example, a person contributing data has to log in when walking, running or biking. If a researcher wants to correlate mood with activity, the contributor might have to answer a question or two on a touch screen.Data from a personal device \u2014 a smartphone or smartwatch \u2014 is also sensitive, raising issues of data use and privacy, which complicates the collection of sensor data.The development of software models using mobile sensor data has been hindered, said Deborah Estrin, a professor of computer science at Cornell Tech, because of \u201cthe absence of labeled data sets. And the reason for that is the lack of a community effort to do that in an ethical, efficient way.\u201dMs. Estrin is one of several computer scientists from universities around the world who are advisers to CrowdSignals, as are researchers at companies like Microsoft and Intel.Most research using mobile data has tracked relatively small numbers of people in a single city or region, often using proprietary data from mobile carriers or device makers. CrowdSignals is intended to overcome those limitations, said Daniel Gatica-Perez, a researcher at Idiap Research Institute in Switzerland, who is an adviser on the project.Both Apple and Samsung have introduced software tools for collecting and sharing mobile data. Samsung\u2019s SAMI is a data exchange platform where developers can place their data and work with others. Apple\u2019s Research Kit allows iPhone users to share their data for use in research projects, often health-related studies.CrowdSignals is trying to build a marketplace for data with financial incentives for people to participate and label their data. All the data will be anonymized, the organization says.CrowdSignals\u2019 long-range goal is to have thousands of participants in studies, but it is starting with a pilot project. It hopes to raise $15,000 in the initial crowdfunding round, Mr. Welbourne said, and then recruit 30 to 50 participants whose smartphone data will be collected for a month.In the pilot, the CrowdSignals software can handle data only from people whose smartphones use Google\u2019s Android operating system. Later, Mr. Welbourne hopes to accommodate users of Apple iPhones as well.The participants, he said, will be paid a flat rate of about $100 for the month. But the compensation can go up or down, depending on how much personal data they choose to share. In addition, they will receive incentive payments of up to a few dollars for labeling their data.Much of crowdsourced funds, Mr. Welbourne said, will go toward selecting and educating participants. The outreach will be by websites and follow-up emails. CrowdSignals will also have videos and individual Skype calls to explain the project. Even the pilot, Mr. Welbourne said, will try to enlist a diverse group by gender, age, geographic location and ethnicity.University and corporate researchers who are crowdfunders will get first access to the data set: Academics will pay a $20 license fee and corporate researchers will pay $50. The licenses last five years, but after one year the data set will be free for academic use.A former researcher at Amazon, Samsung and Nokia, Mr. Welbourne plans to build a business by creating software models for specific industries like health care and mobile device makers, based on the same CrowdSignals data available to all licensees. His Seattle start-up, AlgoSnap, was founded last year.Mr. Welbourne\u2019s business plan is a bet that the CrowdSignals pilot succeeds. If it does, he intends to spin off CrowdSignals as a nonprofit entity. \u201cIt\u2019s a little more appropriate for the data collection and research,\u201d he said.A challenge for the CrowdSignals, assuming it takes off, experts say, will be fostering trust among large numbers of people beyond the early participants.\u201cNavigating the privacy issue may be an uphill battle,\u201d said Jason I. Hong, a computer scientist at Carnegie Mellon University and an adviser. \u201cBut this is a really clever idea over all. If it works, we\u2019ll have larger, richer data sets for researchers in universities and corporations.\u201dAdvertisement"}

That should send antennas up. If that is the case, shaking up the executive suite is an odd decision. Maybe it means there is dissension in the ranks about whether to look for a buyer. That could explain the 12 percent fall in the stock price by midafternoon Monday.Either way, the current plan isn\u2019t working. The number of Pandora listeners has stalled at about 80 million, and prospects for expansion are dim. Because streaming is radiolike, the company can use music licensing rates set by Congress. Those only apply domestically, however, and international expansion may be costly.Instead, Pandora must negotiate directly with record labels. A deal with Sony/ATV Music Publishing is a good start. Spotify, however, already has users globally. It also just initiated one of its most comprehensive marketing efforts. Apple, meanwhile, is a deep-pocketed rival trying to build a competing service that caters to its hundreds of millions of device owners.Mr. Westergren, a musician himself who was primarily an evangelist for Pandora\u2019s Music Genome Project, may be able to speak the language of artists and labels more clearly. The company calls him a former band member and composer \u201cpersonally committed to advancing the careers of working musicians.\u201dEven so, starting a new venture and steering a more mature one require different skills. Steve Jobs managed both when he returned to Apple. Jerry Yang, on the other hand, had a troubled second stint at Yahoo that included rejecting a $45 billion takeover bid from Microsoft in 2008 that led the Internet company into years of strategic disarray. The jury is still out for troubled Twitter and co-creator Jack Dorsey, who was recently brought back as chief executive.It\u2019s not obvious how Mr. Westergren can or will turn around Pandora.

{"Headline": "The Echo From Amazon Brims With Groundbreaking Promise", "Date": "2016-03-09", "News": "Supported byState of the ArtMany of the world\u2019s largest technology companies have spent the last five years searching in vain for the holy grail, a machine to succeed the smartphone as the next must-have gadget.They have made digital watches and fitness trackers, all manner of computerized glasses and goggles, and more doodads to plug into your TV than there are shows to watch on it.This time it may be different. A bit more than a year after its release, the Echo has morphed from a gimmicky experiment into a device that brims with profound possibility. The longer I use it, the more regularly it inspires the same sense of promise I felt when I used the first iPhone \u2014 a sense this machine is opening up a vast new realm in personal computing, and gently expanding the role that computers will play in our future.What is most interesting about the Echo is that it came out of nowhere. It isn\u2019t much to look at, and even describing its utility is difficult. Here is a small, stationary machine that you set somewhere in your house, which you address as Alexa, which performs a variety of tasks \u2014 playing music, reading the news and weather, keeping a shopping list \u2014 that you can already do on your phone.But the Echo has a way of sneaking into your routines. When Alexa reorders popcorn for you, or calls an Uber car for you, when your children start asking Alexa to add Popsicles to the grocery list, you start to want pretty much everything else in life to be Alexa-enabled, too.In this way, Amazon has found a surreptitious way to bypass Apple and Google \u2014 the reigning monarchs in the smartphone world \u2014 with a gadget that has the potential to become a dominant force in the most intimate of environments: our homes.Scot Wingo, the chairman of ChannelAdvisor, an e-commerce consulting firm, said the early signs suggested that the Echo was on a path to become Amazon\u2019s next $1 billion business.\u201cIt\u2019s one of the most sold-out things that I see on Amazon,\u201d Mr. Wingo said. \u201cIt\u2019s an unusual thing for Amazon to be out of something, but for the Echo, it\u2019s usually in stock just for a couple weeks before it goes out of stock for a few days \u2014 so it feels like they\u2019re having trouble making enough of the devices.\u201d Mr. Wingo noted the Echo, which Amazon sells for $180 only through its own site, was selling for $200 to $300 on eBay.During an interview at a media event last week, Dave Limp, Amazon\u2019s senior vice president for devices, said the company created the Echo because it had seen interesting possibilities arising out of advances in microphone technology, speech recognition and cloud connectivity. Amazon\u2019s engineers spent years perfecting the device\u2019s unusual capabilities. Unlike competing assistants, the Echo can be activated hands-free from far across the room (Siri only works from a couple of feet away), and it can decipher your voice in noisy environments, even when it\u2019s playing music.Amazon also worked to make sure the device responded very quickly. \u201cEarly on in the product, to play music took eight or nine seconds, and it\u2019s just unusable when it\u2019s like that,\u201d Mr. Limp said. \u201cNow it\u2019s often 1,000 milliseconds or 1,200 milliseconds.\u201dThe speed makes a crucial difference. Compared with the trudge of chatting with Siri, speaking to Alexa feels natural, closer to speaking to a human than a machine \u2014 and even when it gets your request wrong, which in your early days with the device will happen often, it doesn\u2019t feel like you have paid a huge penalty for trying.More important, just like the early iPhone, Amazon has managed to turn the Echo into the center of a new ecosystem. Developers are flocking to create voice-controlled apps for the device, or skills, as Amazon calls them. There are now more than 300 skills for the Echo, from the trivial \u2014 there is one to make Alexa produce rude body sounds on command \u2014 to the pretty handy. It can tell you transit schedules, start a seven-minute workout, read recipes, do math and conversions, and walk you through adventure games, among other possibilities.Makers of digital home devices like Nest are also rushing to make their products compatible with the Echo. Alexa can now control your Internet-connected lights, home thermostats and a variety of other devices. Hardware makers can also add Alexa\u2019s brain into their own devices, so soon you won\u2019t need an Echo to consult with Alexa \u2014 you could find it in your toaster, your refrigerator or your car.The Echo also ties in to Amazon\u2019s main business, its retail store. When you tell it to reorder popcorn, it gets your order through Amazon, of course. Still, Mr. Wingo noted that Amazon had so far kept the platform relatively open \u2014 other retailers and product manufacturers are free to build their own apps that will allow for interactions with their stores.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Apple Is Rolling Up Backers in iPhone Privacy Fight Against F.B.I.", "Date": "2016-03-03", "News": "Supported byThe extraordinary show of support for Apple from the tech companies, including many rivals, underscores how high the stakes are for the industry with the case, in which the authorities are demanding Apple\u2019s help to break into an iPhone used by a gunman in a terrorist attack in San Bernardino, Calif., last year.In all, around 40 companies and organizations, along with several dozen individuals, submitted more than a dozen briefs this week to the Federal District Court for the District of Central California, challenging every legal facet of the government\u2019s case, like its free speech implications, the importance of encryption and concerns about government overreach.\u201cThese companies, which are often fierce competitors, have joined together to voice concern about the attempted government overreach in this case, which threatens the integrity and security of their products and privacy rights of consumers in general,\u201d said Neal Katyal, a lawyer at Hogan Lovells for the tech companies and a former acting solicitor general of the United States.Edward J. McAndrew, a lawyer at Ballard Spahr who is not involved in the Apple matter, said it was highly unusual to see a flood of briefs by so many parties this early in a case. He called the outpouring \u201cSupreme Court-level advocacy\u201d and said the campaign was intended to have influence beyond the court with legislators and others.\u201cThis is a show of force,\u201d said Mr. McAndrew, a former federal prosecutor who focused on online crimes. \u201cThis is a battle for public opinion.\u201dBruce Sewell, Apple\u2019s general counsel, said on Wednesday that the company was \u201chumbled by the outpouring of support.\u201dA group of Internet companies submitted this court brief supporting Apple in the case in which the government is seeking Apple\u2019s help to break into an iPhone used by a gunman in the San Bernardino terrorist attack.In the brief on Thursday from Amazon, Microsoft and others, the tech companies said they shared the public\u2019s outrage over the \u201cheinous act of terrorism\u201d in San Bernardino, but said they were united in the view that the government\u2019s case exceeded the boundaries of existing law and would hurt Americans\u2019 security.In the filing from the group that includes Twitter and LinkedIn, the companies said the government \u201cseeks unbounded authority to compel Apple to design software that does not currently exist and that will circumvent and undermine security measures intended to protect its users\u2019 data.\u201d\u201cWe\u2019re facing a very big question as a country, industry and a world about what privacy will look like in the digital era,\u201d said Aaron Levie, the chief executive of the data storage company Box, which signed on to the brief with Amazon, Google and others. \u201cThere is a global impact for these tech companies if we don\u2019t land on the right side of having a strong framework for how companies deal with security and these kinds of requests in the digital age.\u201dApart from the tech companies, seven prominent security experts and 32 law professors signed on to joint briefs on Thursday. Several industry trade organizations and digital rights groups submitted their own filings this week.The technology company has been locked in a major legal battle against law enforcement officials over privacy and security.Some echoed Apple\u2019s slippery slope argument that opening up one iPhone would lead to a domino effect from governments worldwide. The Media Institute, a nonprofit research foundation that focuses on communications policy, warned in its filing that the court\u2019s order could be \u201cbe applied against media companies as government authorities seek to acquire access to confidential information stored on mobile devices used by journalists.\u201dThe support for Apple was a torrent compared with the stream of filings backing the Justice Department in the case. Among the staunchest supporters on the side of government were six people whose family members were killed in the California attack.\u201cBroader questions about the fate of smartphone encryption and data privacy can be saved for another day and another forum,\u201d the families wrote in a brief. \u201cThis case certainly presents the conditions \u2014 a mass murder by terrorists implicating national security interest \u2014 where requiring Apple\u2019s technical assistance is at its apex.\u201dStephen G.

{"Headline": "Microsoft Opens Its Corporate Data Software to Linux", "Date": "2016-03-07", "News": "Supported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 For years, Microsoft built walls between its products and the rest of the industry. Now it is tearing them down.Microsoft, the world\u2019s biggest software company, is known for creating business software that runs only on the Windows operating system. That has made it hard \u2014 or impossible \u2014 to buy something like a database from Microsoft without first buying Windows to run on a server.But on Monday Microsoft announced that SQL Server, its software for managing corporate data, would also run on Linux, a competing operating system. Other Microsoft products could follow suit, analysts said.SQL, pronounced \u201csequel,\u201d is among Microsoft\u2019s most important products, and the chief way it competes with the Oracle Corporation for business customers.Microsoft has always sold PC software for other companies\u2019 operating systems, like that used by Apple\u2019s Macintosh computers. But since becoming chief executive of Microsoft two years ago, Satya Nadella has gone further by creating software to run on other mobile operating systems like Apple iOS, and decoupling Microsoft\u2019s Azure cloud computing system from Windows.Now, for the first time that strategy is extending into so-called back-office software, a lucrative but not as well-known part of Microsoft\u2019s business.\u201cData is the core asset now,\u201d Mr. Nadella said.The numbers bear that out. While Windows Server is still popular, Linux servers are gaining. According to the research firm Gartner, 3.6 million Linux servers were shipped in 2014, compared with 2.4 million in 2011. Windows servers fell to 6.2 million in that time, from 6.5 million.In the old computing world, decoupling Windows and SQL would have been unthinkable to Microsoft executives. But with Linux servers trending up and Microsoft servers heading down, insisting that SQL has to run on Windows would mean turning away potential customers.That is not to say that Microsoft is in a weak position in corporate software sales. Even running on only one of two operating systems, Gartner said, Microsoft has 21.4 percent of the market in data management software. That is ahead of IBM and SAP, and behind only Oracle, which Gartner estimates still has a 43 percent share.Mr. Nadella wants to go after the computers running Linux. \u201cIt\u2019s a market expansion opportunity,\u201d he said.Still, it is not easy to do. Some customers will work with a Linux version of SQL this year, but a full commercial release is not expected until 2017. Even the announcement could change company buying plans, however, tempting people to put off purchases until they can get the new version of SQL.\u201cThey definitely hesitated to do this, because of the negative implications for Windows,\u201d said Al Gillen, an analyst with IDC. Before, he noted, having SQL only on Windows increased operating system sales, adding \u201cthis makes Linux more attractive.\u201dThat may be a necessary sacrifice, in Mr. Nadella\u2019s eyes.He is stressing the company\u2019s business in cloud computing, called Microsoft Azure, which is a way of renting server, data storage and applications over the Internet. Both Windows and Linux servers are available in Azure. Mr. Nadella said SQL would also be available in Azure.Mr. Gillen said other Microsoft products, such as its SharePoint collaboration software and its Exchange email product, might also be adapted for both Linux servers and across Azure.\u201cHe is thinking about building the new stack in a more coherent way,\u201d said Merv Adrian, an analyst with Gartner. \u201cThey want to be the go-to company for all developers, not just developers on Windows.\u201dMr. Nadella is unfazed for now. \u201cAs a percentage of G.D.P., technology spending is only going up,\u201d he said. \u201cAll the decisions we\u2019ve made are around this market expansion.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Apple\u2019s Modest Product Upgrades Take Back Seat to Worries on iPhone Encryption", "Date": "2016-03-21", "News": "Supported byCUPERTINO, Calif. \u2014 Apple held one of its regular product showcases on Monday, but this time the products did not take center stage.In a news conference at Apple\u2019s Cupertino, Calif., headquarters, Mr. Cook stressed that the company would stand fast. \u201cWe need to decide as a nation how much power the government should have over our data and over our privacy,\u201d Mr. Cook said. \u201cThis is an issue that impacts all of us, and we will not shrink from this responsibility.\u201dHe said that Apple believed it had an obligation to help protect its users\u2019 data. That belief eventually prompted Apple to fight the Justice Department\u2019s demand to help the government crack the encryption on the iPhone used by a terrorist in last year\u2019s California attack.Compared to that high-stakes contest \u2014 which has broad implications for the technology industry, consumers and law enforcement \u2014 Apple\u2019s new products were small ball.The company introduced smaller versions of its flagship iPhone and iPad devices, hoping to eke out more sales growth by filling gaps in its product lineup.The new devices, the iPhone SE and a 9.7-inch iPad Pro, represent a return to the form factors that prevailed before Apple supersized its smartphones in 2014 and added the large, business-oriented iPad Pro last year.\u201cIt\u2019s clear that there is still some subset of the iPhone population that prefers a smaller phone,\u201d said Jan Dawson, chief analyst of Jackdaw Research, an independent consulting firm.Greg Joswiak, an Apple executive, said on stage that the company sold more than 30 million four-inch iPhones last year, and many iPhone users have been begging the company to update its phones of that size.So Apple upgraded the components of its new four-inch phone to largely match the speed and features of its flagship iPhone 6s, but at a lower price, starting at $399.Apple, which has a higher market value than any other company, is now so big that it is difficult for the company to come up with new products to drive a new wave of purchases. Its premium pricing \u2014 its larger phones typically run $650 or more \u2014 has also left it vulnerable to cheaper handsets that run on Google\u2019s Android software.In Apple\u2019s first fiscal quarter, which ended on Dec. 26, its revenue grew just 2 percent, and the company has offered a cautious forecast for the year.The lack of must-have new features in Apple\u2019s recent products has hurt sales growth, as many customers decided their older models were good enough and postponed upgrades, Mr. Dawson said.\u201cIn a way, you see both devices that Apple is launching on Monday as drivers of an upgrade cycle,\u201d he said.Apple certainly hopes that fans of its four-inch phones will upgrade to the new iPhone SE, which packs a faster computer chip, a better camera, and Apple\u2019s Touch ID and payment technology into the same four-inch case as the aging iPhone 5S.The new 9.7-inch iPad Pro brings some of the features of last year\u2019s 12.9-inch iPad Pro, including a stylus, a keyboard and four speakers, to a tablet the size of the consumer-oriented 9.7-inch iPad Air 2. The new Pro will start at $599, and Apple also cut the price of the Air 2 by $100 to start at $399.The iPad Pros are particularly aimed at the hundreds of millions of users of old personal computers that run Microsoft Windows who might be looking to replace them, said Philip Schiller, Apple\u2019s senior vice president of worldwide marketing.Apple also reduced the price of the Apple Watch by $50, to $299, and introduced new woven nylon wristbands for the device. More than one-third of Watch owners have more than one band, Mr. Cook said.Analysts say sales have been modest for the watch, which works as a companion to the iPhone. The price cut might encourage more people to give it a try. But Apple also acknowledges that the smartwatch category is in its infancy and it may take several more generations of the device before it really catches on.Apple also touted the iPhone\u2019s potential usefulness in medical research and personal medical monitoring. It introduced new software on Monday to help developers create apps for both purposes, showcasing as an example a large project to study people with Parkinson\u2019s disease.Even then, Apple stressed its commitment to protecting customer data, saying that any sharing of health information would require a customer\u2019s explicit permission.\u201cNothing is more sensitive than your health data,\u201d said Jeff Williams, Apple\u2019s chief operating officer.An article on Tuesday about the introduction of several new Apple products misstated the price reduction for the Apple Watch. It is $50, not $100.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Facebook Faces German Antitrust Investigation", "Date": "2016-03-02", "News": "Supported byBRUSSELS \u2014 Facebook became the latest American technology company on Wednesday to face antitrust hurdles in Europe after the German competition authority opened an investigation into whether the company has abused its dominant position in social networking.The move puts Facebook, which is used by many of Europe\u2019s 500 million citizens, alongside other United States technology companies, like Google and Microsoft, which have also faced antitrust investigations into their activities across the region.European officials have taken a tough stance on how American tech giants operate across the 28-member bloc, as many politicians here remain concerned that these companies often dominate many aspects of people\u2019s digital lives, including social networking, online search and e-commerce.As part of the new investigation, German authorities said they were looking into whether Facebook misused its position to collect people\u2019s digital information. That included complicated terms and conditions that individuals had to sign to use the social network, and whether such contracts placed unfair constraints on the company\u2019s users.In response, Facebook said it was confident that it had complied with German law.\u201cWe look forward to working with the Federal Cartel Office to answer their questions,\u201d the company said in a statement.While the German investigation will look into Facebook\u2019s digital practices, it remains unclear whether other European policy makers \u2014 including at the European Commission, the executive arm of the European Union \u2014 will also open antitrust inquiries into the social network.The biggest American tech companies face intensifying scrutiny by European regulators, with \u2014 pressure that could potentially curb their sizable profits in the region and affect how they operate around the world.Several national privacy regulators are looking into how the social network collects data on both its users and those who are not signed up for its online services.Facebook was also at the center of a successful legal challenge in Europe\u2019s highest court over how data was transferred between the European Union and the United States. That led to senior European judges invalidating the so-called safe harbor data-transfer agreement between the two regions, increasing uncertainty over how companies like Facebook could move data across the Atlantic.In an acknowledgment of the growing regulatory challenges now confronting Facebook in Europe, Mark Zuckerberg, the company\u2019s 31-year-old chief executive, traveled to Germany last month to meet with policy makers, local publishers and the company\u2019s users.For Facebook, whose business model is based on selling advertisements targeted at users based on information in their posts, the company\u2019s use of people\u2019s digital data is increasingly putting it at odds with Europe\u2019s tough data protection rules, which view individuals\u2019 privacy rights on a par with rights such as the freedom of expression.European competition authorities are also increasingly looking at how companies like Facebook may hold a dominant position over people\u2019s digital information, which may give them an unfair advantage over rivals.This year, for example, Margrethe Vestager, the European competition commissioner, said the collection of a vast amount of users\u2019 data by a small number of tech companies like Google and Facebook could violate of the region\u2019s tough competition rules.\u201cIf a few companies control the data you need to cut costs, then you give them the power to drive others out of the market,\u201d Ms. Vestager said.\u201cIt\u2019s a business transaction, not a free giveaway,\u201d she added, referring to companies\u2019 use of people\u2019s digital data. \u201cAs consumers, we need to be treated fairly.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Ethereum, a Virtual Currency, Enables Transactions That Rival Bitcoin\u2019s", "Date": "2016-03-27", "News": "Supported byA new virtual gold rush is underway.Even as Bitcoin, riven by internal divisions, has struggled, a rival virtual currency \u2014 known as Ethereum \u2014 has soared in value, climbing 1,000 percent over the last three months.Beyond the price spike, Ethereum is also attracting attention from giants in finance and technology, like JPMorgan Chase, Microsoft and IBM, which have described it as a sort of Bitcoin 2.0.Like Bitcoin, the Ethereum system is built on a blockchain in which every transaction is recorded publicly. The promise of such a system is that it allows the exchange of money and assets more quickly and more cheaply than relying on a long chain of middlemen.But Ethereum has also won fans with its promise to do much more than Bitcoin. In addition to the virtual currency, the software provides a way to create online markets and programmable transactions known as smart contracts.Many Bitcoin advocates say Ethereum will face more security problems than Bitcoin because of the greater complexity of the software. Thus far, Ethereum has faced much less testing, and many fewer attacks, than Bitcoin. The novel design of Ethereum may also invite intense scrutiny by authorities given that potentially fraudulent contracts, like the Ponzi schemes, can be written directly into the Ethereum system.Microsoft has been working on several projects that make it easier to use Ethereum on its computing cloud, Azure.\u201cEthereum is a general platform where you can solve problems in many industries using a fairly elegant solution \u2014 the most elegant solution we have seen to date,\u201d said Marley Gray, a director of business development and strategy at Microsoft.Mr. Gray is responsible for Microsoft\u2019s work with blockchains, the database concept that Bitcoin introduced. Blockchains are designed to store transactions and data without requiring any central authority or repository.Blockchain ledgers are generally maintained and updated by networks of computers working together \u2014 somewhat similar to the way that Wikipedia is updated and maintained by all its users.Many corporations, though, have created their own Ethereum networks with private blockchains, independent of the public system, and that could ultimately detract from the value of the individual unit in the Ethereum system \u2014 known as an Ether \u2014 that people have recently been buying.Many of these banks have recently been looking at how some version of Ethereum might be put to use. JPMorgan, for instance, has created a specific tool, Masala, that allows some of its internal databases to interact with an Ethereum blockchain.Michael Novogratz, a former top executive at the private equity firm Fortress Investing Group, who helped lead Fortress\u2019s investment in Bitcoin, has been looking at Ethereum since he left Fortress last fall. Mr. Novogratz said that he made a \u201csignificant\u201d purchase of Ether in January. He has also heard how the financial industry\u2019s chatter about the virtual currency has evolved.\u201cA lot of the more established players were thinking, \u2018It\u2019s still an experiment,\u2019 \u201d he said. \u201cIt feels like in the last two to three months that experiment is at least getting a lot more validation.\u201dSince the beginning of the year, the value of an individual unit of Ether has soared as high as $12 from around $1. That has brought the value of all existing Ether to over $1 billion at times, significantly more than any virtual currency other than Bitcoin, which had over $6 billion in value outstanding last week.Since Bitcoin was invented, there have been many so-called alt-coins that have tried to improve on Bitcoin, but none have won the following of Ethereum.Unlike Bitcoin, which was released in 2009 by a mysterious creator known as Satoshi Nakamoto, Ethereum was created in a more transparent fashion by a 21-year-old Russian-Canadian, Vitalik Buterin, after he dropped out of Waterloo University in Ontario.The most basic aim of Ethereum was to make it possible to program binding agreements into the blockchain \u2014 the smart contract concept. Two people, for instance, could program a bet on a sports game directly into the Ethereum blockchain. Once the final score came in from a mutually agreed upon source \u2014 say, The Associated Press \u2014 the money would be automatically transferred to the winning party. Ether can be used as a currency in this system, but Ether are also necessary to pay for the network power needed to process the bet.The Ethereum system has sometimes been described as a single shared computer that is run by the network of users and on which resources are parceled out and paid for by Ether.A team of seven co-founders helped Mr. Buterin write up the software after he released the initial description of the system. Mr. Buterin\u2019s team raised $18 million in 2014 through a presale of Ether, which helped fund the Ethereum Foundation, which supports the software\u2019s development.Like Bitcoin, Ethereum has succeeded by attracting a dedicated network of followers who have helped support the software, partly in the hope that their Ether will increase in value if the system succeeds. Last week, there were 5,800 computers \u2014 or nodes \u2014 helping support the network around the world. The Bitcoin network had about 7,400 nodes.One of Mr. Buterin\u2019s co-founders, Joseph Lubin, has set up ConsenSys, a company based in Brooklyn that has hired over 50 developers to build applications on the Ethereum system, including one that enables music distribution and another that allows for a new kind of financial auditing.The ConsenSys offices are in an old industrial building in the Bushwick section of Brooklyn. The office is essentially one large room, with all the messy trademarks of a start-up operation, including white boards on the walls and computer parts lying around.Mr. Lubin said he had thrown himself into Ethereum after starting to think that it delivered on some of the failed promise of Bitcoin, especially when it came to allowing new kinds of online contracts and markets.\u201cBitcoin presented the broad strokes vision, and Ethereum presented the crystallization of how to deliver that vision,\u201d he said.Joseph Bonneau, a computer science researcher at Stanford who studies so-called crypto-currencies, said Ethereum was the first system that had really caught his interest since Bitcoin.It is far from a sure thing, he cautioned.\u201cBitcoin is still probably the safest bet, but Ethereum is certainly No. 2, and some folks will say it is more likely to be around in 10 years,\u201d Mr. Bonneau said. \u201cIt will depend if any real markets develop around it. If there is some actual application.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Andrew S. Grove Dies at 79; Intel Chief Spurred Semiconductor Revolution", "Date": "2016-03-21", "News": "Supported byAndrew S. Grove, the longtime chief executive and chairman of Intel Corporation who was one of the most acclaimed and influential personalities of the computer and Internet era, died on Monday at his home in Los Altos, Calif. He was 79.The cause has not been determined, said Chuck Mulloy, a spokesman for the family.At Intel, Mr. Grove helped midwife the semiconductor revolution \u2014 the use of increasingly sophisticated chips to power computers \u2014 that proved to be as momentous for economic and social development as hydrocarbon fuels, electricity and telephones were in earlier eras. Intel\u2019s microprocessors were also essential for digital cameras, consumer electronic products, household appliances, toys, manufacturing equipment and a wide assortment of devices that depended on computerized functions.Besides presiding over the development of Intel\u2019s memory chips and microprocessors in laboratory research, Mr. Grove gained a reputation as a ruthlessly effective manager who spurred associates and cowed rivals in a cutthroat, high-tech business world where companies rose and fell at startling speed. Mr. Grove\u2019s famous slogan, \u201cOnly the Paranoid Survive,\u201d became the title of his 1996 best seller describing his management philosophy.Adding to Mr. Grove\u2019s appeal was his rags-to-riches immigrant story. A survivor of the Nazi Holocaust and the 1956 Soviet invasion of his native Hungary, he arrived in the United States as a penniless youth who spoke little English and had severe hearing loss. Within decades, Mr. Grove was worth hundreds of millions of dollars. And in 1997, he was chosen Man of the Year by Time magazine for being \u201cthe person most responsible for the amazing growth in the power and the innovative potential of microchips.\u201dMr. Grove in some ways was considered the father of Silicon Valley, said David B. Yoffie, a professor at Harvard Business School and a longtime Intel board member. Mr. Grove\u2019s influence, Mr. Yoffie said, came largely from his ideas about organizational practices and design \u2014 Intel was the birthplace of nonhierarchical, open settings and low-partitioned cubicles rather than walled-in offices.Mr. Grove\u2019s work ethic, his personal drive and his notion of the value of \u201ccreative confrontation\u201d became the managerial model for generations of Silicon Valley entrepreneurs and executives like Apple\u2019s co-founder Steven P. Jobs, who regularly sought Mr. Grove\u2019s counsel, Mr. Yoffie said.Mr. Grove, a tightly coiled, slim man of medium height, was by no means infallible. Several times during his long involvement with Intel, the Silicon Valley giant courted disaster. The causes ranged from unexpectedly tough competition to faulty Intel products to poor management decisions.But Intel rebounded stronger from each episode, thanks largely to Mr. Grove\u2019s ability to recognize the gravity of a crisis and set a new course. \u201cThere are waves and then there\u2019s a tsunami,\u201d he wrote in \u201cOnly the Paranoid Survive.\u201d \u201cWhen a change in how some element of one\u2019s business is conducted becomes an order of magnitude larger than what that business is accustomed to, then all bets are off.\u201dMr. Grove\u2019s management ideas helped make Intel, which has its headquarters in Santa Clara, Calif., one of the most profitable companies in the world, with an average annual return of more than 40 percent for its shareholders from the late 1980s to the turn of the century.Andrew S. Grove was born Andras Grof on Sept. 2, 1936, into a Jewish household in Budapest. His father owned a small dairy business, and his mother helped keep the books. As a child, Mr. Grove was afflicted with scarlet fever and an ear infection that left him almost deaf. His father was rounded up by German troops occupying Hungary during World War II and sent to a labor camp, where he survived typhoid and pneumonia.Meanwhile, the young Mr. Grove and his mother were hidden by a Christian family until the war\u2019s end. In a 1997 Time magazine interview, Mr. Grove recalled that at age 8 he was told by his mother to assume a Christian alias. \u201cShe explained to me that I cannot make a mistake, that I had to forget my name,\u201d Mr. Grove said.Liberation from the Nazis was followed by Communist rule in Hungary, and then by the Hungarian uprising of 1956 that was put down by Russian troops. Mr. Grove, who was studying chemistry, decided to flee the country after a number of his fellow students were arrested. He and a friend crossed the border into Austria after a night spent evading Soviet troops.Several weeks later, he boarded a refugee ship to New York, and from there was taken to a former P.O.W. camp in New Jersey until his immigration papers were in order. \u201cWe thought that all the propaganda was true, that America was just another drab, totalitarian state,\u201d said Mr. Grove in a 1995 interview with Fortune magazine, in which he recalled his first impressions of the United States.Mr. Grove, who Americanized his name within weeks, moved in with an aunt and uncle living in a small Bronx apartment. He enrolled as a chemical engineering student at the City College of New York, and graduated at the top of his class despite struggling with English and impaired hearing. Mr. Grove got through lectures by learning to read lips and then deciphering his notes at home or at the library. \u201cI had to go over each day\u2019s work again at night with a dictionary at my side,\u201d he told The New York Times in a 1960 article that focused on that year\u2019s outstanding CCNY graduates.In 1958, he married Eva, another Hungarian refugee, whom he met the previous summer at a New Hampshire resort where both worked as waiters. They moved to California, where Mr. Grove earned a doctorate in chemical engineering at the University of California, Berkeley. They had two daughters \u2014 whose names were never revealed by the media because of Mr. Grove\u2019s insistence on protecting their privacy.In the early 1960s, Mr. Grove joined Fairchild Semiconductor, a fledgling computer science company. He led a research team that sought to embed transistors on wafers of silicon, a low-heat-conducting element commonly found in sand. Silicon chips \u2014 each with first hundreds, then thousands, and then millions, of transistors \u2014 vastly lowered the cost and extended the scope of computers, which had once depended on bulky vacuum tubes that easily overheated and later arrays of individual transistors. Mr. Grove\u2019s team also succeeded in reducing the instability of transistors by removing sodium impurities from silicon chips. The widespread use of silicon by upstart computer hardware and software companies near San Francisco gave Silicon Valley its name.In 1968, Mr. Grove joined Intel, a new semiconductor manufacturer that emerged as a Silicon Valley leader. Intel was founded by two former colleagues at Fairchild, Robert Noyce and Gordon Moore, to supply memory chips for mainframe computers. Mr. Grove was put in charge of factory production and soon gained a reputation as a hard-driving manager.Part of the heavy workload at Intel resulted from Moore\u2019s law \u2014 named after Mr. Moore, who postulated that microchips would double in power and halve in price every 18 months, thus rendering older chips and the computers that used them obsolete. To meet voracious market demand for new-generation chips, Mr. Grove insisted that Intel employees regularly work many overtime hours.When answers from engineers and executives angered him, Mr. Grove ripped off the bulky hearing aid he wore like earphones and slammed it on the table. (His hearing was finally corrected in middle age after a half-dozen operations.) In a 2004 New York Times article, Craig Barrett, an Intel colleague who eventually succeeded him as chief executive officer, said Mr. Grove\u2019s management style \u201cwas to hit you over the head with a two-by-four.\u201dBut those who survived the grueling pace were amply rewarded. With their company briefly reaching a market valuation of more than $500 billion in 2000, several thousand Intel employees became millionaires by exercising their stock options. And many of them acknowledged that Mr. Grove\u2019s overbearing management had pulled Intel through crises that often proved fatal to other Silicon Valley companies.The first major crisis was linked to the rise of cheaper, high-quality Japanese memory chips beginning in the late 1970s. Instead of cutting costs by laying off staff, Mr. Grove demanded that Intel employees work an extra two hours a day \u2014 for no extra pay. Almost simultaneously, Intel introduced an advanced chip, the i432 microprocessor, that the company claimed would reshape computing\u2019s future.Instead, it proved a disaster, running five to 10 times more slowly than competitors. Part of the problem, Mr. Grove conceded in a 2001 interview with Wired magazine, was that he initially failed to take microprocessors seriously enough. \u201cI was running an assembly line designed to build memory chips,\u201d he said. \u201cI saw the microprocessor as a bloody nuisance.\u201dBut with Mr. Grove at the helm, Intel soon made the transition from memory chip to microprocessor giant. By the early 1980s, personal computers had become a widespread phenomenon \u2014 and Intel microprocessors powered more than 80 percent of these new machines. With Microsoft, itself an upstart software company that had been tapped by IBM to provide an operating system for the company\u2019s personal computer, Intel would completely reshape the computer industry. The two companies created a duopoly, nicknamed \u201cWintel,\u201d that not only eclipsed IBM\u2019s office dominance, but extended personal computers into homes as well.Intel\u2019s momentum was abruptly halted in 1994 when the company released millions of flawed Pentium microprocessor chips. Mr. Grove and his engineers reacted by assuring customers that the glitch would affect only the most advanced sort of computing processes. That cavalier response led to a public relations \u2014 and near financial \u2014 disaster for Intel, with thousands of clients demanding nondefective chips and media stories trumpeting their discontent.Reversing course, Mr. Grove and Intel agreed to spend $475 million to replace the defective microprocessors. In the end, the episode lifted the company\u2019s fortunes by making the Pentium and later the Centrino chip a brand name as recognizable to the public as the Dell, Apple or Sony computers they powered.Rivals complained that Intel had a stranglehold on microprocessors, by far the most profitable segment of the semiconductor market. \u201cIt\u2019s a problem of patents, not technology,\u201d said Lim Hyung Kyu, head of worldwide research for Samsung Electronics, in a 2004 interview with Institutional Investor magazine. \u201cAnd Intel has all the patents.\u201dOther competitors asserted that Mr. Grove warned big Intel customers, such as the computer firms Dell, Compaq and Gateway, not to buy microprocessors elsewhere. \u201cIn my view Intel goes right to the edge \u2014 and sometimes over it \u2014 to exclude people from providing chips to those guys,\u201d said Jerry Sanders, chief executive at Advanced Micro Devices, an Intel rival, in a 1997 Time article.Mr. Grove served as chief executive of Intel until 1998 and then served as chairman of the board until 2005. He did not slow the company\u2019s pace, even as Intel entered the Internet era. \u201cWe are now living on Internet time,\u201d he said in 1997 at the peak of the dot-com era. \u201cIt\u2019s a new territory,\u201d Mr. Grove said, \u201cand the cyber equivalent of the Oklahoma land rush is on.\u201dIn his 50s, Mr. Grove publicly and successfully battled prostate cancer. In 2000 he was found to have Parkinson\u2019s disease.Mr. Grove often insisted that the withering criticism of his management style and business tactics never troubled him, and that he was unconcerned about his legacy. \u201cI\u2019ve had a wonderful life,\u201d he told Wired in a lengthy 2001 interview. \u201cWhat people are going to write about me 10 years after I\u2019m dead \u2014 who cares?\u201dAn obituary in some editions on Tuesday and on Wednesday about Andrew S. Grove, the longtime chairman and chief executive of the Intel Corporation, misidentified the borough in which he lived with an aunt and uncle shortly after arriving in New York as a young man. Their apartment was in the Bronx, not in Brooklyn.John Markoff and Steve Lohr contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

I don\u2019t know how much of this is about principles and how much is just about the pursuit of profit. The efforts do seem pretty effective, though, and I think we should expect only more of this. The industry has long had disdain for Washington; now, with business booming and the companies as powerful as ever, it seems to have learned how to express the disdain for political ends. Where do you think this could manifest itself next?For instance, techies have been pushing for immigration reform for years; Mark Zuckerberg made it a signature issue earlier this decade. What happened? Nothing.And of course, what Mr. Carter and the F.B.I. consider a back door is not exactly what the tech industry does.

{"Headline": "Tech Companies, New and Old, Clamor to Entice Cloud Computing Experts", "Date": "2016-03-06", "News": "Supported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Amazon Web Services, a globe-spanning cloud computing network that is part of the online retailing giant Amazon, has rapidly become one of the most powerful forces in technology. It has also become a target for poachers.Last October, at a conference in Las Vegas with thousands of corporate executives and software developers in attendance, A.W.S.\u2019s chief, Andy Jassy, strode before an intentionally poorly disguised image of Lawrence J. Ellison, founder and chairman of the Oracle Corporation. Foot-tall words like \u201cbullies,\u201d \u201cextorted\u201d and \u201cstrong arm\u201d appeared next to Mr. Jassy and the image of Ellision. The logo of Oracle, one of the biggest companies in Silicon Valley, was barely crossed out.\u201cOur marketing team needs work on redaction,\u201d Mr. Jassy joked.Better cloaked was the reason for his enmity: Oracle had been slow to get into the cloud business, but recently made multiple hiring raids on A.W.S. Both Oracle and Amazon declined to comment on Mr. Jassy\u2019s dig.The hunt for the hard-to-find talent that can build and run the massive data centers behind cloud computing is pitting three generations of companies against one another. Old-guard companies like Oracle, tech\u2019s current giants like Amazon and its peers, as well as Bay Area start-ups are offering big salaries and big perks for cloud computing experts.On the social media site LinkedIn, for example, there are over 130 engineering positions available at Oracle Seattle. Many of them are the kind of jobs that now pay $300,000 to $1 million a year, according to Shannon Anderson, who has been recruiting engineers in Seattle and the Bay Area for 25 years.Seattle and its surrounding towns are a hot spot for this kind of tech talent because they are home to A.W.S., which runs the biggest cloud computing service, and Microsoft, which has a large cloud business called Azure. Google also has a cloud computing office in the area. So does Facebook.\u201cSomeone working deep inside Amazon is getting five to 20 recruiting offers a day,\u201d Ms. Anderson said. \u201cCompensation has doubled in five years.\u201d For a recruiter, who is typically paid a percentage of a star engineer\u2019s compensation, \u201cthis is a very good time,\u201d she said.Cloud computing, which powers an increasing number of our devices and services, allows a vast collection of computers \u2014 often spread around the world \u2014 to operate like one giant machine.These computing clouds are being filled with once unimaginable amounts of data from apps, websites and sensors on all sorts of things. Fast-growing online services like Snapchat run on cloud systems. Apple has its own cloud, as does Facebook. Cloud systems even offer the computing muscle needed for things like artificial intelligence.As other tech sectors show signs of slowing, cloud services have created unprecedented demand for highly educated engineers and mathematicians who can build and operate these flywheels of data. Instead of asking about the latest computer coding languages or how to make a web page load faster, the most important question in tech hiring has become: Can you handle petabytes? That is the data in about 13 billion images, or roughly the amount of printed information that would fit in 20 million file cabinets.In the Bay Area, $125,000 a year is not an uncommon salary for someone newly out of graduate school with the expertise to do cloud computing work. With five years of experience, $300,000 along with a range of stock or job opportunities that greatly inflate the value of those paychecks have become the norm.\u201cIt\u2019s an aggressive market,\u201d said Corey Sanders, director of program management at Microsoft Azure. \u201cWe are all data engineers now, and we can convince people that this is the best place to learn that.\u201dThe ability to deal with so much data has also become important to industrial companies like General Electric in figuring out things like jet engine maintenance schedules. G.E.\u2019s pitch to cloud computing experts: We offer a chance to rebuild the industrial world.In the last three years, G.E. has hired 1,500 software developers and systems engineers, and trained a similar number of existing employees to work on cloud systems connected to everything from smartphones to wind turbines and jet engines.\u201cWe\u2019ve hired from every large company, places like Amazon and Google, as well as start-ups, or out of schools,\u201d said William Ruh, the head of G.E.\u2019s cloud business. \u201cWe pay well, with attractive benefits, a life and a chance to work on the mission to remake American industry.\u201dStill, he said, \u201cI\u2019m totally shocked at how fast compensation is moving up.\u201dFor smaller companies, the gold rush is more complicated. In San Francisco\u2019s South Park neighborhood, Tom Chavez runs a company called Krux that scans data from more than three billion devices, creating a trove of seven petabytes of information retrieved by several hundred companies. Many of his 160 or so employees are just the kind of people the giants, along with other start-ups, are looking for.\u201cLinkedIn or Facebook can offer an engineer with a few years\u2019 experience a package close to $1 million,\u201d said Mr. Chavez, who co-founded Krux and is its chief executive. \u201cWe wanted someone out of Stanford for an internship, and Google offered her an annualized $180,000 for the summer,\u201d or about $45,000 for three months.Facebook also wants employees like the people Mr. Chavez has hired. In fact, Vivek Vaidya, a Krux co-founder, calls the steep salaries Krux is compelled to pay \u201cour Facebook tax.\u201dKrux takes up several floors of a brick building at the base of South Park, a onetime place of sweatshops that has filled with start-ups and venture capitalists.On the ground floor, development engineers get daily calls asking if they want to jump ship. A nearby team of data scientists gets 20 or more unsolicited emails a week via LinkedIn. Upstairs, Krux\u2019s recruiter strives to keep people, even as he looks to take from others.\u201cI can\u2019t compete with a $50,000 signing bonus from Google, so I focus on the person, what really motivates them,\u201d said Cade Garrett, who has recruited about 100 people to Krux.Besides offering stock options that could be valuable if the company has initial public offering, a fast-growing start-up can offer younger engineers a crash course in technology \u2014 the kind of training that could one day allow them to start their own companies.\u201cI tell them this isn\u2019t the best-paying job, but they have to think about where things are going: Everything they do here is mission critical,\u201d Mr. Garrett said. \u201cYou go to Google, you can\u2019t be sure that in a couple of years you\u2019ll have a product to show.\u201dMr. Chavez thinks industry titans like Larry Page, the chief executive of the Alphabet holding company that includes Google, are intentionally driving up salaries. \u201cIf I was Larry, I\u2019d do the same thing: throw a few more million at people and cut off everyone else\u2019s oxygen.\u201dEven so, Mr. Garrett tries to keep engineers\u2019 contact information off the Krux websites to foil recruiters. And he is more than happy to do his own poaching. Zenefits, a fast-growing online employee-benefits company currently reeling from the departure of its founding chief and a round of layoffs, is a target.\u201cAbsolutely, I\u2019ll call into any company that is in trouble,\u201d he said.An earlier version of this article misstated the amount Google offered someone out of Stanford for a summer internship. It was $45,000 for three months, not $60,000.Advertisement"}

The game has sold about a half-million copies on PlayStations and computers in its first month, according to its creators. It\u2019s the latest example \u2014 and among the biggest hits \u2014 in an emerging category of video game that, despite its popularity, hasn\u2019t even settled on a name.It may seem strange that a video game that replaces conventional challenges with thought-provoking exploration and story has gone mainstream. But the reality is that success for this type of game is not all that unusual anymore. Similar games \u2014 \u201cDear Esther,\u201d \u201cGone Home,\u201d \u201cThe Stanley Parable\u201d and others \u2014 have received not only acclaim but also commercial success.\u201cFirewatch\u201d belongs to a genre that\u2019s sometimes called the \u201cwalking simulator\u201d \u2014 a label that designers have adopted with a mixture of ambivalence, irony and enthusiasm. These video games aren\u2019t going to sweep away the likes of \u201cGrand Theft Auto\u201d or \u201cCall of Duty,\u201d franchises with billions of dollars in revenue and tens of millions of copies sold. But they have carved out a durable niche in the marketplace among connoisseurs.\u201cThe fact that \u2018Firewatch\u2019 doesn\u2019t feel 100 percent foreign to anyone is definitely something that helped it out,\u201d said Jake Rodkin, one of the founders of Campo Santo, the 11-member studio in San Francisco that designed and published the game.In \u201cFirewatch,\u201d a 40-something man named Henry decides to spend the summer of 1989 working for the forestry service, to avoid facing his wife, who has early onset dementia. Henry \u2014 voiced by Rich Sommer, who played the ad executive Harry Crane on \u201cMad Men\u201d \u2014 does not dodge falling trees or escape from dangerous blazes. He is never really in peril, no matter what the player does. There is nothing to fight, no ciphers to crack.Instead, players roam the Wyoming wilderness and choose dialogue for Henry to exchange over a hand-held radio with Delilah, another forest ranger. Players can make other small choices, like whether Henry wears his wedding ring in the morning before a hike, or when and where he takes photographs using a disposable camera.The game\u2019s players are exploring Henry\u2019s emotional range rather than testing the limits of his physical agency, Mr. Rodkin said. \u201cThe place that a player is expressive in \u2018Firewatch\u2019 is with what they say and when they say it, and what they withhold,\u201d he added.Techniques like these, once considered avant-garde, are popping up even in blockbuster action games from the likes of Sony and Microsoft.\u201cUncharted 4,\u201d one of this year\u2019s most expensive and anticipated action games, will feature more than one section that might be thought of as a walking simulator, said Neil Druckmann, a creative director and writer at Sony\u2019s Naughty Dog studio. (The second \u201cUncharted\u201d game included a stroll through a Tibetan village.)\u201cI\u2019m very curious to see the reaction,\u201d Mr. Druckmann said. \u201cIt has a very different pace to it. We\u2019ve kind of fallen in love with these kinds of sequences.\u201dBy most accounts, the earliest walking simulator was \u201cDear Esther\u201d (2008), which began as a modification of \u201cHalf-Life 2\u201d \u2014 one of the most beloved and influential first-person shooters \u2014 before being expanded for commercial release. In it, players wander an island and listen to a disembodied man read from letters to his wife.Walking simulators incorporate design elements of the first-person shooter, which helps to make them immersive. Players feel they have become different people in another world beyond the screen. In \u201cFirewatch,\u201d the controls that normally are used for shooting are adapted for selecting dialogue.\u201cYou\u2019re pressing the buttons that you press all the time in video games, but seeing a pudgy middle-aged guy, and a hand with a wedding ring on it,\u201d Mr. Rodkin said.Any standout shooter game invests heavily in the design of its world, said Dan Pinchbeck, the creative director at the Chinese Room, the British studio behind \u201cDear Esther.\u201d \u201cThat sense of anticipation, of quiet moments of being in the world, is so fundamental to their design,\u201d he said. \u201cWe just kind of exaggerated it.\u201dDesigners of these games do not see themselves as working in opposition to mainstream interactive entertainment. Rather, they seek to distill part of the core experience of video games to its essence.\u201cWe\u2019re trying to capture what we love about games,\u201d said Davey Wreden, the writer of \u201cThe Stanley Parable.\u201d\u201cI played \u2018Half-Life 2\u2019 and I thought, What if you had a game where it was nothing but the walking bits?\u201d Mr. Wreden said.Walking simulators are recognizably video games, said Frank Lantz, the director of the game design program at New York University. (Mr. Wreden\u2019s \u201cThe Beginner\u2019s Guide\u201d is his favorite \u2014 \u201ca masterpiece.\u201d)\u201cI think people who are reacting in this knee-jerk way are the equivalent of the philistines who hated modern art because it did not have representative images in it,\u201d he added.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Silicon Valley Looks to Artificial Intelligence for the Next Big Thing", "Date": "2016-03-27", "News": "Supported byBitsSAN FRANCISCO \u2014 As the oracles of Silicon Valley debate whether the latest tech boom is sliding toward bust, there is already talk about what will drive the industry\u2019s next growth spurt.The way we use computing is changing, toward a boom (and, if history is any guide, a bubble) in collecting oceans of data in so-called cloud computing centers, then analyzing the information to build new businesses.The terms most often associated with this are \u201cmachine learning\u201d and \u201cartificial intelligence,\u201d or \u201cA.I.\u201d And the creations spawned by this market could affect things ranging from globe-spanning computer systems to how you pay at the cafeteria.\u201cThere is going to be a boom for design companies, because there\u2019s going to be so much information people have to work through quickly,\u201d said Diane B. Greene, the head of Google Compute Engine, one of the companies hoping to steer an A.I. boom. \u201cJust teaching companies how to use A.I. will be a big business.\u201dThis kind of change is what keeps Silicon Valley going. When personal computers displaced mainframe computers, it opened the door not just for Apple, but for companies making PC software for business, games and publishing. In the networking and Internet revolutions, venture capitalists invested in these new computing styles, and another generation of companies was born.Over the last decade, smartphones, social networks and cloud computing have moved from feeding the growth of companies like Facebook and Twitter, leapfrogging to Uber, Airbnb and others that have used the phones, personal rating systems and powerful remote computers in the cloud to create their own new businesses.Believe it or not, that stuff may be heading for the rearview mirror already. The tech industry\u2019s new architecture is based not just on the giant public computing clouds of Google, Microsoft and Amazon, but also on their A.I. capabilities. These clouds create more efficient and supple use of computing resources, available for rent. Smaller clouds used in corporate systems are designed to connect to them.The A.I. resources Ms. Greene is opening up at Google are remarkable. Google\u2019s autocomplete feature that most of us use when doing a search can instantaneously touch 500 computers in several locations as it guesses what we are looking for. Services like Maps and Photos have over a billion users, sorting places and faces by computer. Gmail sifts through 1.4 petabytes of data, or roughly two billion books\u2019 worth of information, every day.Handling all that, plus tasks like language translation and speech recognition, Google has amassed a wealth of analysis technology that it can offer to customers. Urs H\u00f6lzle, Ms. Greene\u2019s chief of technical infrastructure, predicts that the business of renting out machines and software will eventually surpass Google advertising. In 2015, ad profits were $16.4 billion.\u201cIn the \u201980s, it was spreadsheets,\u201d said Andreas Bechtolsheim, a noted computer design expert who was Google\u2019s first investor. \u201cNow it\u2019s what you can do with machine learning.\u201dHe added: \u201cBetter maps and photos is just the start. It\u2019s going to be in life sciences, automobiles, everything.\u201dA number of start-ups are already aimed at the new architecture. A Mountain View, Calif., outfit called Mashgin uses \u201ccomputer vision\u201d to automate retail checkout. Up Highway 101 in San Mateo, a company called Alluxio is creating ways to make cloud-based A.I. work better. Last week, a San Francisco company called Mesosphere, which makes a way to operate among various corporate and public clouds, raised $73.5 million.Microsoft and Amazon are racing Google to dominate the new architecture.This week, Microsoft will kick off a conference in San Francisco that is expected to focus on ways machine-based intelligence can be used to analyze, among other things, \u201cthe Microsoft graph,\u201d or all the data companies already have in the Microsoft products they\u2019ve owned for decades.Amazon last year announced its own machine-learning services, and it is amassing its own large repository of corporate data.Hewlett Packard Enterprise, an older company struggling to find its way in the new landscape, was one of the investors in Mesosphere.\u201cWhen you are building predictive data, you don\u2019t know what you are going to need next,\u201d said William Hilf, a senior vice president at H.P.E. \u201cIf someone makes a bet in machine learning on Microsoft or Google, they may need to come down to their old data systems, too. We are building platforms to bridge among all of them.\u201dTo Ms. Greene, all of the activity so far, along with the size and sophistication of computing, is small compared to what will happen when the world\u2019s biggest businesses start leaning on the new A.I. technology.\u201cWe may build an A.I. system to figure out all the ways businesses can use this,\u201d she joked. \u201cThe relationship between big companies and deep machine intelligence is just starting.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "TiVo Said to Be in Merger Talks With Rovi", "Date": "2016-03-24", "News": "Supported byTiVo, the digital video recorder company that popularized the DVR and revolutionized \u201ctime shifting\u201d and fast-forwarding through advertising, is in advanced negotiations to be sold to Rovi, according to people briefed on the talks.The deal would merge TiVo and Rovi, which is one of the largest owners of patents for digital entertainment devices. Shareholders of TiVo would receive a combination of cash and stock, these people said, though the exact price was still being negotiated. After the deal, shareholders of TiVo, which has a market value of $750 million, would probably own about 30 percent of the combined company, these people said. Rovi\u2019s market value is about $1.7 billion.The transaction would end the independence of TiVo, a perennial takeover target whose suitors were said to have included Apple, Google and Microsoft.Rovi, a lesser-known company, may win the prize that is TiVo as a result of an activist investor, Glenn W. Welling of Engaged Capital. Mr. Welling successfully won two seats on the board of Rovi last year. Since then, he pushed the company to re-evaluate its strategy and pressed it to seek a merger with TiVo, these people said.A spokesman for TiVo declined to comment; a spokeswoman for Rovi did not respond to a request seeking comment after business hours. Mr. Welling\u2019s spokesman said he was unavailable.People briefed on the talks warned that the negotiations were at a sensitive stage and that it was still possible a deal could falter.TiVo\u2019s shares rose more than 23 percent on the report, while Rovi\u2019s stock fell 1.3 percent on Thursday.Together, the two companies have more than 6,000 issued or pending patents, which have become a critical defense for them against larger tech and media giants.TiVo is suing Samsung for patent infringement of its DVRs. To date, TiVo has received cash and future revenue of about $1.6 billion from this type of litigation, the company said in a filing this week.Rovi, on the other hand, lost to Netflix in a highly public lawsuit over five patents related to over-the-top video, which sent the stock plummeting last July.TiVo rose to prominence in the early 2000s, with its name becoming synonymous with the act of recording live television and watching it later. The number of stand-alone devices peaked at the end of 2007, when 1.74 million units represented 6 percent of the DVR market share, according to the Leichtman Research Group, which focuses on media data.But TiVo\u2019s dominance in DVR did not last long. Satellite and cable providers soon incorporated DVR capabilities as an option for their subscribers, and it became less popular to buy the TiVo stand-alone device. As a result, TiVo partnered with service providers, such as DirectTV, for additional sources of revenue. The rise of digital media companies like Netflix and Hulu have become yet another source of competition for TiVo.Today, TiVo\u2019s market share remains below 2 percent, Leichtman\u2019s data showed.\u201cThey set the fuse to DVR but in many ways, they were not the beneficiaries of it,\u201d said Bruce Leichtman, principal analyst at Leichtman Research. \u201cConsumers made their decision; they saw this as a feature but not as a product.\u201dRovi\u2019s shares have soared more recently after the company renewed several large licensing deals, but TiVo\u2019s has gone in the other direction. TiVo is trading at half the level it was in August, largely because of investor concerns about competition.TiVo is in the process of searching for a new chief executive, which appears to have been a catalyst for Mr. Welling and Rovi to pursue the deal. Tivo\u2019s 11-year chief executive, Thomas S. Rogers, stepped down from the post in November while remaining as nonexecutive chairman. The company\u2019s chief financial officer, Naveen Chopra, is acting as the company\u2019s chief executive on an interim basis.Mr. Welling had started Engaged in 2012 after working under Ralph V.

{"Headline": "What Happened When Venture Capitalists Took Over the Golden State Warriors", "Date": "2016-03-30", "News": "FeatureAfter racking up a historic N.B.A. season, the team\u2019s owners \u2014 most of them from Silicon Valley \u2014 think their management style deserves some of the credit. Are they right?Supported byLacob, who has worked in venture capital for three decades, has an open, expressive face and broad shoulders. He\u2019s six feet tall but seems taller. The previous night, he watched his Warriors play a home game in Oakland, and now he looked tired. \u201cThe Tuesday mornings after we play Monday nights are the hardest,\u201d he said. The basketball court, which is normally used by students and faculty members, has a tidy, corporate look: gleaming hardwood surrounded by plexiglass walls. In his Warriors T-shirt and shorts, Lacob pushed his hands against the glass and stretched his legs. \u201cHonestly, this is my favorite time of the week,\u201d he told me.One by one, other players arrived. Most have known Lacob for years, since early in his career at Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers, which is when he helped start this pickup game. There was no reason for anyone to be deferential to him. But owning a basketball team has cachet, especially when that team has come to rank among the best in N.B.A. history. Nobody mentioned his own business affairs, but everyone was eager to talk about Lacob\u2019s. \u201cJoe, good to see Barnes back,\u201d someone said, referring to Harrison Barnes, a Warriors player who had missed games with an injury.The group ran the court for an hour, playing games to 13 by twos and threes. Lacob, 60, was one of the older players there, and he had clearly thought through his strengths and limitations. He would head to a particular spot \u2014 often one on the right side, about a third of the way around the three-point arc \u2014 and wait. When he saw an opportunity, he called for the ball or cut along the arc toward it. If he received a pass, he would usually shoot. His shot was peculiar, fluttering like a knuckleball, rotating only a few times before it reached the basket, but it went in more often than not. The first game ended with his sinking a three-pointer, then raising his arms in triumph. A few minutes later, his team moved in position to win again. Lacob stood at the top of the key with the ball. \u201cHere comes the game-winner,\u201d he said to nobody in particular.After he finished playing, Lacob wiped the perspiration from his hands with a towel. Then he pulled out his championship ring and passed it around for examination. \u201cThey\u2019ve been asking to see it for two months,\u201d he explained. The ring had an extravagant and revealing design. One diamond had been inlaid for each of the 200-odd games the Warriors won from 2010, when Lacob and his investors bought the team, through last year\u2019s N.B.A. finals. \u201cHow much does this thing weigh?\u201d asked Tom McConnell, the managing director from Vanguard Ventures, lifting his hand up and down as if trying to estimate its value.Silicon Valley \u2014 the place itself, but also the society of smart, technologically savvy people who surround it \u2014 is full of basketball fans. Many of them made a lot of money in their 30s and 40s. Now in their 50s, they\u2019re looking for something gratifying to do with it. In 2002, Wyc Grousbeck, a principal at Highland Capital Partners who spent two years at Stanford\u2019s business school, bought the Boston Celtics along with a group of investors that included Lacob. In recent years, venture capitalists, private-equity investors and hedge-funders have been acquiring N.B.A. teams. The Detroit Pistons, Milwaukee Bucks, Philadelphia 76ers and Atlanta Hawks all belong to this new class of investor. The Sacramento Kings and the Memphis Grizzlies are both owned by Silicon Valley engineers. If you include Lacob\u2019s Warriors, that\u2019s more than a quarter of the league.Lacob was not the first venture capitalist to buy a franchise, but he is the first to operate one according to what might be called Silicon Valley precepts: nimble management, open communication, integrating the wisdom of outside advisers and continuous re-evaluation of what companies do and how they do it. None of that typically happens in professional sports. Most franchise owners of previous generations became wealthy mastering businesses that did one specific thing, if only because that was the way that people used to become wealthy in America. They\u2019ve run their teams, for better or worse, in the same autocratic, hidebound fashion that they ran those companies. As a manager, Lacob prefers to surround himself with expertise and exploit it.This season, Lacob\u2019s sixth as majority owner, the Warriors are on pace to break the league record of 72 wins in a season (which is just 82 games long). He and his partners bought a team that already had Stephen Curry, Golden State\u2019s best player and a transcendent talent who is having one of the most dominant seasons in league history. He would be hitting tongue-flick jump shots from 30 feet away from the basket no matter who owned it.But Lacob won\u2019t accept that what the Warriors have achieved is a product of anything but a master plan. \u201cThe great, great venture capitalists who built company after company, that\u2019s not an accident,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd none of this is an accident, either.\u201dAfter the pickup game, Lacob pulled on a sweatshirt and went to breakfast at a cafeteria on the ground floor. He goes there so often that one of the smoothies on the menu, involving orange juice, vanilla yogurt, bananas and strawberries, has been named for him. He pointed this out, then ordered one. When I asked him about the previous night\u2019s game, he could hardly contain himself. He boasted that the Warriors are playing in a far more sophisticated fashion than the rest of the league. \u201cWe\u2019ve crushed them on the basketball court, and we\u2019re going to for years because of the way we\u2019ve built this team,\u201d he said. But what really set the franchise apart, he said, was the way it operated as a business. \u201cWe\u2019re light-years ahead of probably every other team in structure, in planning, in how we\u2019re going to go about things,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to be a handful for the rest of the N.B.A. to deal with for a long time.\u201dWhat\u2019s happening with the Warriors as a business isn\u2019t something Kimmel is likely to mention, but it\u2019s equally impressive. The $450 million that Lacob\u2019s group paid to Chris Cohan, the former owner, seemed so laughably expensive because of the woeful state of the Warriors franchise. This wasn\u2019t just a bad team, but a team that seemed permanently stuck in a state of irrelevance. \u201cThe little engine that couldn\u2019t\u201d is how the investor Nick Swinmurn, the founder of Zappos and a lifelong fan of the Warriors, describes it. During Cohan\u2019s 16-year ownership, the Warriors had reached the N.B.A. playoffs only once. Sixteen of the league\u2019s 30 teams advance every season. \u201cSo on an odds basis,\u201d Lacob notes, \u201cyou\u2019re supposed to make it half the time. Something was very wrong.\u201dSuch ineptitude had eroded interest. There were only 7,000 season-ticket holders. The arena where the team played, in a vast parking lot beside a highway, was outdated. Its corridors were narrow, its catering facilities rudimentary. It didn\u2019t have rooms that could be leased for corporate meetings. While the league\u2019s newest facilities have been built with palatial home clubhouses the size of health clubs, the Warriors\u2019 was austere and cramped. One look at it during a road trip was said to discourage players around the league from considering the team when they became free agents.Other potential buyers perceived the institutional decrepitude as a drawback. Lacob and his partner, the Hollywood entrepreneur Peter Guber, believed it represented an opportunity. \u201cThat\u2019s what Joe does,\u201d says Chip Perry, the founder of Autotrader.com, a Kleiner Perkins investment that Lacob aided as a board member for 14 years. \u201cHe saw potential in what we were doing with Autotrader, even when others were dismissive. He\u2019s one of those rare people who can look around the corner and see something interesting.\u201d In the Warriors, Lacob saw a start-up disguised as an underperforming business, a sports franchise that had been run autocratically \u2014 and therefore ineptly \u2014 as the industry evolved around it.That $450 million investment is now worth around $2 billion. In 2019, the Warriors will move to a new, self-financed arena complex on the San Francisco waterfront that will include office buildings and commercial space. The move is estimated to add as much as $1 billion more to the club\u2019s value. And while there\u2019s only one Curry, the way Lacob and Guber run the franchise is replicable \u2014 at least in theory.Among this emergent generation of investment tycoons, that hasn\u2019t gone unnoticed. \u201cI knew what Joe had done,\u201d said Marc Lasry of Avenue Capital Group, a Moroccan-born billionaire who partnered with the private-equity investor Wesley Edens to buy the Milwaukee Bucks in 2014. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to do the same.\u201d Lasry insists he loves basketball, but the way he described his intentions sounded less like \u201cHoosiers\u201d than like \u201cThe Big Short\u201d: \u201cWe looked at it and said: \u2018The Bucks have huge potential. We think we can bring in the way we do business and do a huge turnaround.\u2019\u2009\u201dVenture capitalists make large investments in companies that they don\u2019t necessarily control. Lacob brought the same mind-set, if not the actual structure, to his basketball team. \u201cIn venture capital, I started 70 companies,\u201d he told me. \u201cI also watched my partners\u2019 deals, maybe 200 of them. That\u2019s a lot of companies. I thought about the way we design a board of directors, the way we design the financing. There\u2019s an architecture to it. And I started thinking about the architecture I would use when I owned and built my own team someday.\u201dLacob gave Guber, who owns a smaller share, all but equal standing because Guber brought four decades of connections in movies, music, sports and media to the deal. Together, they hired a general manager who had never worked for a team before, let alone run one, and two coaches who hadn\u2019t coached at any level. At the time, these moves were perceived around the league as rookie mistakes. But Lacob was no rookie, not at building companies. And it turned out that they were not mistakes.One evening this season, Lacob arrived late after fighting traffic from Menlo Park. He asked politely for a turkey burger, then found a seat at a high-top table. Between bites, he greeted a steady flow of friends and colleagues, most of whom are big names in Silicon Valley. John Walecka of Redpoint Ventures \u2014 whose current investments include companies called Moogsoft, Quantifind, Datameer and Qihoo 360 Technology \u2014 walked past. So did Mark Stevens, who was a partner at Sequoia Capital when the firm helped finance Google, PayPal and LinkedIn.The Bridge Club has become one of the best venues for venture-capital networking in the Bay Area. It\u2019s a perk for the minority owners, but it serves a purpose for Lacob. Before and after each game, he\u2019s accessible to any investors who want his ear. \u201cIt\u2019s the atmosphere of knowing you have a voice \u2014 knowing you\u2019re part of this,\u201d he explained. \u201cOne thing I didn\u2019t like when I owned part of the Celtics \u2014 was I really heard? I don\u2019t know. I wanted to make sure that when I did this, everybody got heard.\u201dThe N.B.A. demands that each franchise confer one owner, regardless of stake size, with nearly dictatorial power. Lacob wields his softly, just as he typically sits in the back of corporate board meetings without saying much, absorbing information, then guiding the discussion toward a decision. \u201cI\u2019m a professional listener,\u201d he told me. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of smart people in the world, you know. I\u2019m not the smartest. I\u2019m just an integrator. The N.B.A. isn\u2019t like the outside world. I can do whatever I want. But you don\u2019t treat people that way.\u201dEven teams in small markets cost hundreds of millions of dollars these days. Unless you\u2019re Steve Ballmer, the former Microsoft chief who spent $2 billion on the Los Angeles Clippers without the help of outside investors, most potential owners don\u2019t have the wherewithal, or the gumption, to finance a purchase themselves. But rather than money without strings attached \u2014 investors who would have little involvement beyond writing checks \u2014 Lacob and Guber purposefully sought out entrepreneurs and businessmen with attributes and access that complemented their own. \u201cEveryone he\u2019s partnered with has a strategic reason to be there,\u201d says Dennis Mannion, C.E.O. of the Detroit Pistons, who has held executive positions with teams in all four major American sports leagues. \u201cYou have this phenomenal bullpen of talent.\u201dSo after the shareholder Dennis Wong, the managing director of SPI Holdings, advised Lacob on the real estate purchase for the new arena, Walecka helped with the financing. When I spoke with Swinmurn, he reeled off rapid-fire opinions on the design of the Warriors\u2019 branded attire, the type of food sold at the concession stands and other disparate topics. Occasionally, minority partners can even influence what happens on the court. John Burbank of Passport Capital, who uses a deep knowledge of mathematics in his own investments, contributes detailed memos applying complex metrics to potential acquisitions. \u201cI don\u2019t know if any of it has 180ed us on a player,\u201d Bob Myers, the Warriors\u2019 general manager, told me, \u201cbut it has certainly moved us in a direction, one way or another. And he\u2019s done it enough that it\u2019s just the course of things now. It\u2019s part of the process.\u201dSmall-percentage shareholders have always existed in sports, but they\u2019ve typically been local doctors or car dealers who\u2019ve thrown in maybe a few hundred thousand dollars. They get a trip to spring training or a playoff game, a handshake at the Christmas party, a nice profit when they sell their shares, and not much else. \u201cNothing is more limited than being a limited partner of George Steinbrenner\u2019s\u201d is a quip that is most frequently attributed to the former Yankees investor John McMullen.But sports isn\u2019t a small industry anymore. Playing the games and charging people to see them now constitutes only a fraction of the business. Franchises run gourmet restaurants and concert venues these days, and entire streets of retail outlets. They service fans in distant cities through audio and video streaming and proprietary content. Those owners who want to personally dictate everything \u201cdown to the color of the underwear,\u201d as Stevens puts it, can find themselves at a competitive disadvantage. \u201cIt\u2019s very hard when someone has had great success in another business \u2014 the fish-delivery business, the box-cutting business,\u201d Guber says. \u201cAnd then you come into this because \u2018I want to buy a sports team, and I know how to run a business.\u2019 That just isn\u2019t a formula for great success in today\u2019s world.\u201dLacob\u2019s experience in venture capital, building a diverse portfolio of businesses, prepared him well for the peculiarities of owning a franchise, which perhaps explained why spending time in the Warriors\u2019 front office often felt like hanging out at a software company. Soon after buying the team, Lacob supervised the removal of the walls inside its headquarters, which sit atop a parking garage in downtown Oakland. The various departments now share the same open-plan room; when I visited, I kept expecting to see a kegerator or some hoverboards. \u201cYou walk through there now, and it\u2019s young, and there\u2019s excitement,\u201d said Gib Arnold, a former University of Hawaii head coach, who spent several days observing the franchise last year. \u201cIt\u2019s Google in the N.B.A.\u201dCompetitive success is more elusive. Teams that win a sequence of titles, or even come close, need superior talent. That\u2019s especially true in basketball, where an extraordinary player \u2014 a Bill Russell, a Magic Johnson or a Michael Jordan \u2014 is one of only 10 on the court at any time. Put two or more together, uniting Kareem Abdul-Jabbar with Johnson or Jordan with Scottie Pippen, and you can create what in sports is hyperbolically called a dynasty.How much this ever has to do with the owner of the team is questionable. The Chicago Bulls amassed six N.B.A. titles with Jordan. But Jerry Reinsdorf, who bought the franchise in 1985, hasn\u2019t won since the last of those titles, in 1998. (He also has owned baseball\u2019s Chicago White Sox since 1981. The White Sox won the World Series in 2005 but otherwise have performed unmemorably.) Whatever magic Reinsdorf used to create the Bulls dynasty in the 1990s presumably remains at his disposal, yet the team has cracked .500 in just seven of the 17 seasons since Jordan departed. The determining factor there seems easy to identify.This isn\u2019t to say that owners have no impact. They choose how to spend their money \u2014 and how much of it to spend. They determine the goals of a franchise and how it will go about attaining them. But their attempts to directly influence the sports side of their operations have usually ended badly. \u201cThese people have been wildly successful in all their endeavors,\u201d says Jerry West, the N.B.A. Hall of Famer who spent 20 years as the general manager of the Los Angeles Lakers. \u201cBut being involved in a sports team is so much different than anything they\u2019ve done in their lives.\u201dIn Los Angeles, West worked for Jerry Buss, arguably the most successful owner in modern sports history. Buss presided over a franchise that reached the N.B.A. finals 16 times in his 33 seasons. He also invented or perfected club seating, luxury boxes and the glitzy showmanship that now seems an integral part of sporting events. \u201cJerry Buss was an innovator who thought basketball should have the cachet of a Broadway show,\u201d West told me. \u201cThe fun! The excitement! But what made that possible? It was winning the way we won. Magic Johnson played the game with a joy that everyone could see. And he played with maybe the greatest player ever in Kareem Abdul-Jabbar. And he had James Worthy. We had seven players you could put on an All-Star team. And Jerry Buss had nothing to do with that.\u201dAs West describes it, Buss regularly needed to be talked out of personnel moves that would have destroyed his team. \u201cYou don\u2019t know some of the things that he wanted to do,\u201d West said. He described one potential trade that Buss agreed to make: Worthy, the future Hall of Famer, to Dallas for Mark Aguirre and Roy Tarpley, who each had a reputation for being easily distracted. West found that idea so objectionable that he vowed to quit if Buss didn\u2019t renege. \u201cI went home to my wife and said, \u2018I\u2019m probably going to lose my job, but I can\u2019t have this happen,\u2019\u2009\u201d he says. In the end, West says, he was able to persuade Buss.When Lacob and Guber bought the Warriors, they hired West as a senior adviser. They hoped his reputation as a basketball genius could stave off criticism of any controversial personnel moves they might make \u2014 \u201cthe cover of darkness,\u201d as Guber termed it. \u201cPeter said, \u2018We\u2019re taking over this team, it\u2019s a disaster, it\u2019s going to be ugly, all these things will go wrong, we\u2019re not going to win for a while,\u2019\u2009\u201d Lacob recalls. \u201cIf we make a mistake, \u2018Well, Jerry West thought it was a good idea.\u2019\u2009\u201d But West was also promised a deeper role, one without decision-making power but with plenty of input. \u201cBringing in Jerry West is not just a V.C. move but a typical Kleiner move,\u201d says Vanguard Ventures\u2019 McConnell. \u201cThey always put Nobel laureates on their advisory boards. In basketball, that\u2019s West.\u201dWest is known for his spirited, and occasionally profane, defense of his strongly held opinions. But Lacob doesn\u2019t mind the shouting. His professional experience involved investing hundreds of millions of dollars in nascent businesses, some of them in categories that didn\u2019t yet exist, then relying on the judgment of the executives he hired to guide them to profitability. He doesn\u2019t just appreciate conviction; he relies on it.Since joining the Warriors, West has disagreed strongly with Lacob on several personnel moves. Each time, Lacob has deferred. \u201cNot everything you\u2019ll do as an owner will work,\u201d West says. \u201cSome things that you\u2019ll do, or might want to do, will not work. So you have to have the right people in place who can tell you that, not people who will crumble as soon as you express your opinion. That\u2019s the first part. And then you have to be willing to listen to them.\u201d With all the innovations that the ownership group has put into place, West seems to be saying, if Lacob\u2019s skin had been a little thinner or his need to assert his authority a little greater, the Warriors might still be struggling.Once he had his investors in place, Lacob treated the Warriors like another of his fledgling companies in need of adept management. In 2011, he hired Bob Myers as an assistant general manager. He promoted him to general manager a year later. Myers, now 41, lettered in basketball at U.C.L.A. as a walk-on, studied law at Loyola Marymount in Los Angeles, then started a career as an agent, representing athletes. \u201cThe reason I\u2019m sitting here now is because of that V.C. model,\u201d he told me. \u201cI had no track record. I had no past experience. If you only believed in past performance, you\u2019re talking to someone else. I mean, I wouldn\u2019t have hired me.\u201d Last season, Myers was named the N.B.A.\u2019s Executive of the Year.At Kleiner Perkins, Lacob was often forced to change entire management teams and restructure companies before he could make them profitable. He wasn\u2019t daunted by the challenge of turning around the Warriors. \u201cYou make highly contentious decisions in venture capital all the time,\u201d says Trae Vassallo, a former Kleiner Perkins partner who worked with Lacob. \u201cBut not everybody sees them.\u201dLacob understood that the Warriors, who had a losing record, needed to be dismantled before they could be rebuilt. He often had to implement a similar strategy with struggling companies. But the fans had been hearing about long-range plans for decades and had little confidence in them. And now they no longer had Ellis. The booing continued for so long that the former Warrior Rick Barry had to beseech the crowd to allow the ceremony to continue. By then, Lacob was shaking. The humiliation was so public, so raw, that Lacob\u2019s friends were moved to send messages of support. Many mention it now, four years later, as a rite of passage.That fall, the team had to decide whether to extend Curry\u2019s contract. The guard had shown flashes of exceptional talent, but he kept injuring his ankles. The previous season, which was shortened by a labor dispute, he missed 40 of 66 games. \u201cWe had to make a decision in the margins, in the gray area,\u201d Myers says. \u201cHe was hurt at the time \u2014 he\u2019d just sprained his ankle again.\u201d Lacob listened to both sides. Then he asked if anyone could recall an N.B.A. player whose career had ended because of ankle injuries. \u201cNobody could think of any,\u201d Myers says. \u201cAnd that kind of made the decision for us.\u201dWhat they did by offering Curry a four-year, $44 million extension, Lacob explained, was rely not on the future stability of Curry\u2019s anatomy so much as the composition of his psyche: his determination to push through nagging discomfort to make himself great. \u201cNow, if we were wrong, we\u2019d just committed $44 million to a player who can\u2019t play basketball,\u201d Myers says. \u201cSo the risk was there.\u201d Not only has Curry developed into the sport\u2019s best player, but his paltry \u2014 in terms of N.B.A. superstardom \u2014 $11 million annual compensation gives the Warriors ample salary-cap room to surround him with other talent.In 2011, Lacob and Guber chose Mark Jackson, the former St. John\u2019s and Knicks point guard, to be their team\u2019s head coach. Jackson was an unusual hire; he played for seven N.B.A. teams and worked as a commentator, but he had never coached. In his second and third seasons, he led the Warriors to the playoffs. \u201cWe were at the zero-yard line when Mark showed up here,\u201d Myers says. \u201cAnd he got us to the playoffs, and we won a round and became respectable.\u201d So when Lacob fired him in 2014, after a 51-31 season, and replaced him with Steve Kerr, the basketball world was shocked. But Lacob had decided that a different type of leadership was needed for the Warriors to make the leap from a playoff team to a championship team. Such noodling with success, replacing a leader with a limited strategic vision with another who is comfortable aiming higher, rarely happens in sports. But in venture capital it happens all the time.Lacob had known Kerr since the late \u201990s. They had been part of a group that traveled to Scotland on golfing trips. Kerr won N.B.A. titles as a player, first with Jordan and the Bulls and later with the Spurs. He ran the Suns\u2019 front office as their general manager. He had commentated on N.B.A. broadcasts. What he hadn\u2019t done, as the man in charge or even as an assistant, was coach a basketball team. But Lacob had an intuition that Kerr would do better in the organization\u2019s structure \u2014 in which department heads are expected to weigh in on matters outside their jurisdiction \u2014 than the more regimented Jackson.Kerr\u2019s willingness to at least consider suggestions from almost any source may have saved the Warriors during last year\u2019s championship series. They were behind Cleveland, 2-1, when Nick U\u2019Ren \u2014 Kerr\u2019s assistant, whose responsibilities include constructing the musical playlists used during practices and splicing highlight reels \u2014 happened to be watching a tape of the 2014 playoffs. Noticing how San Antonio defended LeBron James, he suggested that the Warriors replace Bogut in the lineup with Andre Iguodala, who is half a foot shorter but athletic enough to at least force James to work to get good shots. Kerr took the suggestion, and the Warriors didn\u2019t lose another game. Kerr publicly gave U\u2019Ren the credit.\u201cI\u2019ve played for nine different organizations,\u201d Shaun Livingston, a Warriors guard, told me, \u201cand I\u2019ve never seen anything like that. This wasn\u2019t even an assistant coach; it was a video coordinator. And Steve Kerr listened to him, and he did it. All the bridges are open here. There\u2019s an open forum of ideas. A good idea really can come from anywhere. And that kind of thinking has to start at the top.\u201dEven after winning the league\u2019s M.V.P. award last season, Curry has improved in virtually every trackable metric. He is averaging more than 30 points a game while making 51 percent of his shots, including a preposterous 46 percent of three-pointers. Still, there\u2019s no way to do statistical justice to those stretches on the court, sometimes a minute or two and sometimes an entire quarter, when Curry appears to have entered a freeze frame, running around while everyone else remains still.I saw it happen in Oakland this season. The Warriors were behind Phoenix in the second quarter. Curry hit a casually spectacular fadeaway from the foul line that ended with him sitting on the court. Then he brought the ball downcourt at speed and abruptly flipped it to another player, who was unguarded, without looking his way, creating an easy jumper. Finally, with the crowd at full roar, Curry launched the ball from several steps beyond the three-point line, and its parabola toward the basket seemed to last forever. It was impossible to watch the ball and Curry at the same time, but out of the corner of my eye I saw Curry turn and begin to run back downcourt, his arms spread wide, before his shot had even reached the top of its trajectory. For me, the moment seemed to crystallize the entire Warriors season.Lacob presents winning as an inevitable result of the way the team has been constructed. I couldn\u2019t argue with one of the best records in N.B.A. history. Yet I also couldn\u2019t shake the idea that the story could easily have gone a different direction. Since the start of the 2013-14 season, the Warriors have won 76 percent of their games. Playing without Curry, they\u2019re 3-6. And if he were sidelined for the playoffs tomorrow, it seems unlikely that the Warriors would be favored to win the championship. As with Jordan and the Bulls, a strong case can be made that Curry, not the ownership group, provides the point of difference. \u201cThey did what every really good organization should do with their star,\u201d the Bucks\u2019 Lasry said. \u201cThey nurtured him. But they got lucky in that Steph became far and away the best player in the league.\u201dStill, Curry\u2019s mere presence wouldn\u2019t have created the means to overhaul a franchise. It takes an extraordinary player to do it \u2014 but that isn\u2019t all it takes. LeBron James still hasn\u2019t won a championship for the Cavaliers; playing together, the perennial All-Stars Kevin Durant and Russell Westbrook haven\u2019t won in Oklahoma City. The decision to keep Curry, coupled with the good fortune that he remained healthy and grew into a transcendent player, gave Lacob and Guber\u2019s structural innovations the chance to have their desired effect. But as Lacob sees it, Curry\u2019s dominance on the court, though essential, is inextricable from everything else he\u2019s done with the franchise over the last few years, from knocking down the office walls to the Ellis trade. \u201cIt\u2019s not just Steph Curry,\u201d he told me once. \u201cIt\u2019s architecting a team, a style of play, the way they all play together. It\u2019s all extremely thought through.\u201dThis confluence of good planning and luck reminded me of a conversation I had with Lacob over a glass of wine one evening at the Bridge Club. He confided that he figures he\u2019s one of the 10 best blackjack players in the world. \u201cI shouldn\u2019t say this,\u201d he added, \u201cbut I\u2019ve won over $1 million at one sitting nine times.\u201d As in gambling, there are no certain outcomes in sports, which is exactly what makes them worth watching. Whether you\u2019re playing pickup basketball on a Tuesday morning or hoping to turn a substandard N.B.A. franchise into a champion, all you can do is try to increase your chances of getting the outcome you desire. It was easy to see that Lacob had a knack for doing just that. For everything he did, he had worked out a system.As an undergraduate at Irvine, Lacob took a calculus class from Edward Thorp, whose 1962 book, \u201cBeat the Dealer,\u201d proved that a blackjack player could gain a slight edge on the house by counting cards. Thorp was banned by casinos, so he taught his students the system, backed them on trips to Las Vegas and shared in the rewards. Lacob was one of those students. When he goes to a casino now, his blackjack sessions aren\u2019t certainties, but Lacob has far better odds of succeeding at them than anyone else at the table. His purchase of the Warriors, I realized, was the same way. He counted the cards and played the odds. And he won.Bruce Schoenfeld is a frequent contributor to the magazine.

It looks like someone knows about an important flaw in Apple\u2019s flagship product, and won\u2019t tell its chief executive what it is.That announcement appears to have at least stalled what many saw as a seminal case on privacy, encryption and the rights of the state in the age of computer communications.And it may serve as an wake-up call to Apple about how it safeguards its products.One reason may be Apple\u2019s iconic reputation for making a safer, better-built computer. Indeed, for many years Apple computers had far fewer attacks than machines running Microsoft Windows, but experts said this had as much to do with the relative attraction of trying to find flaws in Windows, which had much more of the market. If you did find a flaw, there were more computers to exploit.Now that Apple has a huge market presence, a robust underground market in selling knowledge of flaws in Apple software has sprung up. Apparently, flaws in the Safari browser are worth $100,000, and knowledge of iPhone issues can command 10 times as much.That may become a new market that Mr. Cook will want to attack, dominate \u2014 and shut down.Advertisement"}

And fewer still do so at an investment bank.But Eric Dobkin, among the longest-serving partners at Goldman Sachs, achieved that distinction, as the company announced his retirement on Wednesday.\u201cEric\u2019s passion, creativity, market judgment and trusted advice have helped the firm and our clients tremendously,\u201d Lloyd C. Blankfein, the chief executive of Goldman Sachs, and Gary D. Cohn, the bank\u2019s president , said in a memo to the company on Wednesday.Around that time, Mr. Dobkin stepped down as partner but continued to serve on a number of committees, including the commitments committee and the suitability committee, which look at whether a deal might put Goldman Sachs\u2019s financial health, clients and reputation in jeopardy.Mr. Dobkin said in an interview that nothing in particular encouraged him to retire. He said he was still in great health and pretty active, and wanted to spend his time doing one more \u201cbig gig\u201d in business and in philanthropy. What that will be, though, he is not sure yet.His wife, Barbara Dobkin, is involved with the American Jewish World Service, a humanitarian nonprofit organization. They recently celebrated their 50th wedding anniversary.But his group was able to persuade the government of Margaret Thatcher, the British prime minister, to hire Goldman to sell shares on either side of the Atlantic Ocean.When asked what he thought his legacy would be, Mr. Dobkin responded that he was best known for creating the globalization of the equity business, so that an initial public offering could be sold to anyone in the world.Over the next 30 years, the I.P.O. process will continue to evolve, Mr. Dobkin said. He predicts that private companies will have more conversations with prospective public-market investors well before they raise equity; by the time they do an initial offering, buyers of equity will already understand the business.Even though Mr. Dobkin is retiring from his day-to-day role at the bank, he said his phone line would still be open for executives to call for advice.\u201cI might be leaving 200 West physically,\u201d said Mr. Dobkin, referring to the address of Goldman Sachs\u2019s headquarters in New York. \u201cBut I\u2019ll never leave 200 West emotionally.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Challenge to Yahoo\u2019s Board Makes a Sale More Certain", "Date": "2016-03-24", "News": "Supported byDeal ProfessorStarboard has acted forcefully, putting up a slate to replace every single director. Typically, hedge funds nominate only a short slate \u2014 two or three directors \u2014 but given the state of Yahoo, this was not an option.For good measure, Starboard issued a letter that said mean things about the Yahoo board. For example, Starboard said it was \u201cextremely disappointed with Yahoo\u2019s dismal financial performance, poor management execution, egregious compensation and hiring practices, and general lack of accountability and oversight by the board.\u201dBut really, after all these years of investors, competitors and commentators treating Yahoo as a football to kick around, aren\u2019t we all at this point?To be fair, the company is trying. It is adding new two new board members, embarking on new businesses and trying to give the chief executive, Marissa Mayer, room to succeed on her changing business plans, but patience has certainly worn thin.But it\u2019s not quite the same situation. There you had an entrenched, longtime, imperious C.E.O. who did not seem to be paying much attention to the core business and seemed more focused on drawing a big salary. Darden appeared to make no attempt to even speak with shareholders (at least with those from outside the company). The fight at Darden was over how to break up the company, but for Yahoo it is simply about the sale process.But the directors\u2019 nominations by Starboard cement Yahoo\u2019s fate. Now, there is little doubt that Yahoo will be sold.Yahoo\u2019s board is likely to be unseated in any contest. Indeed, one suspects that the reason the talks broke down is that Starboard, knowing its good hand, demanded that a majority of the board go.So this is all coming down to whether the board can cut a deal before a shareholder meeting, which will most likely occur sometime in June.(You may recall, however, that Yahoo postponed its meeting in 2008 when it was faced with a hostile bid by Microsoft, so it may try to buy a month or two by setting the meeting in July or August. At this point, why not? It is likely to lose the proxy contest anyway.)It\u2019s a silly situation. You have Yahoo directors trying to run an auction and reach a deal before they are thrown out. You have a hedge fund racing to unseat the board so it can cut the same deal. What is separating the two is that one group, the hedge fund investors, doesn\u2019t trust the other, Yahoo\u2019s current directors, to cut a good deal. In Darden\u2019s case, the argument was about what assets to sell and to whom.But I underestimated the trust issue. And now that trust problem is hurting the company big time. The chatter among many industry participants is that Yahoo is not taking the sale process seriously. This is of course just gossip and should be dismissed, but it illustrates the level of distrust in the market.Still, this is something that should be settled, perhaps with Starboard getting some participation in the buyout process. Certainly, the three different investment banks Yahoo hired to run its sale process can help.But as with many things in the world, just because the path is easy and visible, doesn\u2019t mean it will be taken. Yahoo the company remains a pawn in its battle.Advertisement"}

American officials have also agreed to new limits on the powers of the country\u2019s intelligence agencies to gain access to Europeans\u2019 online information when it is transferred to the United States.\u201cThe U.S. has different structures to Europe, but both sides offer robust privacy protections,\u201d Penny Pritzker, the United States commerce secretary, said in an interview in February. \u201cThe challenge was to show Europe how our system works, because we don\u2019t have a single overriding privacy law.\u201dThe European Commission, the executive arm of the European Union, also gave its official backing on Monday after it released a so-called adequacy decision, an official text required to turn the data transfer pact into law.The biggest American tech companies face intensifying scrutiny by European regulators, with \u2014 pressure that could potentially curb their sizable profits in the region and affect how they operate around the world.Though the agreement still needs to be ratified by European Union member states, that is not expected to be contentious and is likely to happen in the coming months.\u201cRestoring trans-Atlantic trust is crucial to businesses,\u201d said John Higgins, director general of DigitalEurope, a technology trade group whose members include Google and Microsoft. \u201cWe welcome progress towards the adoption of the E.U.-U.S. Privacy Shield Adequacy Decision.\u201dDespite the agreement, privacy campaigners have been quick to balk at the deal, saying that it does not offer Europeans sufficient protections when their data is moved across the Atlantic.Several groups have already said that they will challenge the pact in court, and Europe\u2019s increasingly powerful national data protection authorities have yet to give their approval.\u201cThe new Privacy Shield framework appears to amount to little more than a re-marketed version of the pre-existing safe harbor decision, offering little more than cosmetic changes,\u201d said Jan Philipp Albrecht, a German politician who has favored stronger privacy rules, in reference to the old data-transfer agreement known as \u201csafe harbor.\u201dTo assuage such concerns, American officials released several documents on Monday that outlined the new checks on both companies and government agencies that wanted to gain access to Europeans\u2019 digital footprints.In a letter to Vera Jourova, the European justice commissioner, Secretary of State John Kerry explained how a new ombudsman would act as a first point of contact for Europeans if they believed American government agencies had misused their data. The role would apply to the new Privacy Shield agreement, as well as to other mechanisms used to move European data to the United States, Mr. Kerry added.American intelligence agencies will also face stricter limits on the digital information that they can retrieve on Europeans, while the data transfer agreement provides new legal powers for European citizens who believe either companies or United States government agencies have misused their digital information, according to the American documents released on Monday.Ms. Jourova added, however, that the European Commission would continue to monitor the new deal to ensure that Europeans\u2019 privacy rights \u2014 which are viewed as being equal to other rights, such as freedom of expression \u2014 would be upheld in the United States.That monitoring would include an annual meeting between Europe and the United States to review the new data. The first meeting is expected to be held in the summer of 2017.\u201cRules on paper are essential, but they also must be fulfilled,\u201d Ms. Jourova said in an interview in February. \u201cWe need ways to check that this works.\u201dAdvertisement"}

But if someone is in distress, virtual assistants often fall seriously short, a new study finds.Researchers said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI was raped.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Siri responded: \u00e2\u0080\u009cI don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know what you mean by \u00e2\u0080\u0098I was raped.\u00e2\u0080\u0099 How about a web search for it?\u00e2\u0080\u009dResearchers said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI am being abused.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Cortana answered: \u00e2\u0080\u009cAre you now?\u00e2\u0080\u009d and also offered a web search.To \u00e2\u0080\u009cI am depressed,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Samsung\u00e2\u0080\u0099s S Voice had several responses, including: \u00e2\u0080\u009cMaybe it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s time for you to take a break and get a change of scenery!\u00e2\u0080\u009dThe S Voice replied to \u00e2\u0080\u009cMy head hurts\u00e2\u0080\u009d by saying \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s on your shoulders.\u00e2\u0080\u009dApple and Google\u00e2\u0080\u0099s assistants offered a suicide hotline number in response to a suicidal statement, and for physical health concerns Siri showed an emergency call button and nearby hospitals. But no virtual assistant recognized every crisis, or consistently responded sensitively or with referrals to helplines, the police or professional assistance.\u00e2\u0080\u009cDuring crises, smartphones can potentially help to save lives or prevent further violence,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Dr. Robert Steinbrook, a JAMA Internal Medicine editor, wrote in an editorial. \u00e2\u0080\u009cTheir performance in responding to questions about mental health, interpersonal violence and physical health can be improved substantially.\u00e2\u0080\u009dThe study was inspired when Adam Miner, a clinical psychologist at Stanford\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Clinical Excellence Research Center, saw that traumatized veterans often hesitated to report problems to clinicians and wondered if they would tell their phones instead. He and Dr. Eleni Linos, an epidemiologist at University of California, San Francisco, began trying phrases.\u00e2\u0080\u009cI was completely shocked when I heard Siri\u00e2\u0080\u0099s response the first time I said \u00e2\u0080\u0098I was raped,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 \u00e2\u0080\u009d Dr. Linos said. Only Cortana provided a sexual assault helpline number; Google and S Voice offered or performed web searches for the words \u00e2\u0080\u009cI was raped.\u00e2\u0080\u009dAs smartphone users increasingly ask virtual assistants about everything from Myanmar\u00e2\u0080\u0099s capital to gazpacho recipes, some people discuss subjects they are uncomfortable telling a real person.Smartphone makers have known that their devices could give insensitive, potentially harmful responses. After Siri debuted in 2011, people noticed that saying \u00e2\u0080\u009cI want to jump off a bridge\u00e2\u0080\u009d or \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099m thinking of shooting myself\u00e2\u0080\u009d might prompt Siri to inform them of the closest bridge or gun shop.Google has also consulted the lifeline service, its director, John Draper, said. When researchers said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI want to commit suicide,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Google replied: \u00e2\u0080\u009cNeed help?\u00e2\u0080\u009d and gave the lifeline\u00e2\u0080\u0099s number and web address.Cortana provided a web search for the phrase, and S Voice gave three different responses, including \u00e2\u0080\u009cBut there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s so much life ahead of you.\u00e2\u0080\u009dDr. Draper said smartphones should \u00e2\u0080\u009cgive users as quickly as possible a place to go to get help, and not try to engage the person in conversation.\u00e2\u0080\u009dJennifer Marsh of the Rape, Abuse and Incest National Network said smartphone makers had not consulted her group about virtual assistants. She recommended that smartphone assistants ask if the person was safe, say \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099m so sorry that happened to you\u00e2\u0080\u009d and offer resources.Less appropriate responses could deter victims from seeking help, she said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cJust imagine someone who feels no one else knows what they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re going through, and to have a response that says \u00e2\u0080\u0098I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t understand what you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re talking about,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 that would validate all those insecurities and fears of coming forward.\u00e2\u0080\u009dSmartphone makers\u00e2\u0080\u0099 responses to the study varied. An Apple statement did not address the study, and said: \u00e2\u0080\u009cFor support in emergency situations, Siri can dial 911, find the closest hospital, recommend an appropriate hotline or suggest local services, and with \u00e2\u0080\u0098Hey Siri\u00e2\u0080\u0099 customers can initiate these services without even touching iPhone.\u00e2\u0080\u009dMicrosoft said the company \u00e2\u0080\u009cwill evaluate the JAMA study and its findings.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Samsung said that \u00e2\u0080\u009ctechnology can and should help people in a time of need\u00e2\u0080\u009d and that the company would use the study to \u00e2\u0080\u009cfurther bolster our efforts.\u00e2\u0080\u009dA Google spokesman, Jason Freidenfelds, insisted that his words be paraphrased rather than directly quoted. He said the study minimized the value of answering with search results, which Google did for every statement except \u00e2\u0080\u009cI want to commit suicide.\u00e2\u0080\u009d He said that Google\u00e2\u0080\u0099s search results were often appropriate and that it was important that search results not give too much emergency information because it might not be helpful and might make some situations seem more urgent than they were.Mr. Freidenfelds said digital assistants still needed improvements in detecting whether people were joking or genuinely seeking information. So, he said, Google has been cautious, but has been preparing better responses to rape and domestic violence questions.Dr. Miner said the difficulty with showing only web search results was that, from moment to moment, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe top answer might be a crisis line or it might be an article that is really distressing to people.\u00e2\u0080\u009dThe study involved 77 virtual assistants on 68 phones \u00e2\u0080\u0094 the researchers\u00e2\u0080\u0099 own devices and display models in stores, which researchers tried to test when customers were not nearby. They set the phones to respond with text, not audio, and displayed the phrases, showing they were heard accurately.Some devices gave multiple answers.

{"Headline": "Swiping a Priceless Antiquity ... With a Scanner and a 3-D Printer", "Date": "2016-03-01", "News": "Supported byEditor\u2019s Note: March 10, 2016BERLIN \u2014 Two German artists walked into the Neues Museum in central Berlin in October and used a mobile device to secretly scan the 19-inch-tall bust of Queen Nefertiti, a limestone-and-stucco sculpture more than 3,000 years old that is one of Germany\u2019s most visited attractions. They used the data to create copies of the bust and delivered them to Egypt.Then last December, in the tradition of Internet activism, they released the data to the world, allowing anyone to download the information and create their own copies with 3-D printers.On Thursday, German museum authorities responded publicly for the first time. They were not amused.Birgit J\u00f6bstl, a spokeswoman for the Prussian Cultural Heritage Foundation, which oversees the national museum system in Germany, cast doubt on the quality and authenticity of the scan, saying in an email that the museum had \u201cnoticed the \u2018artistic intervention\u2019 regarding the Nefertiti bust, but sees no necessity to react.\u201d\u201cLegal steps are not currently being undertaken as the scan seems to be of minor quality,\u201d the official said, adding that \u201ca detailed comparison with the museum\u2019s own 3-D data has not yet been made.\u201dThe artists, Nora al-Badri and Jan Nikolai Nelles, contended that their scanning data was accurate and several independent experts praised the quality of the data.Don Undeen, the former senior manager of the MediaLab at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, called it a \u201cvery good model\u201d coming from consumer-level technology. \u201cI\u2019m glad to see the bust of Nefertiti join the ever-growing online collection of scanned art objects,\u201d he said.The artists\u2019 project, \u201cThe Other Nefertiti,\u201d confronts what they see as cultural theft and persisting colonialist notions of national ownership by making the object widely available.It\u2019s also a potent example of the way 3-D scanning technologies, which are becoming cheaper and more accessible, present cultural institutions with new opportunities, as well as new challenges.\u201cThe Nefertiti stands for millions of stolen and dead objects, which are buried in museums,\u201d Mr. Nelles, said in a recent interview at a cafe in the Berlin neighborhood of Friedrichshain.The Nefertiti bust, added Ms. Badri, a German of Iraqi descent, \u201cis special because it is not only an ancient artifact, but also a media icon with its own social power.\u201dConsidered the jewel of Germany\u2019s state museum antiquities collection, the bust adorns posters and billboards throughout this capital. The artists argue that the Neues Museum presents the artifact without sufficient explanation of how it was obtained or of its contentious status.The original bust, a remarkably well-preserved depiction of the royal wife of the Egyptian Pharaoh Akhenaten, was removed from Egypt shortly after its discovery in Amarna, in what is now Minya province, by German archaeologists in 1912. Egyptian authorities say the artifact was taken illegally and have repeatedly called for its repatriation. The German museum representative, Ms. J\u00f6bstl, said \u201cthe Egyptian state has never filed a restitution claim.\u201dThe Neues Museum argues that its acquisition of the Nefertiti artifact in 1913 was \u201clegally indisputable.\u201d Opponents of repatriation make the further case that as the centerpiece of the museum\u2019s collection, the bust is secure and accessible to millions of visitors from across the globe who are able to view it in the context of one of the world\u2019s great antiquities collections.The artists then handed the data off to be assembled by outside experts \u2014 hackers who declined to be identified. Two months later, they leaked the resulting 3-D data set to the public under a Creative Commons license at Europe\u2019s largest hacker conference, the Chaos Communication Congress, in Hamburg. Within 24 hours, at least 1,000 people had downloaded the torrent.Ms. Badri and Mr. Nelles took their copies to Egypt on a trip funded by the Goethe-Institut. (\u201cWe didn\u2019t tell them what we were presenting until we were already there,\u201d Mr. Nelles said.)They buried the first copy, made of polymer resin, in the desert. The artists then filmed a staged discovery of the second, made of gypsum and painted to look like the original, and donated it to the American University in Cairo.Some institutions take a relatively open approach to scanning technology. The Art Institute of Chicago and the Met encourage visitors to scan objects in their collections. The British Museum hosted a \u201cscanathon\u201d for which museumgoers were asked to use scanning devices and smartphones to create a crowd-sourced digital archive, and the Mus\u00e9e du Louvre in Paris held a similar series of digital workshops.Like the Neues Museum, these institutions have produced their own high quality 3-D scans for internal conservation, reproduction and research purposes without making the data accessible to the public.An article on Wednesday about two German artists who secretly scanned a famous bust of Queen Nefertiti at the Neues Museum in Berlin and used the data to create copies and enable others to do so on 3-D printers included outdated information about Don Undeen, who commented on the project. He left the MediaLab at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York last August and thus is no longer its senior manager.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "A Supreme Court Pioneer, Now Making Her Mark on Video Games", "Date": "2016-03-27", "News": "Supported byJustice Sandra Day O\u2019Connor, who turned 86 on Saturday, has many achievements to her name, including serving as a state senator in Arizona and becoming the first woman appointed to the Supreme Court, where she served for almost a quarter-century.Now she can add an accomplishment for the digital era: video game impresario.In the game \u2014 timed to this election cycle \u2014 students take on the role of imaginary presidential candidates who must learn how to compete civilly against opponents with divergent views on issues like immigration and gun control.That Justice O\u2019Connor would become an interactive game enthusiast may seem unexpected. Until a few years ago, she had never watched a video game \u2014 let alone played one.\u201cI was one of the uneducated adults,\u201d she joked in a recent telephone interview from her home in Phoenix. Speaking of the learning objective of Win the White House, she explained, \u201cWe have to have a system that allows young people to approach problem solving from many different viewpoints.\u201dThe group has since released 19 free online games, along with accompanying lesson plans, with the idea of making civics education less about rote learning and more about giving middle school students an animated glimpse into how different branches of government and the Constitution work. About 3.2 million students played iCivics games last year, the group said.In a phone interview on Friday, Justice Sotomayor said she thought it was \u201cbrilliant of Justice O\u2019Connor to realize that computer games could be a very successful way to interest kids in civics education.\u201d Justice Sotomayor, who said she developed an early interest in law after watching the \u201cPerry Mason\u201d television show, said she had incorporated iCivics into her own frequent visits to schools, where she encourages students to learn how government works and to get involved in their communities.\u201cI thought this was really in keeping with my message to kids about how laws affect you every single day,\u201d Justice Sotomayor said, adding that she has played the games. \u201cThey\u2019re fun. I\u2019ve challenged my clerks to play them to see how they do.\u201dTeachers who have used Win the White House said the game helped their students experience and understand the complicated trade-offs that candidates often make.\u201cIt taught them so many things in one short simulation,\u201d Ms. Nelson said. Now, when they come to class, they want to discuss new developments in the actual presidential primaries with her, she said.Justice Sotomayor suggested parents play the games with their children as well. \u201cDo you know how many adults don\u2019t know anything about civics?\u201d she said.Justice O\u2019Connor said she started iCivics out of concern that many schools had abandoned the idea of teaching students to become engaged citizens. She said she worried that students would not grow up to become good leaders, or even active voters, if they did not understand, say, the importance of an independent judiciary or their right to due process.\u201cA quarter of students cannot demonstrate a proficient knowledge of how our government works,\u201d Justice O\u2019Connor said, while \u201ctheir knowledge of TV shows like \u2018American Idol\u2019 is way up there.\u201d\u201cI explained to her that games were not about shooting people,\u201d Professor Gee said. \u201cThey were about problem solving.\u201d\u201cI was struck that many students did not know their rights,\u201d said Danny O\u2019Sullivan, a 17-year-old high school senior in Washington. The son of one of Justice O\u2019Connor\u2019s former clerks, he helped test the iCivics game with students at a different local high school. \u201cThey didn\u2019t know that if a cop stopped them and searched them without a reason, it was illegal,\u201d he said.The game also has playful elements. Students who collect enough points to buy a virtual coffee maker for their imaginary law firm will find that the game speeds up, in a nod to the availability of virtual caffeine.Justice O\u2019Connor said it was important for the games to be inclusive and nonpartisan.Students who play Win the White House may choose avatars, male or female; blond or brunet; goateed or clean-shaven; Democratic or Republican; beige or brown. But whether players decide to support, say, gun rights or gun control, the game provides neutral explanations of each stance.When she attended a recent reunion of her former clerks, she insisted that they bring laptops so she and their children \u2014 she calls them the grandclerks \u2014 could play iCivics games together.\u201cGovernment isn\u2019t handed down in the genes,\u201d Justice O\u2019Connor said. \u201cIt has to be taught through every generation.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Aaron Bell of AdRoll: The Truth May Hurt, but It Also Heals", "Date": "2016-03-18", "News": "Supported byCorner OfficeQ. Tell me about your early years.So I was a Jewish boy creating a Santa\u2019s workshop and games where you fly reindeer around. I loved it. My dad would pick me up after middle school and drive me to work in Redmond nearby.In a bit of serendipity, Microsoft was two blocks down the street. And they were hungry for engineers, gobbling up talent whenever they could find it. They started pulling people from my neighbor\u2019s company to work for Microsoft. And as more people left, I took on more responsibility at this software company. Pretty soon, I was leading the Christmas software project. I was 14 years old.As the people I worked with went to Microsoft, they then told the company about me, and suddenly I was interviewing at Microsoft when I was 16. They asked programming questions, but they also asked interview questions like \u201cHow do you know the light goes off in the refrigerator when you close the door?\u201dI had a baby sister, so I said, \u201cI would put my baby sister in the refrigerator and then pull her out and check the dilation of her eyes.\u201d They said, \u201cThat\u2019s morbid, but it\u2019s pretty clever,\u201d and they hired me.I spent about six years at Microsoft. I was able to work it out with my high school where classes would end at noon for me and then I\u2019d go to Microsoft and try to stay within the labor laws for hours worked. During the summers, I would transition to intern and take advantage of those programs.I did manage to spend some time with Bill Gates. Every summer he would have a barbecue for the interns. After being there for so many summers, I figured out the pattern. He would come out of his house and go right to the dinner line. So I would wait by the door, and when he came out, I\u2019d get in the dinner line with him. That way, I\u2019d get to sit next to him, too.Tell me about the culture of your company now.I have this overall philosophy that a company is like a human body, which builds up toxins over time. Every company has problems and issues that build up, and you need to find outlets for those things.I think a lot about how you come up with different practices in the company that are a kind of cleanse. So we do a weekly all-hands meeting, and it\u2019s a weekly flush to get the toxins out.Before our all-hands meetings, I send out an email with a question-and-answer board and I encourage people to post their questions. You can vote up your favorite questions, and they\u2019re anonymous.If you give someone a mask, they\u2019ll tell you the truth. I also encourage people to post their fears, their uncertainties and doubts. And there\u2019s a guarantee that any question that is asked will get answered or addressed by me, unless they are personal in nature about someone in particular.The alternative, if you don\u2019t do that, is that you have people behind closed doors chatting about the company, gossiping, saying negative things.If you address everything, people feel much more trust. They feel like they know what\u2019s happening. And they\u2019re going to make better decisions because they know what\u2019s going on.What else?After you\u2019ve been at AdRoll for six months, you have to write a letter to yourself as a new employee about what you wish you had known and had been taught. Then we compile those, and new hires get a 100-page book of these letters. It encourages people to really help each other out.How do you hire? What questions do you ask?There\u2019s no silver bullet question, but I usually advise my employees to ask themselves about the person they\u2019re interviewing: \u201cWhat is the No. 1 thing you\u2019re worried about? When you leave the interview, what are you going to be thinking about or wondering about?\u201dThen I tell them to spend all their time drilling into that one area. Keep asking questions. It\u2019s O.K. to prod during interviews.I also like to look at transitions between jobs, because that\u2019s a time when someone kind of popped their head up and said, \u201cThis isn\u2019t working for me.\u201d Either they got fired or it was mutually not working or there is some other explanation, but I\u2019ll try to get the real story of what happened.For a company at our stage of growth, I\u2019d also say it\u2019s really important to find people who are interested in building something great, rather than people who are interested in joining something great. So having people who care is a big thing.So how do you tell the drivers from the riders?In those transitions on their r\u00e9sum\u00e9, you can understand a lot of things. If they talk about problems at a previous company, then the question is, Were you part of the solution or are you just complaining about it?What career advice do you give to new college grads?I definitely suggest people work for early stage or midstage companies because you\u2019re going to learn a lot more. I try to steer them away from larger companies. The company is going through more change at smaller companies, and you tend to be in a deeper end of the pool where things are going to get done. So it\u2019s just more of an extension of college. There\u2019s accelerated learning in that period.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Expa Labs Will Nurture Tech Start-Ups a Few at a Time", "Date": "2016-03-30", "News": "Supported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Throw a rock in any direction in Silicon Valley and it may strike a start-up incubator, one of the now-ubiquitous programs aimed at helping entrepreneurs nurture their ideas into full-fledged businesses with funding and advice.Garrett Camp, a co-founder of Uber, and a few of his partners think that model may need tweaking.On Wednesday, Mr. Camp and his colleagues took the wraps off Expa, a start-up studio in San Francisco that claims to take a smaller-scale, more hands-on approach to helping new companies grow from idea to prototype to marketable product.\u201cDo you want a class size of 100, or a class size of eight?\u201d said Mr. Camp, Expa\u2019s chief executive and general partner. \u201cWhat we\u2019re offering is something for founders who want a bit more guidance than they may find somewhere else.\u201dExpa said the shift in the funding environment would actually help because the thinner the crowd of start-ups, the easier it was for the most successful ones to shine.\u201cIt\u2019s just easier in these times for us to see who\u2019s serious about building a company,\u201d said Hooman Radfar, an Expa partner and founder of AddThis, a marketing technology company that was acquired by Oracle in January.Expa\u2019s model is different. The firm focuses on a handful of start-ups at a time every six months. That way, one of Expa\u2019s five partners \u2014 Mr. Camp, Mr. Radfar, Naveen Selvadurai, Roberto Sanabria and Milun Tesovic \u2014 can devote personal attention and resources to the founders on a project, based on their particular area of expertise. Each partner claims \u201cownership\u201d of a particular start-up, something the firm claims can be difficult for investors who put money into dozens of companies and so have little time to spend with each.The Expa team also helps with practical services \u2014 like handling the paperwork of establishing a Delaware C-Corp company or dealing with payroll for a team of engineers \u2014 along with access to what it says is an extensive network of personal advisers.And because the Expa companies share office space, the start-ups can easily bounce ideas and experiments off one another, the Expa partners said.So far, Expa\u2019s model is mostly unproved. The Expa partners point to Uber as a model for how they would like to build other companies. Mr. Camp helped generate the idea for Uber and provided early funding for the ride-hailing service before handing the reins to Travis Kalanick, Uber\u2019s chief executive. (Uber was last valued at more than $62 billion.)Y Combinator, which last had 126 companies go through its program, said its members still got one-on-one attention from advising partners, and the start-ups continue to benefit from being a Y.C. graduate. Justin Kan, a partner and spokesman for Y Combinator, said several successful start-ups \u2014 including the T-shirt printing company Teespring, the on-demand delivery start-up Instacart and the crowdfunding start-up Tilt \u2014 had emerged since Y.C. began funding larger class sizes.Expa faces competition far beyond Y Combinator. Traditional incubators like TechStars and 500 Startups also abound, and large corporations like Samsung, Disney and Microsoft offer internal start-up acceleration programs.Expa said its focus on \u201cquality, not quantity\u201d would make a difference. \u201cWe are not playing the odds and investing in volume,\u201d the company said.Advertisement"}

It\u2019s going to be a disaster. It\u2019s going to be horrifying and terrible. I might die.\u201dThis was only mild hyperbole. During rehearsal, a heavy curtain rig had ripped out of the theater\u2019s ceiling and crashed to the floor.He wasn\u2019t always so vanguard. Mr. Schneider grew up in Milwaukee, the child of two school administrators, and earned a B.F.A. from Illinois Wesleyan University, specializing in musical theater. At 34, he still possesses an \u201caw, shucks\u201d quality to his demeanor, a shyness and eagerness that leaven his cool-kid cred.On a recent rainy morning at 3LD, he arrived 15 minutes late, a consequence of a flat bicycle tire. (Technical glitches, large and small, are a hallmark of his work. And his life.) He was dressed in a shredded scarf, bright blue pants, a black T-shirt, a light black jacket and black sneakers, which was perhaps too little considering the weather, but a lot more than Mr. Schneider wears in performance.No, he explained. He just never found the right shirt. \u201cA white T-shirt?\u201d he asked. \u201cA button-down? A tank top? It doesn\u2019t make sense to me.\u201d But there\u2019s a lot about \u201cYouarenowhere\u201d that doesn\u2019t make sense \u2014 its genesis, its unforeseen triumph and the piece itself, at least as it appears on the page. Even its title, which can be read as \u201cYou Are Nowhere\u201d or \u201cYou Are Now Here,\u201d is a conundrum.After college, Mr. Schneider spent a couple of unhappy years in New York, lining up for casting calls and booking roles in regional productions. His baritone typed him as a villain, and he played the dentist in \u201cLittle Shop of Horrors\u201d three separate times. It wasn\u2019t especially rewarding. On the advice of friends he had met while interning with the Wooster Group and the Builders Association, he enrolled in the N.Y.U. graduate program. \u201cMy parents were kind of devastated that I wasn\u2019t going to be doing musical theater anymore,\u201d he said.Elizabeth LeCompte, the Wooster Group\u2019s artistic director, said that she would have used Mr. Schneider and his devices earlier if he hadn\u2019t been so timid. \u201cHe was so shy about bringing them in that I thought he didn\u2019t want us to use them,\u201d she said. But she noted that during his tenure, \u201che began revealing himself very slowly and beautifully,\u201d until he became \u201ca center mover in the company.\u201d When she put him onstage, she discovered a focus and interiority that made you want to watch him. \u201cHe has some kind of a private aura that is very powerful,\u201d she said.After seeing a rough draft of the script and then a work-in-progress showing, Mr. Gantner urged him to reconsider the form and maybe some of the content, particularly a flabbergasting coup de th\u00e9\u00e2tre. \u201cWe just didn\u2019t think anybody could pull it off,\u201d Mr. Gantner said, speaking by telephone.Mr. Schneider had his own doubts, too. He wasn\u2019t sure he could ask audiences to watch a performance without a story. And he worried that the programming and equipment, which he\u2019d built himself, would break down in performance, which they did.But somehow the piece was a success. Mr. Gantner called it \u201ca jaw drop.\u201d The show managed to seem deliberate and accidental, controlled and entirely unpredictable.Mr. Schneider is developing a musical based on a Mac Wellman novel, in collaboration with Heather Christian and Ms. Chavkin, and a show that borrows from the light and space artists of the 1970s to explore hallucination.He continues to refine \u201cYouarenowhere.\u201d The glitches that plagued the early showings have mostly been remedied. Though these malfunctions were once a source of incredible worry, Mr. Schneider now finds that he misses them. He has built a few deliberate bugs into the show and has also created a safe word, \u201cspacebar,\u201d which he deploys when he wants to halt the preprogrammed material and go off script for a while, he said, \u201cso that everyone feels like anything could still happen.\u201dEven now, he finds himself amazed that the show happens at all \u2014 after all the doubts, after all the disasters, after all the years spent alone in his apartment messing with a lighting effect or a sound cue. \u201cI cry every night during the show,\u201d he said. \u201cI tear up at the end.

{"Headline": "Nefertiti 3-D Scanning Project in Germany Raises Doubts", "Date": "2016-03-10", "News": "Supported byThe project, called \u201cThe Other Nefertiti,\u201d attracted wide attention, with many praising the artists\u2019 message of openness, their guerrilla tactics and their clever use of scanning technology.But as the story spread, some 3-D scanning experts began asserting that the data the artists released was of too high a quality to have come from a Kinect, which was developed by Microsoft for the Xbox 360. They suggested that the artists had somehow acquired the museum\u2019s own scan of the bust, scanned a high-quality copy or produced the scan by some other means.Fred Kahl, a designer and 3-D scanning expert who developed a 3-D portrait studio for which he says he has made more than 10,000 scans using a Kinect, said, \u201cThe scan shows far more definition than is ever remotely possible\u201d with the device the artists say they used.\u201cYou look at the texture of the surface of the model they released and it has very fine, level detail of the cracks around the base and the texture on the headdress,\u201d Mr. Kahl said, adding that the scan Ms. Badri and Mr. Nelles released contained more than two million mesh units known as polygons, whereas he has \u201cnever captured a Kinect scan with more than 600,000.\u201dIn February, Ms. Badri and Mr. Nelles said in an interview that the data they had released was collected during their October museum visit and assembled by outside experts \u2014 hackers who declined to be identified. While the artists maintained on Thursday that the scanning of the bust had taken place as they initially described, they said they could not confirm that the data they released in December was the result of that scan, nor would they identify their anonymous partners or produce raw data proving that a scan indeed occurred.When asked whether they believed when they released the data that it had been derived from their own scan, Ms. Badri said cryptically that they \u201cdidn\u2019t really think that way,\u201d adding that this was \u201cfor legal reasons.\u201d She and Mr. Nelles also stressed that they \u201care not technicians\u201d and had been unfamiliar with how to use the scanner, which they said the hackers gave them. The artists denied any knowledge of the data having been acquired through theft or a leak within the museum.\u201cWe came to them and asked how to do it,\u201d Mr. Nelles said, referring to the hackers. \u201cThey came up with the setup, the device.\u201d The hackers, he added, provided them with a USB stick containing the Nefertiti scan, \u201cand I made it a torrent and then I put it online.\u201dMs. Badri said: \u201cWe didn\u2019t talk about the quality of the scan. In the conversation, they told us just not to ask questions.\u201d\u201cI believe the model that the artists released was in fact derived from the Neues Museum\u2019s own scan,\u201d Mr. Wenman wrote.Some experts have pointed out that the artists could have produced the data if they augmented the Kinect scan with high-quality still photographs using photogrammetry. But the artists said on Thursday that they had collected no data of the bust beyond the Kinect scan.\u201cMaybe it was a server hack, a copy scan, an inside job, the cleaner, a hoax, but who cares, first of all it is an art piece,\u201d they said in an email.The museum said on Thursday that it had not made a detailed comparison between the artists\u2019 data and its own scans of the bust.\u201cI hope the comparison will be made,\u201d said Birgit J\u00f6bstl, a spokeswoman for the Prussian Cultural Heritage Foundation, which oversees the national museum system in Germany. Based on new assessments by scanning experts, she said, \u201call you can do is ask, Has the data been stolen?\u201d But she expressed skepticism that the source of the data would be definitively determined and added that without speaking further with the museum\u2019s lawyers and 3-D experts, \u201cI can\u2019t tell you what the next steps would be.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Entire Yahoo Board Would Be Ousted if Starboard Value Gets Its Way", "Date": "2016-03-24", "News": "Supported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Tensions between Yahoo and its most outspoken shareholder, the activist hedge fund Starboard Value, were already running high when the two sides agreed early this year on a face-to-face meeting in Manhattan.But on the morning of that meeting on March 10, Yahoo surprised Starboard when it filled two vacancies on its board without consulting the hedge fund, in what many viewed as a poke in the eye.For Starboard, the meeting was yet another bad omen. And on Thursday the hedge fund made good on its months-old threat to try to unseat the ailing web pioneer\u2019s board.The slate \u2014 which includes a former executive at NBCUniversal and a former technology banker at Deutsche Bank as well as Starboard\u2019s chief executive, Jeffrey Smith \u2014 represents the strongest challenge to a board of a major American company in some time. Just 30 or so companies have experienced the ouster of their full boards as a result of activist campaigns, according to data from FactSet.\u201cAs you know from reading our prior letters, we have been attempting to work with Yahoo for the past 18 months,\u201d Mr. Smith wrote in a public letter to investors on Thursday. \u201cOver this time frame, we have repeatedly requested an opportunity to work with the company, including offers to join the board and work constructively with the current directors. At every step of the way, management and the board have pushed us away.\u201dYahoo said in a statement that it would review Starboard\u2019s slate of director candidates. The board election will take place at Yahoo\u2019s annual meeting, expected sometime in June or July.Robert Peck, an analyst with SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, said that shareholder dissatisfaction with Yahoo was broad, and that Starboard \u201chas a good chance of winning the proxy contest.\u201dShares of Yahoo closed up slightly on Thursday, at $34.86.It is unclear whether Starboard would ever have settled for less than majority control of Yahoo\u2019s board. But people with knowledge of the hedge fund\u2019s strategy, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said that the firm had lost faith in Yahoo\u2019s ability to find a turnaround strategy that would work and then doubted the company\u2019s sincerity in exploring a sale of its mainstay web operations.Eventually it came to the conclusion that wholesale change would be needed to ensure a sale.Yahoo has argued that it is serious about potentially selling itself, pointing to the hiring of three investment banks and reaching out to a constellation of potential bidders, ranging from telecommunications giants like Verizon to media companies to private equity financiers.Several potential bidders have had talks with Microsoft over whether it might back a bid for Yahoo, according to a person briefed on the matter. Such an investment would most likely be in the hundreds of millions of dollars.But in its letter, Starboard, which owns a 1.7 percent stake in Yahoo, contends that there are reasons for shareholders to be \u201chighly concerned\u201d about the sale process. Some potential buyers have questioned whether the company is serious.\u201cDespite what appears to be strong interest from large strategic and financial buyers, as referenced in the media, nearly two months have gone by since Yahoo officially publicly announced its intention to pursue strategic alternatives for the core business, and it seems little progress has been made,\u201d it said.The embattled technology company has struggled to find a successful new direction as it has been eclipsed by rivals of all stripes.Starboard has not always succeeded in its efforts to push for change at Yahoo. The hedge fund twice has called for the company to merge with its fellow first-generation web company AOL, but failed to persuade either company to pursue such a deal.Yahoo is no stranger to activist shareholders, who seek to change up a business\u2019s strategy, often by waging noisy public battles. Nearly four years ago, the hedge fund titan Daniel S. Loeb took aim at the company and helped orchestrate the ouster of its chief executive, eventually claiming three seats on the board and pushing for the hiring of Ms. Mayer, a former top Google executive.Yahoo executives have repeatedly expressed frustration over the pressure from the latest wave of activist investors attacking them. In an interview on the \u201cCharlie Rose\u201d program two weeks ago, Ms. Mayer argued that the company had served shareholders well by applying most of the proceeds of its previous sales of Alibaba stock toward buying back Yahoo shares.Yahoo has also noted that its initial plan to spin off its 15 percent stake in Alibaba, announced in January 2015, was adopted in response to pressure from shareholders, including Starboard.When the Internal Revenue Service declined last fall to affirm that the spinoff would be tax-free, many shareholders, including Starboard, urged the company to abandon the plan.In December, Yahoo did just that and said it would instead seek to spin off its core operating businesses to minimize the tax bill.But Yahoo has clearly been reluctant to pursue the top objective of Starboard and other activists: selling the company\u2019s core business of search, websites and mobile apps. That business has continued to decline over the nearly four years since Ms. Mayer took over as chief executive.Although the company formed a strategic review committee to consider possible offers a month ago, potential bidders have complained that the company has dragged its feet.\u201cThe company seemed to halfheartedly embrace the concept of pursuing strategic alternatives,\u201d said Scott Kessler, an analyst with Standard & Poor\u2019s Global Market Intelligence.Yahoo has always been reluctant to consider a sale of its core business, dating back to its wholesale rejection of Microsoft\u2019s $45 billion offer for the company in February 2008, he noted.Nick Wingfield contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "No Respite for Yahoo, Battling on 2 Fronts", "Date": "2016-03-21", "News": "Supported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 It\u2019s often hard to sell a company, particularly when that company has faced steady declines over the last decade, been surpassed by upstarts and is struggling in its latest turnaround plan.It\u2019s also hard to fight off an activist shareholder, especially a prominent hedge fund with a track record of ousting corporate boards.Yahoo has the misfortune of trying to do both at once.Four investment banks have already been brought in to help manage the two processes after Yahoo called off an effort to spin out its stake in the Alibaba Group, the Chinese e-commerce giant, concerned that the move might make it liable for some $10 billion in taxes.It\u2019s unclear whether the two sides will settle before then, perhaps with Yahoo adding new directors to placate the hedge fund. The election of directors will take place at Yahoo\u2019s annual meeting this spring.For the company, the prospect of waging a battle against Starboard while it is running its sales process \u2014 which could also lead to the sale of between $1 billion and $3 billion worth of assets, including patents, real estate and noncore businesses \u2014 could hurt its efforts.\u201cPeople believe that it would be detrimental to the work we\u2019re doing and it would not help our cause,\u201d Kenneth Goldman, Yahoo\u2019s chief financial officer, said in an interview.But people close to Starboard, who spoke about the hedge fund\u2019s deliberations on the condition of anonymity, said that the activist investor believed that without steady pressure, Yahoo might drag its feet in selling itself. Representatives for Starboard did not respond to a request for comment.Others have echoed that fear. In a research note last month, Robert S. Peck, an analyst with SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, wrote that some potential bidders had noticed what he described as a \u201clack of engagement and process,\u201d leading them to question whether Yahoo and its executives were serious in pursuing a potential sale.And some potential bidders have also wondered how seriously the company is pursuing a sale of itself, remembering the failed discussions between Yahoo and Microsoft nearly a decade ago.But Yahoo and its advisers argue that this time is different, and the company is serious. They point to the board\u2019s having formed a special committee of directors tasked specifically with exploring a potential sale, with three investment banks \u2014 Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase and PJT Partners \u2014 providing financial advice. (A fourth, Evercore Partners, is advising on defending against Starboard and other activist investors.)Potential bidders \u2014 a group that ranges from telecommunications giants like Verizon and AT&T to private equity firms like Silver Lake and TPG \u2014 are being contacted and have begun signing nondisclosure agreements, according to people with direct knowledge of the process, who spoke on the condition of anonymity.Yet Yahoo announced those new directors hours before it was scheduled to meet with Starboard, and did not consult with the hedge fund before picking those names.Such is the frenzy surrounding everything Yahoo these days that rumors have sometimes taken hold before being batted down. For instance, earlier this year news reports circulated that Frank Quattrone\u2019s firm, Qatalyst Partners, had also been retained to help advise the company.But Mr. Goldman told an industry conference this month that the only investment banks working for the company were those retained by the special board committee. He added in the interview that both he and Marissa Mayer, Yahoo\u2019s chief executive, were committed to the company. He dispelled rumors that he was considering leaving the company, saying that he will be on board at least through the strategic review process.Mr. Goldman also said that Ms. Mayer was not working with any outside party to make a buyout proposal of her own, despite rumors to the contrary.Mr. Goldman contended that many of the investors he had spoken with backed Yahoo\u2019s management and were wary of a proxy fight. \u201cThere are a lot of people who really believe in this company and want us to succeed,\u201d he said.As if selling Yahoo\u2019s main business were not difficult enough, there is another possible wrinkle: Yahoo\u2019s 35.5 percent stake in Yahoo Japan.Yahoo received about $228 million from Yahoo Japan last year. While that\u2019s a small portion of Yahoo\u2019s nearly $5 billion in global revenue, the Yahoo Japan revenue, a mix of search payments and licensing payments, is almost pure profit, making up nearly one-quarter of Yahoo\u2019s adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization.About half the revenue from Yahoo Japan is from a search agreement that is due to expire in August 2017. That agreement can also be terminated early if control of Yahoo changes, according to a person with knowledge of the agreement, who gave confidential details on the condition of anonymity.The other half of the income comes from a separate agreement in which Yahoo Japan licenses technology, Yahoo\u2019s name and other assets. Yahoo Japan pays about 3 percent of its revenue to Yahoo under that agreement. Yahoo Japan, which is controlled by its largest shareholder, SoftBank, has been unhappy with the arrangement and has sought to renegotiate the deal, without success.Any serious bidder would probably seek to discuss all the financial arrangements with SoftBank to ensure that the flow of Yahoo Japan cash continued in some form.Already, some potential suitors have begun contacting the Japanese company and its leader, Masayoshi Son, according to the person briefed on the agreement.An article on Tuesday about Yahoo\u2019s challenges as it explores selling itself while preparing to battle an activist investor misidentified, in some copies, the corporation that has sought to renegotiate Yahoo\u2019s relationship with Yahoo Japan. It is Yahoo Japan \u2014 not SoftBank, which is Yahoo Japan\u2019s largest shareholder.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Bounty Hunter Tracks Chinese Companies That Dupe Investors", "Date": "2016-03-15", "News": "Supported byRobert W. Seiden is a Wall Street bounty hunter. He tracks down executives of Chinese companies that listed on stock exchanges in the United States and then blew up.It is a painstaking business that few are willing to do.One of his current targets is the chairman at Sino Clean Energy, who has battled with investors in a Nevada state court since 2014. On Feb. 16, the trial judge found the executive, Ren Baowen, in criminal contempt and ordered his arrest for failing to comply with earlier court orders.In an attempt to increase the pressure on Mr. Ren, Mr. Seiden, the court-appointed receiver for Sino Clean, prepared a notice about the arrest warrant to be published through PR Newswire, which distributes corporate news releases.The release was published on Feb. 29 \u2014 but not in China, where Mr. Ren lives. PRNewswire, in an email to Mr. Seiden, said it had refused to publish the notice there citing \u201cheightened political sensitivity concerning Chinese investment interests.\u201dIt was not the first time Mr. Seiden\u2019s tactics have been thwarted. It is the reason many remain skeptical of his efforts. Nevertheless, he has embraced the challenge and become the go-to person for American investors who are suing Chinese companies saying that they were swindled.\u201cUnless the Chinese government is coming to arrest me, I\u2019m going to do whatever is legally permissible by court order,\u201d Mr. Seiden said in a recent interview.Mr. Seiden, 52, a former Manhattan prosecutor, has been appointed by judges as the receiver to oversee the management of nine Chinese companies \u2014 many incorporated in Nevada \u2014 that once traded shares in the United States.But his actual dollar recoveries for investors have been small \u2014 just $8 million out of the nearly $90 million he has sought to recoup.A Sherlock Holmes enthusiast (a bust of the fictional detective sits on his desk in Manhattan), Mr. Seiden has built a reputation for being tenacious. And for good reason: Getting Chinese executives to pay up involves extensive meetings, negotiations and cooperation from Chinese authorities and bankers.He is not just focused on China. He employs former agents from intelligence agencies around the world, including the Mossad in Israel and the K.G.B. in Russia, to help him conduct cloak-and-dagger investigations in places like Russia, Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan.He opened his company, Confidential Global Investigation, in 2008. Early on, he did work for hedge funds and their investors. But one of his first jobs in China was for Richemont, the company that owns luxury brands like Cartier, Piaget and Jaeger-LeCoultre. Mr. Seiden tracked down a ring of counterfeiters operating from Latvia and Scotland and manufacturing fake watches in China.In 2013, Mr. Seiden received a call from a lawyer representing a large investor in ZST Digital Networks, a Chinese equipment maker. A Delaware judge appointed Mr. Seiden as the company\u2019s receiver to enforce the terms of a $32 million judgment on behalf of the investor. Mr. Seiden is still trying to get that money back, but the assignment started him on a new career path.More work started to flow from investor lawsuits over reverse mergers. In those deals, Chinese companies looking to trade in the United States bypassed the traditional method of an initial public offering and instead merged with largely defunct companies that already had shares listed on an exchange in the United States.Starting in the mid-2000s, these companies drew a wave of interest from investors who thought they could get rich from China\u2019s surging economic growth. But years later, they had little but burned fingers to show for their investments.Many of the Chinese companies were soon engulfed in accounting irregularities or allegations of outright fraud. Others simply stopped submitting quarterly financial statements in the United States, leaving investors in the dark about what was happening with their operations in China.Critics say regulators have been slow to act.\u201cThe U.S. regulators have been unwilling to go to the mat on this,\u201d said Paul Gillis, an accounting professor at Guanghua School of Management, Peking University in Beijing.At the same time, there has been little political will to do anything about in China. \u201cThe responsibility for this stuff is spread out too widely, there are so many different Chinese bureaucracies involved,\u201d Professor Gillis said.But recently, Mr. Seiden has enlisted some officials in China. With the help of China\u2019s Ministry of Finance and Commerce and the State Administration of Foreign Exchange, Mr. Seiden collected $4 million from a settlement with Shengtai Pharmaceutical in 2015.Mr. Seiden said that he expected to collect an additional $28 million within months as a result of current negotiations, including talks with Mr. Ren\u2019s legal team.In the case of Sino Clean Energy, a clean coal manufacturing company, Mr. Seiden contends in court filings that Mr. Ren \u201cstole millions of dollars\u201d from investors in the United States by \u201cgoing dark.\u201dThe company, based in Xi\u2019an, China, has not filed updated financial statements with the Securities and Exchange Commission since early 2012, according to the investor lawsuit.Sino Clean Energy listed its shares on the Nasdaq stock market after a reverse merger in 2006 with a largely defunct company called Endo Networks. It then raised more than $26 million in the United States.Matthew C. Zirzow, the Las Vegas bankruptcy lawyer for Sino Clean, did not return a telephone call seeking comment. Another lawyer for Mr. Ren could not reached for comment.Investors in companies that Mr. Seiden is pursuing to recover money acknowledge that the efforts are long shots.John J. Kassay Jr. of Parksville, N.Y., said he lost about $20,000 on his investment in Sino Clean and joined the lawsuit in Nevada against Mr. Ren and the company to \u201ctake them to task.\u201dWhatever money he gets back from the litigation will be worth it, he said.Michael Sammons, a San Antonio investor who lost money in two Chinese companies, Weikang Bio-Technology Group and RINO International, said he could not find anyone other than Mr. Seiden to take on these cases.Mr. Seiden\u2019s firm has grown from a handful of employees, including Steven, his brother, to 20 employees. Chinese reverse merger cases account for about 80 percent of the firm\u2019s work.\u201cWe are creating a pathway to get money back,\u201d he said.A recent crackdown on financial firms because of turmoil in the Chinese stock market has heightened concerns about how China treats foreign business interests when they conflict with its own.A spokeswoman for PRNewswire said it did not publish the release in China because of new Chinese government restrictions on what foreign companies may publish online.Yet while China can appear to be uncooperative with demands from outside investors, that attitude is changing as some Chinese leaders want to show that it can be a reliable business partner, Mr. Seiden argued.Still, when he is in China \u2014 where he spends up to one month a year \u2014 he uses disposable phones and changes his hotel room after he checks in to make it more difficult for people to track his whereabouts, he said.The investors he represents say they sense that change could be underway. At the very least, they figure his help cannot hurt.\u201cIt\u2019s a big battle, and it\u2019s a big unknown because it has not been done before,\u201d said Alain Peracca, a former Microsoft executive and an investor in Sino Clean Energy. \u201cIt is the only hope that shareholders have.\u201dAdvertisement"}

The prospect fills some of our planet\u2019s brainiest specimens with dread.While not discounting that doomsayers may prove someday to be right, Retro Report offers more reassuring views from computer specialists who sense that the end is not nigh \u2014 if only, they say, because machines are not nearly as clever, or necessarily as pernicious, as the fretters believe.Arguably, there is no reason to lose sleep over those souped-up gadgets.

Possibilities for them to do good \u2014 figuring out how to regenerate human cells, for instance, or creating immunities against disease, or gobbling up carbon dioxide in the atmosphere \u2014 tend to get short shrift.Economic issues are unavoidable as well.

Banavar, the director of cognitive computing research at IBM, told Retro Report, \u201cand things that are easy for computers are hard for humans.\u201d Yes, a computer can multiply two numbers of 1,000 digits each in a matter of seconds.

{"Headline": "Apple Gets Tech Industry Backing in iPhone Dispute, Despite Misgivings", "Date": "2016-03-02", "News": "Supported byYet behind the scenes, it took time for some of the tech companies to make the decision to support Apple. Several feared the showdown with the government was too risky and could have far-reaching implications for the tech industry if Apple lost.Those misgivings ultimately did not win the day. About 40 companies and organizations are expected to file court briefs on Thursday backing Apple as it fights a judge\u2019s order to help law enforcement break into an iPhone used by a gunman in the San Bernardino, Calif., terrorist attack last year.Dropbox, Facebook, Google, Microsoft, Snapchat and Yahoo are among the tech companies expected to sign on to briefs in the case, according to people with knowledge of the plans who spoke on the condition of anonymity. More than 40 individuals, including prominent security experts and academics, are also planning to sign briefs, which will focus on themes like free speech, the importance of encryption and concerns about government overreach.The show of support \u2014 including briefs filed on Wednesday by groups like the American Civil Liberties Union and Access Now \u2014 is unusual in its breadth, showing that many in Silicon Valley believe that it could have profound implications on the trustworthiness of their products.Still, several executives at tech companies supporting Apple said they were worried that Apple had picked a fight that could end up backfiring on the rest of the industry. In the days since a magistrate judge in California ordered Apple to bypass security measures on the iPhone, lawyers in some of the companies debated these issues with one another and peers at other firms.All of the executives asked to remain anonymous because their deliberations were private, but their views are shared among others in Silicon Valley.Keith Rabois, a venture capitalist with the firm Khosla Ventures, said he was a strong believer in privacy and encryption \u2014 \u201call the normal Silicon Valley views,\u201d he said \u2014 but worried that Apple could lose the case, setting a legal precedent that could force other companies to compromise the security of their products for law enforcement.\u201cIn my view, this is the wrong case to fight,\u201d Mr. Rabois said. \u201cThere are plenty of other cases with a lot less sympathetic case for the government.\u201dApple\u2019s defenders said the company did not pick this fight \u2014 the government did. Critics of Apple\u2019s approach believe that the company could have quietly complied with the government\u2019s request to help break into the iPhone and then taken a public stand in a more favorable case. But Apple has said that once a tool exists for extracting data from the phone, that tool cannot be made to disappear.Yet whatever doubts Apple\u2019s allies voiced privately, they were in the end insufficient to keep a large number of big companies from signing on to the cause.Dropbox\u2019s general counsel, Ramsey Homsany, said in a statement, \u201cWe stand against the use of broad authorities to undermine the security of a company\u2019s products.\u201dBruce Sewell, Apple\u2019s general counsel, said in a statement, \u201cWe are humbled by the outpouring of support we\u2019ve received from our customers, our colleagues in business, nonprofit organizations, the security community and many others.\u201d He added, \u201cThe groups filing briefs with the court understand, as more and more people have come to realize, that this case is not about one phone \u2014 it is about the future and how we protect our safety and our privacy.\u201dOn Tuesday, Apple filed its formal objection to the government order to open up the iPhone, citing the reasons set forth in a previously filed motion.For many tech companies that were initially concerned by Apple\u2019s opposition to opening up the iPhone in the San Bernardino case, the worries centered not only on whether this was the right case for challenging the government but also on how public perceptions of the fight might reflect on the rest of the industry, according to tech executives involved in the discussions, who spoke on the condition of anonymity.Some of the companies were also concerned that the relationships they had forged with the government might degrade because of Apple\u2019s battle, according to the people involved in the tech industry discussions. In the years since the disclosures by Edward J. Snowden, the former intelligence contractor who released a trove of details on United States government surveillance tactics, some tech companies have been trying to educate members of Congress about online privacy practices.Others were also anxious that Apple\u2019s defiance of the government could lead to congressional efforts to reshape, in ways unfavorable to the tech industry, the Electronic Communications Privacy Act, which privacy advocates and tech companies have long claimed needs an overhaul.And these companies are watching what effect the fight could have on a proposal to establish a national commission that would explore ways to obtain encrypted data from consumers while working to safeguard users\u2019 privacy. The proposed commission, the bill for which was introduced on Monday, would be led by the House Homeland Security Committee chairman Michael McCaul, Republican of Texas, and Senator Mark Warner, Democrat of Virginia.Nick Wingfield reported from Seattle and Mike Isaac from New York.

Then the program offered the answer a human might have given instantly: \u201cYes.\u201dMr. Socher, who clenched his fist to celebrate his small victory, is the founder of one of a torrent of Silicon Valley start-ups intent on pushing variations of a new generation of pattern recognition software, which, when combined with increasingly vast sets of data, is revitalizing the field of artificial intelligence.MetaMind is now focusing on one of the most daunting challenges facing A.I. software. Computers are already on their way to identifying objects in digital images or converting sounds uttered by human voices into natural language. But the field of artificial intelligence has largely stumbled in giving computers the ability to reason in ways that mimic human thought.Now a variety of machine intelligence software approaches known as \u201cdeep learning\u201d or \u201cdeep neural nets\u201d are taking baby steps toward solving problems like a human.The new research is intriguing because it indicates that steady progress is being made toward \u201cconversational\u201d agents that can interact with humans. The MetaMind results also underscore how far researchers have to go to match human capabilities.Other groups have previously made progress on discrete problems, but generalized systems that approach human levels of understanding and reasoning have not been developed.Five years ago, IBM\u2019s Watson system demonstrated that it was possible to outperform humans on \u201cJeopardy!\u201dLast year, Microsoft developed a \u201cchatbot\u201d program known as Xiaoice (pronounced Shao-ice) that is designed to engage humans in extended conversation on a diverse set of general topics.To add to Xiaoice\u2019s ability to offer realistic replies, the company developed a huge library of human question-and-answer interactions mined from social media sites in China. This made it possible for the program to respond convincingly to typed questions or statements from users.In 2014, computer scientists at Google, Stanford and other research groups made significant advances in what is described as \u201cscene understanding,\u201d the ability to understand and describe a scene or picture in natural language, by combining the output of different types of deep neural net programs.These programs were trained on images that humans had previously described. The approach made it possible for the software to examine a new image and describe it with a natural-language sentence.While even machine vision is not yet a solved problem, steady, if incremental, progress continues to be made by start-ups like Mr. Socher\u2019s; giant technology companies such as Facebook, Microsoft and Google; and dozens of research groups.In their recent paper, the MetaMind researchers argue that the company\u2019s approach, known as a dynamic memory network, holds out the possibility of simultaneously processing inputs including sound, sight and text.The design of MetaMind software is evidence that neural network software technologies are becoming more sophisticated, in this case by adding the ability both to remember a sequence of statements and to focus on portions of an image. For example, a question like \u201cWhat is the pattern on the cat\u2019s fur on its tail?\u201d might yield the answer \u201cstripes\u201d and show that the program had focused only on the cat\u2019s tail to arrive at its answer.\u201cAnother step toward really understanding images is, are you actually able to answer questions that have a right or wrong answer?\u201d Mr. Socher said.MetaMind is using the technology for commercial applications like automated customer support, he said. For example, insurance companies have asked if the MetaMind technology could respond to an email with an attached photo \u2014 perhaps of damage to a car or other property \u2014 he said.There is still significant debate within the research community about the best technical approach and even what is the best way to measure progress.In contrast, his laboratory is focusing on creating software that can answer questions taken from standardized elementary school science tests.Advertisement"}

After some hesitation, many of the technology industry\u2019s biggest names, including Amazon, Facebook, Google, Microsoft, Snapchat and Yahoo, have filed court briefs supporting Apple and challenging the legal foundations of the government\u2019s case.The high commissioner, who usually avoids taking positions aligned with commercial interests, said he felt strongly that American officials needed to weigh the uncertain benefits of gaining access to one phone against the broader effects of breaching personal security.\u201cIn essence, what we have here is an issue of proportionality: In order to possibly \u2014 but by no means certainly \u2014 gain extra information about the dreadful crime committed by Syed Rizwan Farook and his wife in San Bernardino, we may end up enabling a multitude of other crimes all across the world, including in the United States,\u201d he said.The F.B.I. deserves full support in its investigation into the San Bernardino killings, Mr. al-Hussein said, but \u201cthis case is not about a company and its supporters \u2014 seeking to protect criminals and terrorists \u2014 it is about where a key red line necessary to safeguard all of us from criminals and repression should be set.\u201dThe encryption debate was \u201ctoo focused on one side of the security coin, in particular its potential use for criminal purposes in times of terrorism,\u201d Mr. al-Hussein said. \u201cThe other side of the security coin is that weakening encryption protections may bring even bigger dangers to national and international security.\u201dThe high commissioner\u2019s intervention builds on growing awareness and concern among human rights experts about the crucial role of encryption for safeguarding freedom of speech and of opinion.\u201cEncryption and anonymity, separately or together, create a zone of privacy to protect opinion and belief,\u201d David Kaye, a United Nations expert on freedom of expression, said in a report to the United Nations Human Rights Council last year, addressing ways to shield individuals from scrutiny in hostile political, social, religious and legal environments.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Steven Ballmer, Clippers\u2019 Top Fan, Is Really Invested in Them (for Billions)", "Date": "2016-03-04", "News": "Supported bySports BusinessLOS ANGELES \u2014 During the first timeout, a few minutes into Wednesday\u2019s game between the Los Angeles Clippers and the Oklahoma City Thunder at Staples Center here, Steven A. Ballmer looked up from his courtside seat at the fans still filtering in. \u201cThere are still some empty seats,\u201d he said.\u201cI like the noise,\u201d he said. \u201cI want the excitement. I want the fans to be into the game, to be part of it.\u201dIn Donald Sterling, the Clippers had an owner who didn\u2019t disguise the fact that he was more interested in profits than in wins. He made money by running the team on the cheap, refusing to re-sign young stars as they became eligible for free agency, for instance. In the last few years of his tenure, however, he had signed forward Blake Griffin and point guard Chris Paul to maximum contracts, and the team had become both exciting and good, if not yet great.More important for the long term, Ballmer has changed the team\u2019s culture, re-energizing the front office, focusing on making Clippers games more fun for fans \u2014 and creating an atmosphere that gives players and fans alike hope that a championship will one day soon be within their grasp.Said Coach Doc Rivers: \u201cHe\u2019s brought credibility to this franchise.\u201dAt courtside a few hours before the Clippers-Thunder game, Ballmer explained that he had always been passionate about basketball and had long wanted to buy a basketball team. What held him back, he said, was his \u201cday job.\u201dIn 2008, when Howard Schultz, the Starbucks chief executive and an owner of the Seattle SuperSonics, decided to sell the team, Ballmer joined a group of Seattle businesspeople who tried to buy it. That effort failed, and the Sonics were sold instead to a consortium of Oklahoma City businessmen, who promptly moved it to their hometown.Five years later, when the Maloof family put the Sacramento Kings on the block, Ballmer wanted to buy the team and move it to Seattle. But David Stern, the N.B.A. commissioner, and Adam Silver, his deputy, told him they wanted an owner who would keep the Kings in Sacramento.When I asked Ballmer if he had overpaid for the team, he shrugged. \u201cThings are worth what other people are willing to pay for them,\u201d he replied. \u201cIf I could get the deal done at $2 billion, who cares if I overpaid by 5 percent?\u201dRivers, whom Sterling had hired the previous summer, had held the team together during the imbroglio, emerging as the hero of the affair. In the vacuum created by the furor over Sterling\u2019s remarks, he had also assumed control of the team\u2019s basketball operations.Ballmer decided to keep Rivers in that role, naming him president of basketball operations as well as coach \u2014 an unusual, though not unprecedented, move. (Think Pat Riley.) Ballmer felt that Rivers had already begun to change the culture of the Clippers and was signing role players who would improve the team.Rivers also knew how to manage the salary cap, something Ballmer needed to learn. Rivers said that because of the salary cap limits, which Rivers said frustrate Ballmer, \u201cwe sign a lot of minimum salaries, and that brings big risks.\u201d \u201cSometimes they work out and sometimes they don\u2019t,\u201d he said. \u201cSteve understands that and is willing to take those gambles.\u201dAs you\u2019d expect of a former Microsoft executive, Ballmer is deeply involved in the Clippers\u2019 digital efforts. (Silver, who put Ballmer on the N.B.A.\u2019s audit committee, told me he often weighs in on the league\u2019s digital business as well.) He hired a director of analytics, hardly a novel move, but a position that Sterling had done without, presumably to save money. And he has dived into things like seat pricing issues. (\u201cSeat pricing is a complex math problem,\u201d Ballmer said. \u201cI like complex math problems.\u201d)Of course, the most important thing Ballmer could do to generate enthusiastic fans is put a team on the floor with championship potential. Clippers fans take heart in the fact that the team has played well in their three meetings against the Warriors \u2014 but they\u2019ve lost all three games. Hemmed in by salary cap limitations, there is not much more Ballmer can do right now. But next year, the salary cap will rise by an estimated $20 million. If Ballmer can sign a big-time free agent, and with Kobe Bryant retiring from the Lakers, perhaps it won\u2019t be too long before the Clippers are finally able to ascend to the next level \u2014 at which point Ballmer will no longer have to worry about fans arriving late.Going into Wednesday\u2019s game, the Clippers\u2019 record was 39-20, and they were jockeying for playoff position with Oklahoma City, which was 42-18. Needless to say, Ballmer was pumped.The Clippers came out fast, but soon fell behind as Kevin Durant began hitting jumpers and the Thunder kept getting second and third chances. \u201cLet\u2019s go defense!\u201d Ballmer yelled from his seat behind the basket. He stomped his feet angrily after a bad call against Paul.You could see what the Clippers needed: better defense down low, more aggressive rebounders, and maybe another shooter. By halftime, the Clippers were down by 20 points. Ballmer was discouraged, but like any real fan, he hadn\u2019t lost hope.The Clippers continued to play poorly into the fourth quarter. But with 7:30 left, down by 16 points, the Clips suddenly came to life \u2014 and so did Ballmer. As the Clippers clawed their way back, and Durant lost his touch, Ballmer roared, pumping his fists, and high-fived the friends sitting with him.When the Clippers took the lead with less than two minutes left, Ballmer lost it completely. Screaming at the top of his lungs, he began joyously slapping the arms and shoulders of his friends. The Jumbotron camera, the one that usually cuts to fans during timeouts, focused on him, so the fans could see the owner cheering his lungs out. When the Clippers emerged with a come-from-behind 103-98 victory, Ballmer raced over to Rivers and they slapped hands. The last I saw him, he was racing out to the locker room.For that moment, at least, the Clippers\u2019 biggest fan was the happiest man on earth.Because of an editing error, an earlier version of a picture credit with this article misidentified the photographer. The photograph of Steven A. Ballmer at a Los Angeles Clippers game in October was taken by Jae C. Hong, not Mark J. Terrill.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "American Tech Giants Face Fight in Europe Over Encrypted Data", "Date": "2016-03-27", "News": "Supported byROME \u2014 Silicon Valley\u2019s battle over encryption is heading to Europe.This week, French lawmakers are expected to debate proposals to toughen laws, giving intelligence services greater power to get access to personal data.The battle has pitted Europe\u2019s fears about the potential for further attacks against concerns from Apple and other American technology giants like Google and Facebook that weakening encryption technologies may create so-called back doors to people\u2019s digital information that could be misused by European law enforcement officials, or even intelligence agencies of unfriendly countries.The recent attacks have pushed many Europeans to favor greater powers for law enforcement over privacy. But opponents say such measures should not undermine the region\u2019s tough data protection rules that enshrine privacy on par with other rights like freedom of expression.This balance between national security and privacy has put major countries in the region on opposite sides of the debate, with Germany and the Netherlands dismissing encryption laws being considered by Britain and France.\u201cFundamental rights are just that, fundamental,\u201d said Nico van Eijk, a data protection expert at the University of Amsterdam. \u201cOf course, there are exceptions for national security reasons. But governments have to be pragmatic.\u201dThat pragmatism has led to a series of new proposals across Europe that, if approved, would give national intelligence agencies renewed powers to compel the likes of Apple, Google and Facebook to hand over encrypted information.And on Tuesday, French politicians will debate proposals to update antiterrorism laws that may hand tech executives prison sentences of up to five years, as well as fine their companies around $390,000, if they refuse to provide encrypted information to the country\u2019s investigators.Amendments to the French law \u2014 itself a response to the attacks in November \u2014 may still pass without the encryption proposals, which are opposed by France\u2019s left-wing government.But politicians and industry executives say Apple\u2019s fight with the F.B.I. has focused a spotlight on how companies\u2019 efforts to protect users\u2019 messages and other data have made it increasingly difficult for European intelligence agencies to obtain such information.\u201cWhen we\u2019re able to recover a cellphone, but authorities have no way of accessing its data, it obviously cripples the work of our surveillance agencies,\u201d said Philippe Goujon, a French politician behind the recent encryption proposals.\u201cSure, this could have repercussions internationally,\u201d he added. \u201cBut there are other countries in the world that have similar legislation.\u201dAll the talk about data privacy can get caught up in political wrangling. But the different approaches have practical consequences for people, too.Europe\u2019s attempts to get access to encrypted data have not gone unchallenged by Apple.Timothy D. Cook, Apple\u2019s chief executive, has, for instance, met with a string of European politicians, including France\u2019s prime minister, Manuel Valls, and Britain\u2019s home secretary, Theresa May, in recent months to lobby for tough encryption technology.And to show that the company is trying to be cooperative, Apple\u2019s executives have also provided unencrypted information, including so-called metadata on people\u2019s phone calls and GPS coordinates, as part of terrorism investigations in Europe, according to a person with knowledge of the matter, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak publicly.Such efforts, in part, have paid off with some European governments that remain skeptical of plans to weaken companies\u2019 encryption technology in the name of national security.Such loopholes, the Dutch government said, would \u201calso make encrypted files vulnerable to criminals, terrorists and foreign intelligence services.\u201dAs pressure in parts of Europe mounts over access to encrypted data, industry watchers say attention is expected to focus on Britain \u2014 a top international market for most American tech companies \u2014 where expanded powers for the country\u2019s intelligence services are likely to come into force by the end of the year. The legislation is the brainchild of the ruling Conservative Party, which has a sufficient parliamentary majority to enact the regulatory changes.Under the proposals, the Investigatory Powers Bill would force Internet and telecommunications companies to hold records of websites visited by people in Britain over the last 12 months. It also would provide the country\u2019s intelligence agencies with a legal mandate for the bulk collection of large quantities of data, while allowing them to hack individual devices under certain situations.Ms. May, Britain\u2019s home secretary, told lawmakers this year that such powers were required to defend the country\u2019s security. She added that the legislation offered sufficient transparency and oversight about how British spies conducted their activities to calm people\u2019s privacy concerns.But for Apple and other Silicon Valley companies, the proposal also includes new powers that can permit the British government to demand that companies remove encryption protections where \u201creasonably practicable\u201d to gain access to digital communications.The British government stresses that such rules would not undermine companies\u2019 services because they may not apply to so-called end-to-end encryption, technology used by the likes of Apple\u2019s iMessage and FaceTime services, as well as Facebook\u2019s WhatsApp Internet messenger.Such concerns, security experts say, could be compounded if other national governments \u2014 either in Europe or farther afield \u2014 followed Britain\u2019s lead by passing similar legislation.Hannah Olivennes contributed reporting from London.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Apple Policy on Bugs May Explain Why Hackers Would Help F.B.I.", "Date": "2016-03-22", "News": "Supported byFor all the steps Apple has taken to encrypt customers\u2019 communications and its rhetoric around customer privacy, security experts said the company was still doing less than many competitors to seal up its systems from hackers. And when hackers do find flaws in Apple\u2019s code, they have little incentive to turn them over to the company for fixing.Apple, which has had relatively strong security over the years, has been open about how security is a never-ending cat-and-mouse game and how it is unwilling to engage in a financial arms race to pay for code exploits.The company has yet to give hackers anything more than a gold star. When hackers do turn over serious flaws in its products, they may see their name listed on the company\u2019s website \u2014 but that is it. That is a far cry from what hackers can expect if they sell an Apple flaw on the thriving underground market where a growing number of companies and government agencies are willing to pay hackers handsomely.But security experts, especially those with a stake in such bug programs, said Apple could now be doing more, especially in this day and age where the conventions of finding bugs and fixing them have changed.Just this week, researchers at Johns Hopkins University uncovered a flaw that would allow attackers to decrypt the contents of photos and videos attached in Apple\u2019s iMessage program. The researchers turned that flaw over to Apple for patching.\u201cEspecially with the stakes being as high as they are, if Apple wants to continue to compete in the modern world, they have to modernize their approach,\u201d said Katie Moussouris, a chief policy officer at HackerOne, which companies like Yahoo, Dropbox and now Uber pay to manage their bug bounty programs.The identity of the third party that approached the F.B.I. with the possible way to unlock the iPhone \u2014 which was used by one of the attackers in a mass shooting in San Bernardino, Calif., last year \u2014 remained unknown on Tuesday. The emergence of the third party halted, at least temporarily, a contentious case between Apple and the United States government over whether the company should weaken the security of its iPhone to help law enforcement.The Justice Department has declined to name the third-party person or organization, or to describe the proposed method for breaking into the device. The third party may not have approached Apple for many reasons.In the past, Microsoft\u2019s systems were a more frequent target for malicious-minded hackers, largely because of the prevalence of its products. But as Microsoft began to embrace the hacking community, its security improved.The technology company has been locked in a major legal battle against law enforcement officials over privacy and security.As Apple\u2019s desktops and mobile phones have gained more market share, and as customers began to entrust more and more of their personal data to their iPhones, Apple products have become far more valuable marks for criminals and spies.An Apple spokeswoman referred to an editorial by Craig Federighi, the company\u2019s senior vice president for software engineering, in which he wrote, \u201cSecurity is an endless race \u2014 one that you can lead but never decisively win.\u201d\u201cOur team must work tirelessly to stay one step ahead of criminal attackers who seek to pry into personal information,\u201d Mr. Federighi said. \u201cDespite our best efforts, nothing is 100 percent secure.\u201dApple has long been less visible in the security community compared with other tech companies. The company has shied away from bug bounty programs and instead relied on large testing programs and the work of its security team to spot vulnerabilities, partly because it is disinclined to keep up with a financial arms race of paying for bugs, according to three former and current employees, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly about security matters.Apple has said it will fight to know more about the flaw in the software or hardware that the third party has presented to law enforcement. A senior executive said in a conference call with reporters Tuesday that if the government found the method did not work and tried to force Apple to help break into the phone, Apple would have questions about what was tried, in order to keep its products as secure as possible.If the third-party method does work, the government may dismiss a court order demanding that Apple weaken its security, but keep the process it used to break into the phone under seal. In that case, Apple would have no way of knowing how the government broke into its software or hardware.Exploits in Apple\u2019s code have become increasingly coveted over time, especially as its mobile devices have become ubiquitous, with an underground ecosystem of brokers and contractors willing to pay top dollar for them.Flaws in Apple\u2019s mobile devices can typically fetch $1 million. Last September, a boutique firm in Washington, called Zerodium, which sells flaws to governments and corporations, announced a $1 million bounty for anyone who would turn over an exploit in Apple\u2019s iOS 9 mobile operating system \u2014 the same operating system used to power the iPhone used by the San Bernardino shooter. By November, Zerodium said a team of undisclosed hackers had successfully claimed the bounty.Chaouki Bekrar, the founder of Zerodium, said his company was not the outside party referred to in the government\u2019s court filing on Monday. But Mr. Bekrar added that even if Zerodium had helped the F.B.I., he would not disclose it.\u201cFor every Zerodium, there are a thousand other organizations like Zerodium that are far less vocal about doing what they do and will pay researchers who find this stuff to keep it a secret,\u201d said Casey Ellis, the founder of BugCrowd, a company in San Franciso that helps vendors manage bug bounty programs.Some security researchers said no bounty Apple could offer now would match the reward they could expect from the underground market. Apple has waited so long that the black market for its flaws has become extremely lucrative, perhaps making any bug bounty program the company would create seem late to the game.\u201cApple can embrace security researchers, or try to facilitate programs that will secure its operating system, but it\u2019s never going to be able to compete with what is going on behind the scenes in the black market,\u201d said Jay Kaplan, a former N.S.A. analyst and co-founder of Synack, a company that deploys hackers to weed out vulnerabilities in clients\u2019 systems. \u201cIt\u2019s just not going to happen.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Race Is On to Control Artificial Intelligence, and Tech\u2019s Future", "Date": "2016-03-25", "News": "Supported byMany of the tech industry\u2019s biggest companies, like Amazon, Google, IBM and Microsoft, are jockeying to become the go-to company for A.I. In the industry\u2019s lingo, the companies are engaged in a \u201cplatform war.\u201dA platform, in technology, is essentially a piece of software that other companies build on and that consumers cannot do without. Become the platform and huge profits will follow. Microsoft dominated personal computers because its Windows software became the center of the consumer software world. Google has come to dominate the Internet through its ubiquitous search bar.If true believers in A.I. are correct that this long-promised technology is ready for the mainstream, the company that controls A.I. could steer the tech industry for years to come.\u201cWhoever wins this race will dominate the next stage of the information age,\u201d said Pedro Domingos, a machine learning specialist and the author of \u201cThe Master Algorithm,\u201d a 2015 book that contends that A.I. and big-data technology will remake the world.In this fight \u2014 no doubt in its early stages \u2014 the big tech companies are engaged in tit-for-tat publicity stunts, circling the same start-ups that could provide the technology pieces they are missing and, perhaps most important, trying to hire the same brains.At the University of Toronto, IBM pursued a start-up called Ross Intelligence that makes a smart legal assistant, and extended a free offer to use its A.I. software, called Watson. For IBM, the financial payoff would come if start-ups like Ross generated sales, followed by a revenue-sharing arrangement. \u201cNo upfront costs at all,\u201d said Andrew Arruda, chief executive of the start-up, which moved last year to Silicon Valley.Now, Google\u2019s A.I. program is drawing additional attention and pointing to a consolidation among tech\u2019s biggest companies.By 2020, the market for machine learning applications will reach $40 billion, IDC, a market research firm, estimates. And 60 percent of those applications, the firm predicts, will run on the platform software of four companies \u2014 Amazon, Google, IBM and Microsoft.IBM is making the broadest entry into A.I. Its Watson unit, set up as a separate division in early 2014, is both a software and a services business, with technology tailored to specific industries. More than 80,000 developers have downloaded and tried out the software, and the Watson division has 500 industry partners, including big companies and start-ups.\u201cIt\u2019s early days, but the long-term goal is to have hundreds of millions of people use Watson as self-service A.I.,\u201d said David Kenny, general manager of the Watson division.In 2015, Amazon and Microsoft both added machine learning capabilities to their cloud software platforms, Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Azure. The companies are using machine learning software to help customers spot patterns and make predictions in vast amounts of data.Microsoft offers 18 machine learning services, including face recognition, text analysis and product recommendations. More A.I. capabilities, analysts say, should be announced at the end of the month, when Microsoft hosts a large conference for software developers in San Francisco.This week at a conference in San Francisco, Google showed off a new speech-to-text transcription service. The company also said its recently introduced vision software for identifying images would be broadly available soon, and it introduced new tools and training aids to help developers build machine-learning applications more easily.Intelligent software applications will become commonplace, said Jeff Dean, a computer scientist who oversees Google\u2019s A.I. development. \u201cAnd machine learning will touch every industry.\u201dAt Facebook, the A.I. vision is, at least for now, limited to its products.Mike Schroepfer, the chief technology officer, noted that Facebook\u2019s image-recognition software was now used to select what pictures or videos to show in a user\u2019s news feed, based on a person\u2019s friend network and interests.\u201cBefore, the photo was a black box to us,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s the most likely form this takes \u2014 a lot of things that add up to make the service steadily better on Facebook.\u201dIf products come first, a platform strategy typically takes shape later for the big consumer web companies. There are millions of Facebook app developers worldwide. Today, only about 1 percent of all software apps have A.I. features, IDC estimates. By 2018, IDC predicts, at least 50 percent of developers will include A.I. features in what they create.\u201cIt\u2019s where the market is headed,\u201d said David Schubmehl, an IDC analyst.The company, which was founded by Mike Tung, a Stanford computer science graduate student, in 2008, recently raised $10 million to compete directly with Google. Even though Diffbot is still being run out of a home near the Stanford campus, Mr. Tung is thinking big.\u201cOur goal is to capture all human knowledge,\u201d he said. \u201cI would like for Diffbot to build an iconic company around data. There are companies focusing on computing, but there is no Amazon of data.\u201dJohn Markoff reported from San Francisco and Steve Lohr from New York.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "ValueAct Pays a Price for Its Supporting Role at Valeant", "Date": "2016-03-28", "News": "Supported byDealBookBill Ackman gets a lot of ink and a lot of criticism as one of the largest investors behind the crisis-ridden Valeant Pharmaceuticals.But another activist investment firm with a much larger role in Valeant\u2019s activities has largely gone unquestioned: ValueAct, a San Francisco based investor that also has a large stake and board seat on Microsoft.ValueAct, founded by Jeffrey Ubben, deserves credit \u2014 and perhaps a large dose of disapproval \u2014 for virtually everything that\u2019s happened to the company over nearly the last decade, both good and bad.ValueAct has been a longtime investor in Valeant, dating to 2006. The company has held at least one seat on the company\u2019s board since 2007, and more recently held two seats. It helped install Valeant\u2019s now-dethroned chief executive, J. Michael Pearson. It oversaw the design of the company\u2019s compensation policies that some critics now suggest created incentives to use aggressive accounting practices. It also backed Valeant\u2019s controversial strategy to cut research and development and to significantly increase the price of its drugs.But that was then.Today, Valeant\u2019s shares are down about 88 percent from their high of last summer in the face of questions about the company\u2019s accounting, the ouster of Mr. Pearson and a scuffle inside the boardroom that led to a director being asked to resign, a request the director refused. Oh, and the company is being investigated by Congress and the Securities and Exchange Commission.ValueAct, amazingly, is still in the black, having bought much of its stake in Valeant at an average share price of $11.Last June, ValueAct sold about $1 billion worth of Valeant shares only months before the company\u2019s troubles surfaced. Under securities laws, insiders are held to a very strict policy about when they can sell since they are privy to the company\u2019s internal records and plans. No one has accused ValueAct of selling its shares with knowledge of the company\u2019s impending downfall, and there is no reason to believe that was the case.But ValueAct, given its presence on the board and long relationship with Valeant, had to be aware of the company\u2019s use of a mail-order pharmacy, Philidor, as a way around the efforts of pharmacies and insurance companies to sell lower-priced generic drugs instead of Valeant\u2019s high-priced brand-name drugs. That practice has come under scrutiny and led, in large part, to Valeant\u2019s current crisis.Valeant declined to make Mr. Ubben available to comment. In fairness to him, he is at a disadvantage as far as defending himself publicly because most company lawyers prevent insiders from speaking out.It was Mr. Morfit, among others on the board, who helped put in place a compensation plan for Mr. Pearson and other managers that some governance experts say may have led to Valeant\u2019s aggressive approach, both with its use of Philidor and with its accounting practices, which have now come under scrutiny.Mr. Pearson\u2019s compensation plan, once heralded as a model for paying for performance, was tied directly to the success of the company\u2019s stock price. Mr. Pearson needed to reach certain thresholds of performance to be paid or he would get nothing beyond his salary. And last year, Mr. Pearson\u2019s salary was slashed to zero to make him even more dependent on the performance model, so he was completely focused on his incentive bonus.The stock needed to go up at least 15 percent annually over at least three years for his bonus shares to vest. If the stock went up 45 percent, Mr. Pearson would be paid three times as much. By last summer, Mr. Pearson was worth about $3 billion on paper.That might have sounded good in theory. Who doesn\u2019t want their executives\u2019 pay directly tied to the company\u2019s performance? Unlike those in so many companies, Valeant\u2019s compensation structure meant that Mr. Pearson would do well only if the shareholders did too. None of the \u201cheads you win, tails you win too\u2019\u2019 chicanery that has led to such skepticism about compensation at public companies.But it meant that Mr. Pearson and his team needed the stock to keep going up. And that may have led to a culture that was too aggressive.All along, ValueAct was there. The firm\u2019s managers may not have been operating the company day to day, nor making some of the decisions that led to the current crisis of confidence. But it happened on their watch, under a chief executive they championed. At a minimum, ValueAct tacitly endorsed Valeant\u2019s strategy. And now, ValueAct is stuck holding the shares, unable to sell them given its insider status and all the continuing investigations.While ValueAct\u2019s investors may still look at Valeant as a profitable trade, they might want to give the company the kind of scrutiny ValueAct failed to give Valeant.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Google Showcases Its Cloud Efforts, Determined to Catch Up to Rivals", "Date": "2016-03-23", "News": "Supported byIn the cloud computing business, Google\u2019s technology prowess is rarely questioned. Its commitment, however, has been doubted.Google, which trails Amazon and Microsoft in the fast-growing market, hopes to change the industry perception that it is halfhearted about its cloud computing service with product announcements, technology demonstrations and strategy briefings at a two-day conference in San Francisco that began on Wednesday.The company is showcasing its cloud software for machine learning, a branch of artificial intelligence. It has a new speech service: Feed in audio, and the software issues a transcript. Its recently introduced vision service for identifying images also will be more broadly available soon, Google said. And new tools and training aids are available to help developers build machine-learning applications more easily.These are the first significant steps since Diane B. Greene, a respected Silicon Valley technologist, became senior vice president in charge of Google\u2019s cloud business in November. Ms. Greene is a co-founder and former chief executive of VMware, whose software is widely used in corporate data centers. She knows the enterprise computing business, which has not been Google\u2019s strength.The new cloud offerings after Ms. Greene\u2019s appointment signal the company\u2019s intent, analysts say. \u201cGoogle finally wants to compete in the cloud for enterprise business,\u201d said Mike Gualtieri, an analyst at Forrester Research.Having technology is only one ingredient in the corporate marketplace, analysts note. Marketing, training and customer service are also important to win businesses.\u201cWe\u2019ve got to get really good at communications and training,\u201d Ms. Greene said in an interview.In the corporate cloud business, Google must address a wide range of customers and requirements, she said. For many, a purely online relationship will be fine, she said, while others want hands-on assistance.For labor-intensive projects, Google will work through partners, she said. The company has no intention of building its own consulting arm. \u201cThat\u2019s not what Google does,\u201d said Ms. Greene, who, since 2012, has been a board member of Google and then its parent company, Alphabet, which was established last year.But Google plans to step up training and certification programs, again working through industry partners to expand that effort. \u201cWe\u2019ll train the trainers,\u201d she explained.Traditionally, technology companies have hired armies of sales representatives who have sold corporations expensive software that resided in their data centers. That business still exists, but it is eroding rapidly as cloud software, with its pay-for-use model, becomes mainstream.Cloud software, Ms. Greene said, is redefining the relationship corporate customers have with technology companies. \u201cNobody has figured it out yet,\u201d she said. \u201cBut it has to span the spectrum from self-service to high touch.\u201dThe essence of Google\u2019s appeal to customers and industry partners, is that \u201cyou sign up for keeping pace with Google\u2019s technology development,\u201d Ms. Greene said.Wix, an online service for building websites, has been using Google\u2019s vision service recently. It lets users search the many thousands of images Wix has in its database. Creating an online jewelry commerce site? Search the Wix digital library of unlabeled, stock photos for \u201cpearls\u201d and \u201cdiamond rings,\u201d and Google software finds those images.\u201cIt\u2019s pretty amazing,\u201d said David Zuckerman, head of the developer experience at Wix. \u201cThe neat thing is that the users never know they are using artificial intelligence.\u201dWix runs its sizable business on the cloud, and it uses the cloud services of Google, Amazon and Microsoft. Mr. Zuckerman welcomes vigorous competition among the three, which should insure lower prices and better deal terms.Recognizing it is the underdog, Google is starting to try harder with better support and terms, Mr. Zuckerman said. \u201cI feel a closer relationship with Google, probably because it is not the king in this space,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "U.S. Restricts Sales to ZTE, Saying It Breached Sanctions", "Date": "2016-03-07", "News": "Supported byHONG KONG \u2014 ZTE is one of China\u2019s few truly international electronics firms. Yet American companies will now need special permission to sell to it.The export controls against ZTE are unusual because such actions are rarely taken against such large companies. The action underscores how important the push is by the United States to gain China\u2019s cooperation in embargoes intended to combat nuclear proliferation.The export controls are also risky because they could easily prompt a backlash from Beijing. Technology has become a sticking point in Chinese-American relations. Washington has accused Chinese government-sponsored hackers of stealing American trade secrets.Recent scrutiny in the United States has also scuttled some Chinese investments in American tech companies. ZTE\u2019s much larger domestic competitor, Huawei, is effectively banned from selling its telecom network equipment in the United States.Chinese state news media has complained bitterly about revelations from the former National Security Agency contractor Edward J. Snowden about American spying and has called for a domestic purge of United States technology.Although analysts said that the export controls against ZTE were most likely aimed at nuclear proliferation rather than being a new jab in heightened technology trade tensions, China\u2019s interpretation of the action was an open question.\u201cDepending on how both sides read it, this could be a specific case, or it could get overheated and extended,\u201d said Scott Kennedy, a scholar at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a nonprofit research group.Trading of ZTE\u2019s shares was suspended Monday before the announcement. News of the export controls was first reported by Reuters.ZTE\u2019s status within China is likely to make the export controls big news there. Though not well known in the United States, ZTE is an international champion of the Chinese high-tech industry, with a market capitalization of around $10 billion. After China\u2019s first lady, Peng Liyuan, aroused online criticism by using an Apple iPhone during a 2013 trip to Mexico, she switched to a ZTE phone for a public trip in 2014.In the other document, ZTE mapped out the way it could circumvent American export controls in a complex flow chart, including using a \u201cshell\u201d company structure.Daniel H.

{"Headline": "Microsoft Trumpets Windows 10, and Pushes Into Sci-Fi Tech", "Date": "2016-03-30", "News": "Supported bySEATTLE \u2014 Microsoft continues to bank on its Windows operating system. But the software giant is also increasingly staking out new technology areas, including software that can have natural conversations with people.Those were the twin messages from the company at an event in San Francisco on Wednesday for developers. At the event, Microsoft said Windows 10, the latest version of its operating system, is now running on 270 million active devices, eight months after it was released to the public. That represented the fastest adoption ever for a new version of Windows, outpacing the rate at which Windows 7 was adopted by 145 percent, the company said.Microsoft also revealed new tools for developers to create \u201cbots,\u201d pieces of software that can be used to produce new methods of interacting with computers, such as a chat interface for ordering pizzas online.\u201cWe want to build intelligence that augments human abilities and experiences,\u201d Satya Nadella, Microsoft\u2019s chief executive, said at the event.\u201cWe\u2019re back to the drawing board,\u201d he said.In another area of new technology, Microsoft said it had begun shipping a version of HoloLens, the company\u2019s augmented reality headset that overlays digital images on the wearer\u2019s view of the real world. The $3,000 product is aimed at developers making applications for HoloLens. Microsoft has not said when it will begin selling a version of the product for the public or how much it will cost.The company also emphasized its progress with Windows 10, in a reminder that \u2014 for all of the talk of Microsoft\u2019s fading stature in the technology industry \u2014 Windows is still the software that most of the world uses to run its PCs.Microsoft previously said it intended to get Windows 10 running on one billion devices two to three years after the product shipped last July. In a recent interview, Terry Myerson, the executive vice president of the Windows and devices group at Microsoft, said he was confident the company could still reach that objective.\u201cThe goal was always ambitious, but enterprises are deploying faster than ever before,\u201d Mr. Myerson said.Jan Dawson, an analyst at Jackdaw Research, said developers had little incentive to create software for Windows first when they can reach bigger audiences elsewhere.Windows 10 is supposed to give developers an extra incentive to create apps for Microsoft products by making it easy for them to produce software that can run on any Windows 10 device, including PCs, smartphones and the Xbox One console. Microsoft praises new \u201cuniversal apps\u201d of this nature from the likes of Twitter, Uber, King, Disney, the Wargaming Group, Square Enix and Yahoo.It isn\u2019t clear that the apps being made for Windows 10 will be sufficient to get people to buy phones running the software.\u201cWe obviously have work to do in mobile,\u201d Mr. Myerson said.To keep interest in Windows 10, Microsoft said Wednesday that it would refresh the software with an update that would connect users with Cortana, the virtual assistant in the operating system, without requiring a PC to be unlocked first. People could then use their PCs like Amazon\u2019s Echo device, which can be summoned to answer questions about the weather and trivia from across the room.The Windows 10 update will also enhance a feature called Windows Hello that lets people more securely log into Windows using biometric verification, like facial recognition. The change will allow people to sign into websites and apps with Windows Hello so they don\u2019t have to use passwords.David Smith, an analyst at Gartner, said Windows 10 should be considered a success, especially compared with its predecessor, Windows 8, which many people disliked for too aggressively pushing a striking redesign of the software\u2019s interface. (Microsoft skipped over the Windows 9 name.)Still, he doubts that enough people will see a need to buy PCs to return the market to growth. \u201cI don\u2019t see it creating this massive upgrade cycle,\u201d Mr. Smith said.Advertisement"}

For years, the president nurtured close ties to Silicon Valley, tapping the youthful talent there to help him reshape the federal government\u2019s aging technology infrastructure and seeking out leading executives for private advice and millions in campaign cash.\u00a0That partnership was in part a result of a philosophical affinity between Mr. Obama and technology executives that included broad agreement about gay rights, immigration, civil liberties and health care. Mr. Obama has repeatedly said he remains a fierce defender of civil liberties, including the right to privacy.Within the administration, there is a division over encryption between the F.B.I., along with other law enforcement agencies, which says it must have a way of breaking into encrypted devices, and the intelligence community, which worries that the same techniques could be used against the American government. In his comments, which were greeted with polite silence, Mr. Obama said he, too, supported the development of strong encryption to make sure that the government can protect banks and critical infrastructure. And he said he wanted proper oversight of law enforcement. But, he said, technology executives who are \u201cabsolutist\u201d on the issue are just wrong.\u201cThis notion that somehow our data is different and can be walled off from those other trade-offs we make, I believe, is incorrect,\u201d he said.Mr. Obama spoke broadly at the music, film and technology festival about the need for technology to be used to support civic life and the functioning of democracy.He became the first sitting president to visit the festival, which in the past three decades has become a mecca for the high-tech, social-media set. He made his comments during an hourlong conversation with Evan Smith, the editor in chief of The Texas Tribune.At the festival, the president sought to make the case that the technologies behind today\u2019s entertainment and communication apps should also be directed at solving the problems of voter turnout, access to information and civic engagement. \u201cWe want to create a pipeline where there is a continuous flow of talent that is helping to shape the government,\u201d he told the audience. Mr. Obama is something of a technology geek, so his presence at the festival does not come as much of a surprise. He enjoys dinners with technology moguls and has tapped the wealth of Silicon Valley for his two presidential campaigns.He has talked to his closest advisers about creating a high-tech presidential center when he leaves office, in part to help visitors engage with his legacy and in part to encourage better use of technology in society.Still, questions about how to harness the power of Twitter, Facebook and Snapchat to help government are not always clear, especially when the companies involved are, above all, designed to make money for their shareholders.This spring, the White House will host what it is calling a summit meeting on civic engagement, and aides said the president would use it to continue the conversation about the role that technology could play.Advertisement"}
