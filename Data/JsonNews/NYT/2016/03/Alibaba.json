{"Headline": "Entire Yahoo Board Would Be Ousted if Starboard Value Gets Its Way", "Date": "2016-03-24", "News": "Supported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Tensions between Yahoo and its most outspoken shareholder, the activist hedge fund Starboard Value, were already running high when the two sides agreed early this year on a face-to-face meeting in Manhattan.But on the morning of that meeting on March 10, Yahoo surprised Starboard when it filled two vacancies on its board without consulting the hedge fund, in what many viewed as a poke in the eye.For Starboard, the meeting was yet another bad omen. And on Thursday the hedge fund made good on its months-old threat to try to unseat the ailing web pioneer\u2019s board.The slate \u2014 which includes a former executive at NBCUniversal and a former technology banker at Deutsche Bank as well as Starboard\u2019s chief executive, Jeffrey Smith \u2014 represents the strongest challenge to a board of a major American company in some time. Just 30 or so companies have experienced the ouster of their full boards as a result of activist campaigns, according to data from FactSet.\u201cAs you know from reading our prior letters, we have been attempting to work with Yahoo for the past 18 months,\u201d Mr. Smith wrote in a public letter to investors on Thursday. \u201cOver this time frame, we have repeatedly requested an opportunity to work with the company, including offers to join the board and work constructively with the current directors. At every step of the way, management and the board have pushed us away.\u201dYahoo said in a statement that it would review Starboard\u2019s slate of director candidates. The board election will take place at Yahoo\u2019s annual meeting, expected sometime in June or July.Robert Peck, an analyst with SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, said that shareholder dissatisfaction with Yahoo was broad, and that Starboard \u201chas a good chance of winning the proxy contest.\u201dShares of Yahoo closed up slightly on Thursday, at $34.86.It is unclear whether Starboard would ever have settled for less than majority control of Yahoo\u2019s board. But people with knowledge of the hedge fund\u2019s strategy, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said that the firm had lost faith in Yahoo\u2019s ability to find a turnaround strategy that would work and then doubted the company\u2019s sincerity in exploring a sale of its mainstay web operations.Eventually it came to the conclusion that wholesale change would be needed to ensure a sale.Yahoo has argued that it is serious about potentially selling itself, pointing to the hiring of three investment banks and reaching out to a constellation of potential bidders, ranging from telecommunications giants like Verizon to media companies to private equity financiers.Several potential bidders have had talks with Microsoft over whether it might back a bid for Yahoo, according to a person briefed on the matter. Such an investment would most likely be in the hundreds of millions of dollars.But in its letter, Starboard, which owns a 1.7 percent stake in Yahoo, contends that there are reasons for shareholders to be \u201chighly concerned\u201d about the sale process. Some potential buyers have questioned whether the company is serious.\u201cDespite what appears to be strong interest from large strategic and financial buyers, as referenced in the media, nearly two months have gone by since Yahoo officially publicly announced its intention to pursue strategic alternatives for the core business, and it seems little progress has been made,\u201d it said.The embattled technology company has struggled to find a successful new direction as it has been eclipsed by rivals of all stripes.Starboard has not always succeeded in its efforts to push for change at Yahoo. The hedge fund twice has called for the company to merge with its fellow first-generation web company AOL, but failed to persuade either company to pursue such a deal.Yahoo is no stranger to activist shareholders, who seek to change up a business\u2019s strategy, often by waging noisy public battles. Nearly four years ago, the hedge fund titan Daniel S. Loeb took aim at the company and helped orchestrate the ouster of its chief executive, eventually claiming three seats on the board and pushing for the hiring of Ms. Mayer, a former top Google executive.Yahoo executives have repeatedly expressed frustration over the pressure from the latest wave of activist investors attacking them. In an interview on the \u201cCharlie Rose\u201d program two weeks ago, Ms. Mayer argued that the company had served shareholders well by applying most of the proceeds of its previous sales of Alibaba stock toward buying back Yahoo shares.Yahoo has also noted that its initial plan to spin off its 15 percent stake in Alibaba, announced in January 2015, was adopted in response to pressure from shareholders, including Starboard.When the Internal Revenue Service declined last fall to affirm that the spinoff would be tax-free, many shareholders, including Starboard, urged the company to abandon the plan.In December, Yahoo did just that and said it would instead seek to spin off its core operating businesses to minimize the tax bill.But Yahoo has clearly been reluctant to pursue the top objective of Starboard and other activists: selling the company\u2019s core business of search, websites and mobile apps. That business has continued to decline over the nearly four years since Ms. Mayer took over as chief executive.Although the company formed a strategic review committee to consider possible offers a month ago, potential bidders have complained that the company has dragged its feet.\u201cThe company seemed to halfheartedly embrace the concept of pursuing strategic alternatives,\u201d said Scott Kessler, an analyst with Standard & Poor\u2019s Global Market Intelligence.Yahoo has always been reluctant to consider a sale of its core business, dating back to its wholesale rejection of Microsoft\u2019s $45 billion offer for the company in February 2008, he noted.Nick Wingfield contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "No Respite for Yahoo, Battling on 2 Fronts", "Date": "2016-03-21", "News": "Supported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 It\u2019s often hard to sell a company, particularly when that company has faced steady declines over the last decade, been surpassed by upstarts and is struggling in its latest turnaround plan.It\u2019s also hard to fight off an activist shareholder, especially a prominent hedge fund with a track record of ousting corporate boards.Yahoo has the misfortune of trying to do both at once.Four investment banks have already been brought in to help manage the two processes after Yahoo called off an effort to spin out its stake in the Alibaba Group, the Chinese e-commerce giant, concerned that the move might make it liable for some $10 billion in taxes.It\u2019s unclear whether the two sides will settle before then, perhaps with Yahoo adding new directors to placate the hedge fund. The election of directors will take place at Yahoo\u2019s annual meeting this spring.For the company, the prospect of waging a battle against Starboard while it is running its sales process \u2014 which could also lead to the sale of between $1 billion and $3 billion worth of assets, including patents, real estate and noncore businesses \u2014 could hurt its efforts.\u201cPeople believe that it would be detrimental to the work we\u2019re doing and it would not help our cause,\u201d Kenneth Goldman, Yahoo\u2019s chief financial officer, said in an interview.But people close to Starboard, who spoke about the hedge fund\u2019s deliberations on the condition of anonymity, said that the activist investor believed that without steady pressure, Yahoo might drag its feet in selling itself. Representatives for Starboard did not respond to a request for comment.Others have echoed that fear. In a research note last month, Robert S. Peck, an analyst with SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, wrote that some potential bidders had noticed what he described as a \u201clack of engagement and process,\u201d leading them to question whether Yahoo and its executives were serious in pursuing a potential sale.And some potential bidders have also wondered how seriously the company is pursuing a sale of itself, remembering the failed discussions between Yahoo and Microsoft nearly a decade ago.But Yahoo and its advisers argue that this time is different, and the company is serious. They point to the board\u2019s having formed a special committee of directors tasked specifically with exploring a potential sale, with three investment banks \u2014 Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase and PJT Partners \u2014 providing financial advice. (A fourth, Evercore Partners, is advising on defending against Starboard and other activist investors.)Potential bidders \u2014 a group that ranges from telecommunications giants like Verizon and AT&T to private equity firms like Silver Lake and TPG \u2014 are being contacted and have begun signing nondisclosure agreements, according to people with direct knowledge of the process, who spoke on the condition of anonymity.Yet Yahoo announced those new directors hours before it was scheduled to meet with Starboard, and did not consult with the hedge fund before picking those names.Such is the frenzy surrounding everything Yahoo these days that rumors have sometimes taken hold before being batted down. For instance, earlier this year news reports circulated that Frank Quattrone\u2019s firm, Qatalyst Partners, had also been retained to help advise the company.But Mr. Goldman told an industry conference this month that the only investment banks working for the company were those retained by the special board committee. He added in the interview that both he and Marissa Mayer, Yahoo\u2019s chief executive, were committed to the company. He dispelled rumors that he was considering leaving the company, saying that he will be on board at least through the strategic review process.Mr. Goldman also said that Ms. Mayer was not working with any outside party to make a buyout proposal of her own, despite rumors to the contrary.Mr. Goldman contended that many of the investors he had spoken with backed Yahoo\u2019s management and were wary of a proxy fight. \u201cThere are a lot of people who really believe in this company and want us to succeed,\u201d he said.As if selling Yahoo\u2019s main business were not difficult enough, there is another possible wrinkle: Yahoo\u2019s 35.5 percent stake in Yahoo Japan.Yahoo received about $228 million from Yahoo Japan last year. While that\u2019s a small portion of Yahoo\u2019s nearly $5 billion in global revenue, the Yahoo Japan revenue, a mix of search payments and licensing payments, is almost pure profit, making up nearly one-quarter of Yahoo\u2019s adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization.About half the revenue from Yahoo Japan is from a search agreement that is due to expire in August 2017. That agreement can also be terminated early if control of Yahoo changes, according to a person with knowledge of the agreement, who gave confidential details on the condition of anonymity.The other half of the income comes from a separate agreement in which Yahoo Japan licenses technology, Yahoo\u2019s name and other assets. Yahoo Japan pays about 3 percent of its revenue to Yahoo under that agreement. Yahoo Japan, which is controlled by its largest shareholder, SoftBank, has been unhappy with the arrangement and has sought to renegotiate the deal, without success.Any serious bidder would probably seek to discuss all the financial arrangements with SoftBank to ensure that the flow of Yahoo Japan cash continued in some form.Already, some potential suitors have begun contacting the Japanese company and its leader, Masayoshi Son, according to the person briefed on the agreement.An article on Tuesday about Yahoo\u2019s challenges as it explores selling itself while preparing to battle an activist investor misidentified, in some copies, the corporation that has sought to renegotiate Yahoo\u2019s relationship with Yahoo Japan. It is Yahoo Japan \u2014 not SoftBank, which is Yahoo Japan\u2019s largest shareholder.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Yahoo Investor\u2019s Bold Push to Replace Its Board", "Date": "2016-03-24", "News": "Supported byBreakingviewsStarboard Value is going nuclear.Starboard, an activist hedge fund, wants to replace all of Yahoo\u2019s directors with its handpicked slate. The fund, which is run by Jeffrey Smith, is correct that the Internet company\u2019s performance has been dismal under its chief executive, Marissa Mayer. But failure to secure control of the board could hobble Starboard\u2019s attempt to force Yahoo to focus on selling its core Internet and advertising business.Mr. Smith\u2019s firm deserves credit for backing its bark with bite. The investor holds almost 2 percent of Yahoo and has been highly critical of company blunders like its $1 billion acquisition of Tumblr in 2013, which amounted to little more than a huge write-down.It doesn\u2019t help that Yahoo\u2019s market share in its main business, advertising, keeps slipping. Yahoo\u2019s total digital ad revenue is forecast to drop nearly 14 percent, to $2.8 billion this year, according to the research firm eMarketer. Its share of search and display is set to drop below 2 percent worldwide.Ms. Mayer has thrown together a spaghetti bowl of options and strategies to try to fix the company. These include a possible sale of its Internet and ad business, selling its assets in Yahoo Japan, and a road map that seems to be going nowhere to fix the struggling company.Granted, she was handed a difficult task that none of her predecessors were able to manage. And shareholders haven\u2019t exactly suffered since Ms. Mayer took the helm in 2012: The total return on the stock is nearly 120 percent, according to Thomson Reuters data. That\u2019s because of the rise in Yahoo\u2019s Alibaba stake, which now accounts for most of Yahoo\u2019s market value.Starboard may be so emboldened to replace the Yahoo board because it succeeded with a similar strike against Darden Restaurants. But that was a much smaller company and the activist had a bigger stake.Ms. Mayer is a beneficiary of an earlier activist attack on Yahoo. The proxy fight that Daniel Loeb\u2019s Third Point hedge fund began in 2012 ended up installing her as boss \u2014 after the fund targeted just four board seats. Starboard may discover that a more focused aim works better.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Beijing Seeks to Tighten Reins on Websites in China", "Date": "2016-03-29", "News": "Supported byHONG KONG \u2014 China\u2019s government said on Monday that it would take steps to more strictly manage websites in the country, its latest push to set boundaries in the wider Internet.A draft law posted by one of China\u2019s technology regulators said that websites in the country would have to register domain names with local service providers and with the authorities.It was not clear whether the rule would apply to all websites or only to those hosted on servers in China. Chinese laws can be haphazardly enforced and are usually vague, and because the new rule is only a draft, analysts said they expected the regulator, the Chinese Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, to specify later to whom the law would apply.If the rule applies to all websites, it will have major implications and will effectively cut China out of the global Internet. By creating a domestic registry for websites, the rule would create a system of censorship in which only websites that have specifically registered with the Chinese government would be reachable from within the country.Zhu Wei, deputy director of the Communications Law Research Center at the China University of Political Science and Law in Beijing, said he believed that under the current wording, the law would block foreign websites not registered with China.\u201cI think the draft mostly tries to address Internet security and the large amount of pornographic websites and other websites that violate Chinese laws,\u201d he said. \u201cMost of those domains are registered abroad. It is not easy to tackle them.\u201dOther experts, however, said the law would probably apply only to websites hosted in China.\u201cI think these regulations are about content hosted in China,\u201d said Rogier Creemers, a lecturer on Chinese politics at Oxford University. \u201cIt can be that they expand in the future.\u201d He pointed out that if the rules applied to all websites, they would eliminate access overnight to a huge chunk of the Internet.The new rule would also enable the Chinese government to keep closer tabs on the real identities of website operators. It would also help Beijing assemble a registry of important websites if China wants to break away from the global registry that unifies the Internet, Mr. Creemers said.The Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, which said violators of the rule would face fines of 10,000 renminbi to 30,000 renminbi, or about $1,500 to $4,500, will hear comments on the regulation until April 25.In recent years, Mr. Xi has presided over a special committee to strengthen the government\u2019s oversight of the Internet domestically, and more broadly to influence how the Internet is governed abroad.He has also presided over the creation of the Cyberspace Administration of China, a regulatory body that has pushed censorship and worked on an annual conference intended to trumpet China\u2019s belief that each country should be allowed to impose rules on the Internet within its borders.Lokman Tsui, a professor at the School of Journalism and Communication at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, said the latest move was \u201cin line with the developments that have been going on for a while now, where the government is trying to exercise more supervision and control over the Internet, and on the domain name system in China.\u201dCao Li contributed reporting from Beijing.Advertisement"}

According to Chinese law, the police can generally detain a person for 30 days before officers must ask prosecutors to bring formal arrest charges or release the person. Prosecutors then have seven days to announce a charge.Mr. Tashi\u2019s family has tried contacting the Yushu police and the town\u2019s main detention center, where relatives say they believe he is, but officers have not given them a reason for the detention and have not let them see Mr. Tashi.Reached by telephone, a senior police officer in Yushu, Chief Zhang, who gave only his surname, said that his unit, the guobao, was handling the case. Asked for more details, he said he needed to verify whether the case his unit was handling was indeed the same one.Until his detention, Mr. Tashi was posting about Tibet to his Sina Weibo account. Many messages expressed anxieties about the gradual extinction of Tibetan culture. On Jan. 20, for example, Mr. Tashi reshared an item in which an online commentator had asked Khampa Television, the local official Tibetan Khampa-dialect channel, to stop broadcasting, saying \u201cthe Tibetan culture you talk about is for commercial and exhibition use.\u201dMr. Tashi\u2019s last item, on Jan. 24, was a repost of a comment that urged the legislature and legislative advisory committee of Qinghai Province, where Yushu is, to enhance bilingual education and hire more bilingual civil servants.In an interview last year, Mr. Tashi said that he was not advocating Tibetan independence and that he was mainly concerned about cultural preservation. He traveled to Beijing that year to seek legal help in filing a lawsuit against local officials, but he has yet to make the filing.He said he sought to use the law to press officials to have true bilingual education in schools. In most schools in Tibetan regions, the native language is taught in a single class, similar to foreign-language education in the United States. Mandarin is the main teaching language.\u201cMy goal is to change things a little bit, to push to preserve some of our nation\u2019s culture,\u201d he said. \u201cThe entire Tibetan ethnic nationality and culture is at risk of disappearing.\u201dMr. Tashi also said that he was thankful to \u201call the Chinese people who truly protect minorities\u201d and praised President Xi Jinping for having \u201cpromoted a democratic and law-abiding country these last few years.\u201dMr. Tashi was detained briefly twice before, he and his family members said.

{"Headline": "Yahoo Labors to Carry On With Core Business While Exploring Sale", "Date": "2016-03-10", "News": "Supported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Yahoo has a dual personality these days.One is Yahoo the battered Internet giant that is up for sale, with dozens of potential bidders looking to pick up all or parts of the company on the cheap.The other is Yahoo the independent company that is carrying out yet another strategic turnaround plan as if the auction process does not exist.Both Yahoos made an appearance on Thursday and showed just how hard it is for the two to coexist.They will fill seats that were most recently held by Max Levchin, the tech entrepreneur, and Charles R. Schwab, the founder of the brokerage firm that bears his name. Both men had stepped down from the board in recent months.The decision to bring Ms. Friedman and Mr. Brandt on board comes a little more than two weeks before the March 26 deadline for shareholders to nominate their own director candidates.Choosing directors without consulting the activist hedge fund Starboard Value most likely signals Yahoo\u2019s decision to hold firm against the investor. Starboard has been searingly critical of the management and strategy of Yahoo\u2019s chief executive, Marissa Mayer, and it has threatened to propose a rival slate of directors to shareholders if the board does not follow its recommendations.They note there\u2019s no guarantee that any deal will occur. And even if a transaction to sell all or most of the company\u2019s operations is reached, it could be many months before it is consummated as Yahoo and its lawyers tease apart a complex corporate structure that includes its web portal and mobile apps, its Tumblr unit, its Gemini advertising platform and its multibillion-dollar stakes in Alibaba Group and Yahoo Japan.\u201cWe\u2019re continuing to operate the business and execute on the plan that has been laid out publicly,\u201d said Ian Weingarten, Yahoo\u2019s senior vice president for corporate development and partnerships, in an interview. \u201cWith sports being an anchor property for us, we are continuing to look to enhance that content.\u201dIn addition to the N.H.L. games, Yahoo will continue streaming one Major League Baseball game a day when the current season begins and is also streaming Professional Golf Association tournaments, Mr. Weingarten said. For both baseball and hockey, the company will also offer \u201ccondensed games,\u201d recapping the highlights of each match in 10 to 18 minutes of video.Yahoo may also bid this month for streaming rights to the National Football League\u2019s Thursday games. (Mr. Weingarten declined to comment on that prospect.)All of this new content is expensive, and it will be supported primarily by digital advertising, an area where Yahoo has been losing ground to competitors.And none of the effort might matter much in the end, if the company ends up sold or carved into pieces.Under pressure from Starboard and other investors, Yahoo abandoned a plan to spin out its stake in Alibaba, the Chinese e-commerce giant, because of questions about whether that transaction would incur huge taxes.The struggling technology company has already hired advisers to explore a potential sale.\u201cEric and Cathy are both highly respected, experienced practitioners in their fields, and we welcome them to Yahoo\u2019s board of directors,\u201d Maynard Webb Jr., Yahoo\u2019s chairman, said in a statement. \u201cToday we are at an important juncture in Yahoo\u2019s transformation, as we execute on our refined strategy and explore strategic alternatives for the company.\u201dA representative for Starboard did not respond to requests for comment on Thursday.Bankers for Yahoo have already been canvassing a wide range of potential suitors for its core Internet business, from companies like Verizon to private equity firms, people briefed on that process have said.Mr. Weingarten, who heads Yahoo\u2019s team of deal makers, said that he was getting lots of questions from current and potential partners about Yahoo\u2019s future. He answers as best he can and returns to the matters at hand.\u201cThere is obviously a lot of media and speculation around Yahoo,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we\u2019re focused on continuing to operate the business.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Seeking Access to Facebook in China, Zuckerberg Courts Risks", "Date": "2016-03-20", "News": "Supported byHONG KONG \u2014 In terms of publicity, it was a great weekend for Mark Zuckerberg in China.The visits have cemented his place as one of the best-known foreign business executives in China. But it is far from clear whether his charm offensive will unlock Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s ultimate goal: persuading the Chinese government to lift its ban on the social media service and open it to the country\u2019s almost 700 million Internet users.The few American technology firms that have entered China in recent years have played down their efforts. Though Travis Kalanick, a founder of Uber, frequently travels to China, news of his presence rarely spreads across the Chinese Internet. There was almost no fanfare in advance of LinkedIn\u2019s deal with two closely connected Chinese venture capital shops to enter China, an event that was marked with a blog post.If Mr. Zuckerberg succeeds, it could show other foreign companies blocked in China that they have a potential path into the huge and fast-growing market \u2014 one that calls for them to accept China\u2019s strict controls on discourse and to refrain from rocking the boat. A failure would underscore Chinese distrust of foreign technology companies and cement the idea that the low-profile approach is the only way to gain market access.Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s meeting with Mr. Liu \u2014 a rarity for an American business executive \u2014 underscores the dynamic. Mr. Liu sits on the Chinese Communist Party\u2019s Politburo Standing Committee, the summit of power in China. The meeting serves China\u2019s propaganda purposes, allowing the country to show that one of the titans of America\u2019s new tech-based economy is happy to pay homage to China\u2019s leaders and its style of Internet governance.If there is anyone Facebook has to win over, it is Mr. Liu, who has for years presided over the controls on China\u2019s highly censored and stage-managed media.At the meeting, Mr. Liu lauded Facebook\u2019s technology prowess, but he also emphasized the importance of Internet governance \u201cwith Chinese characteristics,\u201d according to an official state news media account, a reference to censorship and surveillance within China.Mr. Zuckerberg praised China\u2019s progress in building an advanced Internet and vowed to work with Chinese peers to \u201cbuild a better world in cyberspace,\u201d according to Xinhua, China\u2019s official news agency.Facebook did not respond to a request for comment.On Friday, Mr. Zuckerberg posted a photo of himself smiling as he jogged past the Mao Zedong portrait in Tiananmen Square. He avoided mentioning both the violent crackdown on peaceful demonstrators there in 1989 and that morning\u2019s dangerous air pollution levels.During the discussion with Mr. Ma, the Alibaba founder, on Saturday, Mr. Zuckerberg also generally avoided sensitive topics, speaking instead about artificial intelligence and what should motivate entrepreneurs. He also praised China\u2019s emphasis on engineering, saying that he believed it would help solve future labor shortages associated with high-technology jobs.\u201cIn general we\u2019re seeing a huge constraint around the world on the number of good engineers who are graduating from universities,\u201d Mr. Zuckerberg said. \u201cAnd I think this is something that China has gotten really right by emphasizing for a long time.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": null, "Date": "2016-03-02", "News": "Mr. McClendon is accused of orchestrating a conspiracy in which two oil and gas companies colluded not to bid against each other for the purchase of leases in northwestern Oklahoma from late 2007 to early 2012. The Justice Department said the companies decided who would win the leases and the winner would allot an interest in the leases to the other company. \u00e2\u0080\u009cHis actions put company profits ahead of the interests of leaseholders entitled to competitive bids for oil and gas rights on their land,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said William J. Baer, assistant attorney general for the antitrust division. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe charge that has been filed against me today is wrong and unprecedented,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. Mr. McClendon, an audacious chief executive at Chesapeake until he was forced to step down three years ago, became a billionaire as the company aggressively outbid competitors for land leases and drilled highly productive wells in virtually every major shale gas field in the country. Chesapeake\u00e2\u0080\u0099s stock price has been sinking for five years now, especially since it was revealed that Mr. McClendon had taken a personal stake in Chesapeake wells and used it as collateral for up to $1.1 billion in loans used mostly to pay for his share of the cost of drilling those wells. Gordon Pennoyer, a spokesman for Chesapeake, said the company was cooperating with the antitrust investigation and did not expect to face prosecution or fines related to the matter.This creates a culture of \u00e2\u0080\u009chaves\u00e2\u0080\u009d and \u00e2\u0080\u009chave-nots,\u00e2\u0080\u009d where a vote is worth everything or nothing. The founders control the company and wield influence more or less with impunity. The idea can work well in principle, allowing the founders to look to the long term. And when one share counts for one vote, too often the vote doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t count. There are indications that shareholders value the power to vote too. Google\u00e2\u0080\u0099s \u00e2\u0080\u009cno vote\u00e2\u0080\u009d shares, for example, trade at a small discount to its one-vote shares.SABMiller agreed to sell its stake in MillerCoors in the United States for about $12 billion in November. Asahi Group Holdings of Japan has also agreed to buy Peroni and Grolsch, as well as parts of SABMiller\u00e2\u0080\u0099s European operations, for about $2.8 billion. The complexity is a result, in part, of the constant jockeying among exchanges to win business from the biggest traders, many of which are so-called high-frequency trading firms that make money by capitalizing on small changes in prices. RBC Capital Markets, found that the New York Stock Exchange, Nasdaq and other exchanges make frequent small tweaks to their prices, influencing trading behavior in ways that are hard for even sophisticated investors to understand. At one exchange highlighted in the research, EDGX, the pricing tiers, for example, include the \u00e2\u0080\u009cInvestor Tier,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the \u00e2\u0080\u009cUltra Tier,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the \u00e2\u0080\u009cMega-Step-Up Tier 1\u00e2\u0080\u009d and the \u00e2\u0080\u009cMega-Step-Up Tier 2,\u00e2\u0080\u009d among others. These tiers, though, were just the first layer of complication that big investors have to navigate to determine the price of buying or selling a stock. The research is likely to strengthen the hand of IEX, a company that is  asking regulators for approval to become an official stock exchange. The founders of IEX were the protagonists in the Michael Lewis book \u00e2\u0080\u009cFlash Boys\u00e2\u0080\u009d and are hoping to provide a more straightforward way to trade stocks. One tool they are proposing is a speed bump to slow down trading. end .ru-story  end .ru-story  end .ru-story  end .ru-story  end .ru-story  end .ru-story  end .ru-story Advertisement"}
