{"Headline": "Leading From the Middle: A Supervisor\u2019s Challenge", "Date": "2016-03-18", "News": "Supported byThe WorkologistI am an assistant manager at a convenience store and gas station chain. My clerks enjoy talking to one another, and this gets excessive when certain employees are paired up. I usually let it go on for five or so minutes before nudging them back to work.It may be lonely at the top, but it can be really lonely in the middle. And this is something you\u2019ll just have to accept: You can\u2019t really be a peerlike pal to your workers, nor should you try to be. You weren\u2019t hired to make sure everyone on the payroll is having fun; you\u2019re managing a place of business, not a cocktail party. And really, \u201cGuys, break it up\u201d hardly sounds to me like a bellicose dictatorial pronouncement. You don\u2019t need to find even nicer ways to make your point; you need find methods that work.Ms. Scott suggests two important yardsticks: caring and challenging. The way I read her thinking, each is crucial to providing productive guidance. The problem with a boss who doesn\u2019t really care about workers but challenges them constantly is obvious enough. But a manager who cares about employees yet can never quite muster the courage to be openly critical \u2014 even when criticism would ultimate benefit the employee \u2014 falls into a category Ms. Scott calls \u201cruinous empathy.\u201d This is bad for everybody, including you.With that in mind, refine your nudging. Be clear about setting parameters, as opposed to reacting solely in the moment: We\u2019re here to serve customers, not socialize, so work takes priority over chitchat, period. And as Ms. Scott advises, deliver praise in public, but criticism in private. Sometimes \u201cknock it off\u201d may be unavoidable, but a more one-on-one conversation feels less theatrical and more thoughtful: \u201cI know you like to talk to so-and-so, but you can\u2019t let that take priority over what you\u2019re being paid to do.\u201dWhile your authority may be limited, consider what power you do have. For instance, you can give an employee a good reference \u2014 or not. And maybe you can suggest that an overly chatty worker should beware of that \u201csecret shopper\u201d reporting to higher-ups that he or she was too busy gossiping to say hello.The idea is to be blunt in a way that communicates genuine guidance. Your crew may still find you \u201cunfun,\u201d but they\u2019ll take you seriously and appreciate you more in the long run.After starting a new job, I\u2019m having a problem breaking into a team of three who have been together for 10 years.The team lead (basically the boss) is a man, and the two other team members on my level are both women, like me. The two women have both made it very clear I\u2019m not welcome \u2014 I\u2019m left out of group emails and not invited to lunches. They have even told me I don\u2019t need talk to the boss about anything.But meanwhile, not talking to your own boss is pretty much a recipe for disaster under any circumstances. It might irritate your teammates, but it\u2019s not clear to me what the \u201crisk\u201d is: They already seem to be pushing the limits of workplace hostility.It is not in your boss\u2019s, or the company\u2019s, interest to have somebody on the payroll who is systematically cut out of the loop. So seek his guidance: Be frank that you are approaching him in confidence and make explicit that your desire is not to complain about anyone but you want to make sure that you are contributing all you can. And that, obviously, would entail being included in relevant email conversations and the like. If your new boss is worth working for, he will want you to become an integral part of this theoretical \u201cteam.\u201dAdvertisement"}

It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the closest that the date written in this format can ever come! And in honor of that, this week, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099d like to celebrate:Reasonable-Seeming but WRONG Approximations of \u00cf\u0080!There are many elegant and accurate derivations of \u00cf\u0080. However, this week\u00e2\u0080\u0099s puzzle begins with a \u201cproof\u201d that \u00cf\u0080 actually equals 4.Proof 1, by Tightening a Square Noose:The proof begins simply: Put a circle that has diameter 2 inside a square with side length 2, then repeatedly cut out rectangular pieces of the box. At each stage, the total perimeter of the figure is 8, and after each step, it better approximates the circle. In fact, step-by-step all of the points approach being on the circle, like a noose tightening, therefore, the perimeter of the circle must also be 8. Last, since \u00cf\u0080 is the ratio between a circle\u00e2\u0080\u0099s circumference and its diameter we can conclude that since the circumference equals 8, \u00cf\u0080 must equal 4.Are you convinced? If not why is this argument incorrect? Most people when asked this simply answer, \u00e2\u0080\u009cit\u00e2\u0080\u0099s obviously wrong because \u00cf\u0080 isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t 4.\u00e2\u0080\u009d But how is this method any weaker than the n-gon approximation: the most common approximation technique that most people learn in school?Proof 2, by Tightening Polygon Approximations:What is the difference between these two techniques?Hint: In order to track down the difference, try applying the square tightening method to find the length of the hypotenuse of a right-isosceles triangle with legs of length 1.And last, if you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re now sad that this post did not contain any actual \u00cf\u0080, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099d like to make it up to you with a bit of cake (cake is an excellent approximation of pi, no?).The Leaning CakeAfter spending most of one intense class day addressing this trouble-making \u00e2\u0080\u009cproof\u00e2\u0080\u009d that \u00cf\u0080 = 4, I decided to reward my class\u00e2\u0080\u0099s perseverance by bringing in cake the next day. To make it into a micro-lesson, I decided to review the quick way to calculate how much frosting was needed to coat the sides of the cylindrical cake. \u00e2\u0080\u009cTo find the surface area of the cake\u00e2\u0080\u0099s side, you simply cut down the side, and unfurl it, to get a rectangle.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Therefore, if the cake is 10 inches in diameter and 12 inches in height, the surface area of the icing-covered sides is 120\u00cf\u0080.However one mischievous student then raised his hand and forebodingly asked me, \u00e2\u0080\u009cMs. Vinegar, what happens if someone pushes your cake to the side so that it leans like the Tower of Pisa? I can still unfurl it and get a parallelogram which has the same area as the rectangle (= base x height), so the surface area stays the same, right?\u00e2\u0080\u009dIs this student right or wrong? For the same cake, pushed over to lean at an x-degree tilt, what do you think the surface area would be?Thank you, Zandra!AlphaGo vs. GoBut Lee\u00e2\u0080\u0099s boasts of winning, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m sure, were genuine. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hard to convey how much of a shock AlphaGo\u00e2\u0080\u0099s performance is to the Go world. Actually he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s said that he was completely confident of a 5-0 or 4-1 win \u00e2\u0080\u0094 until Tuesday, when he heard how AlphaGo works described, in terms of neural nets that evaluate positions more like humans do. This gave him pause, and he was suddenly a lot less sure. This is sad if true. He really should have done his homework (not that is would have helped, it appears). But he is known for being brash.Go is part of the national identity of these countries. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s their chess, but on steroids. It has a multi-thousand year history. And I think it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s fair to say that AlphaGo defeating Lee Se-dol is the biggest thing to happen in the world of Go\u00c2\u00a0since it was invented. There is the human era, before AlphaGo, and the computer era, after AlphaGo. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s true that the same thing already happened to chess. But Go\u00c2\u00a0was thought to be too complex and subtle.\u201cI think maybe 10 years,\u201d he says. \u201cBut I do not like to make predictions.\u201dThe move you are referring to, move 37 in Game 2, has already been dubbed the \u00e2\u0080\u009cjaw-dropping move,\u00e2\u0080\u009d because Lee Se-dol\u00e2\u0080\u0099s jaw dropped when it was played.

It was said in the coverage that \u00e2\u0080\u009cno human would ever play this move.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Based on that, the AlphaGo engineers dug into the game logs to see what AlphaGo\u00e2\u0080\u0099s policy network was thinking. It turns out that AlphaGo believed that there was a one in 10,000 chance that a human player would have played that move.

The desolate expanse betrays little sign of human habitation. But the drone ascends and, gradually, the stones cohere into shapes that clearly show human intervention, and the ghost of Mao Zedong.The slogans were constructed in 1968, two years after the onset of the decade-long Cultural Revolution, as navigation aids by members of a military aviation school. Although they have attracted sporadic attention over the years, because they are visible in satellite images, they went largely unknown to the public.Mr. Ju said he had long wanted to make a film about the Cultural Revolution. \u201cThis part of history has always been affecting us, distorting us and reshaping us,\u201d he said in an interview.\u201cThe big characters construct a utopian miracle, stirring people\u2019s passions,\u201d Mr. Ju said. \u201cBut when I arrived on the scene and looked at the gravel that forms the big characters, I only felt a deep sorrow.\u201dMr. Ju first heard about the navigational markings in 2002 from a friend in Hami, but he thought his friend was joking. It was not until late 2014, when he happened to be using Google Earth to research another film project, that he looked for the marks himself.\u201cI was shocked by how clearly visible they were,\u201d he said.After learning they were built in 1968, a year that had long intrigued him for the political stirrings around the world, he decided to make a film, he said. It was also around 1968 that his parents, two \u201csent-down youths,\u201d left their homes in the eastern province of Jiangsu in response to Mao\u2019s call to urban students to learn from farmers and to cure themselves of bourgeois thinking. Mr. Ju was born in Urumqi, the capital of Xinjiang, in 1975.He set out with eight crew members and two drones from Beijing to Hami last June and spent eight days filming the big characters. \u201cThe marks are little known even to local residents,\u201d Mr. Ju said.In 1968, Mr. Ji decided to create five navigational signals around the airport, to guide pilots trying to make their way over the featureless desert. He said he chose the five slogans not just for political reasons, but because he believed they would fortify the pilots\u2019 resolve.\u201cThe characters pushed them to work harder, flying into the sky and defending our motherland,\u201d Mr. Ji said in a telephone interview from Tonghua, in the northeastern province of Jilin, where he was principal of a school for public security officials from 1982 until his retirement.Mr. Ji said he first marked out the characters on the desert floor. Then several dozen soldiers and trainees spent nearly half a year removing stones so the bare earth would reveal the characters. Each character occupies about 50 square meters of land, or more than 500 square feet, he said. The five slogans together occupy an area of around 75,000 square meters, or 18 acres.Mr. Ji, clearly proud of his mammoth calligraphy, said he had never heard of any other navigational markings like these anywhere else in China.\u201cI feel these are part of our country\u2019s cultural heritage,\u201d he said. \u201cEven in the world, I believe they are the best.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misspelled the name of an airport.

{"Headline": "To Circumcise or Not to Circumcise: A New Father\u2019s Question", "Date": "2016-03-01", "News": "Supported byWe never gave much thought to circumcision. Our son was a surviving twin born at 27 weeks gestation. He spent the first 76 days of his life in the newborn intensive care unit at Prentice Women\u2019s Hospital in Chicago. Because he was fighting for his life, there were more pressing matters to consider than the shape of his penis.I had never really questioned why I was circumcised. It wasn\u2019t done for religious reasons. And I had never wondered what my life would have been like had I not been snipped. The look and shape of my penis are nothing more than a part of who I am. No different, really, than the hair on my chest or the mole above my left eyebrow.The doctors first brought up the subject a week before our son\u2019s discharge. They told us that if we wanted to have him circumcised, it would be most convenient to schedule it with his hernia surgery. It would be a two-for-one.My wife had said that because I was the one with the penis, the decision was up to me. For me, there wasn\u2019t a choice. I\u2019m circumcised. Of course my son would be.The surgery was a success, except that the doctors thought he was too small to circumcise. They recommended that we return a few weeks later for an outpatient procedure.Christina began to have second thoughts about putting him under the knife again. I did not share her concerns.A few days later, I was on the phone with my friend Brooks, updating him on our son\u2019s progress and talking through a potential hot topic within my family: my hard-line stance against baptism.I was raised Catholic. I had served as an altar boy, attended Catholic school for 12 years and hardly ever missed a Sunday Mass throughout my childhood in Staten Island, the Bronx and the Jersey Shore. Today, I am no longer a practicing Catholic. Except for weddings, I have not attended church in years.We intend to expose our son to the many religions of the world, and if there comes a day when he wants to identify with one, then he will make an informed decision. I had thought this through for months. Christina, who is not Catholic, agreed.I told all of this to Brooks. He understood. Then he threw me a curveball: Did we plan to go ahead with the circumcision?\u201cWell, yeah, of course,\u201d I quickly replied.\u201cSo you don\u2019t want to baptize your son, but you won\u2019t hesitate to have his foreskin cut?\u201dI found myself tongue-tied and slightly embarrassed. How could I have not given circumcision more thought? I had convictions regarding baptism. But to have our son circumcised for no reason other than the fact that it was done to me? By the same logic, I may as well have him baptized.But for my son to have his penis look absolutely nothing like mine, well, it worried me somehow. If he ever had questions about his, I wouldn\u2019t have the firsthand experience to offer answers. And if he saw me naked, he might notice the difference. Would he feel less of a father-son connection to me, as paranoid as that may sound?We researched the four methods that use a clamp, as well as the Plastibell method, the procedure favored by the hospital where he would be circumcised.I do not recommend viewing the Google Image search results for circumcision.I fell deep down a cyber-rabbit hole into a world of first-person essays on sites like Cosmopolitan.com and Jezebel, describing women\u2019s sexual escapades with \u201cnatural men.\u201d The reviews were mixed.I was hoping Christina had been with an uncircumcised man so she could provide insight, but I figured she would have said something by now and, alas, she had not. I considered asking female friends about their experiences but couldn\u2019t work up the guts and didn\u2019t know whom I should ask. My fears and ego were getting the better of me. I didn\u2019t want to make the wrong decision for my son.In the end, Christina and I kept coming back to two things: that the procedure meant pain, regardless of how temporary, and that in our son\u2019s case, it seemed not to serve any medical purpose. As my wife put it, it\u2019s just another form of cosmetic surgery.Our son recently turned a year old, and I still play the \u201cwhat if?\u201d game in my head. What if he questions why we look different down there? What if during middle school he gets picked on in the locker room for being the only uncircumcised kid? What if women see this as a deal breaker? What if he has reduced sexual pleasure?Then I remember these fears are occurring because I am way out of my little comfort zone \u2014 out of America\u2019s comfort zone, really.And that\u2019s exactly the type of father I want to be: a man who models for his son that he\u2019s not afraid to challenge his default ways of thinking.Chris Silva, an advertising strategist, is a former editor and sportswriter.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Apple Wins Ruling in New York iPhone Hacking Order", "Date": "2016-02-29", "News": "Supported byA federal magistrate judge on Monday denied the United States government\u2019s request that Apple extract data from an iPhone in a drug case in New York, giving the company\u2019s pro-privacy stance a boost as it battles law enforcement officials over opening up the device in other cases.The ruling, from Judge James Orenstein in New York\u2019s Eastern District, is the first time that the government\u2019s legal argument for opening up devices like the iPhone has been put to the test. The denial could influence other cases where law enforcement officials are trying to compel Apple to help unlock iPhones, including the standoff between Apple and the F.B.I. over the iPhone used by one of the attackers in a mass shooting in San Bernardino, Calif., last year.The government\u2019s view of the All Writs Act is so expansive as to cast doubt on its constitutionality if adopted, Judge Orenstein wrote.\u201cIt\u2019s important that a judge for the first time recognizes the All Writs Act doesn\u2019t provide the lawful authority the government has been claiming in these cases,\u201d said Esha Bhandari, a lawyer with the A.C.L.U., which supports Apple\u2019s position. \u201cIt demonstrates that when the government\u2019s arguments are put to the test, a federal court has decided they were not actually right.\u201dIn a statement on Monday in response to Judge Orenstein\u2019s ruling, the Justice Department said it would ask the judge to review the decision. Apple had previously agreed to help open up the iPhone in the drug case, and has complied with past All Writs Act orders, the Justice Department said.\u201cThis phone may contain evidence that will assist us in an active criminal investigation, and we will continue to use the judicial system in our attempt to obtain it,\u201d the Justice Department said.A federal judge has denied the United States government\u2019s request to open up an Apple iPhone in a drug case in New York.An Apple senior executive said Monday\u2019s ruling makes clear that helping to open an iPhone is a constitutional issue that should be taken up by Congress.Judge Orenstein\u2019s ruling stands out because the courts have largely been absent on the major questions of electronic surveillance and privacy of our day. While judges around the country have signed at least 70 orders at the request of the government compelling Apple to access data on phones, this was the first time that a judge and Apple have pushed back.The legal back and forth between Judge Orenstein, the Justice Department and Apple began last October, when federal prosecutors applied for a court order to force Apple to unlock an iPhone 5s seized by the Drug Enforcement Administration in a 2014 drug case, according to court documents.After federal prosecutors requested the order, Judge Orenstein argued in an 11-page memo last October that prosecutors were misusing the All Writs Act. The judge asked Apple to weigh in, and the company filed a brief that same month. In addition to agreeing with the judge, the company also said the request could create an undue burden and threatened to \u201csubstantially tarnish the Apple brand.\u201d\u201cThis reputational harm could have a longer-term economic impact beyond the mere cost of performing the single extraction at issue,\u201d Apple said in a brief.The government then called Apple\u2019s decision to side with the judge a \u201cstunning reversal.\u201d Saritha Komatireddy, a Brooklyn federal prosecutor, said the government\u2019s application in this case \u201cwas just a simple routine request for assistance in carrying out a valid search warrant issued by a federal court, as Apple has done so many times before.\u201dDuring the case, Judge Orenstein said he found it puzzling that Apple had not previously resisted the use of the All Writs Act, including in other cases where Apple had complied with the order.\u201cYou have had apparently 70 prior instances where you have not taken the steps available to you,\u201d Judge Orenstein said to Apple\u2019s lawyers during a hearing.Ultimately, Judge Orenstein argued that the government couldn\u2019t use the All Writs Act to ask Apple to help extract information from a device just because a different law, the Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act, or Calea, addresses the issue and does not include an \u201cinformation services\u201d company like Apple. Congress has been debating whether to amend Calea to include tech companies such as Apple, Facebook and Alphabet\u2019s Google.Still, the decision is not binding for the San Bernardino case, said Eric A. Berg, a litigation lawyer and special counsel with Foley & Lardner, who is a former Justice Department lawyer.\u201cFrom a technical, legal standpoint, it doesn\u2019t really have much of an effect in the California districts,\u201d Mr. Berg said. But \u201cif you start with public opinion, this is going to be viewed as a victory for the privacy lobby and a defeat for the government in that battle over privacy.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "F.C.C. Proposes Privacy Rules for Internet Providers", "Date": "2016-03-10", "News": "Supported byIn the proposal, before the Federal Communications Commission, the agency\u2019s chairman, Tom Wheeler, called for broadband service providers to disclose clearly how data may be collected about users\u2019 online browsing and other activities. The plan also called for the companies to bolster the security of customer data.In a statement, Mr. Wheeler said that since Internet service providers handle all network traffic, the companies have a \u201cbroad view of all of your unencrypted online activity.\u201d He added that \u201ceven when data is encrypted, your broadband provider can piece together significant amounts of information about you \u2014 including private information such as a chronic medical condition or financial problems \u2014 based on your online activity.\u201dThe proposed regulations would put broadband providers under stronger privacy oversight than Internet companies like Google and Facebook. Those companies are monitored by the Federal Trade Commission, whose ability to create specific privacy rules is limited.Many privacy advocates have pushed for a greater role by other agencies because the F.T.C. cannot create rules for online privacy and can only monitor data collection practices as an enforcement agency.\u201cThis is nothing short of a historic moment,\u201d Jeffrey Chester, executive director of the Center for Digital Democracy, a privacy advocacy group, said of the proposed new rules. \u201cUnlike the Federal Trade Commission, the F.C.C. has the legal authority to enact safeguards that will allow an individual to have real control over how their information can be gathered and used.\u201dSome privacy experts said an Internet service provider was capable of stitching together a more complete picture of a consumer by tracking the sites the consumer visits using its network. Because more devices in the home are now being connected to Wi-Fi, the broadband providers also have more ways to collect data on their customers for online advertising, said Harold Feld, a senior vice president of the nonprofit media advocacy group Public Knowledge.Under the proposal, broadband service providers could still collect and share data with other communications-related affiliates without permission. That would allow Verizon\u2019s broadband business, called Fios, for example, to give personal information about a user to its wireless service to market mobile data plans.But the Internet service providers would not be able to share data with noncommunications partners without permission. This would prohibit a broadband service like Google Fiber from blending consumer information with search, maps and email habits of a consumer, the F.C.C. said. Verizon also would not be able to share customer data with AOL, a media site it owns, without permission.The F.C.C.\u2019s proposal drew protest from telecom and cable companies, which have pointed to the F.T.C. as a strong privacy enforcer. The F.C.C. has argued that after it reclassified broadband as a utility, it was compelled by law to create privacy rules.In a recent blog post, AT&T said Internet service providers were collecting less data as more sites became encrypted. Also, consumers are choosing virtual private networks that prevent broadband providers from seeing the sites people visit, the company said. Websites like Google are leading behavioral advertising companies that should be held to the same standards as broadband access providers, AT&T said.The F.C.C. will vote on the proposal on March 31 and then will begin to take public comments, in what will be a monthslong process before final rules are considered.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Return of the D.I.Y. Abortion", "Date": "2016-03-05", "News": "Supported byDURING oral arguments last week before the Supreme Court in Whole Woman\u2019s Health v. Hellerstedt, Justice Elena Kagan noted that she was struck by the clear relationship between abortion restrictions in Texas and the closing of abortion clinics. \u201cIt\u2019s almost like the perfect controlled experiment as to the effect of the law, isn\u2019t it?\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s like you put the law into effect, 12 clinics closed. You take the law out of effect, they reopen.\u201dHow women respond to these closings, however, is another story.We do not have large enough surveys to discern behavior in different states or to track how it has changed over time \u2014 and in any case, people may not feel comfortable sharing the truth in a survey.Google searches can help us understand what\u2019s really going on. They show a hidden demand for self-induced abortion reminiscent of the era before Roe v. Wade.This demand is concentrated in areas where it is most difficult to get an abortion, and it has closely tracked the recent state-level crackdowns on abortion.In 2015, in the United States, there were about 119,000 searches for the exact phrase \u201chow to have a miscarriage.\u201d There were also searches for other variants \u2014 \u201chow to self-abort\u201d \u2014 and for particular methods. Over all, there were more than 700,000 Google searches looking into self-induced abortions in 2015.For comparison, there were some 3.4 million searches for abortion clinics and, according to estimates by the Guttmacher Institute, there are around one million legal abortions a year.The 700,000 searches included about 160,000 asking how to get abortion pills through unofficial channels \u2014 searches like \u201cbuy abortion pills online\u201d and \u201cfree abortion pills.\u201dThere were tens of thousands of searches looking into abortion by herbs like parsley or by vitamin C. There were some 4,000 searches looking for directions on coat hanger abortions, including about 1,300 for the exact phrase \u201chow to do a coat hanger abortion.\u201d There were also a few hundred looking into abortion through bleaching one\u2019s uterus and punching one\u2019s stomach.The state with the highest rate of Google searches for self-induced abortions is Mississippi, which now has one abortion clinic. Eight of the 10 states with the highest search rates for self-induced abortions are considered by the Guttmacher Institute to be hostile or very hostile to abortion. None of the 10 states with the lowest search rates for self-induced abortion are in either category.Search rates for self-induced abortion were fairly steady from 2004 through 2007. They began to rise in late 2008, coinciding with the financial crisis and the recession that followed. They took a big leap in 2011, jumping 40 percent. The Guttmacher Institute singles out 2011 as the beginning of the country\u2019s recent crackdown on abortion; 92 provisions that restrict access to abortion were enacted. There was not a comparable increase in searches for self-induced abortions in Canada, which has not cracked down.Of course, we cannot know from Google searches how many women successfully give themselves abortions, but evidence suggests that a significant number may. One way to test this is to compare abortion and birth data.In 2011, the last year with complete state-level abortion data, women living in states with few abortion clinics had many fewer legal abortions.Compare the 10 states with the most abortion clinics per capita (a list that includes New York and California) to the 10 states with the fewest abortion clinics per capita (a list that includes Mississippi and Oklahoma).Women living in states with the fewest abortion clinics had 54 percent fewer legal abortions \u2014 a difference of 11 abortions for every 1,000 women between the ages of 15 and 44.Women living in states with the fewest abortion clinics also had more live births. However, the difference was not enough to make up for the lower number of abortions. There were six more live births for every 1,000 women of childbearing age.In other words, there appear to have been some missing pregnancies in parts of the country where it was hardest to get an abortion. Self-induced abortions could be playing a role, although more research must be done on rates of pregnancy and unintentional miscarriage in different regions.All this work is preliminary. It will take years before researchers fully make sense of how to interpret this new data. But there is an unambiguous fact in Google search data that the eight justices of the Supreme Court and everyone else should know. In some parts of the United States, demand for self-induced abortion has risen to a disturbing level.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "As a Data Deluge Grows, Companies Rethink Storage", "Date": "2016-03-14", "News": "Supported byMOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif. \u2014 John Hayes, cleareyed and wild-haired, stood before his silent creation. Big as a slim refrigerator, it held 16 petabytes of data, roughly equal to 16 billion thick books.\u201cPeople are going to have to think about things to put into this,\u201d he said, surrounded by the clutter of his office at a Silicon Valley company called Pure Storage. \u201cBut that won\u2019t take long \u2014 there\u2019s a demand for data that nobody was ready for.\u201dEach month, the world\u2019s one billion cellphones throw out 18 exabytes of data, equal to 1,100 of Mr. Hayes\u2019s boxes. There are also millions of sensors in things ranging from cars and appliances to personal fitness trackers and cameras.IBM estimates that by 2020 we will have 44 zettabytes \u2014 the thousandfold number next up from exabytes \u2014 generated by all those devices. It is so much information that Big Blue is staking its future on so-called machine learning and artificial intelligence, two kinds of pattern-finding software built to cope with all that information.Making storage products has long been a major part of the tech industry. It has also been one of the dullest, with little in the way of innovation. Now the surge in data is leading both start-ups and some of tech\u2019s biggest companies to rethink how they approach the problem.Pure, co-founded by Mr. Hayes, a 38-year-old former video karaoke engineer, is one of several companies trying new approaches.Mr. Hayes\u2019s box, which was unveiled on Monday, holds five times as much data as a conventional storage device, thanks to a combination of so-called flash storage technology and clever engineering. Sometime in 2017, he said, it will hold twice that much, as Pure tweaks the product. Power consumption, the company says, is 4 percent of the current standard.While traditional storage works much like a record player, with data stored on and fetched from spinning disks, flash storage gets data directly on and off a semiconductor. Flash storage has become common in consumer tech products like smartphones.The new Pure system is also built in blades, which act like building blocks. Add a blade, and the overall system reconfigures to raise efficiency. There is space on the device for additional processing, so a blade could easily be added.\u201cIt\u2019s not just about Google and Facebook,\u201d said Joe Unsworth, an analyst with Gartner. \u201cHealth care, manufacturing and natural resources companies can all justify owning this much storage. In 10 years, a big sanitation company with sensors on its Dumpsters to manage pickups could have tens of petabytes.\u201dPure is hardly alone in working on new ways to handle the world\u2019s immense data deluge. The industry leader, EMC, has both traditional and advanced storage, including flash. EMC was bought by Dell in October for $67 billion. \u201cIf Dell hadn\u2019t bought them, I\u2019d wonder what Dell was going to do,\u201d Mr. Unsworth said.Netflix, which offers streaming video to 75 million people in 190 countries, ships dozens of custom-built appliances a week to hundreds of local Internet service providers. The newest, a mix of flash and traditional storage, can store five petabytes \u2014 enough, the company figures, to hold almost anything from its catalog that anyone, anywhere would want to watch, for now.The company analyzes data to figure out both the kind of content it should offer next, and the Internet\u2019s capacity to stream all that entertainment. \u201cWe arguably have the most insight of anybody,\u201d said Ken Florance, vice president of content delivery at Netflix. \u201cThere are networks in Kenya that are better than some networks in the U.S.\u201dCapturing and analyzing masses of data already touches improbable corners, like championship auto racing. Mercedes AMG Petronas, the racing arm of the Daimler car company, is an early customer of the new Pure blades.Mercedes AMG has about 300 sensors on each high-performance car. Much the way human athletes are regulated for substances, racing officials now limit the amount of computation cars can use, including wind tunnel simulations between races, so it pays to move data quickly.\u201cThey audit the amount of processing we use,\u201d said Matt Harris, the head of information technology for Mercedes AMG. \u201cIf we can cut a few seconds off each job with faster storage, that\u2019s an extra simulation a month.\u201dPure is in a race of its own. The company went public in October, and since then its stock has fallen one-third from the highs reached soon after. The new flash blade product line will not be important for revenue this year, but the company\u2019s chief executive, Scott Dietzen, hopes it will calm disappointed investors.\u201cNo one can look at all their data anymore; they need algorithms just to decide what to look at,\u201d he said, adding that he planned to offer 10 times the performance of competing products, at a lower cost. \u201cThis market is at least as large as our original storage business, and a lot bigger over time.\u201dMr. Hayes didn\u2019t set out to shake up a once-staid storage world. In 2006, he was a software engineer at a company that did online karaoke talent searches, when it was purchased by Yahoo.When Yahoo killed the product, he became a promoter of Yahoo\u2019s social networks, then quit in 2009. His old bosses at the karaoke company, backed by venture capitalists, were looking at a way to use flash and needed a good coder.The first Pure Storage product came out in 2012.By mid-2013, he was thinking about how he would build his product for a world of falling memory prices, and rapidly rising amounts of data inside cloud computing systems.Working with Mr. Dietzen and investors, he set up a venture inside Pure but away from the rest of the company, hiring a team of experienced people from places like Oracle, Microsoft Research and Facebook. Mr. Dietzen hopes investors will now see where some formerly unexplained research and development money has gone.\u201cHe got people you couldn\u2019t recruit if you were a start-up \u2014 midcareer \u2014 who wouldn\u2019t work at a place that was going to run out of money, but wanted to be in something small and challenging,\u201d said Par Botes, an early hire who was chief technology officer at EMC. Like others in the effort, Mr. Botes has a LinkedIn profile that says only that he is at a \u201cstealth mode start-up technology company.\u201dFrom an original group of five people, the quiet project inside Pure has grown to 80, and Mr. Hayes sees a need for many more.\u201cI\u2019ve talked to companies planning for hundreds of petabytes,\u201d he said. \u201cEven a body camera on a cop adds up data pretty quickly.\u201dAdvertisement"}

But investors are struggling to see the silver lining in the headlines about Valeant.Mr. Levine also notes that he does not understand Valeant\u00e2\u0080\u0099s investor-relations strategy. Why have one-on-one calls to reassure analysts, only to  sandbag them with bad results and guidance two weeks later? he asks. Also in question is why the company had to issue a correction over an earnings release that it knew would be heavily scrutinized.  Its stock market value of $11.4 billion after the close of business on Tuesday was less than half of the $31 billion in debt the company carries. Valeant\u00e2\u0080\u0099s reliance on acquisitions makes the company\u00e2\u0080\u0099s true cash flows much harder to fathom and its preferred measure of cash flow is not based on generally accepted accounting principles, so it is not reliable. The acquisitions are probably valued on Valeant\u00e2\u0080\u0099s books at or near the prices paid for them and those prices are often far higher than the businesses are worth, analysts say. One of SunEdison\u00e2\u0080\u0099s yieldcos, TerraForm Power, agreed to buy $922 million of Vivint assets from SunEdison, selling stock to finance the purchase. SunEdison controls the yieldcos but does not own a majority interest. Appaloosa Management protested about the acquisition, asserting that SunEdison used its control position to force TerraForm Power into this deal. Then the price of oil collapsed and investors drove down the stocks of solar power companies. After TerraForm Power openly talked of getting out of the deal and a delay in completing SunEdison\u00e2\u0080\u0099s financial statements, a new ironclad merger agreement was written. Yet SunEdison still has not finished its financial statements and Vivint has now terminated and is suing SunEdison for damages. \u00e2\u0080\u009cHe is pretty much the only game in town,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Michael Sammons, a San Antonio investor who lost money in two Chinese companies, adding that he could not find anyone else to take on the cases.

Who\u2019s who?Two people with the same name can get mixed up \u2014 in both senses. Throw in the Internet, which can make geography irrelevant, and the possibility for confusion rivals that of a Shakespeare comedy, without the happy ending.Just ask us.The professor is clean-shaven. The journalist has a beard. In a small town, in real life, that might keep us pretty well sorted out. Out on the web, it has meant only that our photos, too, have been jumbled. Arriving to give a talk recently, the journalist was asked by his host when he grew the beard. Sure enough, there on the poster advertising his talk on drone strikes was the portrait of the expert on entrepreneurship.The professor, meanwhile, has distant relatives who ask him how he has time to write for The Times.When a house cleaner for the professor stole a check and used it for a big purchase at Best Buy, the bad account was sold to a persistent debt-collection company \u2014 which then discovered the journalist\u2019s home phone number. The company phoned off and on for a couple of years, scoffing at the journalist\u2019s insistence that they had the wrong Scott Shane.A few years ago a former congressman phoned the professor, offering a tip on something that was happening in Libya: \u201cIt\u2019s off the record, because it\u2019s classified,\u201d he said. Rattled, and figuring it was another mix-up, the professor cut him off and hurried to hang up, wanting nothing to do with state secrets.Because we both write books, various titles are regularly attributed to the wrong author, especially by the aggregating software that pulls together so much of the web\u2019s data. For a while, the journalist propped up one of the professor\u2019s books (\u201cBorn Entrepreneurs, Born Leaders\u201d) in front of his desk at work, simply to enjoy colleagues\u2019 double takes. The professor is routinely instructed to remove citations of the journalist\u2019s work from his academic citation count, the basis of evaluations and raises.The comic plot thickened a few years ago when the professor was asked to write columns for a New York Times business blog called \u201cYou\u2019re the Boss.\u201d The journalist began to get regular pitches from wheedling P.R. operatives who wanted to get the name of a company or an executive into the column. They were befuddled when told they had the wrong Scott Shane of The New York Times.The column stint ended a few years ago. But by then the professor\u2019s name and email were officially embedded in the newspaper\u2019s computer system. That meant that an editor trying to send the journalist a \u201cplayback\u201d of an edited version of his article sometimes chose the wrong Scott Shane from a drop-down menu. The professor would get an urgent message asking whether the editing changes were O.K. The journalist would wonder why he didn\u2019t get a playback.Uprooting the professor from the paper\u2019s email directories, starting a few weeks ago, has proved to be a complicated task, requiring a crew of technical experts scouring the system. After a round robin of a dozen emails, word arrived that the problem had been fixed.Actually, it turned out, the problem had not been fixed. The professor\u2019s email address surfaced again last week, evidently hiding somewhere in the recesses of The Times\u2019 computers. The tech team is back on the case.And meanwhile, a postscript: The professor seems to have passed this confusion of identities, like some genetic disorder, to a new generation. His son, Ryan Shane, is an excellent swimmer for an 11-year-old, but he is not (yet) ready for the Olympics. Some in the world of competitive swimming, however, have mixed him up with Shane Ryan, a 22-year-old who is a genuine Olympic prospect.Unlike his dad, who would prefer to avoid the confusing bits and bytes, Ryan Shane would be happy to ride the wave of online confusion to a spot with Team U.S.A. He\u2019d also welcome sponsorship. A tech company might be fitting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "CrowdSignals Aims to Create a Marketplace for Smartphone Sensor Data", "Date": "2016-03-22", "News": "Supported byWords and pictures, culled from across the web, have been the digital grist for remarkable gains in computing tasks like image recognition and speech translation. But another huge data resource \u2014 sensor data from smartphones \u2014 lags behind as a fuel source for major research advances.CrowdSignals, a new initiative to collect, label and pay for mobile sensor data, seeks to overcome that shortfall. The organization\u2019s approach relies less on innovation in technology than on economics and creating a marketplace for sensor data.\u201cWe haven\u2019t even begun to tap the potential of smartphone data,\u201d said Evan Welbourne, a computer scientist who heads the CrowdSignals project.The promising future of mobile data, experts agree, is that it can point the way to new insights in health care, transportation, urban planning and the social sciences.But such mobile data is typically costly and time-consuming to collect for researchers, and it is difficult to interpret.The big improvement in fields like vision recognition have come from vast data sources and steadily improving software techniques in a branch of artificial intelligence called machine learning.Yet that high-tech wizardry relies on human help. The software is trained on sets of data that have been labeled by humans \u2014 identifying, for example, the pictures of cats, dogs and horses.Building human-labeled data sets is straightforward with pictures and words. Humans can identify images quickly and accurately.The labeling challenge is trickier with mobile sensor data. For example, a person contributing data has to log in when walking, running or biking. If a researcher wants to correlate mood with activity, the contributor might have to answer a question or two on a touch screen.Data from a personal device \u2014 a smartphone or smartwatch \u2014 is also sensitive, raising issues of data use and privacy, which complicates the collection of sensor data.The development of software models using mobile sensor data has been hindered, said Deborah Estrin, a professor of computer science at Cornell Tech, because of \u201cthe absence of labeled data sets. And the reason for that is the lack of a community effort to do that in an ethical, efficient way.\u201dMs. Estrin is one of several computer scientists from universities around the world who are advisers to CrowdSignals, as are researchers at companies like Microsoft and Intel.Most research using mobile data has tracked relatively small numbers of people in a single city or region, often using proprietary data from mobile carriers or device makers. CrowdSignals is intended to overcome those limitations, said Daniel Gatica-Perez, a researcher at Idiap Research Institute in Switzerland, who is an adviser on the project.Both Apple and Samsung have introduced software tools for collecting and sharing mobile data. Samsung\u2019s SAMI is a data exchange platform where developers can place their data and work with others. Apple\u2019s Research Kit allows iPhone users to share their data for use in research projects, often health-related studies.CrowdSignals is trying to build a marketplace for data with financial incentives for people to participate and label their data. All the data will be anonymized, the organization says.CrowdSignals\u2019 long-range goal is to have thousands of participants in studies, but it is starting with a pilot project. It hopes to raise $15,000 in the initial crowdfunding round, Mr. Welbourne said, and then recruit 30 to 50 participants whose smartphone data will be collected for a month.In the pilot, the CrowdSignals software can handle data only from people whose smartphones use Google\u2019s Android operating system. Later, Mr. Welbourne hopes to accommodate users of Apple iPhones as well.The participants, he said, will be paid a flat rate of about $100 for the month. But the compensation can go up or down, depending on how much personal data they choose to share. In addition, they will receive incentive payments of up to a few dollars for labeling their data.Much of crowdsourced funds, Mr. Welbourne said, will go toward selecting and educating participants. The outreach will be by websites and follow-up emails. CrowdSignals will also have videos and individual Skype calls to explain the project. Even the pilot, Mr. Welbourne said, will try to enlist a diverse group by gender, age, geographic location and ethnicity.University and corporate researchers who are crowdfunders will get first access to the data set: Academics will pay a $20 license fee and corporate researchers will pay $50. The licenses last five years, but after one year the data set will be free for academic use.A former researcher at Amazon, Samsung and Nokia, Mr. Welbourne plans to build a business by creating software models for specific industries like health care and mobile device makers, based on the same CrowdSignals data available to all licensees. His Seattle start-up, AlgoSnap, was founded last year.Mr. Welbourne\u2019s business plan is a bet that the CrowdSignals pilot succeeds. If it does, he intends to spin off CrowdSignals as a nonprofit entity. \u201cIt\u2019s a little more appropriate for the data collection and research,\u201d he said.A challenge for the CrowdSignals, assuming it takes off, experts say, will be fostering trust among large numbers of people beyond the early participants.\u201cNavigating the privacy issue may be an uphill battle,\u201d said Jason I. Hong, a computer scientist at Carnegie Mellon University and an adviser. \u201cBut this is a really clever idea over all. If it works, we\u2019ll have larger, richer data sets for researchers in universities and corporations.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "In the Apple Case, a Debate Over Data Hits Home", "Date": "2016-03-13", "News": "Supported byNews AnalysisBut the national debate touched off this winter by the confrontation between the Justice Department and Apple over smartphone security is not exactly the one Mr. Obama had in mind.Mr. Snowden\u2019s revelations produced modest changes and a heightened suspicion of the government\u2019s activities in cyberspace. Because the issue now centers on a device most Americans carry in their pockets, it is concrete and personal in a way that surveillance by the National Security Agency never was.\u201cDiscussing the case with my friends has become a touchy subject,\u201d said Matthew Montoya, 19, a computer science major at the University of Texas, El Paso. \u201cWe\u2019re a political bunch with views from all across the spectrum.\u201dLike many of her friends, Emi Kane, a community organizer in Oakland, Calif., recently found herself arguing via Facebook with a family friend about the case. Ms. Kane thought Apple was right to refuse to hack the phone; her friend, a waitress in Delaware, said she was disgusted by Apple\u2019s lack of patriotism.After exchanging several terse messages, they agreed to disagree. \u201cIt was a hard conversation,\u201d Ms. Kane said.The novelist Russell Banks, who signed a letter to Attorney General Loretta Lynch on behalf of Apple, said he had spoken with more than a dozen people about the case just in the last week.\u201cIt\u2019s not just people in the tech industry talking about this,\u201d Mr. Banks, the author of \u201cAffliction\u201d and \u201cThe Sweet Hereafter,\u201d said. \u201cIt\u2019s citizens like myself.\u201dThat may be because the Apple case involves a device whose least interesting feature is the phone itself. It is a minicomputer stuffed with every detail of a person\u2019s life: photos of children, credit card purchases, texts with spouses (and nonspouses), and records of physical movements.Mr. Obama warned Friday against \u201cfetishizing our phones above every other value.\u201d After avoiding taking a position for months, he finally came down on the side of law enforcement, saying that using technology to prevent legal searches of smartphones was the equivalent of preventing the police from searching a house for evidence of child pornography.\u201cThat can\u2019t be the right answer,\u201d he said at the South by Southwest festival in Texas, even as he professed deep appreciation for civil liberties and predicted both sides would find a way to cooperate. \u201cI\u2019m confident this is something that we can solve.\u201dThe technology company has been locked in a major legal battle against law enforcement officials over privacy and security.But polls suggest the public is nowhere near as certain as Mr. Obama. In surveys, Americans are deeply divided about the legal struggle between the government and one of the nation\u2019s most iconic companies. The polls show that Americans remain anxious about both the threat of terrorist attacks and the possible theft of personal digital information.But despite the fears about terrorism, the public\u2019s concern about digital privacy is nearly universal. A Pew Research poll in 2014 found more than 90 percent of those surveyed felt that consumers had lost control over how their personal information was collected and used by companies.Now, people are beginning to understand that their smartphones are just the beginning. Smart televisions, Google cars, Nest thermostats and web-enabled Barbie dolls are next. The resolution of the legal fight between Apple and the government may help decide whether the information in those devices is really private, or whether the F.B.I. and the N.S.A. are entering a golden age of surveillance in which they have far more data available than they could have imagined 20 years ago.\u201cIt\u2019s an in-your-face proposition for lots more Americans than the Snowden revelation was,\u201d said Lee Rainie, director of Internet, science and technology research at Pew Research Center.Cindy Cohn, executive director of the Electronic Frontier Foundation, said: \u201cEveryone gets at a really visceral level that you have a lot of really personal stuff on this device and if it gets stolen it\u2019s really bad. They know that the same forces that work at trying to get access to sensitive stuff in the cloud are also at work attacking the phones.\u201dFor the F.B.I. and local law enforcement agencies, the fight has become a high-stakes struggle to prevent what James B. Comey, the bureau\u2019s director, calls \u201cwarrant-free zones\u201d where criminals can hide evidence out of reach of the authorities.Officials had hoped the Apple case involving a terrorist\u2019s iPhone would rally the public behind what they see as the need to have some access to information on smartphones. But many in the administration have begun to suspect that the F.B.I. and the Justice Department may have made a major strategic error by pushing the case into the public consciousness.Many senior officials say an open conflict between Silicon Valley and Washington is exactly what they have been trying to avoid, especially when the Pentagon and intelligence agencies are trying to woo technology companies to come back into the government\u2019s fold, and join the fight against the Islamic State. But it appears it is too late to confine the discussion to the back rooms in Washington or Silicon Valley.The fact that Apple is a major consumer company \u201ctakes the debate out of a very narrow environment \u2014 the universe of technologists and policy wonks \u2014 into the realm of consumers where barriers like the specific language of Washington or the technology industry begins to fall away,\u201d said Malkia Cyril, the executive director of the Center for Media Justice, a grass-roots activist network.That organization and other activist groups like Black Lives Matter have seized on the issue as important for their members. In February the civil liberties group Fight for the Future organized the day of protest against the government order that resulted in rallies in cities nationwide.\u201cWhen we heard the news and made a call for nationwide rallies, one happened in San Francisco that same day,\u201d said Tiffiniy Cheng, co-founder of Fight for the Future. \u201cThings like that almost never happen.\u201dMs. Cyril says the public angst about the iPhone case feels more urgent than did the discussion about government surveillance three years ago.\u201cThis is one of those moments that defines what\u2019s next,\u201d she said. \u201cWill technology companies protect the privacy of their users or will they do work for the U.S. government? You can\u2019t do both.\u201dMichael D. Shear and David E. Sanger reported from Washington, and Katie Benner from San Francisco.Advertisement"}

A \u201ccreative genius\u201d like Mr. Lee tests the limits of the machine, he said.Go has been seen as the last great challenge in computer programmers\u2019 efforts to create software that can outwit humans in board games. Go is such a complex game, with an almost infinite possible sequence of moves, that artificial-intelligence experts had predicted that computer programs needed more than 10 more years before they would be able to beat Go legends like Mr. Lee, who has 18 international titles.Before the best-of-five series began on Wednesday, Mr. Lee had been upbeat. But the mood quickly sank after he lost the first three matches.After losing his third match \u2014 and $1 million in prize money \u2014 on Saturday, Mr. Lee admitted that the psychological pressure he felt in facing a nonhuman foe was a big handicap. But Mr. Lee also said AlphaGo was not perfect.\u201cIt was Lee Se-dol, not humans, who lost the matches,\u201d he said defiantly on Saturday, adding that he would do his best to beat the machine in the remaining two games.On Sunday, Mr. Lee delivered.Go is a two-person strategy board game said to have been created in China more than 3,000 years ago. The players compete for territory by placing black and white stones on intersections of a board of 19 horizontal and 19 vertical lines. The first player in a match uses black stones; the other, white. On Sunday, AlphaGo held the black stone.During the post-match news conference on Sunday, Mr. Lee said he had found some weaknesses of AlphaGo.When he made a surprise move, AlphaGo acted as if it had \u201ca bug,\u201d he said. He also said AlphaGo seemed to do better when it held the white stone.Mr. Lee then offered to let AlphaGo play the white stone in the last match, scheduled for Tuesday.\u201cI beat it with the white stone,\u201d Mr. Lee said. \u201cNow, I want to see if I can beat it with black.\u201dGoogle\u2019s DeepMind team accepted the offer.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Where Computers Defeat Humans, and Where They Can\u2019t", "Date": "2016-03-16", "News": "Supported byOp-Ed ContributorsALPHAGO, the artificial intelligence system built by the Google subsidiary DeepMind, has just defeated the human champion, Lee Se-dol, four games to one in the tournament of the strategy game of Go. Why does this matter? After all, computers surpassed humans in chess in 1997, when IBM\u2019s Deep Blue beat Garry Kasparov. So why is AlphaGo\u2019s victory significant?Like chess, Go is a hugely complex strategy game in which chance and luck play no role. Two players take turns placing white or black stones on a 19-by-19 grid; when stones are surrounded on all four sides by those of the other color they are removed from the board, and the player with more surrounded territory and captured stone at the game\u2019s end wins.Unlike the case with chess, however, no human can explain how to play Go at the highest levels. The top players, it turns out, can\u2019t fully access their own knowledge about how they\u2019re able to perform so well. This self-ignorance is common to many human abilities, from driving a car in traffic to recognizing a face. This strange state of affairs was beautifully summarized by the philosopher and scientist Michael Polanyi, who said, \u201cWe know more than we can tell.\u201d It\u2019s a phenomenon that has come to be known as \u201cPolanyi\u2019s Paradox.\u201dPolanyi\u2019s Paradox hasn\u2019t prevented us from using computers to accomplish complicated tasks, like processing payrolls, optimizing flight schedules, routing telephone calls and calculating taxes. But as anyone who\u2019s written a traditional computer program can tell you, automating these activities has required painstaking precision to explain exactly what the computer is supposed to do.This approach to programming computers is severely limited; it can\u2019t be used in the many domains, like Go, where we know more than we can tell, or other tasks like recognizing common objects in photos, translating between human languages and diagnosing diseases \u2014 all tasks where the rules-based approach to programming has failed badly over the years.Deep Blue achieved its superhuman performance almost by sheer computing power: It sifted through millions of possible chess moves to determine the optimal move. The problem is that there are many more possible Go games than there are atoms in the universe, so even the fastest computers can\u2019t simulate a meaningful fraction of them. To make matters worse, it\u2019s usually far from clear which possible moves to even start exploring.What changed? The AlphaGo victories vividly illustrate the power of a new approach in which instead of trying to program smart strategies into a computer, we instead build systems that can learn winning strategies almost entirely on their own, by seeing examples of successes and failures.Since these systems don\u2019t rely on human knowledge about the task at hand, they\u2019re not limited by the fact that we know more than we can tell.AlphaGo does use simulations and traditional search algorithms to help it decide on some moves, but its real breakthrough is its ability to overcome Polanyi\u2019s Paradox. It did this by figuring out winning strategies for itself, both by example and from experience. The examples came from huge libraries of Go matches between top players amassed over the game\u2019s 2,500-year history. To understand the strategies that led to victory in these games, the system made use of an approach known as deep learning, which has demonstrated remarkable abilities to tease out patterns and understand what\u2019s important in large pools of information.Learning in our brains is a process of forming and strengthening connections among neurons. Deep learning systems take an analogous approach, so much so that they used to be called \u201cneural nets.\u201d They set up billions of nodes and connections in software, use \u201ctraining sets\u201d of examples to strengthen connections among stimuli (a Go game in process) and responses (the next move), then expose the system to a new stimulus and see what its response is. AlphaGo also played millions of games against itself, using another technique called reinforcement learning to remember the moves and strategies that worked well.Deep learning and reinforcement learning have both been around for a while, but until recently it was not at all clear how powerful they were, and how far they could be extended. In fact, it\u2019s still not, but applications are improving at a gallop, with no end in sight. And the applications are broad, including speech recognition, credit card fraud detection, and radiology and pathology. Machines can now recognize faces and drive cars, two of the examples that Polanyi himself noted as areas where we know more than we can tell.We still have a long way to go, but the implications are profound. As when James Watt introduced his steam engine 240 years ago, technology-fueled changes will ripple throughout our economy in the years ahead, but there is no guarantee that everyone will benefit equally. Understanding and addressing the societal challenges brought on by rapid technological progress remain tasks that no machine can do for us.An Op-Ed essay on March 16 about the game-playing computer called AlphaGo mischaracterized the strategy game Go, in which players place colored stones on a grid. Stones are removed from the board when they are surrounded by the other color, and the player with more territory and captured stones wins; the winner is not the player with more captured stones alone. The article also misstated how Deep Blue, a chess-playing computer, learned to make optimal moves. It sifted through millions of possibilities that it created; it was not fed chess games by programmers.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Echo From Amazon Brims With Groundbreaking Promise", "Date": "2016-03-09", "News": "Supported byState of the ArtMany of the world\u2019s largest technology companies have spent the last five years searching in vain for the holy grail, a machine to succeed the smartphone as the next must-have gadget.They have made digital watches and fitness trackers, all manner of computerized glasses and goggles, and more doodads to plug into your TV than there are shows to watch on it.This time it may be different. A bit more than a year after its release, the Echo has morphed from a gimmicky experiment into a device that brims with profound possibility. The longer I use it, the more regularly it inspires the same sense of promise I felt when I used the first iPhone \u2014 a sense this machine is opening up a vast new realm in personal computing, and gently expanding the role that computers will play in our future.What is most interesting about the Echo is that it came out of nowhere. It isn\u2019t much to look at, and even describing its utility is difficult. Here is a small, stationary machine that you set somewhere in your house, which you address as Alexa, which performs a variety of tasks \u2014 playing music, reading the news and weather, keeping a shopping list \u2014 that you can already do on your phone.But the Echo has a way of sneaking into your routines. When Alexa reorders popcorn for you, or calls an Uber car for you, when your children start asking Alexa to add Popsicles to the grocery list, you start to want pretty much everything else in life to be Alexa-enabled, too.In this way, Amazon has found a surreptitious way to bypass Apple and Google \u2014 the reigning monarchs in the smartphone world \u2014 with a gadget that has the potential to become a dominant force in the most intimate of environments: our homes.Scot Wingo, the chairman of ChannelAdvisor, an e-commerce consulting firm, said the early signs suggested that the Echo was on a path to become Amazon\u2019s next $1 billion business.\u201cIt\u2019s one of the most sold-out things that I see on Amazon,\u201d Mr. Wingo said. \u201cIt\u2019s an unusual thing for Amazon to be out of something, but for the Echo, it\u2019s usually in stock just for a couple weeks before it goes out of stock for a few days \u2014 so it feels like they\u2019re having trouble making enough of the devices.\u201d Mr. Wingo noted the Echo, which Amazon sells for $180 only through its own site, was selling for $200 to $300 on eBay.During an interview at a media event last week, Dave Limp, Amazon\u2019s senior vice president for devices, said the company created the Echo because it had seen interesting possibilities arising out of advances in microphone technology, speech recognition and cloud connectivity. Amazon\u2019s engineers spent years perfecting the device\u2019s unusual capabilities. Unlike competing assistants, the Echo can be activated hands-free from far across the room (Siri only works from a couple of feet away), and it can decipher your voice in noisy environments, even when it\u2019s playing music.Amazon also worked to make sure the device responded very quickly. \u201cEarly on in the product, to play music took eight or nine seconds, and it\u2019s just unusable when it\u2019s like that,\u201d Mr. Limp said. \u201cNow it\u2019s often 1,000 milliseconds or 1,200 milliseconds.\u201dThe speed makes a crucial difference. Compared with the trudge of chatting with Siri, speaking to Alexa feels natural, closer to speaking to a human than a machine \u2014 and even when it gets your request wrong, which in your early days with the device will happen often, it doesn\u2019t feel like you have paid a huge penalty for trying.More important, just like the early iPhone, Amazon has managed to turn the Echo into the center of a new ecosystem. Developers are flocking to create voice-controlled apps for the device, or skills, as Amazon calls them. There are now more than 300 skills for the Echo, from the trivial \u2014 there is one to make Alexa produce rude body sounds on command \u2014 to the pretty handy. It can tell you transit schedules, start a seven-minute workout, read recipes, do math and conversions, and walk you through adventure games, among other possibilities.Makers of digital home devices like Nest are also rushing to make their products compatible with the Echo. Alexa can now control your Internet-connected lights, home thermostats and a variety of other devices. Hardware makers can also add Alexa\u2019s brain into their own devices, so soon you won\u2019t need an Echo to consult with Alexa \u2014 you could find it in your toaster, your refrigerator or your car.The Echo also ties in to Amazon\u2019s main business, its retail store. When you tell it to reorder popcorn, it gets your order through Amazon, of course. Still, Mr. Wingo noted that Amazon had so far kept the platform relatively open \u2014 other retailers and product manufacturers are free to build their own apps that will allow for interactions with their stores.Advertisement"}

It\u2019s time to be thinking about your garden, if you have one. Even if you don\u2019t, thinking about gardens \u2014 renewal, growth, wildness, creativity \u2014 has its own reward. As three new picture books with dramatically varied styles of illustration show, a garden is an idea that can be approached from starkly different directions.A garden can be art: sculpture made from greenery. So it is in \u201cThe Night Gardener,\u201d a debut written and illustrated by the brothers Terry and Eric Fan, set in a gray town where green things are happening. Every morning the townspeople discover that another large tree has been reshaped into magnificent topiary. The vivid animal figures spark delight in this grim place. Young William, who lives in an orphanage but is apparently free to come and go, happens one evening upon the Night Gardener, a mysterious old man with a walrus mustache who (because this is William\u2019s book, or his fantasy) engages the boy as apprentice. In a marathon night of climbing and clipping, a park becomes a menagerie of giant, leafy creatures.As the depressed town turns celebratory, illustrations that started out monochrome go full-color. Then, in a riveting sequence of spreads, a green vista of sculpted animals \u2014 giraffe, emu, rhinoceros \u2014 turns autumn-colored and finally reverts to plain, bare-branched trees. The townspeople were never the same, says the text, and neither was William.The lesson: You don\u2019t have to live a dull life if you exercise your imagination. The message itself is none too new, or helpful. What\u2019s worth the admission in this book is in the illustrations. They use a realistic cross-hatched style that sits, if at times slightly awkwardly, halfway between traditional old engravings and the looser lines of more modern artists like Edward Ardizzone. Still, they achieve a lovely, luminous effect. Illustrator-authors often write themselves stories involving spectacular scenes of fantasy; it\u2019s understandable. Those scenes will be the lure for children, as the elaborate tree-animals are for William. Real topiary couldn\u2019t be created from trees like this, but illustrators can do things that horticulturists can\u2019t.The gardens in \u201cTokyo Digs a Garden,\u201d written by Jon-Erik Lappano, are about abandoning control, not exercising it. The world of young, quirkily named Tokyo begins without a garden. It\u2019s a cramped urban landscape in which tall buildings have eaten up all signs of nature. In a strangely archaic moment, a mysterious old woman gives the boy three wishing seeds. He lifts a brick and pokes them into the ground, and soon the city is engulfed in forests. Monkeys swing from trees and ruined roads turn to rivers where salmon jump. The result is a kind of Eden, but the buildings are still part of it. Tokyo\u2019s worried grandfather ponders, \u201cWhat are we going to do?\u201d \u201cI think,\u201d Tokyo says, \u201cthat we will just have to get used to it.\u201dThis moral, too, about living harmoniously with nature, is heavy-handed, and the explosive reforestation the book presents is alarming. But the text attempts some levity with Tokyo\u2019s ice-cream-craving cat, and the final picture also soothes a bit: a scene of a row of houses with colorful vegetation on roofs and balconies. \u201cGardens have to grow somewhere, after all,\u201d the narrator says.For a parable about wildness, Kellen Hatanaka\u2019s illustrations take an unlikely approach: They\u2019re elegant and midcentury modern, all bold, flat shapes, crisp edges and beautiful colors. Abstraction prevails, to the point where Hatanaka\u2019s stylized faces lack features like eyes and noses. But the pictures are also full of energy, popping colors and some sly humor, if you look. Little children\u2019s eyes may fill in the modernist blanks and see the sprawling richness implied in the text. Older children might well appreciate the sophisticated design. Adults who like artistic picture books should take to this one \u2014 I find it a thing of beauty.Beautiful in a very different way, \u201cStories From Bug Garden\u201d comprises 11 tiny stories by Lisa Moser describing the lives of bugs in an abandoned plot of land \u2014 no mysterious old person in this book stirring up magical transformations. You can see from Gwen Millward\u2019s doodly cover drawing that the bugs in question will be winsome cuties and not those things that bite and swarm and ruin your plantings. This garden may be wild, but its function is recreational.There\u2019s a bee, a horsefly, a butterfly, a couple of ants, a worm and more, but they\u2019re really toddlers in a playground: They swing on a gate, try to get a peach down from a tree, float a makeshift boat on a pond. Compactly told in short lines, these pieces are part beginning-reader stories and part poetry. In spirit they remind me of Arnold Lobel\u2019s wonderful Frog and Toad books. I loved the nine-line-long episode in which Bee sits on a branch, watching clouds, rejecting the others\u2019 suggested activities. \u201cWhat do you want to do, then?\u201d they ask, allowing the final line to be \u201c\u200a\u2018Just be,\u2019 said Bee.\u201dThe stories aren\u2019t all successful \u2014 some stray too far from reality (when friends gather to watch flowers explode into bloom, it\u2019s like fireworks, but flowers don\u2019t do that). Yet even when flawed, these tales carry a sense of purpose, of meaning more than what\u2019s apparent. At their best they feel like little puffs of wisdom.Millward\u2019s watercolor, ink and pencil drawings highlight the stories\u2019 whimsy; her google-eyed characters and obsessive, scribbly vegetation add up to a rousing expression of cheer. In the profusion of leaves and flowers, there\u2019s a missed opportunity to reward close viewers with amusing details, but maybe next time. It all looks great, anyway, particularly considering that her color palette consists largely of light greens and bright oranges, hues that standard printing inks can never reproduce with full vibrancy.While all three of these books celebrate the stirring of life in some way, they represent about the widest variety of garden experiences I can imagine. Put together, they spell out the true meaning of garden variety.THE NIGHT GARDENERWritten and illustrated by Terry Fan and Eric Fan42 pp. Simon & Schuster. $17.99.

{"Headline": "Apple Is Rolling Up Backers in iPhone Privacy Fight Against F.B.I.", "Date": "2016-03-03", "News": "Supported byThe extraordinary show of support for Apple from the tech companies, including many rivals, underscores how high the stakes are for the industry with the case, in which the authorities are demanding Apple\u2019s help to break into an iPhone used by a gunman in a terrorist attack in San Bernardino, Calif., last year.In all, around 40 companies and organizations, along with several dozen individuals, submitted more than a dozen briefs this week to the Federal District Court for the District of Central California, challenging every legal facet of the government\u2019s case, like its free speech implications, the importance of encryption and concerns about government overreach.\u201cThese companies, which are often fierce competitors, have joined together to voice concern about the attempted government overreach in this case, which threatens the integrity and security of their products and privacy rights of consumers in general,\u201d said Neal Katyal, a lawyer at Hogan Lovells for the tech companies and a former acting solicitor general of the United States.Edward J. McAndrew, a lawyer at Ballard Spahr who is not involved in the Apple matter, said it was highly unusual to see a flood of briefs by so many parties this early in a case. He called the outpouring \u201cSupreme Court-level advocacy\u201d and said the campaign was intended to have influence beyond the court with legislators and others.\u201cThis is a show of force,\u201d said Mr. McAndrew, a former federal prosecutor who focused on online crimes. \u201cThis is a battle for public opinion.\u201dBruce Sewell, Apple\u2019s general counsel, said on Wednesday that the company was \u201chumbled by the outpouring of support.\u201dA group of Internet companies submitted this court brief supporting Apple in the case in which the government is seeking Apple\u2019s help to break into an iPhone used by a gunman in the San Bernardino terrorist attack.In the brief on Thursday from Amazon, Microsoft and others, the tech companies said they shared the public\u2019s outrage over the \u201cheinous act of terrorism\u201d in San Bernardino, but said they were united in the view that the government\u2019s case exceeded the boundaries of existing law and would hurt Americans\u2019 security.In the filing from the group that includes Twitter and LinkedIn, the companies said the government \u201cseeks unbounded authority to compel Apple to design software that does not currently exist and that will circumvent and undermine security measures intended to protect its users\u2019 data.\u201d\u201cWe\u2019re facing a very big question as a country, industry and a world about what privacy will look like in the digital era,\u201d said Aaron Levie, the chief executive of the data storage company Box, which signed on to the brief with Amazon, Google and others. \u201cThere is a global impact for these tech companies if we don\u2019t land on the right side of having a strong framework for how companies deal with security and these kinds of requests in the digital age.\u201dApart from the tech companies, seven prominent security experts and 32 law professors signed on to joint briefs on Thursday. Several industry trade organizations and digital rights groups submitted their own filings this week.The technology company has been locked in a major legal battle against law enforcement officials over privacy and security.Some echoed Apple\u2019s slippery slope argument that opening up one iPhone would lead to a domino effect from governments worldwide. The Media Institute, a nonprofit research foundation that focuses on communications policy, warned in its filing that the court\u2019s order could be \u201cbe applied against media companies as government authorities seek to acquire access to confidential information stored on mobile devices used by journalists.\u201dThe support for Apple was a torrent compared with the stream of filings backing the Justice Department in the case. Among the staunchest supporters on the side of government were six people whose family members were killed in the California attack.\u201cBroader questions about the fate of smartphone encryption and data privacy can be saved for another day and another forum,\u201d the families wrote in a brief. \u201cThis case certainly presents the conditions \u2014 a mass murder by terrorists implicating national security interest \u2014 where requiring Apple\u2019s technical assistance is at its apex.\u201dStephen G. Larson, the lawyer representing the victims\u2019 families, said he was frustrated that Apple was drawing a line in the sand \u201cover a phone that didn\u2019t even belong to the terrorist and that they have permission to unlock.\u201d The iPhone of the San Bernardino attacker, Syed Rizwan Farook, was issued by his employer.\u201cSo many of Apple\u2019s arguments are red herrings because this is not about privacy more than any other search in a criminal investigation is about privacy,\u201d Mr. Larson said. \u201cThat is scaremongering and that is false.\u201dA handful of law enforcement groups also filed briefs supporting the government\u2019s position, including a joint one from the Federal Law Enforcement Officers Association, the Association of Prosecuting Attorneys and the National Sheriffs\u2019 Association.Those groups listed several instances when iPhone data was an essential piece of a criminal case, including child pornography and sex trafficking cases. They argued that criminals were moving to iPhones because of Apple\u2019s refusal to help the government and that the company was making data extraction from its products impossible.\u201cIf Apple can refuse lawful court orders to reasonably assist law enforcement, public safety will suffer,\u201d the trade groups wrote.Not all family members of San Bernardino victims sided with the government. This week, Salihin Kondoker, whose wife, Anies, was shot three times but survived the attack, wrote a letter to the court saying he thought there was little valuable information on the iPhone used by the gunman.

Schoen, who was appointed a temporary deputy marriage commissioner by Santa Clara County.The bride, 30, is taking her husband\u2019s name. She works at Alphabet in Mountain View, Calif., where she is a product-marketing manager for its broadband Internet and television unit known as Google Fiber. She graduated cum laude from the University of Pennsylvania and received an M.B.A. from Harvard.She is the daughter of Diana Stetsovsky and Vladimir Stetsovsky of Princeton, N.J. The bride\u2019s father is a senior consultant at Chilworth Technology, a company in Princeton that provides process safety management, training and consulting services to industries such as pharmaceuticals, food, and oil and gas. These services are intended to prevent fires and explosions that could potentially result from the processing of chemicals and other substances. Her mother, who works from Princeton, analyzes health care data for Truven Health Analytics, a health care company with headquarters in Ann Arbor, Mich.The groom, 31, is studying for a law degree and an M.B.A. at Stanford, from which he graduated. He also received a master\u2019s degree, with honors, in diplomacy from Norwich University in Northfield, Vt. He was in the Air Force from 2006 to 2014, having served in Afghanistan and achieved the rank of captain. He was last stationed at the Royal Air Force station near Mildenhall, England.He is the son of John E. Hamilton of Oklahoma City and the late Pamala V. List, who lived in Mount Airy, Md., and the stepson of Leonard L. List, also of Mount Airy. The groom\u2019s mother was the director of budget formulation, control and policy staff at the Environmental Protection Agency in Washington. His father retired as a program manager at Tinker Air Force Base in Oklahoma City.The groom\u2019s stepfather retired as a colonel in the Air Force.Ms. Stetsovskaya met Mr. Hamilton \u2014 then Captain Hamilton \u2014 in September 2012, when he made a surprise entrance at a house party in San Francisco given by mutual friends. The England-based airman was quickly mobbed by most of the house guests the moment he arrived.Ms. Stetsovskaya, wondering what all the fuss was about, soon approached the celebrated guest.\u201cWhy does everyone love you so much?\u201d she asked him.Three hours later, they were still enjoying their first conversation.\u201cHe was a very intelligent, well-traveled person who was so easy to talk to,\u201d Ms. Stetsovskaya said.\u201cShe was this beautiful, amazing woman with a sharp sense of humor,\u201d Mr. Hamilton said.They exchanged contact information, and though Ms. Stetsovskaya went to bed that night feeling that a potential relationship \u201cseemed daunting, given the fact that we lived in two different countries,\u201d she awoke to find that Mr. Hamilton was texting her from an airport runway.They kept in touch, and when Mr. Hamilton returned to San Francisco the following month to attend a friend\u2019s wedding, he took along Ms. Stetsovskaya on what became their first official date. After the wedding, they drove to a beach in Sonoma County for an early-morning stroll and a conversation about their future.\u201cWe were determined to try and make it work,\u201d Mr. Hamilton said.On New Year\u2019s Day, 2013, they got together for a second date in Pasadena, Calif., where they watched Stanford beat Wisconsin in the Rose Bowl.The following year, Ms. Stetsovskaya became an even bigger fan of Stanford, as Mr. Hamilton enrolled there as a graduate student, erasing the great distance between them.\u201cI felt extremely fortunate and very lucky,\u201d she said. \u201cAs far as our relationship was concerned, it was a big relief.\u201dMr. Hamilton, who had been planning to leave the Air Force to continue his education, was feeling much the same.\u201cAt long last I was able to be in the same place with the woman I loved,\u201d he said.In 2015, on Valentine's Day, they were strolling on the beach where they had gone on their first date, when Ms. Stetsovskaya came across roses that were strategically positioned in the sand to spell out the words \u201cWill You Marry Me?\u201d\u201cI just started crying,\u201d she said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Apple\u2019s Modest Product Upgrades Take Back Seat to Worries on iPhone Encryption", "Date": "2016-03-21", "News": "Supported byCUPERTINO, Calif. \u2014 Apple held one of its regular product showcases on Monday, but this time the products did not take center stage.In a news conference at Apple\u2019s Cupertino, Calif., headquarters, Mr. Cook stressed that the company would stand fast. \u201cWe need to decide as a nation how much power the government should have over our data and over our privacy,\u201d Mr. Cook said. \u201cThis is an issue that impacts all of us, and we will not shrink from this responsibility.\u201dHe said that Apple believed it had an obligation to help protect its users\u2019 data. That belief eventually prompted Apple to fight the Justice Department\u2019s demand to help the government crack the encryption on the iPhone used by a terrorist in last year\u2019s California attack.Compared to that high-stakes contest \u2014 which has broad implications for the technology industry, consumers and law enforcement \u2014 Apple\u2019s new products were small ball.The company introduced smaller versions of its flagship iPhone and iPad devices, hoping to eke out more sales growth by filling gaps in its product lineup.The new devices, the iPhone SE and a 9.7-inch iPad Pro, represent a return to the form factors that prevailed before Apple supersized its smartphones in 2014 and added the large, business-oriented iPad Pro last year.\u201cIt\u2019s clear that there is still some subset of the iPhone population that prefers a smaller phone,\u201d said Jan Dawson, chief analyst of Jackdaw Research, an independent consulting firm.Greg Joswiak, an Apple executive, said on stage that the company sold more than 30 million four-inch iPhones last year, and many iPhone users have been begging the company to update its phones of that size.So Apple upgraded the components of its new four-inch phone to largely match the speed and features of its flagship iPhone 6s, but at a lower price, starting at $399.Apple, which has a higher market value than any other company, is now so big that it is difficult for the company to come up with new products to drive a new wave of purchases. Its premium pricing \u2014 its larger phones typically run $650 or more \u2014 has also left it vulnerable to cheaper handsets that run on Google\u2019s Android software.In Apple\u2019s first fiscal quarter, which ended on Dec. 26, its revenue grew just 2 percent, and the company has offered a cautious forecast for the year.The lack of must-have new features in Apple\u2019s recent products has hurt sales growth, as many customers decided their older models were good enough and postponed upgrades, Mr. Dawson said.\u201cIn a way, you see both devices that Apple is launching on Monday as drivers of an upgrade cycle,\u201d he said.Apple certainly hopes that fans of its four-inch phones will upgrade to the new iPhone SE, which packs a faster computer chip, a better camera, and Apple\u2019s Touch ID and payment technology into the same four-inch case as the aging iPhone 5S.The new 9.7-inch iPad Pro brings some of the features of last year\u2019s 12.9-inch iPad Pro, including a stylus, a keyboard and four speakers, to a tablet the size of the consumer-oriented 9.7-inch iPad Air 2. The new Pro will start at $599, and Apple also cut the price of the Air 2 by $100 to start at $399.The iPad Pros are particularly aimed at the hundreds of millions of users of old personal computers that run Microsoft Windows who might be looking to replace them, said Philip Schiller, Apple\u2019s senior vice president of worldwide marketing.Apple also reduced the price of the Apple Watch by $50, to $299, and introduced new woven nylon wristbands for the device. More than one-third of Watch owners have more than one band, Mr. Cook said.Analysts say sales have been modest for the watch, which works as a companion to the iPhone. The price cut might encourage more people to give it a try. But Apple also acknowledges that the smartwatch category is in its infancy and it may take several more generations of the device before it really catches on.Apple also touted the iPhone\u2019s potential usefulness in medical research and personal medical monitoring. It introduced new software on Monday to help developers create apps for both purposes, showcasing as an example a large project to study people with Parkinson\u2019s disease.Even then, Apple stressed its commitment to protecting customer data, saying that any sharing of health information would require a customer\u2019s explicit permission.\u201cNothing is more sensitive than your health data,\u201d said Jeff Williams, Apple\u2019s chief operating officer.An article on Tuesday about the introduction of several new Apple products misstated the price reduction for the Apple Watch. It is $50, not $100.Advertisement"}

They are eschewing it completely: sharing zero voluntary personal information on the web.\u201cWe are betraying things about our location and social relationships,\u201d said Mr. Flanery, 40. \u201cEven if it may only be used for corporations to sell us stuff, then that\u2019s also assuming that the corporations collecting that data aren\u2019t moving toward a different emphasis \u2014 that they\u2019re only engaged in a kind of selling, rather than something that is a government by proxy.\u201dAs for the genuine, not-by-proxy government, our fears about its intrusion \u2014 which reached their zenith after Edward Snowden\u2019s revelations about National Security Agency practices in 2013 \u2014 may have diverted attention from purely corporate oversight of our online habits. We are so focused on casting the N.S.A. as a modern-day Stasi that we have become less suspicious of Facebook, Twitter and the like, except when news articles crop up about their collaboration with the government.With the phrase \u201cvulnerable attack surface to the world,\u201d the Reddit user suggested another problem beyond Orwellian surveillance: We are now one another\u2019s Big Brother. Social media accounts further expose oneself to hackers or, via a single tone-deaf misstep, a global public shaming.Yet even outside of these obviously dangerous waters, releasing an identity into the digital world remains discomfiting to some. Once your data is online, it no longer belongs wholly to you; subject to reposting and comments, the data you generate gets tossed into the Internet\u2019s melting pot.Not only can information circulate beyond intended recipients, but people like Isabel Howe, 33, the executive director of the Authors League Fund in New York, find the one-size-fits-all approach to social networks too unwieldy for their personalities. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t call myself a secretive person,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I do want the freedom to vary my level of self-exposure according to circumstance.\u201dOne can, of course, activate stringent privacy measures, set up alternative accounts for specific relationships (like one that excludes co-workers) or not post anything and simply \u201clurk.\u201d But that\u2019s a headache, and not foolproof; another user can still tag or refer to your avatar in a way that feels more invasive than merely naming you.\u201cIt was making me hate everyone,\u201d Ms. Moshfegh, who closed her Facebook and Twitter accounts before her book came out, said in a phone interview.\u201cI don\u2019t know anybody who comes across in any kind of positive way on social media,\u201d she said. \u201cIt made me feel bad, like there was a standard for living that I didn\u2019t even know about, and that I hated so much that, if I ever had to be in touch with that standard, I was going to kill somebody.\u201dThe blatant desire for recognition is what most irritated her. \u201cIt seemed like everybody wants to be a celebrity,\u201d Ms. Moshfegh said. \u201cAs soon as anybody started to know who I was, being on Facebook was so incredibly tacky.\u201dMs. Moshfegh, though, pointed to some of the pitfalls of being an active social networker. \u201cI remember putting in my name to see what people were saying on Twitter about me a lot, and occasionally finding something negative and being really upset by it,\u201d she said.And not being on social media can, in fact, yield brand-building benefits, especially for an artist.As hoi polloi shamelessly promote themselves, bestow disingenuous praise upon colleagues in hopes of receiving it in return and peck out snarkily hashtagged jokes during awards shows, the person who remains offline accrues mystique and is viewed as nobly intentioned, an elusive object of fascination rather than an accessible subject of self-glorification. Who knows how they\u2019re spending their time? Likely working hard for some transcendent and paradigm-shifting purpose, their online absence suggests.But post a tweet, and everyone knows what you\u2019re doing at that moment: idly looking at a screen, chasing after notice.Advertisement"}

(It\u2019s a plot that only makes sense pre-Google Earth.) The man running the scheme, Trudy\u2019s current lover (Bill Sage), is a \u201960s holdout whose doctrinaire radicalism clashes with Hap\u2019s more principled idealism, a thread that lends the show some Altmanesque flavor and a general air of melancholy and defeat.Between trips into the forest and swamp in search of the abandoned bridge, the running time is filled out with flashbacks to Hap\u2019s and Leonard\u2019s childhoods and a subplot about a pair of spree killers, one of whom is a towering disco queen in a white breastplate and ripped spandex.

{"Headline": "Facebook Faces German Antitrust Investigation", "Date": "2016-03-02", "News": "Supported byBRUSSELS \u2014 Facebook became the latest American technology company on Wednesday to face antitrust hurdles in Europe after the German competition authority opened an investigation into whether the company has abused its dominant position in social networking.The move puts Facebook, which is used by many of Europe\u2019s 500 million citizens, alongside other United States technology companies, like Google and Microsoft, which have also faced antitrust investigations into their activities across the region.European officials have taken a tough stance on how American tech giants operate across the 28-member bloc, as many politicians here remain concerned that these companies often dominate many aspects of people\u2019s digital lives, including social networking, online search and e-commerce.As part of the new investigation, German authorities said they were looking into whether Facebook misused its position to collect people\u2019s digital information. That included complicated terms and conditions that individuals had to sign to use the social network, and whether such contracts placed unfair constraints on the company\u2019s users.In response, Facebook said it was confident that it had complied with German law.\u201cWe look forward to working with the Federal Cartel Office to answer their questions,\u201d the company said in a statement.While the German investigation will look into Facebook\u2019s digital practices, it remains unclear whether other European policy makers \u2014 including at the European Commission, the executive arm of the European Union \u2014 will also open antitrust inquiries into the social network.The biggest American tech companies face intensifying scrutiny by European regulators, with \u2014 pressure that could potentially curb their sizable profits in the region and affect how they operate around the world.Several national privacy regulators are looking into how the social network collects data on both its users and those who are not signed up for its online services.Facebook was also at the center of a successful legal challenge in Europe\u2019s highest court over how data was transferred between the European Union and the United States. That led to senior European judges invalidating the so-called safe harbor data-transfer agreement between the two regions, increasing uncertainty over how companies like Facebook could move data across the Atlantic.In an acknowledgment of the growing regulatory challenges now confronting Facebook in Europe, Mark Zuckerberg, the company\u2019s 31-year-old chief executive, traveled to Germany last month to meet with policy makers, local publishers and the company\u2019s users.For Facebook, whose business model is based on selling advertisements targeted at users based on information in their posts, the company\u2019s use of people\u2019s digital data is increasingly putting it at odds with Europe\u2019s tough data protection rules, which view individuals\u2019 privacy rights on a par with rights such as the freedom of expression.European competition authorities are also increasingly looking at how companies like Facebook may hold a dominant position over people\u2019s digital information, which may give them an unfair advantage over rivals.This year, for example, Margrethe Vestager, the European competition commissioner, said the collection of a vast amount of users\u2019 data by a small number of tech companies like Google and Facebook could violate of the region\u2019s tough competition rules.\u201cIf a few companies control the data you need to cut costs, then you give them the power to drive others out of the market,\u201d Ms. Vestager said.\u201cIt\u2019s a business transaction, not a free giveaway,\u201d she added, referring to companies\u2019 use of people\u2019s digital data. \u201cAs consumers, we need to be treated fairly.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Hidden Price of Mindfulness Inc.", "Date": "2016-03-19", "News": "Supported byNews AnalysisTHE other morning, I woke up and brewed a cup of Mindful Lotus tea ($6 for 20 bags). On the subway, I loaded the Headspace app on my iPhone and followed a guided mindfulness exercise ($13 a month for premium content). Later in the day, I dropped by Mndfl, a meditation studio in Greenwich Village ($20 for a 45-minute class).Consumer offerings are prolific, too. There are more than two dozen mindfulness apps for smartphones, some offering $400 lifetime subscriptions. The Great Courses has two mindfulness packages, each with a couple of dozen DVDs for $250. For an enterprising contemplative, it\u2019s never been easier to make a buck.On the face of it, that should be good news all around. After all, where\u2019s the harm in having folks slow down, get in touch with their feelings and be kind? As a sporadic meditator myself, I know firsthand that mindfulness can relieve stress, improve focus and promote well-being. And during this charged election season, couldn\u2019t we all use a bit more peace, love and understanding?But with so many cashing in on the meditation craze, it\u2019s hard not to wonder whether something essential is being lost. If mindfulness can be bought as easily as a pair of Lululemon yoga pants, can it truly be a transformative practice that eases the troubled mind? It\u2019s a question as slippery as a Zen koan.There\u2019s no doubt that as mindfulness has gone mainstream, plenty of people have used the technique to achieve peace of mind, greater self-awareness, perhaps even more compassion. Yet at the same time, a race to the bottom seems to be underway.Never mind all the companies glomming on to the \u201cmindful\u201d moniker. (There are Mindful Meats, Mindful Mints and the Mindful Supply Company, which makes T-shirts. A friend recently painted her daughter\u2019s bedroom \u201cMindful Gray.\u201d) More troubling is the rush to make mindfulness something that fits neatly into lives lived at the speed of the web.Increasingly, mindfulness is being packaged as a one-minute reprieve, an interlude between checking Instagram and starting the next episode of \u201cHouse of Cards.\u201d One company proclaims it has found the \u201cminimum effective dose\u201d of meditation that will change your life. On Amazon, you can pick up \u201cOne-Minute Mindfulness: 50 Simple Ways to Find Peace, Clarity, and New Possibilities in a Stressed-Out World.\u201d Dubious courses promise to help people \u201cmaster mindfulness\u201d in a few weeks.IBISWorld, a research company, estimates that meditation-related businesses in the United States last year generated $984 million in revenue. With so many mindful goods and services for sale, it can be easy to forget that mindfulness is a quality of being, not a piece of merchandise.\u201cIt\u2019s not enough to purchase the right product to be mindful,\u201d said Dan Harris, an ABC news anchor who chronicled his grudging embrace of meditation in a book, \u201c10 Percent Happier.\u201d \u201cMindfulness is a practice, and it\u2019s worth doing.\u201dThat is, you can\u2019t simply buy mindfulness. In its historical context, mindfulness is just one aspect of a lifelong journey to become more accepting, less judgmental and kinder to oneself and others. Even in its modern incarnation, mindfulness is best understood as a skill, one acquired through hours of sometimes uncomfortable contemplation.Alas, that may be asking too much in an age of crash diets and instant abs.\u201cNo one gets to decide who can sell mindfulness, or use mindfulness to sell a product,\u201d said Ms. Quistgaard.Though this may result in less signal and more noise, it doesn\u2019t mean mindfulness can\u2019t still be beneficial. Yoga may have changed over the years, but plenty of authentic teachers and ashrams can still be found. The same dynamic will most likely play out with mindfulness, too. Strange variations on mindfulness will proliferate, while pockets of traditional teachings endure.Even seemingly superficial interventions can be useful, or at least benign. Joe Burton, chief executive of Whil, which offers a popular meditation app, is adamant that just because mindfulness is streaming online at ever-higher price points, that doesn\u2019t make it ineffective or inauthentic. \u201cNo one can come do our training being a greedy, selfish jerk and expect to become a better greedy, selfish jerk,\u201d he said.More often than not, however, the people I know who take time to meditate \u2014 carefully observing thoughts, emotions and sensations \u2014 are sincere in their aspirations to become less stressed, more accepting and at least a little happier.I paid for both and headed for the exit. There\u2019s nothing wrong with buying products labeled mindful. We live in a consumerist culture, and I\u2019d rather spend my money on health food and self-help guides than junk food and gossip rags.But when I got home, I resolved to do more than simply support mindfulness with my wallet. I found a quiet moment, put away my iPhone, and closed my eyes to meditate. It\u2019s not enough to buy into mindfulness. You have to practice it, too.A news analysis on March 20 about mindfulness misstated the rate for a meditation class at Mndfl, aNew York studio.

Today, Amazon, now a retail giant, remains obsessed with this issue, building its own fleet of drones, buying trailers for trucks and signing up drivers for on-demand deliveries.And nowhere is the company\u2019s push to become a logistics and delivery powerhouse more evident than here in the nation\u2019s capital. Amazon has emerged as one of the tech industry\u2019s most outspoken players in Washington, spending millions on this effort and meeting regularly with lawmakers and regulators.Amazon has pushed officials to allow new uses for commercial drones, to extend the maximum length of trucks, to improve roads and bridges and to prop up a delivery partner, the United States Postal Service.The efforts are mostly in the early stages, but Amazon already has detractors, particularly for its drone efforts. Some drone makers argue that Amazon is pushing too hard, too fast. And airline and pilots groups have said opening the skies to more commercial drones, which are remote-controlled flying machines, could create safety risks.\u201cAmazon is disrupting huge industries; retail was a start, then the enterprise market with its cloud platform and now transportation logistics,\u201d said Colin Sebastian, a senior analyst at Robert W. Baird. \u201cThis is Jeff Bezos\u2019s playbook, and achieving it by influencing legislation would be consistent with that plan.\u201dThe money Amazon spent on lobbying in 2015 nearly doubled, to $9.4 million, compared with the year before, which helped to pay a bigger lobbying staff and pay for a new office to house them. The tally, compiled from public records by the Center for Responsive Politics, includes only the spending that Amazon must legally disclose.Amazon\u2019s figure still lags those of some companies that made camp in Washington long ago, like Boeing, which spent about $21 million in 2015. And it trails the leading tech lobbyist, Alphabet, Google\u2019s parent, by several million. But Amazon\u2019s spending grew at a faster pace than any other big tech company\u2019s.Amazon and Mr. Bezos, its chief executive, have other interests in Washington, too. Amazon is now a major government contractor with a $600 million cloud computing partnership with the C.I.A. And Mr. Bezos\u2019s ownership of The Washington Post, which he bought in 2013, gives him a foothold in the political and media circles of Washington.Amazon declined requests to comment for this article. But on a recent earnings call, Amazon\u2019s chief financial officer, Brian Olsavsky, explained why Amazon wanted to move more aggressively into delivery.\u201cTo properly serve our customers at peak, we\u2019ve needed to add more of our own logistics to supplement our existing partners,\u201d Mr. Olsavsky said. \u201cThat\u2019s not meant to replace them.\u201dIn addition, the company\u2019s shipping costs rose 19 percent, to $5 billion, in 2015. The millions of members of its Prime annual subscription service, Amazon\u2019s most frequent customers, have helped feed the surge. Those customers receive free shipping for many products.Some analysts expect Amazon eventually to take over its entire logistics chain \u2014 in some cases, from factory to doorstep. Just this month, Amazon signed a deal to lease 20 Boeing cargo planes.A few analysts got excited when Amazon referred to itself as a \u201ctransportation service provider\u201d in a recent regulatory filing. The company, they suggested, could even become a competitor to UPS and FedEx.Mr. Olsavsky insisted on the call that UPS and FedEx would continue to be important partners. FedEx\u2019s chief executive, Fred Smith, also played down the possibility of Amazon becoming a rival. In a call with analysts and investors last week, he criticized \u201cfantastical\u201d reports about Amazon\u2019s challenge to logistics companies.Satish Jindel, founder of the SJ Consulting Group, which advises transportation and logistics firms, said, \u201cIf my package doesn\u2019t get delivered to my expectations, most people don\u2019t think of FedEx or UPS.\u201d He added, \u201cThey think of the retailer, so Amazon is getting into drones and delivery to enhance the customer experience and have a bigger influence over the customer.\u201dAmazon has also urged Congress to adopt rules that would allow the retailer to fly drones beyond a pilot\u2019s line of sight, a crucial hurdle to Amazon\u2019s goal of operating drones from its warehouses. This effort is expected to face an important test soon. This month, the Senate Transportation Committee drafted a bill that would ensure rules for delivery drones within two years.Airline and pilot groups have resisted many of Amazon\u2019s proposed changes.\u201cThe chances of a collision will go way up when you have more unmanned aircraft up,\u201d said Chris Dancy, a spokesman for the Helicopter Association International, a trade group.Some drone makers said in interviews that Amazon\u2019s bold statements may be generating too much public angst, helping the safety advocates.He also urged the approval of legislation that aims to improve roads, bridges and railways. The bill was passed by Congress and signed into law in December.\u201cThe private sector cannot make all the necessary improvements\u201d in transportation, Mr. Misener said in July during a Senate hearing, a message that he has repeated to members of Congress. \u201cGovernment needs to keep up.\u201dAmazon has backed a proposal for 33-foot twin-trailer trucks, vehicles that would extend the current legal length of trucks by several feet; opponents say longer trucks could make roads more dangerous for other drivers.\u201cThe 33-foot trucks are going to be safer,\u201d Mr. Misener said last July, \u201cbecause there will be fewer of them on the road, driving fewer miles.\u201dThe proposal has been met with resistance from Ralph Nader, a longtime consumer advocate. He said he wrote Mr. Bezos, asking Amazon to stop its support of these trucks for safety reasons. He said Mr. Bezos never responded. The proposal was rejected last year as part of a broader transportation bill.\u201cDrones and longer trucks, what are all these efforts for?\u201d Mr. Nader said in an interview. \u201cTo get you your toothpaste faster?\u201dDoris Burke contributed research.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Top Experts Confounded by Advisers to Donald Trump", "Date": "2016-03-22", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 When Donald J. Trump finally began to reveal the names of his foreign policy advisers during a swing through Washington this week, the Republican foreign policy establishment looked at them and had a pretty universal reaction: Who?Many foreign policy experts have been wondering for months about who might be counseling the leading Republican presidential candidate, who has unfurled such provocative proposals as reinstating waterboarding and barring foreign Muslims from entering the country.Mr. Trump has promised to hire the world\u2019s brightest minds to make up for his lack of political experience, but his new foreign policy team left some of the country\u2019s leading experts in the field scratching their heads as they tried to identify his choices. And on a day when the Islamic State struck a blow to a major European capital, Mr. Trump\u2019s new team faced additional scrutiny.While most presidential campaigns have been offering lists of their high-profile advisers, Mr. Trump had repeatedly declined to reveal his, offering only that he developed his views about world affairs from listening to experts on television, and that he liked to come up with his own ideas. The rest are remaining low profile. There was no record of employment for Mr. Kellogg, a retired Army lieutenant general who helped run the coalition provisional authority in Iraq from 2003 to 2004. He most recently worked for a defense contractor that had no information on his whereabouts.And others could say little about how they were helping Mr. Trump. None have spoken to their new boss.Mr. Page, a managing partner at Global Energy Capital, who will be advising Mr. Trump on energy policy and Russia, said that he had just been sending policy memos to the Trump campaign and that the details of his role remained unclear. Mr. Page did not comment when asked if he supported Mr. Trump\u2019s views on torture or the moratorium on Muslim immigration.Some foreign policy experts have been wary about joining Mr. Trump out of concern that they will have to answer for controversial policies that he sometimes seems to develop on the fly. Although there is potential upside to signing up with a candidate who is on the rise, there are also risks to reputation.Peter D. Feaver, a political science professor at Duke University, signed a letter from top Republican national security leaders objecting to Mr. Trump earlier this month and said he was confounded by the advisers that the candidate ultimately came up with.\u201cI think that normally, the front-runner for a Republican presidential campaign, by March of the campaign year, has assembled a team that is more distinguished than this,\u201d said Dr. Feaver, who was a national security adviser in the George W. Bush and Bill Clinton administrations. \u201cI think this suggests that he might be straining to assemble a list.\u201dDr. Feaver said that while he had heard of Mr. Phares and Mr. Schmitz, who was an inspector general of the Defense Department during Mr. Bush\u2019s administration, the assortment of backgrounds did not have a coherent theme.Also curious was the fact that Mr. Trump would choose two people who played active roles in the Iraq war. Mr. Trump regularly tells voters that he was against the war, and he has accused Mr. Bush of lying about the presence of weapons of mass destruction in Iraq.Despite questions about the team, the Trump campaign contends that this is just the beginning of a hiring spree. Sam Clovis, a senior policy adviser to Mr. Trump, said new hires were being briefed on Mr. Trump\u2019s foreign policy positions and were asked to be sure that they felt comfortable with where he stood.Mr. Clovis also pushed back against the idea that it had been hard for Mr. Trump to find good help and said the campaign had been looking for people with \u201creal world\u201d and military experience as opposed to retreads that other candidates relied on.\u201cThese are people who work for a living,\u201d Mr. Clovis said. \u201cIf you\u2019re looking for show ponies, you\u2019re coming to the wrong stable.\u201dDavid E. Sanger contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "With Cruz Up, Rubio Down, Where Does That Leave Donald Trump?", "Date": "2016-03-07", "News": "Supported byThe 2016 RaceThere was a big shift in the Republican race over the last few days: Ted Cruz surged, almost entirely at Marco Rubio\u2019s expense.The Cruz surge was the clearest sign yet that Donald Trump might indeed be at a disadvantage in a one-on-one race. Viewed that way, Saturday was a bad night for Mr. Trump. Not only did the primaries and caucuses that day suggest he could lose if the field dwindled to one opponent, but the results also probably made a one-on-one race more likely by elevating Mr. Cruz at Mr. Rubio\u2019s expense.But not all is gloomy for Mr. Trump. The results made it likelier that he would face a candidate, Mr. Cruz, with serious limitations in the blue states that dominate the second half of the primary season. Mr. Cruz still seems to lack the potential for broader appeal that Mr. Rubio, despite his struggles, had shown signs of having.The weekend\u2019s results also made it more likely that Mr. Trump would claim Florida\u2019s 99 delegates, potentially the biggest delegate prize of the primary season. Cruz\u2019s Super SaturdayMr. Trump didn\u2019t fare much worse than expected. But Mr. Cruz, by consolidating conservative voters, nearly overtook him in Louisiana and Kentucky, states that should have been two of Mr. Trump\u2019s strongest. Mr. Cruz won Maine, another state where Mr. Trump was favored, and he won Kansas in a landslide.Mr. Cruz\u2019s gains appeared to come almost entirely at the expense of Mr. Rubio. The four contests all now count among his six worst of the season. Mr. Rubio was a lot closer to John Kasich than to Mr. Cruz.This was a real shift \u2014 not some weird product of the geography of the states. Mr. Rubio fared far worse than one would have expected based on what happened on Super Tuesday, while Mr. Cruz did much better by an almost equal amount.The shift is perhaps clearest in the early vote data from Louisiana. Citizens in that state were allowed to vote early, an option that ended on Feb. 27. That early vote looked a lot like the Super Tuesday vote, with Mr. Rubio earning 20 percent and Mr. Cruz earning 23 percent.But the Election Day vote broke overwhelmingly for Mr. Cruz, who won 41 percent of the Election Day vote to just 9.6 percent for Mr. Rubio.Some of the change between early voting and Election Day could have been caused by differences in the compositions of the two voting blocs. But it\u2019s more likely that it reflects a broader shift \u2014 especially given the results elsewhere.Looking back, the debate on Thursday seems like the best explanation for the abrupt shift toward Mr. Cruz among conservative voters. As my colleague Justin Wolfers and others noted, Google search data showed Mr. Rubio\u2019s advantage over Mr. Kasich and Mr. Cruz slipping after the debate. The data has often been an indicator of shifts in the Republican race this year.The Bad News for TrumpThe weakening of Mr. Rubio and the surge of Mr. Cruz lower Mr. Trump\u2019s odds of earning a majority of delegates, at least compared with the four-way race heading out of Super Tuesday. That was basically the best-case scenario for Mr. Trump. He would have been a big favorite to amass a majority of delegates against such a divided field.The results Saturday suggested that Mr. Trump might not benefit from such a divided field for too much longer, if one of two things happens: Either Mr. Cruz claims a broader share of the \u201canti-Trump\u201d vote, or Mr. Rubio and Mr. Kasich are soon forced out of the race.Both possibilities point toward a harder time for Mr. Trump. The results were consistent with the long-held theory that Mr. Trump has a ceiling on his support. He failed to do any better than one would have projected from his showing on Super Tuesday, despite his wins, the collapse of one of the top candidates (Mr. Rubio) and the departure of Ben Carson.If Mr. Cruz did particularly well \u2014 say he won Arizona and California or held down Mr. Trump\u2019s margins enough in Missouri, Pennsylvania, Indiana or Illinois \u2014 he could keep Mr. Trump short of a majority. And that would be true even if Mr. Trump won both Ohio and Florida on March 15. It\u2019s not easy for Mr. Cruz, but it\u2019s tougher for Mr. Trump than a continuation of the patterns from Super Tuesday.Silver Linings for TrumpMr. Trump still has two things going for him: Florida and the growing likelihood of drawing Mr. Cruz, not Mr. Rubio, as his main opponent.The Florida argument is simple enough: Saturday\u2019s results were bad news for Mr. Rubio, who\u2019s making a late and desperate play to win Florida\u2019s big delegate haul. (Only a candidate who wins California decisively can net more delegates than the 99 in Florida). A strong showing on March 15 would put Mr. Trump in a pretty good position to amass a majority of delegates by the end of the primary season, though he would have to continue to win primaries.It didn\u2019t Saturday. Look at the results in Louisville or New Orleans. Mr. Trump managed to win both because Mr. Rubio and Mr. Kasich maintained a lot more of their collective support there than elsewhere, preventing Mr. Cruz from going over the top.Mr. Trump\u2019s win in New Orleans is particularly telling. Based on the Super Tuesday results, you would have expected New Orleans to be one of Mr. Rubio\u2019s better counties in the country: a 44-to-29-percent favorite over Mr. Trump.In the end, Mr. Trump finished with about the same share of the vote as projected \u2014 he was at 31 percent \u2014 but he won as Mr. Cruz, Mr. Rubio and Mr. Kasich largely split the remaining vote.The Surprising Kasich ResultsPart of the reason Mr. Cruz failed to make inroads in areas like New Orleans, despite Mr. Rubio\u2019s weakness, was John Kasich. It was Mr. Kasich, not Mr. Cruz, who seemed to benefit most from Mr. Rubio\u2019s weakness there and in other metropolitan areas.Mr. Kasich outperformed expectations by the most in New Orleans. He won 17 percent of the vote there \u2014 and that was a showing with little or no precedent for him in the South on Super Tuesday. The only Southern metropolitan counties where Mr. Kasich even broke 10 percent on Super Tuesday were the two counties including Atlanta, Fulton and DeKalb, where Mr. Kasich won around 12.5 percent. Mr. Kasich also hit 16 percent and 22 percent in the counties that include Louisville and Lexington in Kentucky.In general, Mr. Kasich outperformed expectations by a lot on Saturday, especially for a slate of caucuses and red states. He hit 16 percent in both Kansas and Kentucky, two red-state caucuses. His previous best in a caucus was 5.7 percent (in Minnesota). His previous best in a red state was 7.6 percent in South Carolina, and that\u2019s a fairly establishment-friendly state.What does that mean? Mr. Rubio was probably under pressure on both sides, from Mr. Kasich on the left and Mr. Cruz on the right.That\u2019s a fine deal for Mr. Cruz in conservative states like Louisiana or Kentucky, but it\u2019s not going to play out nearly as well in the North. Michigan, which holds its primary Tuesday, might be the first test. If Mr. Cruz and Mr. Kasich are both eroding Mr. Rubio\u2019s support, Mr. Trump might end up winning by an even greater margin than if Mr. Rubio were stronger.But if Mr. Cruz can fight Mr. Trump to a fairly close race there, even with Mr. Rubio and Mr. Kasich still in the race, it would be a good sign for Mr. Cruz\u2019s chances of denying Mr. Trump a majority of delegates.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Ad Watch: Offering Salvation for Americans Fleeing Politics", "Date": "2016-03-10", "News": "Supported byDuring presidential election years, Americans of varying political persuasions often contemplate moving to Canada. Google queries for Canada spike. Conversations between friends turn to preferred Canadian destinations.On the surface, the website seems like a joke. \u201cMake Canada Even Greater,\u201d the introductory text reads, in a nod to a certain politician\u2019s campaign slogan. Symbols of Canada are everywhere \u2014 a moose, maple syrup, the Canadian flag, a hockey player in a jersey with a maple leaf. There\u2019s even a section on \u201cwhat to expect from your new home\u201d (\u201cCanada is big,\u201d \u201cHigh poutine diets\u201d).\u201cIt\u2019s where the zeitgeist is going,\u201d said Dianne Wilkins, the chief executive of Critical Mass. \u201cWe\u2019re in a unique place to comment on and participate in this public half-comedy, half-serious discussion that\u2019s going on out there.\u201dBut beneath the goofy website is a more serious goal: talent acquisition. Critical Mass, now a global digital agency whose clients include Nissan and Citi, is looking to hire roughly 30 people to work in its Calgary and Toronto offices.The campaign, while timely, also speaks to an underlying fear in the ad industry that talent may be slipping away. For many years, creative types who also wanted a job that paid the bills \u2014 and made their parents proud \u2014 went to advertising agencies. But competition for creative talent is much fiercer today, and agencies are seeing people go instead to companies like Facebook and Google.Critical Mass says the website is already proving successful. Traffic from the site has increased page views on its Toronto careers site by 2,310 percent and on its Calgary careers site by 244 percent, it says. Traffic to the agency\u2019s website has increased 50 percent.The website may be slightly silly, but it could also offend particularly patriotic Americans. It is also trying to capitalize on a cultural moment, which means it could feel stale once the moment passes. And because the campaign is geared more toward the advertising industry than the general public, it might not garner widespread attention.Ms. Wilkins said an employee on the agency\u2019s marketing team in Chicago had the initial idea last week after seeing a BuzzFeed post about moving to Canada after the election. By Monday, the site was live, a stunningly fast turnaround for an industry that seems at times as if it wants to debate and tweak everything ad infinitum.How did Critical Mass get the site up and running so quickly? \u201cWe\u2019re our own client,\u201d Ms. Wilkins said, \u201cwhich helps.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Facebook\u2019s Live Videos Get Lots of Looks but No Money Yet", "Date": "2016-03-30", "News": "Supported byWhen severe weather passed through the Atlanta area early this month, Brad Nitz, a meteorologist for a local television station, WSB-TV, fed viewers live video updates on the station\u2019s website, as he has done for years.But then he did something new: He turned away from the television camera and addressed an iPhone that was streaming him live \u2014 on Facebook. And the station\u2019s social media manager, Jonathan Anker, watched this new Facebook audience swell.At its peak, the stream reached 8,800 viewers at once, and the segment has been played more than 77,000 times in total, far more than the station\u2019s typical online audience.The numbers, Mr. Anker said, were \u201cseriously out of whack, in a delightful way.\u201dExperiences like this have media companies swooning over the possibilities of posting live video to Facebook, a feature made widely available two months ago. For years, companies have searched for ways to unlock three tough questions: How do you attract people to live online videos? How do you reach people on their mobile devices? And how do you get more out of Facebook\u2019s 1.6 billion users?Now, they hope, they have found a key for all three. Yet it is also raising some questions inside the companies about if \u2014 and when \u2014 they will see any meaningful money come from the push.Already, Facebook users can tune in to a daily celebrity news show produced by E!, with anchors sitting behind a broadcast-style desk. TMZ streams daily gossip updates and goes live for breaking news. Local news anchors are broadcasting live from the field and during commercial breaks, or while they apply makeup. Dr. Sanjay Gupta of CNN fielded questions about the Zika virus.\u201cThis feels like a transformative step,\u201d said Liz Heron, the executive editor of The Huffington Post, which recently restructured its video production to favor social media distribution after streaming live video through its website since 2012. \u201cIt\u2019s really the mobile piece that feels different to me.\u201dThe fascination also dovetails with interest inside Facebook itself. The feature, called Facebook Live, has largely lived under the radar so far. But it is one of the company\u2019s highest-priority projects, according to three people directly involved with the initiative, who spoke on condition of anonymity.Internally, Facebook Live is seen as a way to move beyond hosting conversations about television and live events to becoming a venue for both. Mark Zuckerberg, the company\u2019s chief executive, has made Facebook Live one of his pet projects, two of the people said, devoting significant resources and effort to the initiative. Facebook plans to announce a suite of new features and partners in early April and at F8, Facebook\u2019s developer conference in San Francisco later in the month.Facebook declined to discuss details about the announcements.The shows vary widely. Tastemade, a young food media company, streamed a live edition of its \u201cTiny Kitchen\u201d show, in which it prepared a stamp-size hamburger; Martha Stewart spent an hourlong broadcast making pretzels with Seth Meyers. In addition, Facebook has urged celebrities and athletes to use Facebook Live to interact with fans.The Huffington Post has tested live video across many of its 79 Facebook pages, with broadcasts from the campaign trail, celebrity interviews and live music events.\u201cNobody came up to me and said, \u2018you should really be using Live,\u2019\u201d said Ms. Heron, who previously worked at Facebook. \u201cI knew it was something I wanted The Huffington Post to do.\u201dMost of the questions, though, have focused on figuring out how much money the companies will get for video streams viewed on the social network. Live streaming revenue could come from advertising, subscriptions or paid one-time events.Facebook, though, has prioritized getting live video in front of as many users as possible. The company has been eager to talk with media companies about getting started with streaming, but remains vague in conversations about revenue sharing or subscription models.It is pushing a build-first, make-money-later philosophy, one that can be frustrating to media partners, particularly those struggling to navigate broader changes in the online media industry. But whatever the frustrations, they are outweighed by the prospect of reaching Facebook\u2019s huge audience.\u201cIt\u2019s early days, and as with all products at Facebook we build people-first, but we are committed to finding a sustainable monetization model for partners sharing live video on Facebook,\u201d said Fidji Simo, a director of product at Facebook. \u201cIt\u2019s something that we\u2019re thinking carefully about, and it\u2019s important to us to create something that is a good experience for people on Facebook and that works for our partners.\u201dOne of the appeals for media companies has been a sense of regaining control of Facebook\u2019s news feed, the primary source of information on the social network, where posts are sorted based on an opaque computer program. The lack of control has made reaching users \u2014 even those that follow media brands intentionally \u2014 more competitive.So far, putting video on the service can be done only by using a Facebook app on a mobile device. But Facebook is considering letting media partners broadcast live video using their own professional-grade studio recording equipment, according to two of the people with knowledge of the company\u2019s plans. The new efforts could introduce a more polished, professional set of live programming to Facebook\u2019s audiences.Facebook\u2019s ability to convene large audiences will help Live compete with Twitter\u2019s Periscope, an app that helped popularize mobile live streaming last year. Periscope has been growing briskly, the company says. But companies that have used both products say that raw viewer numbers favor Facebook.Donald Alexander, director of social media and audience development at TMZ, the gossip news site, said, \u201cwith Facebook promoting the Live platform so much, at some point I think it could take on a life of its own.\u201dMr. Alexander said TMZ was focusing on Facebook over other platforms, like Periscope. But when asked about specific discussions with Facebook regarding advertising, subscriptions and changes to the tech product, Mr. Alexander responded, \u201cI have to be honest \u2014 they\u2019re keeping it a little to themselves right now.\u201dBecause of an editing error, a picture caption on Thursday with an article about live broadcasting on Facebook misidentified the location of an interview with Wyclef Jean that was aired live by The Huffington Post. Mr. Jean was shown at the Brooklyn Bowl in Brooklyn, not at the one in Las Vegas.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Israeli Soldiers Get Lost Using Waze App, and Clashes Follow", "Date": "2016-03-01", "News": "Supported byThe soldiers, from the army\u2019s canine unit, were following Waze, a navigation app, late Monday when they drove into an area bordering the Kalandia refugee camp, between Jerusalem and Ramallah.The app is popular among Israelis, but soldiers are under standing orders not to use GPS services in areas they are not familiar with, said Lt. Col. Peter Lerner, a spokesman for the Israeli military.\u201cThey should be using maps, and they should know the route,\u201d he said.Armed, in uniform and driving a clearly identifiable military vehicle, they were quickly attacked by Palestinians, who apparently suspected that the soldiers were part of a military raid.The Palestinians hurled rocks and firebombs and set the vehicle ablaze, the military said Tuesday. The soldiers, who were on an administrative task, abandoned their vehicle and fled separately on foot.The missing soldier was eventually found in a valley between the refugee camp and a nearby Jewish settlement.When Israeli troops came to retrieve the abandoned vehicle, clashes broke out between soldiers and local Palestinians, lasting until the early hours of the morning.A 22-year-old Palestinian man, Iyad Sajadiyya, was shot and killed, according to Maan, a Palestinian news outlet. Moshe Yaalon, the Israeli defense minister, who was attending a technology conference on Tuesday, said that Mr. Sajadiyya had been armed.It was unclear why the soldiers were using Waze, a smartphone app developed in Israel and acquired by Google for more than $1 billion in 2013, to navigate in the West Bank.Waze told Agence France-Presse in a statement that the soldiers must have veered off the route suggested by the application.Waze\u2019s default setting does not provide navigation in areas of the West Bank considered dangerous for Israelis; the soldiers would have had to turn off the app\u2019s \u201csafe mode\u201d to use it around Kalandia.Colonel Lerner said that the episode was under review, and that the military wanted to know, among other things, \u201chow they ended up there and what were their orders for getting from A to B.\u201dMr. Yaalon, the defense minister, warned against relying too much on technology to navigate potentially dangerous areas. Waze, which uses crowd-sourced information from its users to suggest the best routes, \u201cdoes not take into account all of the considerations,\u201d he said.At the same time, Mr. Yaalon acknowledged that \u201cnot a small amount of technology was involved\u201d in ultimately finding the soldiers.Waze does not distinguish among the different areas of the West Bank\u2019s political map once the safe mode is disabled, making it potentially perilous for Israelis and Palestinians who rely on it inside the territory.The West Bank is a mosaic of Palestinian-ruled areas that Israelis may not enter without prior authorization, Jewish settlements where Palestinians are forbidden without permits, and Israeli military checkpoints and border crossings.Waze also tends to confuse Palestinian and Israeli areas, which often have the same, or similar, names.In June, two other Israeli soldiers who were using the app accidentally entered the Palestinian city of Tulkarm after they typed in \u201cBeit Lid,\u201d the name of a village near the Tulkarm area of the West Bank and the name of a road junction in Israel.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Aubrey McClendon Is Remembered for Ambition and Philanthropy", "Date": "2016-03-07", "News": "Supported byOKLAHOMA CITY \u2014 The diverse worlds of energy, politics and sports assembled at the Crossings Community Church here Monday to pay tribute to Aubrey McClendon, the natural gas wildcatting pioneer who helped catalyze the nation\u2019s energy revolution.Kevin Durant and other players of the Oklahoma City Thunder, the National Basketball Association team that Mr. McClendon part-owned and helped bring from Seattle, were among a few thousand guests who attended the public memorial service in a tribute marked by praises of his groundbreaking business career and his philanthropy, and music played by members of the Oklahoma City Philharmonic.Mr. McClendon, 56, was remembered as an ambitious executive, legendary even in an industry known for larger-than-life characters. He transformed a tiny oil company, Chesapeake Energy, which he co-founded in 1989, into the second-biggest gas producer in the United States after Exxon Mobil.\u201cHe changed an industry and put America on the path of being energy independent,\u201d said Tom Blalock, the chief legal officer of American Energy Partners, Mr. McClendon\u2019s latest business venture. Mr. Blalock described him as a man of great intensity, contagious curiosity, laughter \u2014 and 5 a.m. emails. \u201cThe icing on the cake was pixie dust and he had an endless supply,\u201d Mr. Blalock added in his tribute.Mr. McClendon intertwined his personal financial well-being with that of Chesapeake Energy, taking a personal stake in company wells, then using those investments as collateral for up to $1.1 billion in loans to himself. Such behavior led the activist investor Carl C. Icahn and the Chesapeake board to force him to leave the company three years ago.But at the service Monday, Mr. McClendon was remembered as a philanthropist, a booster of Oklahoma City and a man who filled his life with golf, Jet Skiing, classic rock music, red wine and steak. He was described as a man not too big to take out the garbage at the office.He developed a campus for Chesapeake here that made the company resemble an Ivy League university, complete with a gym, day care center and a dental clinic for employees. He was a champion of natural gas as a replacement for coal and an adamant defender of hydraulic fracturing to unlock oil and gas from hard rocks in Louisiana, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania and Texas.After leaving Chesapeake, he was a co-founder of American Energy Partners, which sought to spread the fracking revolution not only around the country but across Latin America and Australia.Mr. McClendon\u2019s interests were broad, including part-ownership of the Thunder and a winery in Bordeaux, France, and a $12 million antique map collection.\u201cAubrey was a renaissance man, a man for all seasons,\u201d Frank Keating, a former governor of Oklahoma, said in his tribute. Mr. Keating noted Mr. McClendon\u2019s philanthropy, citing his support of museums, theaters, the Boy Scouts and the United Way.A smaller public memorial was held early Saturday along Oklahoma City\u2019s riverfront, in a recreation area Mr. McClendon helped develop.Almost every top executive of Oklahoma\u2019s oil industry gathered at the church on Monday, mixing with many of Mr. McClendon\u2019s former employees at Chesapeake, the company that helped restore Oklahoma as a center of the global oil and natural gas business.Mr. McClendon\u2019s son Will said in his tribute that descriptions of Mr. McClendon\u2019s character as reckless were accurate. He recalled how Mr. McClendon set his pants on fire at his wife, Katie\u2019s, 50th birthday party, \u201cliterally.\u201d\u201cHe was courageous, bold and daring,\u201d Will McClendon said. \u201cHe was definitely not a Google maps kind of guy.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Survey after survey shows that millennials want to work for companies that place a premium on employee welfare, offer flexible scheduling and, above all, bestow a sense of purpose. These priorities are well known and frequently mocked, providing grist for the oft-repeated claim that millennials are lazy, entitled job-hoppers.But it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s important to remember that this generation was shaped by a recession, an unprecedented crush of student debt and a broad decline in the credibility of all kinds of institutions.

The industry has long had disdain for Washington; now, with business booming and the companies as powerful as ever, it seems to have learned how to express the disdain for political ends. Where do you think this could manifest itself next?For instance, techies have been pushing for immigration reform for years; Mark Zuckerberg made it a signature issue earlier this decade. What happened? Nothing.And of course, what Mr. Carter and the F.B.I. consider a back door is not exactly what the tech industry does.

{"Headline": "Pandora Replaces Chief, Aiming to Reinvent Itself Midstream", "Date": "2016-03-28", "News": "Supported byPandora Media became a powerhouse in online music primarily by doing one thing: tailoring song after song to the tastes of its listeners, along with the occasional ad. For a decade, it worked well, as Pandora came to dominate Internet radio.But with its stock price suffering, and as competitors like Spotify and Apple Music transform the streaming music market around it, Pandora has come under increasing pressure to adapt. In recent months Pandora has unveiled ambitious changes to its service, and also weighed whether to sell itself.On Monday Pandora threw Wall Street another curveball by replacing its chief executive, who had held the job for less than three years, with one of the company\u2019s founders.Brian P. McAndrews, an online advertising executive who joined Pandora in September 2013 as chairman and chief executive, has left the company, and is being replaced as chief executive by Tim Westergren, a co-founder of Pandora and its former chief strategy officer.The return of Mr. Westergren, who has been serving in a board position, signals that this is a critical juncture for Pandora as it tries to restore the growth of its early years. After climbing rapidly, its number of monthly users fell to 81.1 million at the end of 2015, from 81.5 million a year before. Its stock has fallen by about 75 percent since its peak in early 2014.But Mr. Westergren\u2019s appointment as chief executive struck some analysts as a positive development for a company that is trying to regain its footing and change its image on Wall Street and within the music industry.\u201cThis is front and center about a company that wants to change its mojo,\u201d said Barton Crockett, an analyst with FBR Capital Markets. \u201cThey have an inspirational founder who has been very prominent within Pandora, and representing Pandora to artists, and is now stepping up to take over the whole operation.\u201dTo revitalize itself, Pandora plans to move toward an on-demand streaming model that would put it in direct competition with Spotify, Apple, Google, Amazon and others in an increasingly crowded online music market. Pandora views the scale it has already built as a big advantage in this field, calling itself \u201cthe world\u2019s most powerful music discovery platform.\u201dOn Monday the company said it remained committed to that plan, which took shape under Mr. McAndrews, who is also a director of The New York Times Company.\u201cWe are pursuing a once-in-a-generation opportunity to create a massive, vibrant music marketplace,\u201d Mr. Westergren said in a statement. \u201cWe have the audience, the technology infrastructure, the monetization engine and, most importantly, the right team with the passion and commitment to do it.\u201dPandora\u2019s stock price fell 12 percent on Monday in response to the news, closing at $9.60.It was unclear what effect the executive change might have on the company\u2019s explorations of a sale. Last month, it emerged that Pandora had retained Morgan Stanley to advise it on strategic plans for its business. The company has not commented on those plans, but last week its stock rose briefly on the news that it had appointed to its board Anthony J. Vinciquerra, a senior adviser to the Texas Pacific Group, the private investment firm, and a former chief executive of the Fox Networks Group. Given Mr. Vinciquerra\u2019s experience, some analysts viewed his arrival as a sign that a sale or merger might be close.Another critical question for Pandora is how quickly it can complete new music licensing deals. For its radio service, Pandora licenses recordings through a government-backed system that sets standard rates. But last year it paid $75 million for the assets of Rdio, a struggling Spotify competitor, and to restart that service it would need special deals negotiated directly with record companies.Mr. Westergren may be able to improve those talks, which began under Mr. McAndrews late last year and so far have not been fruitful, according to music executives who have been involved with them.Pandora\u2019s competition in moving into the on-demand streaming world is formidable. Spotify has been operating in this area since 2008, and now has 30 million paying customers around the world. Apple, which entered the subscription streaming business last year, has 11 million. A majority of Pandora\u2019s customers listen free, with ads, but the company also has about four million subscribers who pay $5 a month to eliminate ads and get higher-quality audio.Along with Pandora\u2019s $450 million purchase of Ticketfly, an online ticketing company, its move into on-demand streaming is part of its new business plan, which it hopes will nearly quadruple its revenue in the next four years, to $4 billion. In 2015, Pandora had $1.16 billion in revenue, up 26.4 percent from the year before, but its net loss also grew to $169.7 million, from $30.4 million in 2014.Mr. Westergren, a former musician who helped develop the company\u2019s \u201cmusic genome project\u201d \u2014 a system for categorizing songs and the basis for how Pandora chooses what songs to play for its customers \u2014 was chief executive from 2002 to 2004, in the days when the company was known as Savage Beast Technologies. Pandora was introduced in 2005, and the company went public in 2011.Along with Mr. McAndrews\u2019s departure, the company announced that Michael S. Herring, its chief financial officer, would also take on Mr. McAndrews\u2019s role as president; Sara Clemens was named chief operating officer; and Christopher Phillips would be chief product officer. James Feuille, an independent board member, took over as chairman.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "To Know Who\u2019s Leading in the Voting, Just Ask Google", "Date": "2016-03-01", "News": "Supported byThe 2016 RaceI\u2019m always looking for new methods for predicting elections.And in this election cycle, Google might be on to something.A simple count of the total number of searches has nailed the early Republican results with uncanny accuracy.The Republican South Carolina primary also yielded a very close match between Primary Day Googling and final vote tallies. Mr. Trump held a big lead in online interest, and he did even better in the final results. Mr. Rubio and Ted Cruz were left to duke it out for runner-up, and while Mr. Cruz held a slight lead in online searches, Mr. Rubio ended up getting slightly more votes. And Google correctly predicted that neither Mr. Bush nor Mr. Kasich would make much of an impression in South Carolina.The glass-half-empty version of this story would emphasize that Google picked Mr. Cruz rather than Mr. Rubio to be the runner-up. The glass-half-full version notes that their figures got the broad contours of the race right, picking Mr. Trump to win with a 30-plus-point share, with Mr. Cruz and Mr. Rubio locked in a close race for second with around 20 percent each. It may be too much to ask for more than this.Even Mr. Stephens-Davidowitz was surprised by the forecasting performance of these search data. When he first started trawling Google data before the 2012 election, he said that he \u201cwas really, really skeptical because there are so many reasons to search for a candidate.\u201dBut these early primaries have caused him to revisit his pessimism. It is not clear why online searches have proved so predictive, Mr. Stephens-Davidowitz said, but \u201cmy interpretation is that people just searched for their candidate either before or after they voted for them.\u201dIt\u2019s not a crazy idea. After all, who among us hasn\u2019t searched for reviews of a car, a stereo or a phone on the day of buying it? And if we do this when we\u2019re shopping, who\u2019s to say that people don\u2019t do the same on Election Day?It\u2019s a bit harder to figure out how to use search data to predict a caucus. After all, caucuses are a bit like my university lectures: Once they start, you\u2019re meant to be deeply engaged by the speaker, rather than staring at your phone and calling up Google.Even so, Nikhil Madadi, an election enthusiast, shared with me his data on Google searches made within Nevada over the four hours before the caucus. He reckons that, like my students, perhaps the voters were doing their reading ahead of class.The big question leading into the Nevada race was whether the Trump campaign could turn out voters for a time-consuming caucus. Google search data suggested that Mr. Trump should be optimistic. They were right. Mr. Trump\u2019s win roughly paralleled his lead in online search activity. As in South Carolina, Mr. Cruz and Mr. Rubio were left to fight for second place, with each winning a bit more than a fifth of the vote. Again, Mr. Cruz was slightly more popular online, but Mr. Rubio edged ahead of him among voters.But the news from Iowa was not all good for Google. Mr. Trump, who came in second, was not even in the top five candidates for this type of search. Given the large number of newcomers that Mr. Trump was drawing to the caucus, it\u2019s surprising that a larger number didn\u2019t ask Google how it\u2019s done. Mr. Trump ended up winning nearly a quarter of the votes, and so I count this incorrect forecast as a big miss.As Mr. Stephens-Davidowitz told me: \u201cOne of the reasons I\u2019m still a bit skeptical of searches predicting votes is my own experience. I Google Trump every 25 minutes. But, I\u2019m a Bernie Sanders supporter. Plus, I don\u2019t vote.\u201dMr. Stephens-Davidowitz\u2019s behavior might explain why Google\u2019s data isn\u2019t as predictive for the Democratic contest. After all, this is a two-horse race in which one of the candidates \u2014 Mr. Sanders \u2014 draws much of his enthusiastic support from younger and tech-savvy folks. By contrast, Hillary Clinton is popular with older voters, who spend less time online, but have very high turnout rates.If I see anything interesting, I\u2019ll report back.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Tech Companies, New and Old, Clamor to Entice Cloud Computing Experts", "Date": "2016-03-06", "News": "Supported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Amazon Web Services, a globe-spanning cloud computing network that is part of the online retailing giant Amazon, has rapidly become one of the most powerful forces in technology. It has also become a target for poachers.Last October, at a conference in Las Vegas with thousands of corporate executives and software developers in attendance, A.W.S.\u2019s chief, Andy Jassy, strode before an intentionally poorly disguised image of Lawrence J. Ellison, founder and chairman of the Oracle Corporation. Foot-tall words like \u201cbullies,\u201d \u201cextorted\u201d and \u201cstrong arm\u201d appeared next to Mr. Jassy and the image of Ellision. The logo of Oracle, one of the biggest companies in Silicon Valley, was barely crossed out.\u201cOur marketing team needs work on redaction,\u201d Mr. Jassy joked.Better cloaked was the reason for his enmity: Oracle had been slow to get into the cloud business, but recently made multiple hiring raids on A.W.S. Both Oracle and Amazon declined to comment on Mr. Jassy\u2019s dig.The hunt for the hard-to-find talent that can build and run the massive data centers behind cloud computing is pitting three generations of companies against one another. Old-guard companies like Oracle, tech\u2019s current giants like Amazon and its peers, as well as Bay Area start-ups are offering big salaries and big perks for cloud computing experts.On the social media site LinkedIn, for example, there are over 130 engineering positions available at Oracle Seattle. Many of them are the kind of jobs that now pay $300,000 to $1 million a year, according to Shannon Anderson, who has been recruiting engineers in Seattle and the Bay Area for 25 years.Seattle and its surrounding towns are a hot spot for this kind of tech talent because they are home to A.W.S., which runs the biggest cloud computing service, and Microsoft, which has a large cloud business called Azure. Google also has a cloud computing office in the area. So does Facebook.\u201cSomeone working deep inside Amazon is getting five to 20 recruiting offers a day,\u201d Ms. Anderson said. \u201cCompensation has doubled in five years.\u201d For a recruiter, who is typically paid a percentage of a star engineer\u2019s compensation, \u201cthis is a very good time,\u201d she said.Cloud computing, which powers an increasing number of our devices and services, allows a vast collection of computers \u2014 often spread around the world \u2014 to operate like one giant machine.These computing clouds are being filled with once unimaginable amounts of data from apps, websites and sensors on all sorts of things. Fast-growing online services like Snapchat run on cloud systems. Apple has its own cloud, as does Facebook. Cloud systems even offer the computing muscle needed for things like artificial intelligence.As other tech sectors show signs of slowing, cloud services have created unprecedented demand for highly educated engineers and mathematicians who can build and operate these flywheels of data. Instead of asking about the latest computer coding languages or how to make a web page load faster, the most important question in tech hiring has become: Can you handle petabytes? That is the data in about 13 billion images, or roughly the amount of printed information that would fit in 20 million file cabinets.In the Bay Area, $125,000 a year is not an uncommon salary for someone newly out of graduate school with the expertise to do cloud computing work. With five years of experience, $300,000 along with a range of stock or job opportunities that greatly inflate the value of those paychecks have become the norm.\u201cIt\u2019s an aggressive market,\u201d said Corey Sanders, director of program management at Microsoft Azure. \u201cWe are all data engineers now, and we can convince people that this is the best place to learn that.\u201dThe ability to deal with so much data has also become important to industrial companies like General Electric in figuring out things like jet engine maintenance schedules. G.E.\u2019s pitch to cloud computing experts: We offer a chance to rebuild the industrial world.In the last three years, G.E. has hired 1,500 software developers and systems engineers, and trained a similar number of existing employees to work on cloud systems connected to everything from smartphones to wind turbines and jet engines.\u201cWe\u2019ve hired from every large company, places like Amazon and Google, as well as start-ups, or out of schools,\u201d said William Ruh, the head of G.E.\u2019s cloud business. \u201cWe pay well, with attractive benefits, a life and a chance to work on the mission to remake American industry.\u201dStill, he said, \u201cI\u2019m totally shocked at how fast compensation is moving up.\u201dFor smaller companies, the gold rush is more complicated. In San Francisco\u2019s South Park neighborhood, Tom Chavez runs a company called Krux that scans data from more than three billion devices, creating a trove of seven petabytes of information retrieved by several hundred companies. Many of his 160 or so employees are just the kind of people the giants, along with other start-ups, are looking for.\u201cLinkedIn or Facebook can offer an engineer with a few years\u2019 experience a package close to $1 million,\u201d said Mr. Chavez, who co-founded Krux and is its chief executive. \u201cWe wanted someone out of Stanford for an internship, and Google offered her an annualized $180,000 for the summer,\u201d or about $45,000 for three months.Facebook also wants employees like the people Mr. Chavez has hired. In fact, Vivek Vaidya, a Krux co-founder, calls the steep salaries Krux is compelled to pay \u201cour Facebook tax.\u201dKrux takes up several floors of a brick building at the base of South Park, a onetime place of sweatshops that has filled with start-ups and venture capitalists.On the ground floor, development engineers get daily calls asking if they want to jump ship. A nearby team of data scientists gets 20 or more unsolicited emails a week via LinkedIn. Upstairs, Krux\u2019s recruiter strives to keep people, even as he looks to take from others.\u201cI can\u2019t compete with a $50,000 signing bonus from Google, so I focus on the person, what really motivates them,\u201d said Cade Garrett, who has recruited about 100 people to Krux.Besides offering stock options that could be valuable if the company has initial public offering, a fast-growing start-up can offer younger engineers a crash course in technology \u2014 the kind of training that could one day allow them to start their own companies.\u201cI tell them this isn\u2019t the best-paying job, but they have to think about where things are going: Everything they do here is mission critical,\u201d Mr. Garrett said. \u201cYou go to Google, you can\u2019t be sure that in a couple of years you\u2019ll have a product to show.\u201dMr. Chavez thinks industry titans like Larry Page, the chief executive of the Alphabet holding company that includes Google, are intentionally driving up salaries. \u201cIf I was Larry, I\u2019d do the same thing: throw a few more million at people and cut off everyone else\u2019s oxygen.\u201dEven so, Mr. Garrett tries to keep engineers\u2019 contact information off the Krux websites to foil recruiters. And he is more than happy to do his own poaching. Zenefits, a fast-growing online employee-benefits company currently reeling from the departure of its founding chief and a round of layoffs, is a target.\u201cAbsolutely, I\u2019ll call into any company that is in trouble,\u201d he said.An earlier version of this article misstated the amount Google offered someone out of Stanford for a summer internship. It was $45,000 for three months, not $60,000.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "A BuzzFeed Founder\u2019s Costa Rican Hideaway", "Date": "2016-03-02", "News": "Supported byNext StopDozens of surfboards bobbed on the Pacific waves rolling in as the sun came down on yet another perfectly clear, piping-hot day in the Nicoya Peninsula beach town Nosara.This hard-to-reach spot has pulled in surfers since American expatriates discovered it in the late 1960s. But something radical has changed on the beach. The $10-a-night flophouses that once housed the bohemian surfer crowd have largely been replaced by high-end boutique hotels, and more than a dozen new restaurants have opened in the last year alone.They have helped lure affluent travelers to a once-sleepy yet still decidedly laid-back beach town, including waves of families who usually vacation in places like Telluride, Colo., Montauk, N.Y., or the south of France.Its natural beauty is the primary draw. Nosara has a virtual amusement park of outdoor activities: some of the world\u2019s best surfing, stand-up paddle boarding in adjacent estuaries, and, in the nearby mountains, one of the world\u2019s longest zip-line tours. But it is Nosara\u2019s embrace of an eco-friendly, all-natural, organic lifestyle that rounds out its appeal. It is home to a dozen or so yoga retreats, day spas, natural healing classes and a culinary scene that emphasizes super-fresh ingredients like farm-fresh produce and just-caught seafood. This is the kind of place where a crowd assembles at the beach for the sunset each day, in a Zen-like tribute to nature.Accelerating its shift upscale has been the entry of an unusual hotelier: John S. Johnson III, the Brooklyn- and Nosara-based co-founder of BuzzFeed, whose great-grandfather started the giant global pharmaceutical and personal care company Johnson & Johnson. Mr. Johnson, himself a surfer, first came to Nosara about 15 years ago in search of a wintertime surf spot closer to the East Coast than a home he had in Kauai, Hawaii.\u201cCosta Rica in my mind, back then, you sum up my impression of the country in three ideas: Closer. Waves. Spanish-speaking people,\u201d he said.He soon found that there was more to it.Costa Rica has garish, party-scene resort towns like Tamarindo, just 40 miles up the coast. But Nosara puts a premium on natural preservation. No new development is allowed in beachside conservation areas within about 200 yards of the ocean. There are no high-rise buildings, no fast-food restaurants, very few beach bars \u2014 there are not even chaise longues on the beach. It is, in effect, the anti-resort resort.\u201cThere is a freshness in Nosara that is pretty compelling,\u201d said Mr. Johnson, in torn jeans shorts and a patterned, partly unbuttoned, short-sleeved shirt during a recent visit. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of an analog to a little ski town, like the early days of Telluride.\u201dThere was one other critical ingredient that Mr. Johnson found here: Susan Short, a naturalist, filmmaker and also a surfer, whom he met on one of his early visits to Nosara and who is now his wife and partner in their business endeavors.The couple have gone on something of a buying spree in town, purchasing two small hotels; two unfinished condo developments; and even the local weekly newspaper. They are determined to prevent large-scale, resort tourism from taking hold, and have enough available capital to actually stop it.The Harmony is not a place that pampers its guests, despite the premium price: The rooms are relatively small and hardly luxurious (and lack televisions), and room service is not offered. (Rates range from $210 for a basic room in low season to $990 a night for a two-bedroom bungalow over the Christmas holiday.) Mr. Johnson is proud of the fact that it serves no sugary sodas or junk food. Even the minibar is stocked with treats like a homemade granola bar and artisanal chocolate.It is just what the regulars come for. In this unpretentious beachside spot, the lobby at times seems more like a family room. Children hang out while their parents are at the pool or dining on plates like ceviche and Costa Rican casado in the nearby bar and open-air restaurant.A lush, tropical garden connects the hotel lobby to the nearby bungalows \u2014 serving as home to howler monkeys, hummingbirds and other wildlife \u2014 and the hotel\u2019s yoga center, day spa and juice bar. Mr. Johnson is going to open an organic supermarket nearby soon.The hotel does no advertising outside Mr. Johnson\u2019s website, yet it has become an impromptu gathering place, particularly during the peak season, of filmmakers, fashion designers, journalists, Silicon Valley tech executives and New York bankers, their spouses, and children, as well as a sprinkling of European families who somehow heard about the place. Almost all of them know Mr. Johnson or his wife personally, or someone else who does.\u201cThis is a surfer yogi\u2019s spiritual Beverly Hills Hotel,\u201d said Coralie Charriol Paul, creative director of the Swiss watch and jewelry brand Charriol, who was there with her husband, Dennis Paul, a New York investment manager, and their children, after an evening in which they had drinks at the hotel bar with Roopal Patel, the fashion director for Saks Fifth Avenue, who also happened to be in town. \u201cIt has just got a great energy.\u201dThere that same day was Alan Bibby, the television commercial director whose clients have included Mercedes-Benz and Google, with his wife, Alice Bertay, the fashion stylist, whose own roster includes Nike and Target, and their 6-year-old son. They took a break from several hours of surfing for some sushi and a bottle of wine at the Harmony for lunch.\u201cThis place is very much made for gringos \u2014 let\u2019s be honest,\u201d Mr. Bibby said, conceding that he was a bit uncomfortable to be a part of this affluent, New York-centric crowd. \u201cBut at the same time, I am a hypocrite. I am here.\u201dSince there is little night life here \u2014 the most popular spot is perhaps La Luna, a restaurant right next to Playa Pelada, one of the four beaches \u2014 just about everyone seems to be in bed by about 10 p.m. The busiest scene comes at the first light of dawn, when surfers of all ages start streaming toward the beach.All of this physical activity \u2014 surfing, yoga, zip-lining, horseback riding, paddle boarding \u2014 and the deep pockets of this new generation of out-of-town guests help explain why the restaurant scene here in Nosara is also on fire.Just in the last year, one intersection near Playa Guiones \u2014 the most popular beach in the Nosara area \u2014 has become home to 22 restaurants, compared with six in 2014.Reaching Nosara remains a bit of a chore \u2014 it requires a bumpy two-hour trip across mostly dirt roads from the closest major airport, in Liberia. And do not rely on Google Maps \u2014 it will tell you to take a hazardous mountain-pass road. But in a way, that is just how everyone wants it to stay. Make it any easier, and Nosara, as it is today, will disappear.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Tenure Voting Could Shift the Balance of Corporate Power", "Date": "2016-03-01", "News": "Supported byDeal ProfessorA great divide exists in the voting power of shareholders in the United States.The majority of American companies have one share, one vote, but more and more companies are going public with a dual-class stock structure. Here, the voting power rests in the hands of the founders or another group of shareholders.It\u2019s time to consider an alternative: \u201ctenure voting,\u201d a system in which shareholders accumulate more votes the longer they hold stock.Dual-class stock, which must be adopted in the initial public offering stage, is all the rage and is not just found at Google and Facebook. Pure Storage, First Data and Square have all gone public with dual-class stock. Last year, some 13.5 percent of I.P.O.s included some type of dual-class stock, according to DealogicThe difference comes down to the value of a vote.In the case of dual-class stock, either your vote is worth nothing or everything. The founders essentially control the company and wield influence more or less with impunity. This insulates the company from shareholder activism and indeed from the other shareholders. The other shareholders, meanwhile, have worthless votes.In the rest of corporate America, shareholders have one vote for every share. This has the same flaws as American democracy. Too often your vote doesn\u2019t count and many shareholders don\u2019t bother to vote. Everyone also has the same kind of voting power, from an index fund that can hold a stock for decades to day traders who care only about the next five minutes.In other words, neither model works in all cases. In addition, this binary world does not reflect an increasingly complicated reality. Today, founders reflexively go about adopting dual-class stock whether it is good or bad for the company. Dual-class stock may work well at Facebook, but whether it does at Fairway Group Holdings, the struggling grocery store chain that appears to be heading for default on its loans, is another story.The one-share, one-vote companies, meanwhile, are vulnerable to being pushed into quick fixes at the expense of the business long term. Activist hedge funds press companies to enact spinoffs, big share buybacks or other financial engineering tricks to generate a pop in the stock price. And then the activists walk away. This can be a real problem.The charge is heatedly disputed by the activists, who contend that they are simply making companies more efficient. They have a point: Activists have successfully overhauled many staid companies like Darden Restaurants, owner of Olive Garden, where the chief executive was accused of spending several months a year serving on other boards while his own business declined.There is, however, a potential middle ground in shareholder voting \u2014 a system that diverts power from founders while allowing companies to reward longer-term shareholders.In tenure voting, more votes are given to shareholders the longer they hold shares. So for example, if you hold shares for three years at the company you will have three votes per share.The award of more votes for a longer holding period is intended to empower those shareholders who stick with the company. They will presumably have a greater stake in the welfare of the company.It can also provide a counterweight in a dual-class setup. The founders may still have a larger voting bloc, but the power held by long-term institutional investors would grow over time. That would allow some measured shareholder activism, while limiting founder power.The beauty of tenure voting is that it is devised to address short-termism while rewarding all shareholders. Blockchain technology can make it easier to track ownership of everyone\u2019s shares to ensure they are given the right number of votes. (Blockchain technology, which is used by Bitcoin, would create a public ledger of all transactions.)Will long-term shareholders value their new voting power? It is possible that such shareholders may become like sheep, never complaining and never trying to influence the company. They will hold and hold and sell only when the news is very bad.Still, there are some indications that shareholders value the power to vote: Google\u2019s \u201cno vote\u201d shares, for example, trade at a small discount to its one-vote shares.Tenure voting is not a cure-all, to be sure. It may turn out that one share, one vote is best and we should simply reward whoever has the most shares.Yet American companies are in a straitjacket because of the current Wall Street obsession on short-term methods and results. They dare not give shareholders any more voting power if they can help it. Otherwise, though, there are no checks on founders and management.A middle path \u2014 tenure voting \u2014 seems worth trying.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Chanel, Dior, Fendi and Kors Unveil Latest Offerings at Baselworld", "Date": "2016-03-21", "News": "Supported byBASEL, Switzerland \u2014 Each year, some 150,000 industry insiders and haute horlogerie fanatics descend upon this small town, near the German and French borders, for Baselworld, the biggest watch fair in the world.But amid the relentless clinking of Champagne glasses, flashy showcases and sequin-encrusted models cruising the floor with multimillion-dollar showstoppers, the mood at the fair this year was, according to its regulars, more subdued than at fairs past.\u201cThe atmosphere is not great,\u201d said Jean-Claude Biver, the chief executive of TAG Heuer, talking at a media preview. \u201cI think Baselworld this year will not be that bad, but it won\u2019t be one of the best.\u201dBecause of currency fluctuations, slowing demand from China and a slump in traveler spending, full-year Swiss watch exports fell 3.3 percent to 21.5 billion Swiss francs ($22.1 billion) in 2015, eroding much of the industry\u2019s growth since 2012.Despite the predominant focus of the seven-day fair on men\u2019s watches, which make up the majority of global luxury timepiece sales, the displays devoted to women\u2019s watches \u2014 a rapidly growing part of the market \u2014 were clearly trying to grab some of the spotlight.Some players built their offerings around easily accessible and known associations for clients. Most of the luxury fashion houses, for example, turned to the runway for influence.The Dior VIII Grand Bal Coquette, with a cotton-candy pink and cerulean blue palette, gave a clear nod to the colors on the catwalk as part of the Dior spring 2015 couture collection. The raspberry and forest green hues of the spring 2016 resort show were evident in several of the Dior VIII Montaigne styles. Even the Grand Soir KaleiDoirscope No. 5 \u2014 a dazzling one-of-a-kind watch forged from gold, garnets, sapphires and diamonds \u2014 was given a splash of contemporary flair with its washed denim strap.Fendi had detachable fox fur adornments encircling silver and pav\u00e9 diamond watches from its My Way collection, mirroring the fluffy charm movement that was on display at Milan Fashion Week last month.But the power of brand extension was at its most literal at Chanel, where the signature quilted effect of its bags had been recreated in several straps, be it in lashings of woven white diamonds in pieces like its Signature Diamond Secret Watch, or the plush black alligator leather of the Mademoiselle Priv\u00e9 collection, with watches featuring sculptured Oriental-style gold birds dancing on onyx dials.Others simply decided to dazzle with color this year, adhering to a philosophy of brighter and bolder is better. Examples included the Big Bang Tutti Frutti collection from LVMH-owned maximalist brand Hublot (with yet more examples of denim detailing); the magenta pink and deja blue of Louis Vuitton\u2019s Blossom timepieces (bright blues were everywhere this year, as well as in 2015); and the Chopard rainbow-hued Imperiale Joaillerie watch, a self-winding mechanical movement with a case, crown, dial and strap covered entirely with 581 baguette-cut sapphires, arranged in colors that melted gently from one to the next.Indeed, a desire to dazzle with bling was ever-present. The kingpin jewelers certainly pulled out all the stops. Bulgari\u2019s new quartz movement satin-strap women\u2019s watch, the Diva\u2019s Dream, had a dial of 233 brilliant-cut pav\u00e9 diamonds and blued hands. Graff\u2019s new quartz women\u2019s timepiece, the Snowfall, featured 278 diamonds set like flakes suspended in midair on a rippling lattice strap, with a delicate case in its center just 6.17 millimeters thick.And Boucheron took a subtler (but no less luxurious) approach with the unveiling of the Reflet Bleu de Jodhpur. The Reflet \u2014 with its secret clasp and interchangeable strap \u2014 has been a staple style for the house since 1947.Its latest incarnation \u2014 framed with cabochon diamonds around the edges of a delicate rectangular case, a single sparkling gem at 12 o\u2019clock, and a white marble dial from the same quarry from which stones for the Taj Mahal were sourced \u2014 had an understated, feminine elegance that proved a hit with many of the big-name connoisseurs.Elsewhere, though, the great gender crossover continues to build as much momentum in the watch world as it has on the catwalks in recent seasons. Nowhere was the deliberate erosion of once-rigid demarcations between conventionally feminine and masculine styles clearer than with smartwatches and the latest offerings brought to the market.The highest-profile timepieces to marry stylish form with digital function were the $395 Michael Kors Access watch, which uses the Google Android Wear platform and comes in either gold or a sporty black design, and Swatch-owned Tissot\u2019s futuristic-looking solar-powered Smart-Touch, which comes with an independent outdoor weather station unit, and can provide navigation by moving its hands and even trigger an alarm on a fob (with which it is sold) in order to find mislaid keys.\u201cI\u2019m in the business of making people\u2019s lives easier through fashion,\u201d Mr. Kors said. \u201cI thought, \u2018Why can\u2019t tech accessories be chic and glamorous?\u2019 You wear them every day. After all, technology is impacting life more and more. A watch should reflect your personal taste as much as anything else, but it should also give you access to all the experiences that you want.\u201d\u2014Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trial of Veteran Accused of Trying to Join ISIS May Hinge on Unsent Letter", "Date": "2016-03-06", "News": "Supported by\u201cI will escort you into Paradise and when you see the home paid for by my blood and your tears you will know it was worth it,\u201d reads the letter, typed on his computer in January 2015. In it, he pledged to \u201cuse the talents and skills given to me by Allah to establish and defend the Islamic State.\u201dDays after writing those words, Mr. Pugh boarded a plane for Istanbul. Prosecutors say he was on his way to neighboring Syria to present himself to the Islamic State.But Mr. Pugh never got that far. He was detained upon landing in Istanbul and deported to New York, where the Federal Bureau of Investigation was waiting. Last week, he became one of the first American citizens to stand trial on Islamic State-related charges.The testimony in Federal District Court in Brooklyn has shown Mr. Pugh to be a skilled airplane mechanic and a convert to Islam who drifted across the Middle East, finding work at small airlines flying in and out of military bases on Pentagon contracts.But Mr. Pugh\u2019s increasingly radical views had begun to alienate his co-workers and supervisors. One of his managers, Aamer Aslam, now a pilot for United Airlines, testified last week that Mr. Pugh had once claimed that the Islamic State was seeking skilled airplane mechanics. This seemed to hint at Mr. Pugh\u2019s own desire to join the Islamic State.The January letter to his wife, Misha, however, is the clearest declaration of any intentions to join the militant group. It is the perfect piece of incriminating evidence, except for one thing: Mr. Pugh does not seem to have actually sent the letter. It appeared to be just a draft, raising the question of why he never sent it.Did the letter explain his intentions at the time he flew to Istanbul? Did he avoid sending it because he and his wife had previously argued about jihad? His lawyers have claimed that while Mr. Pugh had dark internal fantasies about jihad, his purpose in flying to Istanbul was only to relax and search for a new job.The draft letter perfectly captures the larger question that the jury will have to consider this week as it decides Mr. Pugh\u2019s fate: where (and how) to mark the precise moment when a man\u2019s fantasies become plans and his planning crosses over into concrete action.It is a question that courts and juries are likely to be grappling with in similar cases in the years to come. Since 2013, the Justice Department has charged at least 85 people in cases related to foreign terrorist groups or homegrown violent extremism. Some three-quarters of these cases are connected to the Islamic State, a Justice Department spokesman, Marc Raimondi, said.Terrorism and national security cases traditionally featured clandestine meetings of secret cells and oaths of loyalty. By contrast, the Islamic State has drawn in recruits from afar, in part by bombarding the world with propaganda and scenes of carnage, available to anyone with an Internet connection. Mr. Pugh\u2019s trial is presenting an early case study of how juries will sort through the Islamic State propaganda, online messages and travel itineraries that are likely to account for much of the evidence in such cases.Over several days last week, the jury listened to testimony on topics ranging from Mr. Pugh\u2019s Internet searches and the propaganda he viewed (which included scenes of beheadings and crucifixions under the Islamic State), to the type of clothing Mr. Pugh packed in his backpack (\u201call-terrain sandals,\u201d an F.B.I. agent testified about his footwear), as the prosecution made its case that Mr. Pugh was destined for Syria.For the prosecution, by the time Mr. Pugh flew to Turkey \u2014 a common entrance point to Syria for foreign fighters \u2014 he had taken steps to join the Islamic State, committing a federal crime: attempting to support a foreign terrorist organization. Evidence from his computer showed that he had researched the most common border crossings between Turkey and Syria.But defense lawyers pointed out that he was also searching websites for a new aviation job in the region after being fired from one in Kuwait. And some of his last Internet searches, on TripAdvisor, were for Turkish baths in Istanbul, a detail that is turning into the cornerstone of his defense.At the outset of the trial, one of his lawyers, Eric M. Creizman, even claimed that Mr. Pugh went to Istanbul \u201cto clear his head,\u201d as though the heat of the bathhouses might have cleansed him of his jihadist fantasies.As each side sought to convince jurors of what Mr. Pugh intended to do upon landing in Istanbul, the contents of his two backpacks loomed large. Some items seemed to support the prosecution\u2019s claim that Mr. Pugh was Syria-bound: a black ski mask, a small solar-powered cellphone charger and two compasses. But there were alternative interpretations as well: Istanbul was bitterly cold when Mr. Pugh landed; a solar-powered cellphone charger might be useful to an itinerant airplane mechanic; and compasses could help a Muslim in an unfamiliar city orient himself toward Mecca during prayer.Mr. Pugh is not expected to testify, his lawyers have said. Yet the jury has caught snippets of his innermost thoughts, from his Google searches to his efforts to communicate with his wife, an Egyptian woman who spoke little English, while Mr. Pugh spoke no Arabic. Apart for long periods, they corresponded by recruiting strangers on Facebook to translate their messages between English and Arabic, a laborious process that produced as much frustration as understanding.At one point, they apparently argued about Mr. Pugh\u2019s visions of martyrdom and she had brought up divorce, according to Facebook messages. \u201cI am on a mission for the pleasure of Allah,\u201d Mr. Pugh wrote in one message, less than four months before he left for Istanbul. \u201cI delayed for 2 years because of your selfish behavior.

Take that eminently decent Bertie fellow, who\u2019s still crazy for Edith but doesn\u2019t know what to do about it. Thanks to a timely (and surprising) (and not surprising) intervention by Mary, he\u2019s all \u201cI want you back\u201d and \u201cWould you believe me if I said I couldn\u2019t live without you?\u201d and \u201cThe only thing I\u2019m not ready for is a life without you.\u201dThere\u2019s only one problem, and her name is Mum, or Mrs. Pelham, a puritanical figure who wants to rebuild Brancaster Castle as \u201ca moral center for the area\u201d and wants her son to be \u201ca moral man leading by example.\u201d Ruh-roh. What\u2019s she going to say when she learns that her son is marrying Hester Prynne?I\u2019m guessing that, if Baron Fellowes had his druthers, he would have drawn out this plot line till the days go by, wrapping it up only when Edith was well past her reproductive window. But time was a-wasting, so Mummy Pelham, after blanching a little at Edith\u2019s \u201csordid revelations,\u201d quickly rallied.\u201cShould I turn down a daughter-in-law who, in addition to having birth and brains, is entirely and unimpeachably honest?\u201d she asked. \u201cShe was prepared to deny herself a great position, to say nothing of happiness, rather than claim it by deceit. We must applaud her.\u201dMary then proceeds to one-up Henry by announcing that another crawling Crawley \u2014 oh, very well, Talbot \u2014 is on its way. We will take it as a sign of her newfound emotional maturity that she asks Henry to sit on the news \u2014 \u201cI don\u2019t want to steal Edith\u2019s thunder\u201d \u2014 but she must have forgotten to share that intention with Anna, whose water inconveniently breaks before the newlyweds have even made it out the door.Never mind, Dr. Clarkson is on the spot, and Lady Mary\u2019s bedchamber will make a fine delivery room \u2014 won\u2019t it, Carson? \u2014 and, in something like record time, out pops Baby Boy Bates, whose life, we can only hope, will be easier than his parents\u2019. At the very least, he should steer clear of the slammer and anyone named Green. There\u2019s nothing we can do about World War II.(Anna, by the way, may be the only mother ever to emerge from an unexpected and epidural-free labor looking like a Pre-Raphaelite nymph. Makes you wonder what Clarkson was slipping her during the contractions.)Make her an avenging angel, that\u2019s what. When she learns that her onetime fianc\u00e9, Lord Merton, is dying of pernicious anemia and kept prisoner in his own home, she barges in with Violet and practically airlifts the poor fellow out. She offers to marry him for good measure, which means that Lord M, in addition to shacking up with his honey, gets to (1) tell his son what a loser he is (\u201cI\u2019ve tried and failed to like you\u201d); (2) bear up manfully under a terminal diagnosis (\u201cI\u2019m not too downcast. I\u2019ve had a good innings\u201d); and then (3) rejoice when the diagnosis is amended (by none other than his romantic rival, Dr. Clarkson). I call that Dickiepalooza.And it\u2019s fully in keeping with tonight\u2019s modus operandi, which is to banish all hint of tragedy or discord. Violet buries the hatchet with her daughter-in-law. Robert accepts the fact that he\u2019s married to a high-powered health care chief executive. Molesley leaves service behind to mold-sley the next generation of Yorkshire minds. Mrs. Patmore is ready, it seems, to cast off a lifetime of maidenhood for the pig farmer of her heart.And Andy \u2026 well, he gets the dubious pleasure of Daisy.Let\u2019s credit Baron Fellowes for at least trying to make the wretched girl endearing by putting her through that whole business of massacring her hair. And let\u2019s credit Daisy herself with recognizing that Andy looks plenty all right on a ladder in his undershirt. She \u201ccould do worse,\u201d indeed, and after enough back-and-forthing and cold-shouldering to set the corridors of a high school ablaze, the two appear to be on track to cofounding a Mason pork-products empire. (Which will, of course, be supplying the Mrs. Patmore bed-and-breakfast empire.)As you know, Abbots, this needs the heaviest lift because, in a very short space, Downton\u2019s second paterfamilias has become Downton\u2019s Mussolini. (You mistreat Mrs. Hughes at your own peril.) So what\u2019s the Fellowes strategy? Break the man down at a cellular level.Thus, out of nowhere, Charlie Carson, like his father and grandfather before him, develops a palsy, as ruinous for a butler as for a neurosurgeon. Having spilled a little too much water and a little too much wine, Carson is ready to ship himself off to the glue factory when an unexpected solution presents itself: Mr. Barrow! He\u2019s hating life at the Stiles Mausoleum (\u201cThis is not 1850, you know\u201d) and jumps at the chance to put on the old livery.So before the new year has even arrived, Carson is relegated to the role of \u201celder statesman,\u201d \u201cseeing eye,\u201d manager of \u201cgrand events and so on.\u201d Everybody thinks it\u2019s a capital idea except Carson, whose welling eyes suggest that the glue factory might have been a more humane outcome.Baxter will not hook up again with her old seducer, Peter Coyle, belatedly and blessedly severing one of the show\u2019s least rewarding narrative threads. And Barrow will be no closer to getting lucky than he was four seasons ago.A fact that Baron Fellowes seems to acknowledge when, in the minutes leading up to Edith\u2019s wedding, Violet proffers her definition of an English happy ending: \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of risk, but with any luck they\u2019ll be happy enough.\u201dI think it\u2019s fair to say that Julian Fellowes has given us an American happy ending. And why shouldn\u2019t he? Haven\u2019t we loved these foolish Granthams with all the fervor of their countrymen? Don\u2019t we have the operational tear ducts to prove it? And when that Scottish songstress Mrs. H launched into Bobby Burns\u2019s old lyric \u201cAuld Lang Syne,\u201d didn\u2019t we ache at the thought of leaving behind these silly, maddening, wonderful people?Downton Abbey and its residents were no more real than Middle-earth and, in the end, how little that mattered. We asked them into our homes, and when their time was done, we sent them on their way.Amelia: \u201cMrs. Crawley wants to take you away from your son and your family and kidnap you into marriage. What do you say?\u201dLord M: \u201cHow perfectly marvelous.\u201dDepartment of other stuff.\u2026\u2022 Shrimpie\u2019s back! That means nothing, I just wanted to say \u201cShrimpie\u201d one last time.\u2022 Tom and Miss Edmunds are indeed getting it on. Because who else is left for either of them?\u2022 Meanwhile, the reciprocal man-crush between Tom and Henry has reached quite bizarre heights (\u201cIt can be hard for a woman to understand that a man is what he does\u201d) and only gets more ridiculous when Atticus enters the mix and tells the boys they needn\u2019t reinvent themselves because \u201cI rather like the old models.\u201d Get a room, you three.\u2022 Speaking of Atticus, he had far and away the most dreadful lines in tonight\u2019s episode. I hope Matt Barber got combat pay.\u2022 Shampoo comes from India. Who knew?\u2022 Patricia Hodge (Mrs. Pelham) does things with her mouth that haven\u2019t been done since the silent era. (Some Abbots may recall Ms. Hodge from the 1983 film adaptation of Harold Pinter\u2019s \u201cBetrayal.\u201d)\u2022 Also loved Lady Rose\u2019s encouraging words for the heavily pregnant Anna: \u201cBut it\u2019s such fun after.\u201d Spoken like a parent with a full-time nanny. A nanny who, uh, \u201cwon\u2019t let\u201d Rose and Atticus cross the ocean with their child.\u2022 Didn\u2019t it seem like the servants were more interested in seeing off the newlyweds than checking on Anna? Whatever.Here, I normally pose questions about the show\u2019s future, but with that avenue closed, I fall back on remembrance. We\u2019ve all been together a long time, as Mrs. Patmore said \u2014 a couple of years, at any rate \u2014 and from my side, I can only say how much I\u2019ve relished your company, your commentary and your camaraderie.

So I thought for this week we\u2019d bring in an expert \u2014 our colleague John Markoff, who covers machine intelligence.Also, just for the record, I\u2019m pretty sure I can take AlphaGo in Candyland.What appears to be happening is the timetable for computing dominance of Go has been moved up roughly a decade from when it had been expected. That\u2019s largely because the new ability to blend pattern recognition algorithms and vast data sets has been yielding spectacular results in the last half-decade. It\u2019s like computer scientists have found a powerful new hammer, and they\u2019re using it to pound lots of different nails.I have no idea how this game works, except from what I see of the guys playing against each other in, like, Washington Square Park.One would think that Mr. Lee has a similar advantage. But I imagine a computer program \u2014 even a fancy one from Google \u2014 would lack this certain set of skills. Is there something here I\u2019m not getting?A second type of algorithm can also see the consequences of particular moves far, far in advance of the game by playing millions and millions or perhaps even billions of combinations of moves. In contrast, human Go experts have their experience to rely on, but it is fuzzy by comparison. Think of this as an intellectual version of John Henry and the jackhammer. And remember, right now the only thing the program can do is play Go.Thanks for the guest spot, John! I love learning new things.Advertisement"}

Mr. Rudetsky, perhaps the biggest and most famous Broadway fanboy in town, himself plays professor Ted Scheider, soi-disant \u201cnoted disaster expert.\u201d He has reason to believe a geological event of mighty proportions may be about to occur, because he\u2019s been extracting some unusually heated sediment from, er, somewhere. (The opening number, introducing most of the characters, is performed to the throbbing \u201cHot Stuff,\u201d originally made famous by Donna Summer.)Ted is most worried about this casino-disco, which is celebrating its grand opening and is stuffed to capacity, a further danger detected by Marianne (Ms. Butler), that nosy reporter who buttonholes the proprietor, Tony (Mr. Bart). His flirtatious evasions don\u2019t give her much help, requiring her to take him up on his invitation to join the party.Once aboard, she\u2019s surprised to meet an ex-fianc\u00e9 whom she dumped, Chad, a cater-waiter played by Adam Pascal, whose leather lungs are ripe for his big power ballad, the ghastly \u201cWithout You.\u201d Let\u2019s all sing along: \u201cI can\u2019t live/If living is without you/I can\u2019t live/I can\u2019t give anymore.\u201d (Try getting that out of your head now. Apologies.)Also on board: Ms. Prince\u2019s Shirley, resplendent in lurid Pucci swirls (the delicious costumes are by William Ivey Long), and her husband, Maury (Kevin Chamberlin, mostly wasted, alas); the washed-up disco queen Levora, played with seen-it-all weariness by Lacretta Nicole; and Ms. York\u2019s Jackie, who hopes to entice Tony into becoming stepfather to her twin tykes \u2014 a boy and girl played with ingenuity by Baylee Littrell, swapping genders within seconds.Mr. Rudetsky and Mr. Plotnick (along with Drew Geraci, who co-conceived the show and wrote \u201cadditional material\u201d) take their time getting to the titular calamity, or rather series of calamities: after the earthquake comes a tidal wave that capsizes the casino. The first act tends toward waywardness, and while it runs just an hour, it feels longer. When you\u2019re camping it up, it\u2019s best not to spend too much time vamping.

{"Headline": "Silicon Valley Looks to Artificial Intelligence for the Next Big Thing", "Date": "2016-03-27", "News": "Supported byBitsSAN FRANCISCO \u2014 As the oracles of Silicon Valley debate whether the latest tech boom is sliding toward bust, there is already talk about what will drive the industry\u2019s next growth spurt.The way we use computing is changing, toward a boom (and, if history is any guide, a bubble) in collecting oceans of data in so-called cloud computing centers, then analyzing the information to build new businesses.The terms most often associated with this are \u201cmachine learning\u201d and \u201cartificial intelligence,\u201d or \u201cA.I.\u201d And the creations spawned by this market could affect things ranging from globe-spanning computer systems to how you pay at the cafeteria.\u201cThere is going to be a boom for design companies, because there\u2019s going to be so much information people have to work through quickly,\u201d said Diane B. Greene, the head of Google Compute Engine, one of the companies hoping to steer an A.I. boom. \u201cJust teaching companies how to use A.I. will be a big business.\u201dThis kind of change is what keeps Silicon Valley going. When personal computers displaced mainframe computers, it opened the door not just for Apple, but for companies making PC software for business, games and publishing. In the networking and Internet revolutions, venture capitalists invested in these new computing styles, and another generation of companies was born.Over the last decade, smartphones, social networks and cloud computing have moved from feeding the growth of companies like Facebook and Twitter, leapfrogging to Uber, Airbnb and others that have used the phones, personal rating systems and powerful remote computers in the cloud to create their own new businesses.Believe it or not, that stuff may be heading for the rearview mirror already. The tech industry\u2019s new architecture is based not just on the giant public computing clouds of Google, Microsoft and Amazon, but also on their A.I. capabilities. These clouds create more efficient and supple use of computing resources, available for rent. Smaller clouds used in corporate systems are designed to connect to them.The A.I. resources Ms. Greene is opening up at Google are remarkable. Google\u2019s autocomplete feature that most of us use when doing a search can instantaneously touch 500 computers in several locations as it guesses what we are looking for. Services like Maps and Photos have over a billion users, sorting places and faces by computer. Gmail sifts through 1.4 petabytes of data, or roughly two billion books\u2019 worth of information, every day.Handling all that, plus tasks like language translation and speech recognition, Google has amassed a wealth of analysis technology that it can offer to customers. Urs H\u00f6lzle, Ms. Greene\u2019s chief of technical infrastructure, predicts that the business of renting out machines and software will eventually surpass Google advertising. In 2015, ad profits were $16.4 billion.\u201cIn the \u201980s, it was spreadsheets,\u201d said Andreas Bechtolsheim, a noted computer design expert who was Google\u2019s first investor. \u201cNow it\u2019s what you can do with machine learning.\u201dHe added: \u201cBetter maps and photos is just the start. It\u2019s going to be in life sciences, automobiles, everything.\u201dA number of start-ups are already aimed at the new architecture. A Mountain View, Calif., outfit called Mashgin uses \u201ccomputer vision\u201d to automate retail checkout. Up Highway 101 in San Mateo, a company called Alluxio is creating ways to make cloud-based A.I. work better. Last week, a San Francisco company called Mesosphere, which makes a way to operate among various corporate and public clouds, raised $73.5 million.Microsoft and Amazon are racing Google to dominate the new architecture.This week, Microsoft will kick off a conference in San Francisco that is expected to focus on ways machine-based intelligence can be used to analyze, among other things, \u201cthe Microsoft graph,\u201d or all the data companies already have in the Microsoft products they\u2019ve owned for decades.Amazon last year announced its own machine-learning services, and it is amassing its own large repository of corporate data.Hewlett Packard Enterprise, an older company struggling to find its way in the new landscape, was one of the investors in Mesosphere.\u201cWhen you are building predictive data, you don\u2019t know what you are going to need next,\u201d said William Hilf, a senior vice president at H.P.E. \u201cIf someone makes a bet in machine learning on Microsoft or Google, they may need to come down to their old data systems, too. We are building platforms to bridge among all of them.\u201dTo Ms. Greene, all of the activity so far, along with the size and sophistication of computing, is small compared to what will happen when the world\u2019s biggest businesses start leaning on the new A.I. technology.\u201cWe may build an A.I. system to figure out all the ways businesses can use this,\u201d she joked. \u201cThe relationship between big companies and deep machine intelligence is just starting.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "TiVo Said to Be in Merger Talks With Rovi", "Date": "2016-03-24", "News": "Supported byTiVo, the digital video recorder company that popularized the DVR and revolutionized \u201ctime shifting\u201d and fast-forwarding through advertising, is in advanced negotiations to be sold to Rovi, according to people briefed on the talks.The deal would merge TiVo and Rovi, which is one of the largest owners of patents for digital entertainment devices. Shareholders of TiVo would receive a combination of cash and stock, these people said, though the exact price was still being negotiated. After the deal, shareholders of TiVo, which has a market value of $750 million, would probably own about 30 percent of the combined company, these people said. Rovi\u2019s market value is about $1.7 billion.The transaction would end the independence of TiVo, a perennial takeover target whose suitors were said to have included Apple, Google and Microsoft.Rovi, a lesser-known company, may win the prize that is TiVo as a result of an activist investor, Glenn W. Welling of Engaged Capital. Mr. Welling successfully won two seats on the board of Rovi last year. Since then, he pushed the company to re-evaluate its strategy and pressed it to seek a merger with TiVo, these people said.A spokesman for TiVo declined to comment; a spokeswoman for Rovi did not respond to a request seeking comment after business hours. Mr. Welling\u2019s spokesman said he was unavailable.People briefed on the talks warned that the negotiations were at a sensitive stage and that it was still possible a deal could falter.TiVo\u2019s shares rose more than 23 percent on the report, while Rovi\u2019s stock fell 1.3 percent on Thursday.Together, the two companies have more than 6,000 issued or pending patents, which have become a critical defense for them against larger tech and media giants.TiVo is suing Samsung for patent infringement of its DVRs. To date, TiVo has received cash and future revenue of about $1.6 billion from this type of litigation, the company said in a filing this week.Rovi, on the other hand, lost to Netflix in a highly public lawsuit over five patents related to over-the-top video, which sent the stock plummeting last July.TiVo rose to prominence in the early 2000s, with its name becoming synonymous with the act of recording live television and watching it later. The number of stand-alone devices peaked at the end of 2007, when 1.74 million units represented 6 percent of the DVR market share, according to the Leichtman Research Group, which focuses on media data.But TiVo\u2019s dominance in DVR did not last long. Satellite and cable providers soon incorporated DVR capabilities as an option for their subscribers, and it became less popular to buy the TiVo stand-alone device. As a result, TiVo partnered with service providers, such as DirectTV, for additional sources of revenue. The rise of digital media companies like Netflix and Hulu have become yet another source of competition for TiVo.Today, TiVo\u2019s market share remains below 2 percent, Leichtman\u2019s data showed.\u201cThey set the fuse to DVR but in many ways, they were not the beneficiaries of it,\u201d said Bruce Leichtman, principal analyst at Leichtman Research. \u201cConsumers made their decision; they saw this as a feature but not as a product.\u201dRovi\u2019s shares have soared more recently after the company renewed several large licensing deals, but TiVo\u2019s has gone in the other direction. TiVo is trading at half the level it was in August, largely because of investor concerns about competition.TiVo is in the process of searching for a new chief executive, which appears to have been a catalyst for Mr. Welling and Rovi to pursue the deal. Tivo\u2019s 11-year chief executive, Thomas S. Rogers, stepped down from the post in November while remaining as nonexecutive chairman. The company\u2019s chief financial officer, Naveen Chopra, is acting as the company\u2019s chief executive on an interim basis.Mr. Welling had started Engaged in 2012 after working under Ralph V. Whitworth at Relational Investors, until that fund was wound down earlier in the year. Rovi caught Mr. Welling\u2019s eye shortly after he founded Engaged, building up his stake and then starting a proxy fight a year ago for director seats and strategic changes. He now owns a 2.7 percent of Rovi, or 2.25 million shares, according to data from S&P Capital IQ.Engaged focuses on medium-size companies with market valuations below $8 billion, and has focused on a range of companies, including the smoothie retailer Jamba and Outerwall, which owns RedBox, an inexpensive DVD rental provider.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "What Happened When Venture Capitalists Took Over the Golden State Warriors", "Date": "2016-03-30", "News": "FeatureAfter racking up a historic N.B.A. season, the team\u2019s owners \u2014 most of them from Silicon Valley \u2014 think their management style deserves some of the credit. Are they right?Supported byLacob, who has worked in venture capital for three decades, has an open, expressive face and broad shoulders. He\u2019s six feet tall but seems taller. The previous night, he watched his Warriors play a home game in Oakland, and now he looked tired. \u201cThe Tuesday mornings after we play Monday nights are the hardest,\u201d he said. The basketball court, which is normally used by students and faculty members, has a tidy, corporate look: gleaming hardwood surrounded by plexiglass walls. In his Warriors T-shirt and shorts, Lacob pushed his hands against the glass and stretched his legs. \u201cHonestly, this is my favorite time of the week,\u201d he told me.One by one, other players arrived. Most have known Lacob for years, since early in his career at Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers, which is when he helped start this pickup game. There was no reason for anyone to be deferential to him. But owning a basketball team has cachet, especially when that team has come to rank among the best in N.B.A. history. Nobody mentioned his own business affairs, but everyone was eager to talk about Lacob\u2019s. \u201cJoe, good to see Barnes back,\u201d someone said, referring to Harrison Barnes, a Warriors player who had missed games with an injury.The group ran the court for an hour, playing games to 13 by twos and threes. Lacob, 60, was one of the older players there, and he had clearly thought through his strengths and limitations. He would head to a particular spot \u2014 often one on the right side, about a third of the way around the three-point arc \u2014 and wait. When he saw an opportunity, he called for the ball or cut along the arc toward it. If he received a pass, he would usually shoot. His shot was peculiar, fluttering like a knuckleball, rotating only a few times before it reached the basket, but it went in more often than not. The first game ended with his sinking a three-pointer, then raising his arms in triumph. A few minutes later, his team moved in position to win again. Lacob stood at the top of the key with the ball. \u201cHere comes the game-winner,\u201d he said to nobody in particular.After he finished playing, Lacob wiped the perspiration from his hands with a towel. Then he pulled out his championship ring and passed it around for examination. \u201cThey\u2019ve been asking to see it for two months,\u201d he explained. The ring had an extravagant and revealing design. One diamond had been inlaid for each of the 200-odd games the Warriors won from 2010, when Lacob and his investors bought the team, through last year\u2019s N.B.A. finals. \u201cHow much does this thing weigh?\u201d asked Tom McConnell, the managing director from Vanguard Ventures, lifting his hand up and down as if trying to estimate its value.Silicon Valley \u2014 the place itself, but also the society of smart, technologically savvy people who surround it \u2014 is full of basketball fans. Many of them made a lot of money in their 30s and 40s. Now in their 50s, they\u2019re looking for something gratifying to do with it. In 2002, Wyc Grousbeck, a principal at Highland Capital Partners who spent two years at Stanford\u2019s business school, bought the Boston Celtics along with a group of investors that included Lacob. In recent years, venture capitalists, private-equity investors and hedge-funders have been acquiring N.B.A. teams. The Detroit Pistons, Milwaukee Bucks, Philadelphia 76ers and Atlanta Hawks all belong to this new class of investor. The Sacramento Kings and the Memphis Grizzlies are both owned by Silicon Valley engineers. If you include Lacob\u2019s Warriors, that\u2019s more than a quarter of the league.Lacob was not the first venture capitalist to buy a franchise, but he is the first to operate one according to what might be called Silicon Valley precepts: nimble management, open communication, integrating the wisdom of outside advisers and continuous re-evaluation of what companies do and how they do it. None of that typically happens in professional sports. Most franchise owners of previous generations became wealthy mastering businesses that did one specific thing, if only because that was the way that people used to become wealthy in America. They\u2019ve run their teams, for better or worse, in the same autocratic, hidebound fashion that they ran those companies. As a manager, Lacob prefers to surround himself with expertise and exploit it.This season, Lacob\u2019s sixth as majority owner, the Warriors are on pace to break the league record of 72 wins in a season (which is just 82 games long). He and his partners bought a team that already had Stephen Curry, Golden State\u2019s best player and a transcendent talent who is having one of the most dominant seasons in league history. He would be hitting tongue-flick jump shots from 30 feet away from the basket no matter who owned it.But Lacob won\u2019t accept that what the Warriors have achieved is a product of anything but a master plan. \u201cThe great, great venture capitalists who built company after company, that\u2019s not an accident,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd none of this is an accident, either.\u201dAfter the pickup game, Lacob pulled on a sweatshirt and went to breakfast at a cafeteria on the ground floor. He goes there so often that one of the smoothies on the menu, involving orange juice, vanilla yogurt, bananas and strawberries, has been named for him. He pointed this out, then ordered one. When I asked him about the previous night\u2019s game, he could hardly contain himself. He boasted that the Warriors are playing in a far more sophisticated fashion than the rest of the league. \u201cWe\u2019ve crushed them on the basketball court, and we\u2019re going to for years because of the way we\u2019ve built this team,\u201d he said. But what really set the franchise apart, he said, was the way it operated as a business. \u201cWe\u2019re light-years ahead of probably every other team in structure, in planning, in how we\u2019re going to go about things,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to be a handful for the rest of the N.B.A. to deal with for a long time.\u201dWhat\u2019s happening with the Warriors as a business isn\u2019t something Kimmel is likely to mention, but it\u2019s equally impressive. The $450 million that Lacob\u2019s group paid to Chris Cohan, the former owner, seemed so laughably expensive because of the woeful state of the Warriors franchise. This wasn\u2019t just a bad team, but a team that seemed permanently stuck in a state of irrelevance. \u201cThe little engine that couldn\u2019t\u201d is how the investor Nick Swinmurn, the founder of Zappos and a lifelong fan of the Warriors, describes it. During Cohan\u2019s 16-year ownership, the Warriors had reached the N.B.A. playoffs only once. Sixteen of the league\u2019s 30 teams advance every season. \u201cSo on an odds basis,\u201d Lacob notes, \u201cyou\u2019re supposed to make it half the time. Something was very wrong.\u201dSuch ineptitude had eroded interest. There were only 7,000 season-ticket holders. The arena where the team played, in a vast parking lot beside a highway, was outdated. Its corridors were narrow, its catering facilities rudimentary. It didn\u2019t have rooms that could be leased for corporate meetings. While the league\u2019s newest facilities have been built with palatial home clubhouses the size of health clubs, the Warriors\u2019 was austere and cramped. One look at it during a road trip was said to discourage players around the league from considering the team when they became free agents.Other potential buyers perceived the institutional decrepitude as a drawback. Lacob and his partner, the Hollywood entrepreneur Peter Guber, believed it represented an opportunity. \u201cThat\u2019s what Joe does,\u201d says Chip Perry, the founder of Autotrader.com, a Kleiner Perkins investment that Lacob aided as a board member for 14 years. \u201cHe saw potential in what we were doing with Autotrader, even when others were dismissive. He\u2019s one of those rare people who can look around the corner and see something interesting.\u201d In the Warriors, Lacob saw a start-up disguised as an underperforming business, a sports franchise that had been run autocratically \u2014 and therefore ineptly \u2014 as the industry evolved around it.That $450 million investment is now worth around $2 billion. In 2019, the Warriors will move to a new, self-financed arena complex on the San Francisco waterfront that will include office buildings and commercial space. The move is estimated to add as much as $1 billion more to the club\u2019s value. And while there\u2019s only one Curry, the way Lacob and Guber run the franchise is replicable \u2014 at least in theory.Among this emergent generation of investment tycoons, that hasn\u2019t gone unnoticed. \u201cI knew what Joe had done,\u201d said Marc Lasry of Avenue Capital Group, a Moroccan-born billionaire who partnered with the private-equity investor Wesley Edens to buy the Milwaukee Bucks in 2014. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to do the same.\u201d Lasry insists he loves basketball, but the way he described his intentions sounded less like \u201cHoosiers\u201d than like \u201cThe Big Short\u201d: \u201cWe looked at it and said: \u2018The Bucks have huge potential. We think we can bring in the way we do business and do a huge turnaround.\u2019\u2009\u201dVenture capitalists make large investments in companies that they don\u2019t necessarily control. Lacob brought the same mind-set, if not the actual structure, to his basketball team. \u201cIn venture capital, I started 70 companies,\u201d he told me. \u201cI also watched my partners\u2019 deals, maybe 200 of them. That\u2019s a lot of companies. I thought about the way we design a board of directors, the way we design the financing. There\u2019s an architecture to it. And I started thinking about the architecture I would use when I owned and built my own team someday.\u201dLacob gave Guber, who owns a smaller share, all but equal standing because Guber brought four decades of connections in movies, music, sports and media to the deal. Together, they hired a general manager who had never worked for a team before, let alone run one, and two coaches who hadn\u2019t coached at any level. At the time, these moves were perceived around the league as rookie mistakes. But Lacob was no rookie, not at building companies. And it turned out that they were not mistakes.One evening this season, Lacob arrived late after fighting traffic from Menlo Park. He asked politely for a turkey burger, then found a seat at a high-top table. Between bites, he greeted a steady flow of friends and colleagues, most of whom are big names in Silicon Valley. John Walecka of Redpoint Ventures \u2014 whose current investments include companies called Moogsoft, Quantifind, Datameer and Qihoo 360 Technology \u2014 walked past. So did Mark Stevens, who was a partner at Sequoia Capital when the firm helped finance Google, PayPal and LinkedIn.The Bridge Club has become one of the best venues for venture-capital networking in the Bay Area. It\u2019s a perk for the minority owners, but it serves a purpose for Lacob. Before and after each game, he\u2019s accessible to any investors who want his ear. \u201cIt\u2019s the atmosphere of knowing you have a voice \u2014 knowing you\u2019re part of this,\u201d he explained. \u201cOne thing I didn\u2019t like when I owned part of the Celtics \u2014 was I really heard? I don\u2019t know. I wanted to make sure that when I did this, everybody got heard.\u201dThe N.B.A. demands that each franchise confer one owner, regardless of stake size, with nearly dictatorial power. Lacob wields his softly, just as he typically sits in the back of corporate board meetings without saying much, absorbing information, then guiding the discussion toward a decision. \u201cI\u2019m a professional listener,\u201d he told me. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of smart people in the world, you know. I\u2019m not the smartest. I\u2019m just an integrator. The N.B.A. isn\u2019t like the outside world. I can do whatever I want. But you don\u2019t treat people that way.\u201dEven teams in small markets cost hundreds of millions of dollars these days. Unless you\u2019re Steve Ballmer, the former Microsoft chief who spent $2 billion on the Los Angeles Clippers without the help of outside investors, most potential owners don\u2019t have the wherewithal, or the gumption, to finance a purchase themselves. But rather than money without strings attached \u2014 investors who would have little involvement beyond writing checks \u2014 Lacob and Guber purposefully sought out entrepreneurs and businessmen with attributes and access that complemented their own. \u201cEveryone he\u2019s partnered with has a strategic reason to be there,\u201d says Dennis Mannion, C.E.O. of the Detroit Pistons, who has held executive positions with teams in all four major American sports leagues. \u201cYou have this phenomenal bullpen of talent.\u201dSo after the shareholder Dennis Wong, the managing director of SPI Holdings, advised Lacob on the real estate purchase for the new arena, Walecka helped with the financing. When I spoke with Swinmurn, he reeled off rapid-fire opinions on the design of the Warriors\u2019 branded attire, the type of food sold at the concession stands and other disparate topics. Occasionally, minority partners can even influence what happens on the court. John Burbank of Passport Capital, who uses a deep knowledge of mathematics in his own investments, contributes detailed memos applying complex metrics to potential acquisitions. \u201cI don\u2019t know if any of it has 180ed us on a player,\u201d Bob Myers, the Warriors\u2019 general manager, told me, \u201cbut it has certainly moved us in a direction, one way or another. And he\u2019s done it enough that it\u2019s just the course of things now. It\u2019s part of the process.\u201dSmall-percentage shareholders have always existed in sports, but they\u2019ve typically been local doctors or car dealers who\u2019ve thrown in maybe a few hundred thousand dollars. They get a trip to spring training or a playoff game, a handshake at the Christmas party, a nice profit when they sell their shares, and not much else. \u201cNothing is more limited than being a limited partner of George Steinbrenner\u2019s\u201d is a quip that is most frequently attributed to the former Yankees investor John McMullen.But sports isn\u2019t a small industry anymore. Playing the games and charging people to see them now constitutes only a fraction of the business. Franchises run gourmet restaurants and concert venues these days, and entire streets of retail outlets. They service fans in distant cities through audio and video streaming and proprietary content. Those owners who want to personally dictate everything \u201cdown to the color of the underwear,\u201d as Stevens puts it, can find themselves at a competitive disadvantage. \u201cIt\u2019s very hard when someone has had great success in another business \u2014 the fish-delivery business, the box-cutting business,\u201d Guber says. \u201cAnd then you come into this because \u2018I want to buy a sports team, and I know how to run a business.\u2019 That just isn\u2019t a formula for great success in today\u2019s world.\u201dLacob\u2019s experience in venture capital, building a diverse portfolio of businesses, prepared him well for the peculiarities of owning a franchise, which perhaps explained why spending time in the Warriors\u2019 front office often felt like hanging out at a software company. Soon after buying the team, Lacob supervised the removal of the walls inside its headquarters, which sit atop a parking garage in downtown Oakland. The various departments now share the same open-plan room; when I visited, I kept expecting to see a kegerator or some hoverboards. \u201cYou walk through there now, and it\u2019s young, and there\u2019s excitement,\u201d said Gib Arnold, a former University of Hawaii head coach, who spent several days observing the franchise last year. \u201cIt\u2019s Google in the N.B.A.\u201dCompetitive success is more elusive. Teams that win a sequence of titles, or even come close, need superior talent. That\u2019s especially true in basketball, where an extraordinary player \u2014 a Bill Russell, a Magic Johnson or a Michael Jordan \u2014 is one of only 10 on the court at any time. Put two or more together, uniting Kareem Abdul-Jabbar with Johnson or Jordan with Scottie Pippen, and you can create what in sports is hyperbolically called a dynasty.How much this ever has to do with the owner of the team is questionable. The Chicago Bulls amassed six N.B.A. titles with Jordan. But Jerry Reinsdorf, who bought the franchise in 1985, hasn\u2019t won since the last of those titles, in 1998. (He also has owned baseball\u2019s Chicago White Sox since 1981. The White Sox won the World Series in 2005 but otherwise have performed unmemorably.) Whatever magic Reinsdorf used to create the Bulls dynasty in the 1990s presumably remains at his disposal, yet the team has cracked .500 in just seven of the 17 seasons since Jordan departed. The determining factor there seems easy to identify.This isn\u2019t to say that owners have no impact. They choose how to spend their money \u2014 and how much of it to spend. They determine the goals of a franchise and how it will go about attaining them. But their attempts to directly influence the sports side of their operations have usually ended badly. \u201cThese people have been wildly successful in all their endeavors,\u201d says Jerry West, the N.B.A. Hall of Famer who spent 20 years as the general manager of the Los Angeles Lakers. \u201cBut being involved in a sports team is so much different than anything they\u2019ve done in their lives.\u201dIn Los Angeles, West worked for Jerry Buss, arguably the most successful owner in modern sports history. Buss presided over a franchise that reached the N.B.A. finals 16 times in his 33 seasons. He also invented or perfected club seating, luxury boxes and the glitzy showmanship that now seems an integral part of sporting events. \u201cJerry Buss was an innovator who thought basketball should have the cachet of a Broadway show,\u201d West told me. \u201cThe fun! The excitement! But what made that possible? It was winning the way we won. Magic Johnson played the game with a joy that everyone could see. And he played with maybe the greatest player ever in Kareem Abdul-Jabbar. And he had James Worthy. We had seven players you could put on an All-Star team. And Jerry Buss had nothing to do with that.\u201dAs West describes it, Buss regularly needed to be talked out of personnel moves that would have destroyed his team. \u201cYou don\u2019t know some of the things that he wanted to do,\u201d West said. He described one potential trade that Buss agreed to make: Worthy, the future Hall of Famer, to Dallas for Mark Aguirre and Roy Tarpley, who each had a reputation for being easily distracted. West found that idea so objectionable that he vowed to quit if Buss didn\u2019t renege. \u201cI went home to my wife and said, \u2018I\u2019m probably going to lose my job, but I can\u2019t have this happen,\u2019\u2009\u201d he says. In the end, West says, he was able to persuade Buss.When Lacob and Guber bought the Warriors, they hired West as a senior adviser. They hoped his reputation as a basketball genius could stave off criticism of any controversial personnel moves they might make \u2014 \u201cthe cover of darkness,\u201d as Guber termed it. \u201cPeter said, \u2018We\u2019re taking over this team, it\u2019s a disaster, it\u2019s going to be ugly, all these things will go wrong, we\u2019re not going to win for a while,\u2019\u2009\u201d Lacob recalls. \u201cIf we make a mistake, \u2018Well, Jerry West thought it was a good idea.\u2019\u2009\u201d But West was also promised a deeper role, one without decision-making power but with plenty of input. \u201cBringing in Jerry West is not just a V.C. move but a typical Kleiner move,\u201d says Vanguard Ventures\u2019 McConnell. \u201cThey always put Nobel laureates on their advisory boards. In basketball, that\u2019s West.\u201dWest is known for his spirited, and occasionally profane, defense of his strongly held opinions. But Lacob doesn\u2019t mind the shouting. His professional experience involved investing hundreds of millions of dollars in nascent businesses, some of them in categories that didn\u2019t yet exist, then relying on the judgment of the executives he hired to guide them to profitability. He doesn\u2019t just appreciate conviction; he relies on it.Since joining the Warriors, West has disagreed strongly with Lacob on several personnel moves. Each time, Lacob has deferred. \u201cNot everything you\u2019ll do as an owner will work,\u201d West says. \u201cSome things that you\u2019ll do, or might want to do, will not work. So you have to have the right people in place who can tell you that, not people who will crumble as soon as you express your opinion. That\u2019s the first part. And then you have to be willing to listen to them.\u201d With all the innovations that the ownership group has put into place, West seems to be saying, if Lacob\u2019s skin had been a little thinner or his need to assert his authority a little greater, the Warriors might still be struggling.Once he had his investors in place, Lacob treated the Warriors like another of his fledgling companies in need of adept management. In 2011, he hired Bob Myers as an assistant general manager. He promoted him to general manager a year later. Myers, now 41, lettered in basketball at U.C.L.A. as a walk-on, studied law at Loyola Marymount in Los Angeles, then started a career as an agent, representing athletes. \u201cThe reason I\u2019m sitting here now is because of that V.C. model,\u201d he told me. \u201cI had no track record. I had no past experience. If you only believed in past performance, you\u2019re talking to someone else. I mean, I wouldn\u2019t have hired me.\u201d Last season, Myers was named the N.B.A.\u2019s Executive of the Year.At Kleiner Perkins, Lacob was often forced to change entire management teams and restructure companies before he could make them profitable. He wasn\u2019t daunted by the challenge of turning around the Warriors. \u201cYou make highly contentious decisions in venture capital all the time,\u201d says Trae Vassallo, a former Kleiner Perkins partner who worked with Lacob. \u201cBut not everybody sees them.\u201dLacob understood that the Warriors, who had a losing record, needed to be dismantled before they could be rebuilt. He often had to implement a similar strategy with struggling companies. But the fans had been hearing about long-range plans for decades and had little confidence in them. And now they no longer had Ellis. The booing continued for so long that the former Warrior Rick Barry had to beseech the crowd to allow the ceremony to continue. By then, Lacob was shaking. The humiliation was so public, so raw, that Lacob\u2019s friends were moved to send messages of support. Many mention it now, four years later, as a rite of passage.That fall, the team had to decide whether to extend Curry\u2019s contract. The guard had shown flashes of exceptional talent, but he kept injuring his ankles. The previous season, which was shortened by a labor dispute, he missed 40 of 66 games. \u201cWe had to make a decision in the margins, in the gray area,\u201d Myers says. \u201cHe was hurt at the time \u2014 he\u2019d just sprained his ankle again.\u201d Lacob listened to both sides. Then he asked if anyone could recall an N.B.A. player whose career had ended because of ankle injuries. \u201cNobody could think of any,\u201d Myers says. \u201cAnd that kind of made the decision for us.\u201dWhat they did by offering Curry a four-year, $44 million extension, Lacob explained, was rely not on the future stability of Curry\u2019s anatomy so much as the composition of his psyche: his determination to push through nagging discomfort to make himself great. \u201cNow, if we were wrong, we\u2019d just committed $44 million to a player who can\u2019t play basketball,\u201d Myers says. \u201cSo the risk was there.\u201d Not only has Curry developed into the sport\u2019s best player, but his paltry \u2014 in terms of N.B.A. superstardom \u2014 $11 million annual compensation gives the Warriors ample salary-cap room to surround him with other talent.In 2011, Lacob and Guber chose Mark Jackson, the former St. John\u2019s and Knicks point guard, to be their team\u2019s head coach. Jackson was an unusual hire; he played for seven N.B.A. teams and worked as a commentator, but he had never coached. In his second and third seasons, he led the Warriors to the playoffs. \u201cWe were at the zero-yard line when Mark showed up here,\u201d Myers says. \u201cAnd he got us to the playoffs, and we won a round and became respectable.\u201d So when Lacob fired him in 2014, after a 51-31 season, and replaced him with Steve Kerr, the basketball world was shocked. But Lacob had decided that a different type of leadership was needed for the Warriors to make the leap from a playoff team to a championship team. Such noodling with success, replacing a leader with a limited strategic vision with another who is comfortable aiming higher, rarely happens in sports. But in venture capital it happens all the time.Lacob had known Kerr since the late \u201990s. They had been part of a group that traveled to Scotland on golfing trips. Kerr won N.B.A. titles as a player, first with Jordan and the Bulls and later with the Spurs. He ran the Suns\u2019 front office as their general manager. He had commentated on N.B.A. broadcasts. What he hadn\u2019t done, as the man in charge or even as an assistant, was coach a basketball team. But Lacob had an intuition that Kerr would do better in the organization\u2019s structure \u2014 in which department heads are expected to weigh in on matters outside their jurisdiction \u2014 than the more regimented Jackson.Kerr\u2019s willingness to at least consider suggestions from almost any source may have saved the Warriors during last year\u2019s championship series. They were behind Cleveland, 2-1, when Nick U\u2019Ren \u2014 Kerr\u2019s assistant, whose responsibilities include constructing the musical playlists used during practices and splicing highlight reels \u2014 happened to be watching a tape of the 2014 playoffs. Noticing how San Antonio defended LeBron James, he suggested that the Warriors replace Bogut in the lineup with Andre Iguodala, who is half a foot shorter but athletic enough to at least force James to work to get good shots. Kerr took the suggestion, and the Warriors didn\u2019t lose another game. Kerr publicly gave U\u2019Ren the credit.\u201cI\u2019ve played for nine different organizations,\u201d Shaun Livingston, a Warriors guard, told me, \u201cand I\u2019ve never seen anything like that. This wasn\u2019t even an assistant coach; it was a video coordinator. And Steve Kerr listened to him, and he did it. All the bridges are open here. There\u2019s an open forum of ideas. A good idea really can come from anywhere. And that kind of thinking has to start at the top.\u201dEven after winning the league\u2019s M.V.P. award last season, Curry has improved in virtually every trackable metric. He is averaging more than 30 points a game while making 51 percent of his shots, including a preposterous 46 percent of three-pointers. Still, there\u2019s no way to do statistical justice to those stretches on the court, sometimes a minute or two and sometimes an entire quarter, when Curry appears to have entered a freeze frame, running around while everyone else remains still.I saw it happen in Oakland this season. The Warriors were behind Phoenix in the second quarter. Curry hit a casually spectacular fadeaway from the foul line that ended with him sitting on the court. Then he brought the ball downcourt at speed and abruptly flipped it to another player, who was unguarded, without looking his way, creating an easy jumper. Finally, with the crowd at full roar, Curry launched the ball from several steps beyond the three-point line, and its parabola toward the basket seemed to last forever. It was impossible to watch the ball and Curry at the same time, but out of the corner of my eye I saw Curry turn and begin to run back downcourt, his arms spread wide, before his shot had even reached the top of its trajectory. For me, the moment seemed to crystallize the entire Warriors season.Lacob presents winning as an inevitable result of the way the team has been constructed. I couldn\u2019t argue with one of the best records in N.B.A. history. Yet I also couldn\u2019t shake the idea that the story could easily have gone a different direction. Since the start of the 2013-14 season, the Warriors have won 76 percent of their games. Playing without Curry, they\u2019re 3-6. And if he were sidelined for the playoffs tomorrow, it seems unlikely that the Warriors would be favored to win the championship. As with Jordan and the Bulls, a strong case can be made that Curry, not the ownership group, provides the point of difference. \u201cThey did what every really good organization should do with their star,\u201d the Bucks\u2019 Lasry said. \u201cThey nurtured him. But they got lucky in that Steph became far and away the best player in the league.\u201dStill, Curry\u2019s mere presence wouldn\u2019t have created the means to overhaul a franchise. It takes an extraordinary player to do it \u2014 but that isn\u2019t all it takes. LeBron James still hasn\u2019t won a championship for the Cavaliers; playing together, the perennial All-Stars Kevin Durant and Russell Westbrook haven\u2019t won in Oklahoma City. The decision to keep Curry, coupled with the good fortune that he remained healthy and grew into a transcendent player, gave Lacob and Guber\u2019s structural innovations the chance to have their desired effect. But as Lacob sees it, Curry\u2019s dominance on the court, though essential, is inextricable from everything else he\u2019s done with the franchise over the last few years, from knocking down the office walls to the Ellis trade. \u201cIt\u2019s not just Steph Curry,\u201d he told me once. \u201cIt\u2019s architecting a team, a style of play, the way they all play together. It\u2019s all extremely thought through.\u201dThis confluence of good planning and luck reminded me of a conversation I had with Lacob over a glass of wine one evening at the Bridge Club. He confided that he figures he\u2019s one of the 10 best blackjack players in the world. \u201cI shouldn\u2019t say this,\u201d he added, \u201cbut I\u2019ve won over $1 million at one sitting nine times.\u201d As in gambling, there are no certain outcomes in sports, which is exactly what makes them worth watching. Whether you\u2019re playing pickup basketball on a Tuesday morning or hoping to turn a substandard N.B.A. franchise into a champion, all you can do is try to increase your chances of getting the outcome you desire. It was easy to see that Lacob had a knack for doing just that. For everything he did, he had worked out a system.As an undergraduate at Irvine, Lacob took a calculus class from Edward Thorp, whose 1962 book, \u201cBeat the Dealer,\u201d proved that a blackjack player could gain a slight edge on the house by counting cards. Thorp was banned by casinos, so he taught his students the system, backed them on trips to Las Vegas and shared in the rewards. Lacob was one of those students. When he goes to a casino now, his blackjack sessions aren\u2019t certainties, but Lacob has far better odds of succeeding at them than anyone else at the table. His purchase of the Warriors, I realized, was the same way. He counted the cards and played the odds. And he won.Bruce Schoenfeld is a frequent contributor to the magazine. He last wrote about Ned Yost, the manager of the Kansas City Royals.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "At RSA Conference, Unlikely Allies Address Value of Digital Security", "Date": "2016-03-04", "News": "Supported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 To Amit Yoran, a digital security veteran, the fight between Apple and the F.B.I. over access to an iPhone can be viewed in black-and-white terms: What law enforcement authorities want is \u201cso misguided, they simply boggle the mind.\u201dSpeaking to an audience of computer security professionals at the RSA Conference, Mr. Yoran, who heads the RSA Security division of the data-storage provider EMC, explained his exasperation with officials who he says want to weaken the data protection in computer products despite the growing threat of hackers and other attacks.\u201cSuch a policy would harm U.S. economic interests on an already suspicious world stage, as well as unconscionably undermine those trying to defend our digital environments in every industry,\u201d said Mr. Yoran, who was the cybersecurity czar at the Department of Homeland Security for a little more than a year, ending in 2004.Mr. Yoran\u2019s strong take on Apple\u2019s confrontation with the F.B.I. might be expected of someone in the tight-knit security world. Indeed, it was a typical refrain of conference attendees who see the dispute as an extension of the decades-long struggle between the tech industry and government over encryption.But what surprised many of the about 40,000 people attending the RSA Conference, the world\u2019s largest gathering of security experts, this week was the nuanced, industry-friendly tone of former government officials who spoke at the event.Michael Chertoff, the former director of Homeland Security under George W. Bush and an author of the Patriot Act, said it would be a mistake to sacrifice tough security to \u201cgive authorities admittedly important access to certain types of phones or data.\u201dThe technology company has been locked in a major legal battle against law enforcement officials over privacy and security.And strong security will become even more important in the coming years as Internet-connected technology spreads from smartphones and computers to home heating systems, streetlights, the electrical grid and much more, said Mr. Chertoff, who is now executive chairman of a risk-management and consulting organization.\u201cAttacks on control systems can have loss of life, and encryption is going to be a key element in a strategy to secure all of this going forward,\u201d he told an audience.The F.B.I. wants Apple\u2019s help bypassing the password mechanism of an iPhone that belonged to one of the attackers in December\u2019s mass shooting in San Bernardino, Calif. Apple is resisting a court order requiring its assistance, and a crowd of tech companies have filed court briefs in support of Apple\u2019s stance.To many in tech, the iPhone fight is a reminder of the 1990s, when the government unsuccessfully argued for a so-called back door to encryption called the Clipper chip. The encryption debate was reignited by the widespread government monitoring of Internet traffic that was revealed in documents leaked in 2013 by the former government contractor Edward J. Snowden.Mr. Snowden\u2019s revelations added urgency to the adoption of tougher security and encryption at Silicon Valley\u2019s technology companies, including Apple, which added an encryption system in 2014 that made it impossible for the company to extract data off a customer\u2019s phone without the owner\u2019s password, even when compelled to by court order.The tech industry has other unlikely allies in this debate.J. Michael McConnell, a director of the National Security Agency in the 1990s, was once an advocate of the Clipper chip. But he said at the RSA Conference that he changed his mind after joining the private sector and Booz Allen Hamilton, a military consultancy, where he said he had yet to examine any computer of consequence that had not been hacked by Chinese spies.\u201cWhen you understand that level of extraction of intellectual property,\u201d Mr. McConnell said, \u201cit\u2019s logical that ubiquitous encryption is something the nation needs to have.\u201dThere is, of course, a business rationale for these concerns. The United States hardly has a monopoly on encryption technology. Consumers can pick from around 800 encryption tools from 55 countries. Some in the security business worry they will lose badly to competitors in other countries if it becomes clear the United States government has a way around their systems.Others at the conference, including James A. Lewis, a leading digital strategist at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a bipartisan research group in Washington, said the iPhone debate was the start of a much larger discussion about the use of end-to-end encryption. That is, technology that protects data behind cyphers at every point.He said this technology would make it difficult for corporations to see what employees were doing and for financial regulators to see what Wall Street was doing. It would, he added, put a veil over nearly everything.Mr. Lewis argued for a system not unlike Google\u2019s, which has deployed encryption but, unlike Apple\u2019s encryption scheme, has yet to make it unrecoverable to authorities.\u201cEnd-to-end encryption does not make you safer, it creates legal problems,\u201d Mr. Lewis said. \u201cThat\u2019s what we\u2019re really fighting about.\u201dBut most at the conference disagreed with that premise.\u201cWe\u2019re not going to stop this technology,\u201d Mr. McConnell said. \u201cIt\u2019s already available in parts of the world.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "For Apple, Potential Flaw May Be a Wake-Up Call", "Date": "2016-03-23", "News": "Supported byBitsTimothy D. Cook has found himself in a strange position. It looks like someone knows about an important flaw in Apple\u2019s flagship product, and won\u2019t tell its chief executive what it is.That announcement appears to have at least stalled what many saw as a seminal case on privacy, encryption and the rights of the state in the age of computer communications.And it may serve as an wake-up call to Apple about how it safeguards its products.One reason may be Apple\u2019s iconic reputation for making a safer, better-built computer. Indeed, for many years Apple computers had far fewer attacks than machines running Microsoft Windows, but experts said this had as much to do with the relative attraction of trying to find flaws in Windows, which had much more of the market. If you did find a flaw, there were more computers to exploit.Now that Apple has a huge market presence, a robust underground market in selling knowledge of flaws in Apple software has sprung up. Apparently, flaws in the Safari browser are worth $100,000, and knowledge of iPhone issues can command 10 times as much.That may become a new market that Mr. Cook will want to attack, dominate \u2014 and shut down.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Pittsburgh\u2019s Youth-Driven Food Boom", "Date": "2016-03-15", "News": "Supported by21 PhotosPITTSBURGH \u2014 It hits you as soon as you get to town.Everybody seems so young. And everybody\u2019s talking about restaurants. If there are scholars who hope to study how a vibrant food culture can help radically transform an American city, the time to do that is right now, in real time, in the place that gave us Heinz ketchup.Kelly Sawdon, an executive with the Ace chain, said the company spent years trying to raise money to convert a torn-and-frayed Y.M.C.A. into a hip hotel because the \u201cenergy\u201d of the city suggested a blossoming marketplace. Food, she said, has been the catalyst.For decades, Pittsburgh was hardly seen as a beacon of innovative cuisine or a magnet for the young. It was the once-glorious metropolis that young people fled from after the shuttering of the steel mills in the early 1980s led to a mass exodus and a stark decline.\u201cWe had to reinvent ourselves,\u201d said Bill Peduto, Pittsburgh\u2019s mayor.No one can pinpoint whether it was the artists or techies or chefs who got the revitalization rolling. But there\u2019s no denying that restaurants play a starring role in the story Pittsburgh now tells about itself. The allure of inhabiting a Hot New Food Town \u2014 be it Nashville or Richmond, Va., or Portland (Oregon or Maine) \u2014 helps persuade young people to visit, to move in and to stay.That\u2019s good news for tourism; 2,800 hotel rooms have been added in Pittsburgh since 2011. \u201cWe\u2019re really using the food scene as a driver of that,\u201d Mr. Davis said. \u201cThere\u2019s a reason to come to the city.\u201dIt is also good news for business and culture leaders who seek out young employees and customers. When job candidates arrive, the new wave of restaurants is brandished as a selling point.\u201cThe food scene in Pittsburgh is actually responsible for our landing some best-in-the-world types of people,\u201d said Andrew Moore, the dean of the School of Computer Science at Carnegie Mellon and a founder of Google\u2019s first office in the city.Google\u2019s presence has since expanded considerably \u2014 and almost in sync with the restaurant surge. Pittsburgh\u2019s mayor said the food boom had played a pivotal role in restoring neighborhoods, evidence of an \u201centrepreneurial attitude throughout the city.\u201d\u201cTen years ago, you had some visionaries, some young people who had a dream of owning their own restaurants,\u201d Mr. Peduto said. \u201cThey took a risk \u2014 they really did believe the place had this amazing potential.\u201dIn the early days of Piccolo Forno, Mr. Branduzzi was warned that Pittsburghers weren\u2019t likely to take a chance on old-school items like rabbit or wild boar. \u201cPeople thought it was crazy and that it would never sell,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd now I can\u2019t take rabbit off the menu.\u201dBeing shielded from crushing rent increases allows Pittsburgh chefs to take risks and cook the way they want to cook without constantly fretting about going under.This is not to say that creating Cure was easy. Lawrenceville still has its fair share of graffiti and abandoned storefronts, but \u201cyou should\u2019ve seen that neighborhood five years ago,\u201d Mr. Severino said. \u201cI got to know the prostitutes who worked the corner. I got to know the drug dealers who hated my guts.\u201d He was always calling the police; thieves broke into Cure repeatedly.Through it all, he stuck to his philosophy: \u201cI\u2019m just going to do what I want to do without regard for what people say they want.\u201dMr. Mantica and Mr. Benson see Smallman as a way to cater to the tastes of the young employees of Apple, Uber and Google who are starting to occupy new apartments in the area. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen this huge demographic shift in Pittsburgh, and now it\u2019s a matter of, \u2018What do those people want?\u2019\u201d Mr. Benson said.Mr. Hilty grew up near Pittsburgh, and said he had plans to leave for New York or Oregon after college, but \u201cI had too much debt. So I slowly figured out what my contribution would be to the city.\u201d He is glad he stayed. Lawrenceville, he said, is \u201cvery youthful and it\u2019s full of unbridled enthusiasm for this stuff.\u201dBut there is ambivalence as well. Young restaurateurs know how gentrification works; they\u2019ve witnessed it in Brooklyn and San Francisco. Rents rise. People get squeezed out. \u201cWe all see where it\u2019s going to be in five years,\u201d Mr. Hilty said. \u201cThe barrier to entry\u2019s going to be so high.\u201dMs. Thackray added, \u201cIt\u2019s really cool \u2014 and then the bubble bursts.\u201dLike winning the lottery, being crowned a Hot New Food Town can complicate things. Despite his trailblazing, Mr. Severino has noticed how Lawrenceville\u2019s newer inhabitants view him as something of a square. \u201cMost of those hipsters hate me,\u201d he said with a laugh. \u201cThey\u2019ll go out of their way to tell me what a yuppie I am.\u201dSome of the more thoughtful leaders of Pittsburgh\u2019s cultural youthquake find themselves vexed \u2014 worrying that the city they wanted to live in could turn, over time, into its glossy and expensive opposite, a place that evicts older residents and prices out younger ones.The present is exciting in Pittsburgh. The future? That depends.\u201cWe just have to stay vigilant in how Pittsburgh\u2019s redevelopment takes place,\u201d Mr. Shuck said, \u201cfostering the conversation and pressuring government and private capital to work together to do it right.\u201dIf You Go ...An earlier version of this article misstated the titles of the Whitfield chefs Bethany Zozula and Casey Shively. Ms. Zozula is the executive chef, not the pastry chef. Ms. Shively is the pastry chef, not the chef. An earlier version of a picture caption also misstated Ms. Zozula\u2019s title.Because of an editing error, a map last Wednesday with an article about Pittsburgh\u2019s booming food scene misstated the address of a Primanti Brothers restaurant. It is 1832 East Carson Street \u2014 not 2100 Wharton Street, which is the address of the corporate office.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Teenage Drivers? Be Very Afraid", "Date": "2016-03-19", "News": "Supported byThis LifeSpend enough time having parenting conversations, as I\u2019ve done personally and professionally for the last dozen years, and certain patterns emerge. In nine out of 10 cases, if you\u2019re talking about highly motivated parents, the message to Mom and Dad is: back off, chill out, park the helicopter.Whether you want your children to be independent, resilient, creative; whether you\u2019re talking to teachers, psychologists, grandparents; whether you\u2019re discussing homework, food, sports; the recommendation, time and again, is relax.Recently, I stumbled onto a topic in which the advice was the exact opposite.Among the people who know what they are talking about, the unanimous message to parents is: You\u2019re not worried nearly enough. Get much more involved. Your child\u2019s life may be in danger.What\u2019s the topic? Teenage driving.Among this age group, death in motor vehicle accidents outstrips suicide, cancer and other types of accidents, Dr. Morris said. \u201cCars have gotten safer, roads have gotten safer, but teen drivers have not,\u201d she said.How to address this problem is not as simple as it seems, especially as technology has taken over teenagers\u2019 lives.One father I know bought his son a manual-transmission car because it required him to use two hands, to eliminate the option of using a cellphone. I recently overheard a conversation between my sister and her 16-year-old son in which she reminded him not to text while driving, and he replied, \u201cBut I\u2019m using Google Maps, and the text pops up automatically on the screen.\u201dSo what\u2019s a parent to do, especially one who knows teenagers are always one step ahead of any rules they try to impose?Most states have what are called \u201cgraduated driver\u2019s licenses,\u201d meaning some combination of learner\u2019s permit, followed by a six-month or so intermediate phase, followed by a full permit. Restricting the number of passengers who are not family members is among the most common regulations in the early phases, but Dr. Morris said most parents disregard the rule once that time expires.That\u2019s a huge mistake, she said. \u201cEven if your state drops the non-familiar-passenger restriction after six months, parents should make it their own rule,\u201d Dr. Morris said.Distraction is highest when boys ride with other boys, she said, whereas boys actually drive safer when girls are in the car. Altogether, passengers are a greater threat than cellphones, she believes. \u201cYour cellphone isn\u2019t encouraging your teen to go 80 in a 50, or 100 in a 70,\u201d she said.Dr. Klauer has done three studies, in which she places video cameras in cars and monitors drivers for a year. Even when teenagers know they\u2019re being monitored, they still use their telephones for texting, talking or checking Facebook at least once every trip, including ones only a few blocks.\u201cTeens\u2019 prevalence for engaging their devices is higher than other age groups,\u201d she said, \u201cand their risk for being involved in a crash when they do is higher.\u201dEven if the phone is tucked away in a pocket or backpack, enticing beeps or ringtones make it hard to resist. Dr. Klauer recommends blocking all notifications before even getting in the car. \u201cYou\u2019re more likely to do it if you\u2019re sitting calmly at home,\u201d she said. \u201cIn the moment, it\u2019s really hard not to look at the screen.\u201d\u201cThe real enemy is taking your eyes off the forward roadway,\u201d Dr. Klauer said. \u201cAnything more than two seconds is extremely dangerous. The longer you look away, the worse it gets.\u201dThough she\u2019s skeptical young drivers actually need navigation for most trips, Dr. Klauer said audible turn-by-turn directions are preferable to paper maps, because there\u2019s less rustling in your lap. Similarly, streaming music has advantages over flipping radio channels, as long as the driver is not selecting each individual song.Dr. Morris encouraged parents to adopt as many of the safety features as possible. \u201cI did not grow up in a wealthy family,\u201d she said. \u201cI drove a $3,000 car when I was in high school. But if the idea is that these bells and whistles aren\u2019t necessary for teens, I would argue against that. I know it\u2019s expensive for parents, but any advanced safety feature is well worth the money and peace of mind.\u201dDr. Klauer said that in her studies she would send video snippets to parents when their children violated the law. When parents looked at the results and discussed them with their teenagers, results improved. The only problem: Half the parents never even looked at the warnings. \u201cI know you trust your child,\u201d Dr. Klauer said. \u201cBut if you\u2019re not paying attention, chances are they\u2019re not driving as safely as you think they are.\u201dThe bottom line: Teenage driving may be that rare outlier when it comes to parenting. As soon as you give your children the keys to the car, it may be time to pull the helicopter out of the hangar for a spell and follow them down the road.Bruce Feiler is the author, most recently, of \u201cThe Secrets of Happy Families.\u201d Follow him on Twitter @brucefeiler. \u201cThis Life\u201d appears monthly.Advertisement"}

Does your answer change after finding out that the company is called \u201cGirls\u2019 Lounge\u201d and its events include mini-makeovers? If so, why?In the most basic sense, the Girls\u00e2\u0080\u0099 Lounge is a free space \u00e2\u0080\u0094 a hotel penthouse, for instance \u00e2\u0080\u0094 where businesswomen can relax and mingle between meetings and seminars. There is fruit to snack on. Hair, nail and makeup experts offer mini-makeovers. Ms. Zalis, assisted by four full-time staff members, sometimes brings in a \u00e2\u0080\u009cconfidence coach\u00e2\u0080\u009d to give pep talks. Pink flowers, throw pillows and plush sofas add to the slumber-party feel.Girls\u00e2\u0080\u0099 Lounge attendees \u00e2\u0080\u0094 roughly 5,000 by now, Ms. Zalis estimates \u00e2\u0080\u0094 are also encouraged to network and explore business deals, both with one another and with any men who find themselves in their midst. Gail Tifford, for instance, was unable to find a spot at a 2014 convention to discuss business with Stephen Quinn, who was then Walmart\u00e2\u0080\u0099s chief marketing officer, so she asked him to meet her in the Girls\u00e2\u0080\u0099 Lounge.\u00e2\u0080\u009cThere were women in robes with their hair in towels,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Ms. Tifford, vice president for media and digital engagement at Unilever North America, recalled with a laugh. \u00e2\u0080\u009cStephen and I went out to the terrace and had a very productive one-hour meeting.\u00e2\u0080\u009dMr. Quinn, who recently retired from Walmart, wrote in an email that it taught him something important about how women must feel when they are surrounded by men. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt was kind of uncomfortable for me,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI clearly didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t fit in and distinctly had a feeling of a lot of eyes on me. Voice in my head: \u00e2\u0080\u0098What is he doing here?\u00e2\u0080\u0099 Probably wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t true, but my mind went there.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u2026 As the Girls\u00e2\u0080\u0099 Lounge has grown, landing partners that include Visa and Google (and, at some events, The New York Times), so have Ms. Zalis\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ambitions. Early on, she said, she was simply interested in \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe power of the pack\u00e2\u0080\u009d: making women feel like less of a minority at heavily male business events. (Men outnumber women at Davos by more than five to one.) But then she noticed that Girls\u00e2\u0080\u0099 Lounge attendees were having meaningful conversations about sexism at work and how to combat it.\u2026 The Girls\u00e2\u0080\u0099 Lounge definitely has its detractors. While reluctant to publicly criticize another woman, especially one working toward an admirable goal, a half-dozen women I approached \u00e2\u0080\u0094 senior media executives, a retired state judge, lawyers \u00e2\u0080\u0094 told me that they thought Ms. Zalis was hurting professional women by using the \u00e2\u0080\u009cG word.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cA girl is a juvenile, someone who isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t ready, and I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve fought my entire career to avoid being perceived as that,\u00e2\u0080\u009d one Warner Bros. executive said.Among the other comments: \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt sounds like a bathroom\u00e2\u0080\u009d; \u00e2\u0080\u009cAnything that makes us separate from men is harmful\u00e2\u0080\u009d; \u00e2\u0080\u009cI embrace my femininity \u00e2\u0080\u0094 I wear dresses to work, I shop on business trips \u00e2\u0080\u0094 but if I told my male colleagues that I was headed for the Girls\u00e2\u0080\u0099 Lounge, it would only cement in their minds that I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not as good as them.\u00e2\u0080\u009dEven several of Ms. Zalis\u00e2\u0080\u0099s supporters conceded that the Girls\u00e2\u0080\u0099 Lounge took some getting used to. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s an unlikely name for what is really going on there,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Joanna Barsh, a director emeritus at McKinsey & Company. Ms. Barsh added: \u00e2\u0080\u009cShelley is not making a difference because she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s timid. She\u00e2\u0080\u0099s brazen. This woman is a force of nature \u00e2\u0080\u0094 an extraordinary, energized bundle.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u2014 Do you think the Girls\u2019 Lounge offers a solution to what Ms. Zalis calls the \u201cboys club\u201d in the business world?\u2014 How do you think the article would be different, if at all, had it been written by a woman? Explain. \u2014 What do you think of Ms. Zalis\u2019 decision to \u201cpour on the pink\u201d at the Girls\u2019 Lounge as a show of standing out, not trying to fit in, as she claims she\u2019s been advised to do in the workplace? \u2014 Knowing that Stephen Quinn, who is male, had had a meeting with a woman in the space rented by the Girls\u2019 Lounge suggests that there isn\u2019t a \u201cno men allowed\u201d rule there. How, if at all, does that affect your opinion of the Girls\u2019 Lounge?\u2014 What is your reaction to Mr. Quinn\u2019s description of how he felt when he was there?  The Girl\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Lounge has been quite controversial for its use of the word \u201cgirl,\u201d its creation of an exclusive space, but mostly its emphasis on women doing stereotypically \u201cgirly\u201d things.This article makes me reflect on whether all of these different paths for female empowerment can run parallel or whether they are divisive at a time when women need to come together.\n She suggests these questions:\u2014 Do women have to minimize their feminity in order to be taken seriously by men? \u2014 Does offering spaces where women do stereotypically \u201cgirly\u201d things such as getting manicures and makeovers enforce traditional gender roles or is it a kind of empowerment? \u2014 Does a space like the Girls\u2019 Lounge exclude women who don\u2019t fit the mold it embraces?

{"Headline": "In Seoul, Go Games Spark Interest (and Concern) About Artificial Intelligence", "Date": "2016-03-15", "News": "Supported byLee Se-dol, a boyish-looking 33-year-old and a South Korean Go master, was preparing on Wednesday for his first match in a best-of-five series. His challenger, though, was nowhere to be seen.For days, I\u2019ve listened to people in Seoul talk about \u201cthe match of the century\u201d \u2014 a round of Go between Mr. Lee and AlphaGo, a computer program created by Google\u2019s DeepMind artificial intelligence unit. Few news events here have attracted such a large and electrified crowd of reporters and TV cameras. Not even the briefings on North Korea\u2019s recent nuclear test generated such media frenzy.And as The Times\u2019s Seoul bureau chief, I was in the thick of it.The scene last Wednesday at the Four Seasons Hotel in downtown Seoul resembled a fight night on the Las Vegas Strip: hundreds of reporters, match organizers in black T-shirts (with earphones and walkie-talkies on their hip belts), bodyguards in suits and ties holding back milling photographers and TV crews.When the first game got underway, professional Go players \u2014 like newscasters describing a boxing match, punch by punch \u2014 served as commentators, offering an analysis of each move. But Go is so complex that its moves can be understood only by those trained in the game.Many reporters, and a majority of South Koreans, could not make heads or tails of the commentators\u2019 analysis. We waited for the commentators to announce who had made a mistake and for remarks about how the players were doing in general.Called \u201cbaduk\u201d in Korean, Go is a two-person board game popular in Northeast Asia. The players compete for more territory by placing black and white stones on intersections on a board of 19 lines by 19 lines. The number of possible moves in a Go game is said to be bigger than that of atoms of the observable universe.A typical Go match lasts several hours. In fast-paced and modern South Korea, Go is sometimes seen as a game from the past, an idle pastime enjoyed by older villagers in the summertime shade of a large tree. But in a country where computer games are all the rage among young people, Go still commands an enduring hold.Online Go match sites have taken the tradition to the Internet. There\u2019s also a cable channel that shows Go matches round-the-clock. One recent box-office hit even featured gangsters who kidnap child Go geniuses and use earphones and other secret devices to fix Go matches with huge amounts of cash at stake.In the movie, those caught red-handed ended up having their fingers chopped off.No such blood in the Lee-AlphaGo matches \u2014 though that\u2019s not to say they lacked drama.In the first match, Mr. Lee conceded after three and a half hours. It was obvious \u2014 to him, anyway \u2014 that he\u2019d lost too much territory to recover. (Go watchers compare such concessions to combatants laying down their weapons; they call it \u201cthrowing down the stone.\u201d)In the second match, on Thursday, Mr. Lee again threw down his stone.\u201cI must say I am speechless,\u201d he said. \u201cFrom the very beginning of the match, I could never manage an upper hand for one single move. It was AlphaGo\u2019s total victory.\u201dMr. Lee\u2019s dramatic defeats were front-page news in South Korean newspapers and sparked public interest in \u2014 and even some fear of \u2014 artificial intelligence. Government officials noted that it was not AlphaGo, but the human programmers, who won the matches.On Saturday, Mr. Lee lost his third straight match \u2014 and the $1 million prize money. He admitted to feeling handicapped by the psychological pressure of facing an invisible foe. But he also said that AlphaGo was not perfect and that the machine showed weaknesses in some of its moves.Mr. Lee exploited those weaknesses in a surprising victory in the fourth match on Sunday. But AlphaGo won the fifth and final match on Tuesday, ending the series 4-1.One Twitter user quipped that he knew one sure way for a human to beat AlphaGo. \u201cJust pull out its electric plug,\u201d he wrote.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The High Cost of Housing in San Francisco", "Date": "2016-03-15", "News": "Supported byLetterTo the Editor:The cost of housing is out of control, in part because of record job creation, but also because housing construction in the city and the region has failed to meet demand. With thousands of jobs being added every month in San Francisco alone, housing construction is shockingly sluggish, with only 3,500 new units added in 2015.It is no surprise that costs are up and that residents are being driven out. The good news is that a new wave of pro-housing advocacy has begun.For the first time in years, people across the Bay Area \u2014 including homeowners whose property values would go up if they did nothing \u2014 are standing up to those who would preserve the shortage for their own benefit and advocating for new housing.We are already seeing progress in areas like Mountain View, where 10,000 units are planned near Google, and in San Francisco along transit corridors where housing is finally being approved.It\u2019s not enough, but it\u2019s a good first step.ANDREW SULLIVANSan FranciscoThe writer is a member of the San Francisco Bay Area Renters Federation, supported by donors, including from the tech industry.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "E.U. and U.S. Release Details on Trans-Atlantic Data Transfer Deal", "Date": "2016-02-29", "News": "Supported byAmerican and European officials released details on Monday about a new trans-Atlantic data transfer agreement, prompting a new round of debate about how companies like Google move digital information between the two regions.As part of the new agreement \u2014 known as the E.U.-U.S. Privacy Shield \u2014 companies will face stricter rules over how they move people\u2019s digital data from the European Union to the United States. American officials have also agreed to new limits on the powers of the country\u2019s intelligence agencies to gain access to Europeans\u2019 online information when it is transferred to the United States.\u201cThe U.S. has different structures to Europe, but both sides offer robust privacy protections,\u201d Penny Pritzker, the United States commerce secretary, said in an interview in February. \u201cThe challenge was to show Europe how our system works, because we don\u2019t have a single overriding privacy law.\u201dThe European Commission, the executive arm of the European Union, also gave its official backing on Monday after it released a so-called adequacy decision, an official text required to turn the data transfer pact into law.The biggest American tech companies face intensifying scrutiny by European regulators, with \u2014 pressure that could potentially curb their sizable profits in the region and affect how they operate around the world.Though the agreement still needs to be ratified by European Union member states, that is not expected to be contentious and is likely to happen in the coming months.\u201cRestoring trans-Atlantic trust is crucial to businesses,\u201d said John Higgins, director general of DigitalEurope, a technology trade group whose members include Google and Microsoft. \u201cWe welcome progress towards the adoption of the E.U.-U.S. Privacy Shield Adequacy Decision.\u201dDespite the agreement, privacy campaigners have been quick to balk at the deal, saying that it does not offer Europeans sufficient protections when their data is moved across the Atlantic.Several groups have already said that they will challenge the pact in court, and Europe\u2019s increasingly powerful national data protection authorities have yet to give their approval.\u201cThe new Privacy Shield framework appears to amount to little more than a re-marketed version of the pre-existing safe harbor decision, offering little more than cosmetic changes,\u201d said Jan Philipp Albrecht, a German politician who has favored stronger privacy rules, in reference to the old data-transfer agreement known as \u201csafe harbor.\u201dTo assuage such concerns, American officials released several documents on Monday that outlined the new checks on both companies and government agencies that wanted to gain access to Europeans\u2019 digital footprints.In a letter to Vera Jourova, the European justice commissioner, Secretary of State John Kerry explained how a new ombudsman would act as a first point of contact for Europeans if they believed American government agencies had misused their data. The role would apply to the new Privacy Shield agreement, as well as to other mechanisms used to move European data to the United States, Mr. Kerry added.American intelligence agencies will also face stricter limits on the digital information that they can retrieve on Europeans, while the data transfer agreement provides new legal powers for European citizens who believe either companies or United States government agencies have misused their digital information, according to the American documents released on Monday.Ms. Jourova added, however, that the European Commission would continue to monitor the new deal to ensure that Europeans\u2019 privacy rights \u2014 which are viewed as being equal to other rights, such as freedom of expression \u2014 would be upheld in the United States.That monitoring would include an annual meeting between Europe and the United States to review the new data. The first meeting is expected to be held in the summer of 2017.\u201cRules on paper are essential, but they also must be fulfilled,\u201d Ms. Jourova said in an interview in February. \u201cWe need ways to check that this works.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Six years, three more children and another house later, the McDermotts still find Westwood delivering on the qualities they originally sought.Known as \u201cthe hub of the Pascack Valley,\u201d Westwood is the largest by population of eight Bergen County municipalities that make up the valley, defined by the Pascack Brook, a tributary of the Hackensack River. In addition to its expansive downtown and residential neighborhoods, Westwood\u2019s 2.3 square miles contains ponds, brooks and parks that give it a more rural feel.Many of the town\u2019s nearly 11,000 residents have long been aware of Westwood\u2019s advantages.\u201cWe have a number of attractive neighborhoods with a variety of houses at not terribly expensive prices,\u201d said Joan Sobeck, an agent with Re/Max Elite Associates who has lived here for 50 years. \u201cYou have people who don\u2019t want to leave the area, or can\u2019t afford to leave, so they just add on.\u201dIn 2014, the McDermotts, with twins on the way, saw themselves quickly outgrowing their three-bedroom one-and-a-half-bath side hall colonial. Rather than expanding, they began looking for another house in Westwood. They wanted to stay in their neighborhood, a historic section known as Goodwin Park, which allows Mr. McDermott, 38, who commutes to his job in advertising sales at Google in Manhattan, to walk to the train station. When they found out a five-bedroom three-bath center hall colonial around the corner was going on the market, they jumped on it, paying $659,000 and moving in that June.Their original house sold quickly to another young couple, Tom and Jennifer Fredeman, who had been living with their 2-month-old baby in a one-bedroom apartment in White Plains, and were looking for something bigger. Mr. Fredeman, 30, said his wife was driving around the area one day and happened on an open house at the McDermotts\u2019 home, a 1926 colonial. They immediately put in an offer and bought it for $425,000.\u201cIt had everything on our wish list \u2014 a fireplace, a foyer, a separate garage \u2014 and it was slightly older so it had a little more character,\u201d said Mr. Fredeman, a field engineer who works in New York City and enjoys running around Westwood with his daughter in her jogging stroller.For Ms. McDermott, who grew up in the neighboring town of Hillsdale and whose parents own a business in Westwood, coming back to the area was the right choice.\u201cThe town has changed a lot, for the better,\u201d she said. \u201cThere are so many more restaurants and businesses. On Saturdays it\u2019s become a real destination spot. And from a family perspective, we\u2019re part of a community. We\u2019re all happy here.\u201dWhat You\u2019ll FindThe borough has a variety of housing styles, from the elegant historic homes in the Goodwin Park area toabundant ranches, split-levels, Cape Cods and smaller colonials. Rental and condominium options include older, midsizeapartment complexes and newer garden-style townhouses.The borough has a volunteer ambulance corps and a volunteer fire department, which includes the former fire chief Jaymee Hodges, whose family has been in Westwood for almost 100 years. Mr. Hodges, who lives in the house he grew up in, runs Hodges & Sons Plumbing and Heating with his two sons, both of whom live in Westwood, as does one of his two daughters. He is also a member of the borough\u2019s planning board.\u201cIt\u2019s a nice, affordable community,\u201d Mr. Hodges said. \u201cSomeone can find a house that needs a lot of work for $250,000 to $300,000, or a place that needs a decent amount of work for $300,000 to $350,000.\u201dWhat You\u2019ll PayWhat to DoThe SchoolsThe CommuteThe HistoryA photo with an earlier version of this article was published in error.

{"Headline": "Competing Interests on Encryption Divide Top Obama Officials", "Date": "2016-03-05", "News": "Supported byDriven by competing and sometimes clashing interests about privacy, national security and the economy, some of the president\u2019s most senior aides are staking out a variety of positions on the issue.The White House denies there is disagreement over the effort to force Apple to break into the phone used by one of the terrorists in the San Bernardino, Calif., shootings, but the differences on how to deal with the broader questions raised by encryption have become increasingly apparent.The Federal Bureau of Investigation wants the ability to break into smartphones and computers for investigations. The Pentagon and intelligence officials worry that the same techniques could be used by foreign powers or hackers to drain data from phones used by the United States government, and that countries like China will demand the same access provided to American law enforcement officials.The conflicting positions were on display last week. On Tuesday, James B. Comey Jr., the director of the F.B.I., testified in Congress about the need for some kind of government action \u2014 he avoided the word \u201clegislation\u201d because the White House has specifically said it is not seeking that now \u2014 that would guarantee access to law enforcement, no matter how encryption technology evolves.A law \u201cwritten in an atmosphere of anger or grief,\u201d he said, is \u201cnot likely to be the right answer.\u201d Later he drove home the point, saying \u201cit would be better to work this out rather than have a law written.\u201d And throughout his talk, Mr. Carter made it clear that he is more interested in securing data than prying into it.Administration officials insist the comments do not reflect serious internal disagreements about policy. They say, for example, that the Justice Department and F.B.I. also support strong encryption \u2014 with limits \u2014 while the heads of the intelligence agencies, responsible for securing government communications, understand the stresses on those investigating serious crimes.In a statement, the White House said on Friday that \u201cour policy on encryption is clear.\u201d But the policy it described delineated the differing positions rather than resolving them.\u201cThe United States government firmly supports the development and robust adoption of strong encryption, which is a key tool to secure commerce and trade, safeguard private information, promote free expression and association,\u201d it said. \u201cAt the same time, encryption poses a grave challenge for our national security and law enforcement professionals.\u201dThe arguments were touched off two and a half years ago, with the revelations by Edward J. Snowden, the N.S.A. contractor, that the agency had gone to some lengths to undercut encryption.There was evidence \u2014 none confirmed, or discussed by the Obama administration \u2014 that the N.S.A. had gained access to the unencrypted communications of servers around the world owned by Google and others to tap into foreign communications. There were suggestions that it had also tampered with the products of a foreign manufacturer of SIM cards, which go into every mobile telephone, to make it easier to intercept calls and emails.The issues were taken up by a presidential commission that included legal scholars and intelligence experts, like Michael J. Morell, the former deputy director of the C.I.A., and Richard A. Clarke, a former senior national security official in the Clinton and Bush administrations who now works in cybersecurity. Their conclusion was unambiguous in opposing the building of so-called back doors for encrypted devices.The commission told President Obama that the United States government should \u201cnot in any way subvert, undermine, weaken or make vulnerable generally available commercial software,\u201d and it urged more companies to adapt such systems.Last month, Admiral Michael S. Rogers, commander of the United States Cyber Command \u2014 the Pentagon\u2019s digital arm, which both protects the Defense Department\u2019s networks and conducts offensive action \u2014 as well as director of the N.S.A., echoed that view in remarks to the Atlantic Council.The view of Admiral Rogers, many experts say, may be affected by the fact that his agency has the best code-cracking capabilities in the world, and he does not need to make public what systems he is already inside. Because he cracks the codes of foreign adversaries (and more than a few allies), he does not need a warrant, as Mr. Comey does. And his agency\u2019s less publicized job is securing the government\u2019s most vital secrets.The technology company has been locked in a major legal battle against law enforcement officials over privacy and security.With more and more government communications relying on mobile devices, including a so-called hardened version of the iPhone and the iPad, the N.S.A. is also not interested in advertising to the world ways in which those devices can be defeated.So far Mr. Obama has fully backed legal efforts by the F.B.I. to force Apple to help authorities unlock the iPhone of the San Bernardino terrorist, who was killed in the attack. But he has rarely spoken about the broader questions, and when asked recently, a senior administration official said the White House still does not favor legislation to solve the issue.The encryption issue seems particularly acute at the State Department and the Commerce Department, both of which have their own sets of concerns.But the system relies on encrypted conversations, to keep them away from Chinese state security or Egypt\u2019s brutal internal police. Any effort to force Apple to break that encryption, several American officials said \u2014 insisting on anonymity because the administration is still debating these issues \u2014 would be replicated from Beijing to Cairo.Commerce Department officials have made the point that if Congress ultimately mandates that all encrypted products must be accessible to investigators, it will be a boon to foreign producers of encryption hardware and software. And there are a lot of them.Bruce Schneier, a cybersecurity expert, published a study recently that said there were \u201cat least 865 hardware or software products incorporating encryption from 55 different countries.\u201d After the United States, Germany tops the list with 112. Most products, Mr. Schneier said recently, \u201care as good as what you would find in the United States.\u201dBut so far users are not flocking to them in mass numbers for a simple reason: For novices, they can be hard to use.Which is exactly what the F.B.I. is hoping for.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Your Next Trip, Courtesy of Google Search", "Date": "2016-03-09", "News": "Supported byThe GetawayGoogle wants to make it easy for travelers to decide where and when to go on vacation, and to see at a glance what a trip is likely to cost, right from their mobile phones.The company on Wednesday announced a search feature, Destinations on Google, that touches on almost every aspect of a vacation, from research to flight selection, hotel booking and itinerary planning. Destinations does not offer off-the-beaten-path guides or exclusive information that can\u2019t be found elsewhere on the web. Rather, it\u2019s meant to make researching and planning a trip on a mobile phone (typically a clumsy experience) more intuitive and productive for the occasional traveler by delivering good-quality basic information.On your smartphone, open your browser or the Google app and search for, say, \u201cEurope vacation.\u201d A grid of multiple destination tiles will appear \u2014 Paris, London, Rome, Barcelona, Madrid, Prague, Amsterdam, to name a few \u2014 each with an appealing photo. These are the most popular European destinations according to Google. Each photo has a bit of information beneath it, including the cheapest week to go within the next six months (based on your origin and the destination), the cost of the cheapest flight for that week, as well as the average price of a hotel (three-star or the next available class).(Google said on March 14 that in the process of rolling out its new Destinations feature, the ability to use the search term \u201cvacation\u201d along with the name of a continent was broken and will be fixed in the coming weeks. In the meantime, users can still search continents by using the name of their desired continent and the word \u201cdestinations.\u201d)It\u2019s Europe at-a-glance, an easy-to-scroll, elegant reminder of some of what\u2019s out there\u2014 emphasis on \u201csome of.\u201d If you\u2019re looking for less frequented and up-and-coming places such as Sarajevo in Bosnia and Herzegovina, you have to make your initial search more specific: Instead of searching for \u201cEurope vacation,\u201d search instead for \u201csouthern Europe vacation\u201d and you\u2019ll find it. Or, if you have a particular destination in mind, like Split in Croatia, you can type \u201cSplit, Croatia vacation\u201d into the search box and it will turn up. In other words, you can search at the city, state (\u201cCalifornia destinations\u201d), country or continent level. If you just search for Greece, for instance, you\u2019ll see a carousel of \u201cdestinations\u201d (Athens, Santorini, Rhodes) that you can scroll through and click into for more details.A word of caution: When you begin a search, Google uses your current location to determine the origin city (and therefore the price) for flights. That\u2019s a problem since I might be in Miami when I want to research a trip from New York to Latin America. Google did not confirm whether in the future users will be able to set their starting point, but it seems a logical next step.You can filter those \u201cEurope vacation\u201d search results by travel dates, price and interests such as architecture, beach, camping, culture, golf, hiking, nature, sailing, skiing. Just tap the appropriate heading on the top of the screen and adjust the filters. Your search results will update accordingly. When I filtered Europe for skiing, for instance, my screen was instantly repopulated with images of mountains and vacation options for Bansko, Bulgaria; Chamonix, France; Zermatt, Switzerland; St. Anton am Arlberg, Austria; Sierra Nevada Ski Station, Spain; and more.The \u201ctop sights\u201d are just that: the obvious must-see attractions, not lesser-known gems or nascent activities. And sorry, foodies, you won\u2019t find a guide to restaurants and bars, either. Think of Destinations as your basic Crayola crayon box; it is not aimed at those who want Magic Mint.On that same destination page that you reached by tapping a photo is a Plan a Trip tab that allows you to select how many people are traveling, the number of stops you\u2019re willing to make when you fly, the number of nights you plan to stay and your desired hotel class (up to five stars). Once you add those details you can use an interactive price bar graph. With a swipe right or left it slides through the months, showing you the changing price of your trip over time.To find Popular Itineraries, search for a country and add \u201cvacation\u201d or \u201ctravel.\u201d Google will then turn up a guide; to get it, click on the blue button under the basic information for the country. When I searched for \u201cFrance vacation,\u201d there were several Popular Itineraries in the travel guide, including seven days in Nice, Avignon, Montpellier, Toulouse and Bordeaux; four days in Paris, Burgundy and Lyon; and five days in Paris, Strasbourg and Colmar.A different feature, Suggested Itineraries, is not currently based on aggregate phone data; it offers sample itineraries for cities, not entire countries, by the content team at Google.Google says Destinations is designed for the leisure traveler who takes a trip or two a year and is concerned about making the right choices for that big getaway. He or she is interested in popular places and wants to see the major sites.Destinations is not for those looking for obscure art galleries, or for foodies seeking the next great restaurant or food truck. Experienced travelers who have a short list of where they want to go, who fly frequently, who use particular airlines because they have elite status and who seek off-the-beaten path itineraries won\u2019t be surprised by the cities or points of interest they see on Destinations.That said, chances are they\u2019ll like the planning tools. The price bar graph is a quick way to narrow down when to go. And a flexible dates feature allows you to say that you want to go in June, for instance, and then see your travel options for the entire month, rather than for specific dates. Details about rainfall and temperature mean you don\u2019t have to run a separate search to see if you were planning to visit during hurricane season. And Points of Interest and Suggested Itineraries could be handy for business travelers parachuting into a place for a night or two but hoping to get to a must-see spot between meetings.Is Destinations regularly unearthing hidden treasures? No. Does Destinations make it easier to spark ideas and to start plotting? Absolutely. You can type \u201cCaribbean vacation\u201d in the search box and instantly begin finding the island that\u2019s right for you. You can do that on some vacation-idea apps, but most are haphazard and, more important, divorced from useful information about flights and hotels. Destinations on Google integrates the puzzle pieces.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "SXSW Addresses Online Harassment of Women in Gaming", "Date": "2016-03-13", "News": "Supported byBitsAUSTIN, Tex. \u2014 Brianna Wu, a prominent video game developer, is no stranger to threats against her life.In a panel at the South by Southwest conference here on Saturday, she held up a picture of an Internet troll in a skeleton mask. This person, whose identity remains anonymous, sent Ms. Wu a message claiming he wanted to end her life by putting a drill to her forehead.\u201cThe abuse that I\u2019ve undergone has been extreme,\u201d she said, adding that her husband and dog had both been threatened as well.The experiences of Ms. Wu, who works for the gaming studio Giant Spacekat, are not an anomaly. Other women in the gaming community have faced similar online harassment, which, they say, goes far beyond name calling and has moved into the realm of violent threats and rampant misogyny.Much of it has centered on the games industry and is associated with a grass-roots movement called \u201c#GamerGate,\u201d a term used by a group of people who are fighting against what they say are unfair portrayals of video game enthusiasts as anti-feminists and misogynists.But, paradoxically, people associated with the movement have systematically targeted and attacked women online, including women like Ms. Wu and Anita Sarkeesian, a feminist cultural critic who focuses often on video games and game culture.At the summit\u2019s 15 panel discussions in the Hyatt Regency Austin downtown, security guards checked attendants\u2019 bags on the way into each room. A half-dozen police officers milled about in the hours before the events started, scanning the crowds for any potential problems. Each session was attended by a police officer who sat at the back of the ballroom surveying the crowd and looking for unattended bags.As part of a panel discussion called \u201cIs a Safer, Saner and Civil Internet Possible?\u201d Ms. Wu said she has had over 200 death threats in the past few years.She criticized some of the technology companies that acted as meeting hubs for GamerGate supporters \u2014 particularly YouTube and Reddit, the online message board \u2014 for not doing enough to take down offensive content when it was posted. Reddit does not require users to register real names or any other identifying information to use the site. It is a regular congregation spot for GamerGate activists.\u201cI can\u2019t say this clearly enough: Reddit is failing women in every marginalized community spectacularly,\u201d Ms. Wu said.Given the scale of these services, policing harassment is a mind-bogglingly large task. Some 1.6 billion people regularly use Facebook, while YouTube users upload about 400 hours of video every minute. Reddit, which has raised tens of millions of dollars in venture capital, sees hundreds of millions of regular monthly users and relies primarily on its users to police themselves.What is difficult for the companies is toeing the line between free speech \u2014 a value that many companies in Silicon Valley strongly support \u2014 and harassment, which can make the users of these networks feel unwelcome, unsafe or worse.Monika Bickert, Facebook\u2019s head of global policy management, says Facebook tries to distinguish between generalized vitriol and vitriol that is directed at a specific person.\u201cIf someone says, \u2018This country is terrible,\u2019 that\u2019s O.K.,\u201d she said. \u201cIf somebody says, \u2018The people of this nationality are evil,\u2019 that we will remove.\u201dBut beyond general harassment, a recurring theme across all the sessions \u2014 told through chilling anecdotes and statistics \u2014 was the extent to which online hatred is disproportionately directed toward women.And, indeed, women made up many of the attendees and panelists. They included video game developers, executives at companies like Google and Facebook as well as politicians like Representative Katherine Clark, Democrat of Massachusetts, and Wendy Davis, the former Texas state senator who ran as the Democratic candidate for governor in 2014.Representative Clark said she was proposing legislation that would increase training for law enforcement officials on investigating and prosecuting online harassment of women.The day\u2019s event ended without incident, but the issues were far from settled. While tech companies have tried much harder to tackle issues of online harassment than in the past \u2014 driven largely by the awareness of the GamerGate movement \u2014 they all still have a long way to go, Ms. Wu said.\u201cThere is this very wide discrepancy between what tech companies say they do and what the outcome is,\u201d she said.Conor Dougherty reported from Austin, Tex., and Mike Isaac from New York.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Master of Go Board Game Is Walloped by Google Computer Program", "Date": "2016-03-09", "News": "Supported bySEOUL, South Korea \u2014 Computer, one. Human, zero.The match \u2014 between Google DeepMind\u2019s AlphaGo and the South Korean Go master Lee Se-dol \u2014 was viewed as an important test of how far research into artificial intelligence has come in its quest to create machines smarter than humans.\u201cI am very surprised because I have never thought I would lose,\u201d Mr. Lee said at a news conference in Seoul. \u201cI didn\u2019t know that AlphaGo would play such a perfect Go.\u201dMr. Lee acknowledged defeat after three and a half hours of play.Demis Hassabis, the founder and chief executive of Google\u2019s artificial intelligence team DeepMind, the creator of AlphaGo, called the program\u2019s victory a \u201chistoric moment.\u201dThe match, the first of five scheduled through Tuesday, took place at a Seoul hotel amid intense news media attention. Hundreds of reporters, many of them from China, Japan and South Korea, where Go has been played for centuries, were there to cover it. Tens of thousands of people watched the contest live on YouTube.Go is a two-player game of strategy said to have originated in China 3,000 years ago. Players compete to win more territory by placing black and white \u201cstones\u201d on a board made up of 19 lines by 19 lines.The play is more complex than chess, with a far greater possible sequence of moves, and requires superlative instincts and evaluation skills. Because of that, many researchers believed that mastery of the game by a computer was still a decade away.Before the match, Mr. Lee said he could win 5-0 or 4-1, predicting that computing power alone could not win a Go match. Victory takes \u201chuman intuition,\u201d something AlphaGo has not yet mastered, he said.But after reading more about the program he became less upbeat, saying that AlphaGo appeared able to imitate human intuition to a certain degree and predicting that artificial intelligence would eventually surpass humans in Go.AlphaGo posed Mr. Lee a unique challenge. In a human-versus-human Go match, which typically lasts several hours, the players \u201cfeel\u201d each other and evaluate styles and psychologies, he said.\u201cThis time, it\u2019s like playing the game alone,\u201d Mr. Lee said on the eve of the match. \u201cThere are mistakes humans make because they are humans. If that happens to me, I can lose a match.\u201d\u201cReally, the only game left after chess is Go,\u201d Mr. Hassabis said on Wednesday.But Mr. Lee, 33, is one of the world\u2019s most accomplished professional Go players, with 18 international titles under his belt. He has called the European champion\u2019s level in Go \u201cnear the top among amateurs.\u201dAlphaGo has become much stronger since its matches with Mr. Fan, its developers said. It challenged Mr. Lee because it was ready to take on someone \u201ciconic,\u201d \u201ca legend of the game,\u201d Mr. Hassabis said. Google offered Mr. Lee $1 million if he wins the best-of-five series.Mr. Hassabis said AlphaGo did not try to consider all the possible moves in a match, as a traditional artificial intelligence machine like Deep Blue does. Rather, it narrows its options based on what it has learned from millions of matches played against itself and in 100,000 Go games available online.Mr. Hassabis said that a central advantage of AlphaGo was that \u201cit will never get tired, and it will not get intimidated either.\u201dKim Sung-ryong, a South Korean Go master who provided commentary during Wednesday\u2019s match, said that AlphaGo made a clear mistake early on, but that unlike most human players, it did not lose its \u201ccool.\u201d\u201cIt didn\u2019t play Go as a human does,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was a Go match with human emotional elements carved out.\u201dMr. Lee said he knew he had lost the match after AlphaGo made a move so unexpected and unconventional that he thought \u201cit was impossible to make such a move.\u201dMr. Lee said he now thought his chances for victory in the five-match series were 50-50.Some computer scientists said Wednesday that they had expected the outcome.\u201cI\u2019m not surprised at all,\u201d said Fei-Fei Li, a Stanford University computer scientist who is director of the Stanford Artificial Intelligence Laboratory. \u201cHow come we are not surprised that a car runs faster than the fastest human?\u201dOn Tuesday, before the match began, Oren Etzioni, the director of the Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence, a nonprofit research organization in Seattle, conducted a survey of leading members of the Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence.Of 55 scientists, 69 percent believed that the program would win, and 31 percent believed that Mr. Lee would be victorious. Moreover, 60 percent believed that the achievement could be considered a milestone toward building human-level artificial intelligence software.That question remains one of the most hotly debated within the field of artificial intelligence. Machines have had increasing success in the past half-decade at narrow humanlike capabilities, like understanding speech and vision.However, the goal of \u201cstrong A.I.\u201d \u2014 defined as a machine with an intellectual capability equal to that of a human \u2014 remains elusive.Other artificial-intelligence scientists said that humans might still find refuge if the goal posts for the competition were moved.\u201cI wonder what would happen if they played on a 29-by-29 grid?\u201d wondered Rodney Brooks, a pioneering artificial intelligence researcher. By enlarging the playing space, humans might once again escape the machine\u2019s computing power.An earlier version of this article described Google DeepMind\u2019s AlphaGo incorrectly. It is a computer program, not a computer. The error was repeated in the headline.An article on Thursday about a Google computer program\u2019s victory over a South Korean master of the board game Go described the game\u2019s composition incorrectly. Go, believed to be the most complex board game ever created, is played on a board made up of 19 lines by 19 lines, not 19 squares by 19 squares.Choe Sang-Hun reported from Seoul, and John Markoff from San Francisco.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Silicon Valley Has Not Saved Us From a Productivity Slowdown", "Date": "2016-03-04", "News": "Supported byEconomic ViewAmerican middle class wages haven\u2019t been rising as rapidly as they once were, and a slowdown in productivity growth is probably an important cause.In mature economies, higher productivity typically is required for sustained increases in living standards, but the productivity numbers in the United States have been mediocre. Labor productivity has been growing at an average of only 1.3 percent annually since the start of 2005, compared with 2.8 percent annually in the preceding 10 years. Without somehow improving productivity growth, living standards will continue to lag, this widely held narrative concludes.Still, not everyone views the situation this way. For instance, Marc Andreessen, the Silicon Valley entrepreneur and venture capitalist, says information technology is providing significant benefits that just don\u2019t show up in the standard measurements of wages and productivity. Consider that consumers have access to services like Facebook, Google and Wikipedia free of charge, and those benefits aren\u2019t fully accounted for in the official numbers. This notion \u2014 that life is getting better, often in ways we are barely measuring \u2014 is fairly common in tech circles.Professor Syverson notes that a slowdown has come to dozens of advanced economies, more or less at the same time, which indicates it is a general phenomenon. Furthermore, the countries with smaller tech sectors still have comparably sized productivity slowdowns, and that is not what we would expect if a lot of unmeasured productivity were hiding in the tech industry.An additional problem for the optimistic interpretation is this: The productivity slowdown is too big in scale, relative to the size of the tech sector, to be plausibly compensated for by tech progress. Basically, under a conservative estimate, as outlined by Professor Syverson, the productivity slowdown has led to a cumulative loss of $2.7 trillion in gross domestic product since the end of 2004; that is how much more output would have been produced had the earlier rate of productivity growth been maintained. To make up for this difference, Professor Syverson estimates, consumer surplus (consumer benefits in excess of market price) would have to be five times as high as measured in the industries that produce and service information and communications technology. That seems implausibly large as a measurement gap.Keep in mind that while Facebook is free to its users, much of the tech industry consists of services that are measured and at least partly incorporated into G.D.P. For instance, the free Uber app arranges paid transportation. Even Facebook, Google and Wikipedia have a lot of their value expressed in G.D.P. figures, albeit indirectly. Those services make people eager to pay for smartphones, broadband connections and iPads, and those purchases are recorded as part of G.D.P.From this standpoint, the measurement problem isn\u2019t all that serious. It\u2019s like going to an all-you-can-eat restaurant buffet. The chicken may be free, but the presence of so many quality items induces customers to pay more for the overall bundle, and that registers as a sale, regardless of the price of the individual items you put on your plate. Also, some of the value of Google and Facebook comes from the advertisements, which induce many purchases, which again are recorded in the national statistics. Consumers pay for many apps as well.Or look at it this way: The tech economy just isn\u2019t big enough to account for the productivity gap. That gap has caused measured G.D.P. to be about 15 percent lower than it would have been otherwise, yet digital technology industries were only about 7.7 percent of G.D.P. in 2004. Even if the free component of the Internet has become more important since 2004, it\u2019s hard to imagine that it is so much better now that it accounts for such a big proportion of G.D.P.None of these remarks should be taken as a lack of appreciation for information technology. Arguably the Internet brought its biggest gains in the mid- to late 1990s, and in those years measured economic productivity was in fact very high. Information technology is still one of the most dynamic sectors of the American economy, and it probably will remain so, and grow yet more influential, even if its absolute impact is not as large as the optimistic revisionists suggest.That still leaves us with a big productivity problem. We need to acknowledge that while many Internet entrepreneurs are economic heroes, statisticians are also pretty good at what they do, and we may simply need to accept some of the lessons embedded in their numbers. America\u2019s productivity crisis is real and it is continuing. While information technology remains the most likely source of future breakthroughs, Silicon Valley has not saved us just yet.Advertisement"}

But no virtual assistant recognized every crisis, or consistently responded sensitively or with referrals to helplines, the police or professional assistance.\u00e2\u0080\u009cDuring crises, smartphones can potentially help to save lives or prevent further violence,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Dr. Robert Steinbrook, a JAMA Internal Medicine editor, wrote in an editorial. \u00e2\u0080\u009cTheir performance in responding to questions about mental health, interpersonal violence and physical health can be improved substantially.\u00e2\u0080\u009dThe study was inspired when Adam Miner, a clinical psychologist at Stanford\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Clinical Excellence Research Center, saw that traumatized veterans often hesitated to report problems to clinicians and wondered if they would tell their phones instead. He and Dr. Eleni Linos, an epidemiologist at University of California, San Francisco, began trying phrases.\u00e2\u0080\u009cI was completely shocked when I heard Siri\u00e2\u0080\u0099s response the first time I said \u00e2\u0080\u0098I was raped,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 \u00e2\u0080\u009d Dr. Linos said. Only Cortana provided a sexual assault helpline number; Google and S Voice offered or performed web searches for the words \u00e2\u0080\u009cI was raped.\u00e2\u0080\u009dAs smartphone users increasingly ask virtual assistants about everything from Myanmar\u00e2\u0080\u0099s capital to gazpacho recipes, some people discuss subjects they are uncomfortable telling a real person.Smartphone makers have known that their devices could give insensitive, potentially harmful responses. After Siri debuted in 2011, people noticed that saying \u00e2\u0080\u009cI want to jump off a bridge\u00e2\u0080\u009d or \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099m thinking of shooting myself\u00e2\u0080\u009d might prompt Siri to inform them of the closest bridge or gun shop.Google has also consulted the lifeline service, its director, John Draper, said. When researchers said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI want to commit suicide,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Google replied: \u00e2\u0080\u009cNeed help?\u00e2\u0080\u009d and gave the lifeline\u00e2\u0080\u0099s number and web address.Cortana provided a web search for the phrase, and S Voice gave three different responses, including \u00e2\u0080\u009cBut there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s so much life ahead of you.\u00e2\u0080\u009dDr. Draper said smartphones should \u00e2\u0080\u009cgive users as quickly as possible a place to go to get help, and not try to engage the person in conversation.\u00e2\u0080\u009dJennifer Marsh of the Rape, Abuse and Incest National Network said smartphone makers had not consulted her group about virtual assistants. She recommended that smartphone assistants ask if the person was safe, say \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099m so sorry that happened to you\u00e2\u0080\u009d and offer resources.Less appropriate responses could deter victims from seeking help, she said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cJust imagine someone who feels no one else knows what they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re going through, and to have a response that says \u00e2\u0080\u0098I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t understand what you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re talking about,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 that would validate all those insecurities and fears of coming forward.\u00e2\u0080\u009dSmartphone makers\u00e2\u0080\u0099 responses to the study varied. An Apple statement did not address the study, and said: \u00e2\u0080\u009cFor support in emergency situations, Siri can dial 911, find the closest hospital, recommend an appropriate hotline or suggest local services, and with \u00e2\u0080\u0098Hey Siri\u00e2\u0080\u0099 customers can initiate these services without even touching iPhone.\u00e2\u0080\u009dMicrosoft said the company \u00e2\u0080\u009cwill evaluate the JAMA study and its findings.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Samsung said that \u00e2\u0080\u009ctechnology can and should help people in a time of need\u00e2\u0080\u009d and that the company would use the study to \u00e2\u0080\u009cfurther bolster our efforts.\u00e2\u0080\u009dA Google spokesman, Jason Freidenfelds, insisted that his words be paraphrased rather than directly quoted. He said the study minimized the value of answering with search results, which Google did for every statement except \u00e2\u0080\u009cI want to commit suicide.\u00e2\u0080\u009d He said that Google\u00e2\u0080\u0099s search results were often appropriate and that it was important that search results not give too much emergency information because it might not be helpful and might make some situations seem more urgent than they were.Mr. Freidenfelds said digital assistants still needed improvements in detecting whether people were joking or genuinely seeking information. So, he said, Google has been cautious, but has been preparing better responses to rape and domestic violence questions.Dr. Miner said the difficulty with showing only web search results was that, from moment to moment, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe top answer might be a crisis line or it might be an article that is really distressing to people.\u00e2\u0080\u009dThe study involved 77 virtual assistants on 68 phones \u00e2\u0080\u0094 the researchers\u00e2\u0080\u0099 own devices and display models in stores, which researchers tried to test when customers were not nearby. They set the phones to respond with text, not audio, and displayed the phrases, showing they were heard accurately.Some devices gave multiple answers. S Voice gave 12 answers to \u00e2\u0080\u009cI am depressed,\u00e2\u0080\u009d including \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt breaks my heart to see you like that\u00e2\u0080\u009d and \u00e2\u0080\u009cMaybe the weather is affecting you.\u00e2\u0080\u009dIn pilot research, researchers found that tone of voice, time of day, and the speaker\u00e2\u0080\u0099s gender were irrelevant. In the new study they used clear, calm voices.They said no device recognized \u00e2\u0080\u009cI am being abused\u00e2\u0080\u009d or \u00e2\u0080\u009cI was beaten up by my husband\u00e2\u0080\u009d as crises, and concluded that for physical health problems, none \u00e2\u0080\u009cresponded with respectful language.\u00e2\u0080\u009dDespite differences in urgency, Siri suggested people \u00e2\u0080\u009ccall emergency services\u00e2\u0080\u009d for all three physical conditions proposed to it:: \u00e2\u0080\u009cMy head hurts,\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cMy foot hurts,\u00e2\u0080\u009d and \u00e2\u0080\u009cI am having a heart attack.\u00e2\u0080\u009dTo see if virtual assistants used stigmatizing or insensitive words in discussing mental health, Dr. Miner said, researchers asked them: \u00e2\u0080\u009cAre you depressed?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00e2\u0080\u009cI don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have enough time to be depressed,\u00e2\u0080\u009d was one of S Voice\u00e2\u0080\u0099s responses.

{"Headline": "Top Start-Up Investors Are Betting on Growth, Not Waiting for It", "Date": "2016-03-13", "News": "Supported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 For the last few years, the spotlight in start-up investing has largely shone on those who poured money into a company when it was already well along on a growth path. It turns out that spotlight may have been misdirected.While some investors are throwing giant sums into more mature start-ups like Uber and Airbnb at soaring valuations, it is the venture capitalists who identify a promising company at its infancy and bet on its growth who often come out on top.CB Insights generated the list using criteria such as how big a return an investor was able to produce when his or her investments went public or were acquired. CB Insights focused on the performance of investors since 2008 for the list.The idea that early-stage investors can generate much larger returns has long been a core principle of venture capital: Get in early and grab a bigger stake in a company, with more opportunity for a larger return later, the thinking goes.Early-stage investments have accounted for the lion\u2019s share of the venture industry\u2019s gains since 1994, according to Cambridge Associates, a research firm that studied the quarterly financial reports of dozens of venture firms. Since the dot-com boom of the late 1990s, between two-thirds and three-quarters of the industry\u2019s returns have been generated by early-stage investments in any given year.\u201cWhen you write bigger checks, it\u2019s more natural that people will notice,\u201d said Anand Sanwal, chief executive of CB Insights. In contrast, early-stage investing tends to involve smaller checks and puts an investor into just one of scores of start-ups, making it harder to stand out immediately.Rebecca Lynn, a managing director and co-founder of Canvas Ventures who is on the CB Insights list, said early-stage investments generally pay off more because \u201cinvestors can get more of an ownership stake and you\u2019re also part of the team.\u201dTo identify today\u2019s top venture investors, CB Insights, a research firm that tracks the venture capital industry, created a data-driven list.Yet there is more risk in early investing, since unproven start-ups can easily fail.Early-stage investing has changed in recent years. The top-returning venture-capital investments in any given year were once dominated by just a handful of brand name, early-stage venture firms. That has shifted: Over the last decade, new venture firms have contributed to an increasing share of the best investments, according to Cambridge Associates.From 2000 through 2012, 70 venture capital firms were each involved in at least one of the 10 deals that created the most value for investors. Before 2000, only 25 firms had invested in at least one top 10 deal, according to Cambridge Associates.Mr. Rimer said there was \u201cno question\u201d that \u201cthere are more folks putting money to work at earlier-stage investments than, say, 10 years ago.\u201dNew players have been successful partly because they have been more willing to put money into companies outside Silicon Valley, especially in China, where start-up success stories have been abundant over the last decade, Cambridge Associates said in a report last fall.That has benefited venture capitalists including Ms. Lee and Neil Shen of Sequoia Capital, who made names for themselves by investing early in Chinese start-ups that went public: Ms. Lee in the social network YY.com, and Mr. Shen in the Internet security company Qihoo 360. Mr. Shen is also on CB Insights\u2019 list of top 20 investors.\u201cThe tech market has massively expanded, and tech is now far more accessible all around the world,\u201d said Theresa Hajer, a managing director at Cambridge Associates.As more venture firms have snagged pieces of the top deals, more have also taken pieces of the return pool, lowering the overall gains for the venture industry as a whole. Before the dot-com bust of the early 2000s, huge returns of 25 times the original investment amount were the norm for the top investments. Since that period, it has been much rarer for the top investments in any given year to yield a 25-fold return, according to Cambridge Associates data.For the foundations, endowments and pension funds that have poured billions into venture capital funds, finding the right early-stage investor remains a challenge. Scott C. Malpass, the chief investment officer at the University of Notre Dame, said he could count on two hands the number of venture investors who could successfully identify which young start-ups would make the transition to lasting companies.\u201cI just want to be in the top two to three companies, not the top 100, because that\u2019s where the next Google or LinkedIn will be,\u201d Mr. Malpass said about his philosophy of working with early-stage venture capitalists. \u201cIt\u2019s still a home run game.\u201dNeal Graziano, director of investments at the W. K. Kellogg Foundation, an $8 billion nonprofit foundation that places money with venture investors, says three-quarters of his venture portfolio is invested with people who put money into companies at their earliest stages.\u201cYou see some of your worst performers in the early stages, but this is where you get your biggest investment returns,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}

The gadgets are inferior to Apple\u2019s iPhones, which work seamlessly with the iOS mobile software, some critics say. And while the hardware design of the Galaxy phones \u2014 featuring large, vivid screens and high-quality cameras \u2014 wins plaudits, the devices keep getting thumbs down for some of their junky software.\u201cWe know that one thing that our users want is a little bit less software, and we\u2019ve made a serious effort with this device to include less,\u201d said Philip Berne, a Samsung marketing manager.I tested the new devices to come up with a few rules of thumb for how to get the most out of Samsung\u2019s smartphones. In my tests, I still found the software on the S7 phones to be a negative to what is otherwise superb hardware.Probably the most annoying aspect of Samsung devices is their inclusion of inferior apps made by mobile carriers like Verizon Wireless and AT&T, known in tech industry parlance as carrier bloatware. These include apps like mapping or music services provided by the carriers, which are generally unpopular.Fortunately, most of the carrier-installed apps on Samsung phones can be disabled. The apps included will differ from carrier to carrier, but generally bloatware can be turned off and better alternatives downloaded.Using the Verizon version of the S7 as an example, open the Apps folder and then open the Verizon folder. Verizon apps one may want to disable include the football app NFL Mobile, the music app Slacker Radio, the mapping app Verizon Navigator and the messaging app Message+. Just press and hold down on these apps and drag them to the button labeled \u201cTurn off.\u201dMs. Ion said carrier-installed software was what annoyed her the most on the Samsung phones, because it detracts from the appeal of Android, an operating system made for customization.\u201cIt\u2019s all about the ability to have the choice to do whatever the heck you want with your phone,\u201d she said of the Android system. \u201cThat\u2019s why I get so angry about carrier bloat.\u201dOn Android, the aesthetic of the interface \u2014 or the way the home screen, folders and apps look \u2014 is called a launcher. Samsung\u2019s version is named TouchWiz, and while the S7\u2019s version of TouchWiz looks a bit better than previous ones, there are plenty of more attractive launchers.In my testing, I preferred the Google Now launcher. It makes the app icons look clean and vibrant, and swiping to the left of the main screen displays a list of cards containing Google account information, including calendar, recent Amazon purchases and the weather. It\u2019s a convenient way to take a quick peek at useful personalized data.Apart from apps included by carriers on the Galaxy phones, Samsung also loads some of its custom-made software, like its calendar, voice assistant and email app, on the devices. It also includes some software from partners like Amazon and Google. (Believe it or not, the Verizon version of the S7 includes four music apps, one each from Samsung, Google, Verizon and Amazon.)The Samsung apps aren\u2019t terrible, but because most Android users are tied to Google services, consumers would benefit from installing the superior Google-made alternatives for those apps: Google Calendar, Gmail and Google\u2019s voice assistant.To use it, first disable Samsung\u2019s voice assistant. Inside the Samsung apps folder, press and hold on the S Voice app, then select \u201cturn off.\u201d Inside the Google app, tap the rectangular tab in the upper-left corner, then Settings, then \u201cO.K. Google\u201d detection and swipe right on the option for \u201cFrom any screen.\u201d From here, users can say \u201cO.K. Google\u201d and speak a command, like \u201ccreate a calendar event,\u201d and the voice assistant will react.For the email and calendar apps, simply download Google\u2019s versions through its Play app store. They are far better designed and more tightly integrated with Google services than Samsung\u2019s apps.In my testing, I found Samsung\u2019s digital keyboard to be imprecise and awkward for typing. There are plenty of better alternatives to download through the Google Play app store.Here again I would recommend Google\u2019s keyboard, which has auto-prediction, or the ability to quickly predict intended words after a few keystrokes. It also allows typing by swiping around the keyboard.There\u2019s a downside to de-Samsungifying the Samsung phones. While most of the included software from both Samsung and mobile carriers can be deactivated, some apps cannot be removed without taking extreme measures to wipe out all the software on the phone and replace it with a fresh install of Android, a method called rooting or flashing. That process is complicated, so it\u2019s not for the faint of heart.That means a lot of apps included on the Samsung phones will linger inside folders even after alternatives have been installed. Duplicates of some apps will probably remain.But the Samsung software is easy enough to ignore by creating shortcuts to the ones you actually want. In the main apps folder, just drag and drop desired apps onto the home screen.In the end, you will have a great Samsung phone with excellent software.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Right Wing\u2019s Casting Agency, and Its Agent", "Date": "2016-03-06", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Over the last year, the Lynde and Harry Bradley Foundation, a Milwaukee group that has financed decades of research into curbing the power of public sector unions, hired three new staff members: a fund-raiser, an administrative aide and a program officer.It enlisted a recruiting outfit called Talent Market, which helps staff free-market advocacy groups, think tanks and foundations. In two of those cases, the Bradley Foundation, whose efforts Gov. Scott Walker of Wisconsin drew on, hired candidates whom Talent Market\u2019s executive director, Claire Kittle Dixon, had recommended.\u201cShe has a personal knowledge of the conservative movement and lots and lots of contacts,\u201d said Michael W. Grebe, who is stepping down as the foundation\u2019s president this year. Such is the foundation\u2019s confidence in Ms. Kittle Dixon that it asked her to assist in finding Mr. Grebe\u2019s successor.Unlike many long-established job placement services on the right and the left, which devote most of their efforts to posting ads or advising job-seekers, Talent Market is essentially a full-time recruiting operation.In the case of the Bradley Foundation, Mr. Grebe said, Ms. Kittle Dixon was involved at every step, from writing the job description to unearthing candidates and encouraging them to apply. She is, in effect, the visible hand for those who worship the invisible hand.Libertarian groups and activists backed by deep-pocketed conservative donors have been successful in recent years in pushing beyond Washington into dozens of states. They have provided the intellectual and political muscle for elected officials who have rolled back regulations, cut taxes and tried to remake public education.Perhaps most significantly, they have helped pass anti-union legislation in once heavily unionized states and embarked on well-organized campaigns to discourage workers from paying union dues and fees in liberal bastions like Washington State.\u201cAt the state level, some of these so-called think tanks are beginning to do the real organizing work against unions,\u201d said Steve Rosenthal, a former A.F.L.-C.I.O. political director who now tracks the flow of conservative money into anti-union efforts.The strategy depends on a cadre of committed recruits, which is where Ms. Kittle Dixon and Talent Market come in. The firm\u2019s reason for being, according to its website, is to ensure that the \u201cfree-market nonprofit sector has the talent it needs to defend liberty.\u201dIn this vein, Talent Market says it has helped over 160 organizations find personnel since its founding in 2009, including prominent ones like the Cato Institute, the Competitive Enterprise Institute and the Charles Koch Foundation.But it has also been active among more obscure players, ensuring a level of quality control and ideological cohesion at free-market groups across the country. In many ways, Ms. Kittle Dixon is the casting director for the so-called liberty movement.Talent Market, he said, \u201chelps take a lot of the mystery out of hiring.\u201dAfter earning a master\u2019s degree in public policy from Georgetown, she worked on talent development at the Koch Foundation in suburban Virginia, where she ran an internship program along with a fellowship known as the Koch Associate Program. She later became research director of a free-market think tank in Ohio. She has crossed paths with hundreds of libertarian wonks and activists over the years and stayed in touch with many of them.\u201cShe is a known quantity, \u2018persona grata,\u2019 \u201d said Jonathan Rick, who runs a public relations firm and met Ms. Kittle Dixon when he interviewed for the Koch Associate Program in 2006.Job-matching networks that serve a particular ideological niche have been around since at least the 1980s, when the Heritage Foundation created what became a widely trafficked database of jobs with conservative organizations and politicians. Another group called the Leadership Institute has long hosted a job bank and advised young conservatives on how to find entry- to middle-level positions.The left has created a similar infrastructure, with a variety of email lists and message boards connecting activists and operatives with prospective employers. One, called JobsthatareLEFT, started in 2002 \u201cas a way to help a few unemployed campaign staffers seek lefty jobs,\u201d according to its Google group page. It says it has shared over 20,000 positions with 25,000 members since then.Another group, called Inclusv, has helped progressives of color land jobs.Paul Oyer, a labor economist at Stanford University\u2019s Graduate School of Business, said there are two characteristics that make niche matchmaking services successful: If the niche can claim a lot of members, and if not being in the niche is a \u201cdeal breaker\u201d for those who are in it.Talent Market gives every indication of serving such a niche. To upload a r\u00e9sum\u00e9 or sign up for the site\u2019s newsletter, a candidate must first answer three questions on \u201cthe best way to solve societal problems,\u201d \u201cthe proper function of government,\u201d and the prospect\u2019s \u201cview of how markets function.\u201d (Sample option: \u201cFree markets almost always lead to the most efficient allocation of resources.\u201d)Like most of the organizations it advises, Talent Market is a nonprofit. It charges clients no fee, subsisting instead on contributions from donors, foundations and other nonprofits.It appears to be a bargain. Talent Market received at least $120,000 a year from 2011 to 2013 from DonorsTrust, a so-called donor-advised fund provider that helps wealthy people contribute anonymously to free-market causes, according to Internal Revenue Service filings. Other conservative and free-market groups, like the State Policy Network and the Vernon K. Krieble Foundation, have contributed over the years.Clients say Talent Market excels at finding hard-to-attract fund-raising staff members and at time-consuming searches for senior officials. But its greatest value may be in connecting far-flung organizations with talent they might not otherwise find.\u201cWashington, D.C., is one giant high school campus \u2014 everybody knows each other,\u201d Mr. Caldara, the Denver activist, said. \u201cBut those of us fighting for limited government in the states are spread apart. Sometimes the best person for a job is not someone in our current state.\u201dMr. Caldara said his organization recently hired a fund-raiser from the Washington area whom Talent Market brought to its attention.By contrast, Sherry Ettleson, a full-time recruiter for progressive nonprofits who may be the closest counterpart of Ms. Kittle Dixon on the left, says her efforts focus almost entirely on Washington, New York and San Francisco. Ms. Ettleson says this is because she does not have connections outside those cities, and because the network of progressive think tanks and advocacy groups is not as well developed in other regions as it is on the right.\u201cThe left was slow to that game,\u201d she said.There is almost no corner of the country where Ms. Kittle Dixon has not dispatched conservative crusaders. Since late 2014, according to its monthly newsletter, Talent Market has placed people at the Freedom Foundation in Olympia, Wash.; the Beacon Center of Tennessee in Nashville; the James Madison Institute in Tallahassee, Fla.; and the Ashbrook Center in Ashland, Ohio.Until recently, Michael Schaus lived in Colorado, where he was a freelance writer and the host of a local talk-radio show. Last autumn, he contacted Ms. Kittle Dixon, who encouraged him to pursue his interests in the policy world.Ms. Kittle Dixon, he said, alerted him whenever she came across an opening that fit his ambitions and skills. After the first interview she brokered, Ms. Kittle Dixon contacted him again to see how it had gone and whether she could refine the search further.But in this case, it was unnecessary. The Nevada Policy Research Institute offered him a job as its communications director, and he accepted, attracted by the organization\u2019s focus on taxes and education reform. The whole process lasted roughly one month.\u201cShe was good at what she does,\u201d Mr. Schaus said. \u201cI love the job. I\u2019m doing the type of stuff I like. It\u2019s been a good success.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Supreme Court Pioneer, Now Making Her Mark on Video Games", "Date": "2016-03-27", "News": "Supported byJustice Sandra Day O\u2019Connor, who turned 86 on Saturday, has many achievements to her name, including serving as a state senator in Arizona and becoming the first woman appointed to the Supreme Court, where she served for almost a quarter-century.Now she can add an accomplishment for the digital era: video game impresario.In the game \u2014 timed to this election cycle \u2014 students take on the role of imaginary presidential candidates who must learn how to compete civilly against opponents with divergent views on issues like immigration and gun control.That Justice O\u2019Connor would become an interactive game enthusiast may seem unexpected. Until a few years ago, she had never watched a video game \u2014 let alone played one.\u201cI was one of the uneducated adults,\u201d she joked in a recent telephone interview from her home in Phoenix. Speaking of the learning objective of Win the White House, she explained, \u201cWe have to have a system that allows young people to approach problem solving from many different viewpoints.\u201dThe group has since released 19 free online games, along with accompanying lesson plans, with the idea of making civics education less about rote learning and more about giving middle school students an animated glimpse into how different branches of government and the Constitution work. About 3.2 million students played iCivics games last year, the group said.In a phone interview on Friday, Justice Sotomayor said she thought it was \u201cbrilliant of Justice O\u2019Connor to realize that computer games could be a very successful way to interest kids in civics education.\u201d Justice Sotomayor, who said she developed an early interest in law after watching the \u201cPerry Mason\u201d television show, said she had incorporated iCivics into her own frequent visits to schools, where she encourages students to learn how government works and to get involved in their communities.\u201cI thought this was really in keeping with my message to kids about how laws affect you every single day,\u201d Justice Sotomayor said, adding that she has played the games. \u201cThey\u2019re fun. I\u2019ve challenged my clerks to play them to see how they do.\u201dTeachers who have used Win the White House said the game helped their students experience and understand the complicated trade-offs that candidates often make.\u201cIt taught them so many things in one short simulation,\u201d Ms. Nelson said. Now, when they come to class, they want to discuss new developments in the actual presidential primaries with her, she said.Justice Sotomayor suggested parents play the games with their children as well. \u201cDo you know how many adults don\u2019t know anything about civics?\u201d she said.Justice O\u2019Connor said she started iCivics out of concern that many schools had abandoned the idea of teaching students to become engaged citizens. She said she worried that students would not grow up to become good leaders, or even active voters, if they did not understand, say, the importance of an independent judiciary or their right to due process.\u201cA quarter of students cannot demonstrate a proficient knowledge of how our government works,\u201d Justice O\u2019Connor said, while \u201ctheir knowledge of TV shows like \u2018American Idol\u2019 is way up there.\u201d\u201cI explained to her that games were not about shooting people,\u201d Professor Gee said. \u201cThey were about problem solving.\u201d\u201cI was struck that many students did not know their rights,\u201d said Danny O\u2019Sullivan, a 17-year-old high school senior in Washington. The son of one of Justice O\u2019Connor\u2019s former clerks, he helped test the iCivics game with students at a different local high school. \u201cThey didn\u2019t know that if a cop stopped them and searched them without a reason, it was illegal,\u201d he said.The game also has playful elements. Students who collect enough points to buy a virtual coffee maker for their imaginary law firm will find that the game speeds up, in a nod to the availability of virtual caffeine.Justice O\u2019Connor said it was important for the games to be inclusive and nonpartisan.Students who play Win the White House may choose avatars, male or female; blond or brunet; goateed or clean-shaven; Democratic or Republican; beige or brown. But whether players decide to support, say, gun rights or gun control, the game provides neutral explanations of each stance.When she attended a recent reunion of her former clerks, she insisted that they bring laptops so she and their children \u2014 she calls them the grandclerks \u2014 could play iCivics games together.\u201cGovernment isn\u2019t handed down in the genes,\u201d Justice O\u2019Connor said. \u201cIt has to be taught through every generation.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "CBS Considers Selling Its U.S. Radio Business", "Date": "2016-03-16", "News": "Supported byBreakingviewsThe exit of CBS from the radio business looks in tune with the times. CBS, a $24 billion broadcaster, is considering a sale of its 117 stations in the United States, just as the Internet streaming service Pandora may be on the block. Both moves could make sense, given stiff competition from the likes of Spotify, waning advertising and other industry disruption. The trick will be to find buyers.The company\u2019s chief executive, Leslie Moonves, said on Tuesday that CBS was exploring \u201cstrategic options\u201d for its clutch of AM/FM stations. A sale or other separation could generate up to $1.9 billion in gross proceeds, according to Jefferies, the investment bank.The urge to deal is understandable. Industry revenue has declined as advertisers have embraced other media to reach customers. Last year, radio ad sales dropped 2 percent, while revenue in the struggling newspaper business actually rose 7 percent, according to Standard Media Index.Streaming services are capturing more listeners, too. Spotify and Apple allow people to pick songs and listen to them commercial-free. That\u2019s a double whammy for terrestrial radio stations.Not everything is upbeat in the digital-streaming world, however. Pandora cannot grow overseas, because it lacks licenses to play music outside the United States. That seems to be driving its possible sale. Spotify is raising money and could be interested in Pandora\u2019s more than 80 million listeners and powerful sales force. Long-shot buyers could include the likes of Google or Amazon.A sale is not the only option for CBS. It could split off the division, much as Time Warner did with AOL, Time Warner Cable and Time Inc. CBS itself put its outdoor business into a separately traded real estate investment trust in 2014.Possible buyers for the radio arm include iHeartMedia and Cumulus Media, although both are mired in debt. Alternatively, the division could, as a separate business, buy assets of those two troubled companies. Either way, the broadcaster seems to have a playlist to choose from.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "At High Street on Hudson, Prime Time Starts Early in the West Village", "Date": "2016-03-08", "News": "Supported byRestaurant Review12 PhotosWhen you make a reservation at an independently reviewed restaurant through our site, we earn an affiliate commission.What is missing, what you may miss at first if you came for breakfast or lunch, the only meals High Street on Hudson served in its first few weeks of life, is the high level of intelligence the kitchen applies to everything it does from morning through evening.The chef, Eli Kulp, is unmistakably trying to make his mark in New York after making his name in Philadelphia. (He was traveling between the two cities last year when his Amtrak train derailed, leaving him with serious spinal injuries.) At dinner, the time when chefs make their big statements, the menu turned out to be full of small oddities and unexpected ripples of flavor when it was finally unveiled in January. Yet his restaurant doesn\u2019t just put on a show at night and wait for you to be impressed. Mr. Kulp and his business partner, Ellen Yin, understand that coffee and a great pastry can be just as meaningful before noon as an artfully plated duck breast is after dark.The view into the windows from Hudson Street says bakery: You can see bread on shelves, a squarish seeded rye and a round buckwheat loaf with dried cherries inside. Baked by Alex Bois, they have the roughness and flavor of whole grains, the complicated taste of slow-rising dough, and the kind of dark, thick, crackling crust you want to feel between your teeth.In a glass case by the door are a few of Samantha Kincaid\u2019s pastries, fewer as the day goes on. The neighbors are especially fond of carrying off the round doughnuts rolled in spiced sugar and filled with salty cider caramel.Or it could revolve around a black bialy. This oddball creature, dark with squid ink and strewn with sesame seeds, is soft and chewy, with pickled peppers and a mound of tart, uncreamy whitefish salad pressed into its divot.Cooking at breakfast takes the form of egg sandwiches. My choice of these is the Bodega, an incongruous name for a countrified affair of flattened sage sausage and Cheddar on a biscuit with a mule kick of black pepper. Like the other sandwiches, the Bodega arrives alongside a grilled hot pepper on an irregular block of wood. This is both affected and counterproductive; a boring old plate would do a better job of keeping food off the table. (What\u2019s going to happen to all these fancy boards once they stop being cool and everybody admits what a pain they are?)I am tempted to jump from breakfast straight to dinner out of cowardice. I would rather not have to say that lunch is the weakest meal of the day. The sandwiches are the trouble. The pastrami is a buzz kill, an inert mass of cold pink meat sliced too thickly on too much rye. Another is called the Best Grilled Cheese Ever. It isn\u2019t. (Granted, calling a sandwich the Best Grilled Cheese Ever is like naming your child Jesus Buddha.)If a place is going to go to the trouble of baking those first-rate breads, it should keep a closer eye on the laws of contrast and proportion that mean success or failure in the sandwich universe. Sandwich engineering is a skill of its own, or maybe an instinct.When it gets dark, High Street on Hudson doesn\u2019t entirely pack up the bakery. One of Mr. Kulp\u2019s more clever moves is to integrate dinner into the overall program with a few breads and some of the regionally grown grains they\u2019re made from.Vollkornbrot, a dark German rye riddled with sunflower seeds, is a wonderful thing to eat when it\u2019s buttered and griddled and spread with rutabaga hummus, which could double as vegetarian chicken-liver p\u00e2t\u00e9. Slices of anadama, a venerable New England cornmeal loaf sweetened with molasses, are topped with very rich, very tender, very smoky eel.I was happily surprised that sunflower seeds cooked into a creamy mock risotto could be so appealing. A less pleasant surprise was the portion size, too small to be served as a separate course to our table of four. Apart from the breads, the menu is a longish list under a single category, \u201cTo Share.\u201d The kitchen decides what to send out when, and it doesn\u2019t always make the right call.Tempura-style broccoli is at the start of that list and, ideally, at the start of your meal. Impressively crisp, it gets a refreshing assist from pickled wood-ear mushrooms and an exhilarating dribble of spicy chowchow relish.Toward the bottom of the menu are what used to be called main courses. Arctic char is sauced with a very smart remix of a gribiche; the eggs are pickled for extra snap. And while the phrase \u201csoured grains\u201d does not make the heart go pitter-pat, I could work up some affection for the thing it described, a tart, almost refreshing porridge served under fat slices of duck breast with especially flavorful skin.You may expect a place serving soured grains to go salty and savory with its desserts. And you\u2019d be correct. I like them, mostly, but I\u2019d rather have a piece of the spiced kabocha cake, or the cream puff, with its soft spill of Meyer-lemon cream, followed by a cookie offered on a tray by a smiling woman at the door.When you make a reservation at an independently reviewed restaurant through our site, we earn an affiliate commission.Reservations powered by OpenTableAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Map of My Life", "Date": "2016-03-10", "News": "Supported byLife, among other things, is accumulation \u2014 of objects, papers, photographs, paintings, tax returns, love letters and assorted things in the backs of drawers, the bottoms of closets and the recesses of cellars. Stuff gathers. It piles up through the acquisitive instinct, nostalgia and inertia. Some of it may be useful, a lot of it not.Possessions can be uplifting if they are beautiful or merely comforting, signposts to a life, recalling the places they were acquired and with whom. On the other hand, they can feel imprisoning. Who has not had the urge just to be rid of everything and roam free? Humanity may broadly be divided into hoarders and disposers. They tend to have disagreements, especially when bound in a couple.These thoughts crossed my mind as I picked my way through a bedroom I have used for several months for storage, mostly of books without shelves to place them on, but also of boxes I felt disinclined to open. Making a home is not a steady process but comes about in bursts, interspersed with inactivity.In the midst of my clutter-clearing push, I stumbled on my maps \u2014 hundreds of maps, produced by companies like Michelin or Rand McNally or the British Ordnance Survey, charting the roads, tracks and railroads of the Marseille region through Jerusalem to Paraguay by way of the Cheddar Gorge. Bearing witness \u2014 what journalists must do \u2014 involves moving around; for a long time there was only one way to get oriented. A good map in a bad place was a lifesaver.The maps looked otherworldly, like old sewing machines or outsize transistor radios from another era. I fingered them, unsure what to do. Google Maps and GPS have taken over. A disembodied voice guides you to a destination whose geographic context is irrelevant. Technology siphons people into furrows. When the GPS breaks down, there is panic.I thought of throwing all the maps away. Why keep them if I would no longer need them? Because I love maps \u2014 the way they render contour and scale, invite exploration. But that hardly seemed reason to hoard.Then my eye fell on two maps of a country that no longer exists \u2014 Yugoslavia \u2014 and another map of the countries born from its death \u2014 Slovenia, Croatia, Bosnia, Serbia etc. \u2014 and I was back in the wars of Yugoslavia\u2019s destruction in the 1990\u2019s. The smash of a shell in Sarajevo, the contraction in my stomach, the tapering valley and the death-spewing mountains, sweet coffee in the old city, a sign on the road south of Split pointing left to Sarajevo and straight to Dubrovnik. I always turned left, away from the sea, toward the besieged Bosnian capital. That was the road where, in 1994, I flipped over, crashed into a field, ended upside-down with Bosnian peasants trying to extricate me from the wreck.I was alive, somehow. My son was born a few days later in Paris.Life pivots on very little. It has its roads and byways. Italy was well represented \u2014 maps of Lake Como, Campania, Sicily. Covering Italy in the 1980s was a joy. Now I was back in Rome: that interview with then Prime Minister Bettino Craxi, who exuded an animal force and ended badly in Tunisia. The call, its menace unmistakable, in the midst of a Palermo night when I was investigating a four-part series on the Mafia for The Wall Street Journal. The umbrella pines in the Villa Borghese, the clay courts playable through winter, the talkative Umbrian agro-scientist convinced he could cultivate truffles, the beans at Nino on the Via Borgognona, that shattering Velazquez portrait in Rome of Pope Innocent X.These maps, it occurred to me, mapped my life more or less. I was transported. The Old City in Jerusalem near the Damascus Gate, market stalls piled with dates and pomegranates, Palestinians emerging from the Al Aqsa Mosque on the El-Wad Road, Orthodox Jews bumping into them as they head toward the Western Wall, a crowd of Philippine Christians emerging from the Via Dolorosa carrying a crucifix they try to maneuver through these Arabs and Jews.I was back there, too. Life is mingling and coupling despite the effort of every Middle Eastern fanatic to draw division. Yugoslavia died bloodily because it took such force to unmingle it.I could not dispose of my redundant maps. My own borders were written into them. I do not want to live without them.A confession then: I tend toward hoarding, perhaps through trauma. A vivid memory is of my father standing in the garden in the London house where I spent most of my childhood piling objects onto a fire. Into the flames went old toys, files, papers, and the \u201cDon Bradman\u201d cricket bat I had used as a child and he had used before me. That was after my mother\u2019s first suicide attempt, in preparation for a disastrous move.After which the family was lost in unmapped territory.An earlier version of this column misstated the year in which Roger Cohen was involved in a car crash in Bosnia. It was 1994, not 1995.Advertisement"}

After a successful liver transplant, he recovers, leaves the hospital and, by episode\u2019s end, reclaims his job from Donald Blythe.As usual, restoring Frank to a position of political strength means that other people must die. As we see in a quick scene before that graphic depiction of Frank\u2019s surgery, the liver that saves him comes from a young suicide victim named Danny. Anthony P.

Frank, still in recuperation mode, looks diminished as well; the slick brown dye in his hair has faded to gray, making him appear older and, coupled with his reduced physical size, frail. Kevin Spacey\u2019s performance in the whole Claire reunion sequence \u2014 when he chokes up over Meechum\u2019s death and struggles to walk with Claire\u2019s help \u2014 may be the best work he\u2019s ever done on \u201cHouse of Cards.\u201d For once, he gets to exhibit vulnerability that feels genuine.\u201cI said you were nothing, in the Oval, without me,\u201d Frank tells his wife, alluding to their fight at the end of Season 3 and also echoing the words Petrov used to insult Claire just hours earlier. \u201cIt\u2019s the other way around.\u201dFrank promises her that she can have something more than just the role of first lady, continuing the \u201cHouse of Cards\u201d tradition of treating that job dismissively but also giving Claire what she wants and making them co-pilots again. Question: Shouldn\u2019t Frank be more angry with Claire? She abandoned him while he was undergoing surgery and wouldn\u2019t even take his call when he woke up for the first time in days, if not weeks. That certainly seems like grounds for holding a grudge. But Frank doesn\u2019t resent those choices because they resemble the choices he would have made; he looks at Claire and he sees shades of himself. Either that or he\u2019s super-woozy from the meds he\u2019s taking.Frank\u2019s hallucinations, consciously or subconsciously, seem to renew his resolve to do whatever it takes to stay alive and in the White House. The simultaneously sultry and threatening sequences involving Peter Russo and Zoe Barnes play like an attempt to seduce Frank into sweet death, much the way Frank lured them to theirs. (\u201cYou tried, Frank, which is more than most people ever do,\u201d Peter coos in Frank\u2019s ear. \u201cRight now, it\u2019s just us. And we have all the time in the world.\u201d) The image of Frank, Peter and Zoe wrapped together in a freakish purgatory orgy eventually gives way to another mental snapshot: of Frank and Claire sitting across from each other in the Oval Office. That, it seems, is what brings Frank back.It\u2019s nice to see Corey Stoll and Kate Mara on \u201cHouse of Cards\u201d again, even if their dream sequences feel simultaneously riveting and a little silly. (Ms. Mara, in particular, is objectified to a borderline absurd degree.) But nothing in those surreal mental side trips is quite as silly as this exchange between Claire and Leann:Leann, suddenly appearing at the hospital: \u201cThis can\u2019t wait.\u201dClaire: \u201cWhat is it?\u201dLeann: \u201cPollyhop.\u201dPollyhop is a fictional, Google-esque search engine that according to Leann\u2019s polling expert is being exploited by the Republican candidate Will Conway in ways that suggest Underwood can\u2019t possibly beat him in the general election. The explanation of how Pollyhop works is convoluted at best, but the gist is that Conway and his people are manipulating search engine results so that only positive coverage of their side appears. As to why that alone would completely tip the election scale in favor of Conway \u2014 I don\u2019t know. Maybe a search on Pollyhop would uncover the answer?At the very least, Frank no longer has to worry about competing against Heather Dunbar, whose commitment to running an honest campaign proves to be her undoing. Heather decides to speak candidly with investigators about the fact that she met with Lucas Goodwin and about Frank\u2019s lack of a moral compass. Once the video of her interrogation hits the news media, she winds up looking as paranoid as Lucas and, worse, disrespectful of a commander in chief who is still ailing. As Doug tells the health and human services secretary, a person can either change her ethics or lose her job. Heather seems smart and seasoned enough, however, to maintain her ethics without being quite so dumb; she could have easily decided to be truthful without going the extra-naive step of allowing the video of her interview to be released.In any case, during the second half of Season 4, it seems that Frank\u2019s opponent will no longer be Heather or Claire. Now he\u2019ll have to deal with an entity perhaps even more formidable: a rich and very electable Republican.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "\u2018House of Cards\u2019 Season 4, Episode 7: Rock Star Candidate", "Date": "2016-03-08", "News": "Supported byHouse of CardsWe\u2019ve heard Will Conway\u2019s name a few times and images of the Republican presidential candidate have flashed by in TV commercials over the course of the season. But in this episode, the New York governor (Joel Kinnaman) and his family finally come into full view.This chapter is a study in the contrasts between two candidates, a look at how they function politically and how they live. On almost every metric, President Frank Underwood seemingly falls short of Conway, who is young (at roughly 39, he meets the age requirement for a presidential candidate, but just barely), savvy when it comes to social media, and a happily married family man. In short, as one of the president\u2019s advisers puts it, he\u2019s a rock star.Conway and Frank even start their days in what feel like different universes. Conway enjoys spirited \u201cgood morning\u201d sex in the bathroom with his beautiful, British wife, while Frank stands alone in front of a bathroom vanity filled with medications as his wife peeks in from a cautious distance. After the quickie with his spouse, Conway goofs around with one of his adorable moppet children; meanwhile, a subdued Frank and Claire discuss the importance of staying focused on their political agenda instead of worrying about their personal relationship. \u201cFind your steel, Claire,\u201d he tells her, foreshadowing the steel she\u2019ll later hold in her hand while advocating for tougher gun-control measures.This is the Season 4 episode when most people will be tempted to see the Underwoods as stand-ins for Bill and Hillary Clinton, assuming they haven\u2019t already. Unlike the Conways, Frank and Claire appear to derive their earthly pleasures from coaching each other toward professional success. In a pair of deftly edited sequences we first see Frank advising Claire about how to hone her message during a meeting with the head of the National Rifle Association, then, later, Claire helping Frank perfect his approach to an important conversation about who should be his running mate. Everything they lack in romantic passion, they make up for in their strategic synchronicity, a quality that, true or not, many have always imagined is core to the Clintons\u2019 relationship as well. (Notably, as the episode progresses, Claire and Frank inch closer to each other in terms of physical proximity until, by the end, they\u2019re in the same bedroom, albeit not the same bed.)The notion of tapping into Americans\u2019 personal information is a hot-button issue and \u201cHouse of Cards\u201d uses it to further accentuate the differences between the candidates. While Conway seeks to gain intel about voters\u2019 preferences using technology that takes advantage of willingly shared information, Frank wants to just take it by way of a federal court ruling that allows for widespread domestic surveillance, justified by airstrikes against ICO, the \u201cHouse of Cards\u201d version of ISIS. It\u2019s the stuff of Edward Snowden\u2019s most extreme nightmares, and Frank has the good judgment to abort both the military mission and his plan. Still, one wonders if he\u2019ll find another way to tap, wire or otherwise, into the minds of voters and in the process, perhaps find out that Tom Hammerschmidt is still investigating Lucas Goodwin\u2019s claims about him.There\u2019s another important quality that Conway and Frank don\u2019t share and that\u2019s ruthlessness. As Claire notes, the Underwoods are willing to go farther than anyone, including the Conways, to get what they want. If there was any thought that, post-surgery, Frank might soften, this episode puts an end to that notion. His overdramatic, fourth-wall-breaking monologues, easily the most irritating of the \u201cHouse of Cards\u201d signature stylistic flourishes, are back in full force. And his insistence, with Claire\u2019s agreement, that \u201cwe are going to destroy\u201d the Conways suggests things are going to get very ugly in the remainder of the season.While watching that video of the 2012 New Year\u2019s Eve party, both the president and first lady realize they have something to hold over their rival\u2019s head. What it is, exactly, remains unclear. Which is maddening; these two talk to each other the way some people \u201cvaguebook\u201d on Facebook.But surely that\u2019s intentional on the part of the writers. As the first Netflix original series and one whose success relies, in part, on its binge-worthiness, \u201cHouse of Cards\u201d knows there\u2019s as much value in keeping things mysterious as there is in all that Pollyhop metadata.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Wary of Digital Guests, Brooklyn House Tour Closes Its Doors", "Date": "2016-03-06", "News": "Supported byStrolling past the brownstones of Brooklyn Heights is an exercise in envy suppression. What homey perfection hides behind each cornice and gable, bay window and ornate lintel? How much more resplendent are the lives inside those buildings than in our own apartments? For 31 years the Brooklyn Heights Association has provided some answers by offering a tour of private residences in the neighborhood that, for one day, allowed the curious up the stoops and into the living rooms that are often every bit as palatial as imagined.But after three decades, the association has called it quits on the tour: a victim, organizers say, of the times \u2014 in particular, of Google.\u201cThe people who put their house on the tour, it\u2019s an unbelievable act of generosity, for which they get no credit in a funny way, because it is anonymous\u201d to protect privacy, said Erika Belsey Worth, a vice president of the Brooklyn Heights Association. \u201cNow you look at the address \u2014 you look it up, you find out everything,\u201d she said, adding, \u201cIt\u2019s just an invasion of privacy in the way that it wasn\u2019t 30 years ago.\u201dThe issue, in part, is a fear of exposure. The houses, some with stained-glass detailing, parquet flooring, marble countertops and settees with throw pillows arranged just so, could seem too Pinterest-worthy for a visitor to resist taking a photograph, association members said.The tour, which was usually held in May, typically consisted of five private homes, all volunteered by owners whose names were not published in the tour\u2019s program. Tickets were $40 in recent years \u2014 though last year the price was doubled in an effort to keep numbers down. Although the tour was a significant part of its fund-raising strategy, the association says it is currently planning an event to rival the tour.The organization had rules to protect the homeowners: no photographs and no children except babies, and even then, only in \u201cfront packs,\u201d according to its website. Volunteers were stationed in each room and on landings between floors, not only to ward against visitors\u2019 tripping on a rumpled runner, but also to monitor for forbidden photo-taking.As far as the association knows, photos of the interiors of homes on the tour have not appeared on the Internet.But with the ubiquity of camera phones, surreptitious photography is harder to spot, Ms. Worth said. \u201cYou don\u2019t even have to look through the viewfinder,\u201d she said. It would be impossible to know, for example, whether visitors had their phone aloft beside that wrought-iron mantelpiece because they were innocently composing a text message or because they were posting a photo of the fireplace to Twitter.So far, the worst thing that has occurred in the tour\u2019s history, according to Judy Stanton, a former executive director of the association who has been involved with the tour for three decades, was when a woman tripped down a staircase and dislocated a shoulder a few years ago. Even after the woman was taken away in an ambulance and the house was removed from the itinerary for the rest of the day\u2019s event, the tour marched on, Ms. Stanton said.But it is the mere specter of exposure on Instagram and in other corners of the Internet, not whether such a thing has actually happened, that has scared people away from volunteering their homes for the tour.\u201cIt\u2019s a strange kind of privacy concern that people have because on the one hand, they are active in social media, in ways that I don\u2019t think are at all private, and then they don\u2019t want people inside,\u201d said Ms. Stanton, who put her house on the first official tour in 1985, when her children were little.\u201cI am of the generation that rings the doorbell for a cup of sugar,\u201d she said, adding, \u201cI don\u2019t see that kind of culture prevailing in 2016.\u201dReal estate websites like StreetEasy and Trulia have made it relatively simple to search for a home\u2019s sale price, floor plans and even its owner\u2019s identity, which may have turned off new participants, said John MacIntosh, who runs an investment bank that serves nonprofits and volunteered his house for the tour in the past. Visitors \u201csee the books you read, and they see the bed you sleep on, and I think that people are fine with that,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I guess they are less fine about people knowing who they are in a LinkedIn, Internet, social media sort of world.\u201dFor some homeowners, the possibility of widespread social media exposure prompted concerns that their homes would become easy targets for burglars.Yet organizers of house tours in other parts of New York City say they have not heard the same concerns raised that led to the demise of the Brooklyn Heights tour, offering explanations with a whiff of neighborhood rivalry.\u201cThey go for the higher-end public, large-scale houses, in terms of celebrities, that sort of thing,\u201d said Gilly Youner, an architect and co-president of the Park Slope Civic Council. In her Brooklyn neighborhood, there has been a house tour for twice as long, she said, which tends to attract older people. \u201cI think that the demographic that comes to see ours is not a social media demographic. And then there\u2019s a lot of local Park Slopers who don\u2019t really feel like they want to tweet or post about our neighbors.\u201dThe act of touring a private home seems, by definition, an invasion of privacy, albeit a sanctioned one. For Ms. Ramcharan, a small-business consultant, the tours are an act of sharing.\u201cIf you saw some of the detail, the original mantles, it is really something to stand up and be proud about,\u201d she said. \u201cSo I can\u2019t understand someone being apprehensive about taking photos.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Europe\u2019s Antitrust Enforcer on Google, Apple and the Year Ahead", "Date": "2016-03-06", "News": "Supported byBitsBRUSSELS \u2014 Margrethe Vestager is already having a busy 2016.Her aggressive positions have made the 47-year-old Danish politician \u2014 said to be among the inspirations behind \u201cBorgen,\u201d a critically acclaimed TV show described as Denmark\u2019s answer to \u201cThe West Wing\u201d \u2014 a poster child for Europe\u2019s somewhat combative relationship with United States tech giants.Ms. Vestager sat down with The New York Times last week to discuss her priorities for the year, the issues underpinning her competition investigations and whether she unfairly targets American companies. The interview has been condensed and edited for clarity.What\u2019s obvious is that it\u2019s not just important to open cases, but important to close cases, too. But as some of the antitrust cases we have ongoing are huge, that\u2019s not necessarily going to happen in 2016. I expect in the merger field we will keep busy, and we\u2019ll keep our focus on antitrust and state aid issues.Since we aren\u2019t done yet, we can\u2019t yet go through the different elements of the statement of objections. But Google gave us a very substantial answer, and what we need to do is ask them for more data to have a comprehensive picture so they aren\u2019t just giving us data that solely substantiates their position.It\u2019s a huge task. We\u2019re doing our best with the analysis, but it\u2019s also interesting to see how legitimate third parties [that have filed complaints in the case] also look at it.I have learned that to do antitrust at this volume takes the patience of steel. Speed is itself a quality because we have big companies whose names are being mentioned over and over again, so you have to think about that.But speed isn\u2019t a quality unto itself. You can\u2019t substitute justice with speed. You need to be able to say this will hold up in court. Then, speed is a secondary issue.That depends. Other complaints related to online mapping or local search are similar, as they say Google uses its position to promote itself in neighboring markets. That is very similar to the current statement of objections.The biggest American tech companies face intensifying scrutiny by European regulators, with \u2014 pressure that could potentially curb their sizable profits in the region and affect how they operate around the world.Then we have issues that are different in nature. One is scraping [allegations that Google copies content from other sites]; another is the question of advertising [claims that Google abuses its dominance in advertising contracts]; and then we have Android, which is almost another planet. We will become much wiser as we go in-depth in these areas.It\u2019s not black or white. The questions people have been asking are whether data can be duplicated, and can a competitor establish itself in the same way or buy a copy of another\u2019s data?So far, the analysis shows that data can be copied or newly created without any detrimental effects to competitors. That\u2019s why I have approached this area with a very open mind.That doesn\u2019t necessarily have to be a problem.But I still think Adam Smith was right when he said there\u2019s no such thing as a free lunch. Eventually, you will pay in one form or the other. And it\u2019s that \u201cother\u201d that is still hard to grasp because we are just in the process of truly appreciating the value of our own data.National tax legislation and European state aid rules need to be fulfilled at the same time. For me, it\u2019s a simple question of fair competition.Companies compete door to door with similar products, prices and services. If one company has higher costs and another company has lower costs solely because of aggressive tax arrangements, then you have a problem.There\u2019s a lot of convenience in that argument. I\u2019ve been asking my people to give me the statistics to find a bias, and I can find no bias. Not in the mergers, not in the fines being paid out, there\u2019s no U.S. bias. It also ignores the fact that we often react to complaints from U.S. companies.These are huge companies that play a very strong role in the market. But you still have many, many, many more companies that are on their way, that want to make it into the market, and that need open markets for the incentive to innovate.Advertisement"}

Below you will find the details of a case involving a middle-aged man with pains that seem to migrate from one joint to the next with no visible sign of injury.The route to the final diagnosis was particularly circuitous. Below, I provide most of the records that were available when the diagnosis was made. As usual, the first person to solve the case gets a signed copy of my book, \u00e2\u0080\u009cEvery Patient Tells a Story,\u00e2\u0080\u009d and the pleasure of puzzling out a difficult mystery.Making a List\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhy don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t we make a list?\u00e2\u0080\u009d the young man\u00e2\u0080\u0099s wife suggested. Her husband, tall and slender, had been moving restlessly around the kitchen, but when he heard her words, he came and sat next to her. He was 36 and, for the past 20 years, had been plagued by pains that moved from one joint to the next. Sometimes it was an ankle; sometimes a knee. It could be his back or his hand or his wrist. And sometimes it was all of the above. Over the years he\u00e2\u0080\u0099d seen a phalanx of doctors. They\u00e2\u0080\u0099d look him over, order an X-ray and then, seeing nothing, refer him to physical therapy. And he\u00e2\u0080\u0099d get better. But then, within days or occasionally even weeks, something else would start up. It didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t seem right, his wife had said, over and over, during their years together. There had to be something else going on. Something bigger than whichever joint was hurting at the moment. The Patient\u2019s StoryThe man had seen internists, orthopedists, rheumatologists. But after various thoughts and tests, none had seen a pattern that suggested anything more than the misfortune of frequent exercise-related injuries. His wife had Googled his symptoms many times, but the only diagnosis she ran across regularly was fibromyalgia, a chronic pain syndrome. When she read up on that condition, though, it just didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t seem to fit. Her husband sometimes had muscle pain, a characteristic of fibromyalgia, but most of the time his pain was in the joints themselves. The patient had resigned himself to these aches and pains. His wife, however, had not. A friend of hers who\u00e2\u0080\u0099d suffered a lifetime of joint pain was recently given a diagnosis: rheumatoid arthritis. And that friend had enthusiastically recommended the doctor who had figured it out, a specialist in inflammatory diseases at Mount Sinai Hospital in Manhattan. Call her, her friend urged. She figured out a diagnosis that had puzzled others for years.So she called. When her husband\u00e2\u0080\u0099s appointment was a week away, she suggested that they put together a list of everything odd that had happened to him. She could start the list, and he could add anything she left out.An Expert OpinionThe day of the appointment, the wife tore the list out of her notebook and handed it to her husband. Don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t forget to show this to the doctor, she urged. The man looked up when he heard his name called in the waiting room. The doctor smiled warmly as she walked toward him. She introduced herself and led him into the tiny exam room in the back. When she asked him about his medical history, he brought out his list. In addition to his migrating joint pain, he\u00e2\u0080\u0099d had several other unusual medical problems that might be related. Most recently he\u00e2\u0080\u0099d been given a diagnosis of von Willebrand disease, a disorder of the blood coagulation system. He found that out after nearly bleeding to death following a colonoscopy. He also had something called a geographic tongue. It wasn\u2019t painful but looked odd. Areas of the tongue surface somehow are injured, leaving smooth, red, angry-looking patches amid the tongue\u2019s normally velvety pink surface. Someone had told him that geographic tongue was a sign of psoriasis, but psoriasis typically causes a scaly skin rash, and he\u00e2\u0080\u0099d never had that. Plus he had scoliosis, or a curvature of the spine. He also had osteoporosis, even though everyone agreed he was way too young.His symptoms dated back some 20 years. As a teenager, his lung had suddenly ruptured, a condition known as a pneumothorax. Doctors had fixed the collapsed lung, but then it happened again. That second time they\u00e2\u0080\u0099d fixed it permanently. No one could explain why that happened. Indeed, no one could explain any of his weird medical problems. Other people in his family were sick, but not in the same way. His mother and brother had Crohn\u00e2\u0080\u0099s, a form of inflammatory bowel disease. Crohn\u2019s disease usually causes bloody diarrhea, but it can also make your joints and muscles ache, so one of his doctors suspected he might have it too. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s why the patient had been given that colonoscopy that had gone wrong. But it turned out he didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have Crohn\u00e2\u0080\u0099s.\nNormal JointsAny redness or swelling in his painful joints?, the rheumatologist asked. Never, he told her. Any joint stiffness in the morning? None.Had he ever been tested for arthritis?, she asked. Oh, many times, he replied. The tests had all been negative. He never smoked, never drank, never used any illegal drugs. He hardly even took Tylenol. He was vegan and took vitamin B12 daily to make certain he didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t run out of this essential nutrient, which is found in meats. He was married, had two children (both pretty healthy) and worked as a lawyer. He exercised most days, even when his joints hurt. On exam, the doctor found a few clues. There was the geographic tongue he\u00e2\u0080\u0099d already told her about. And his fingernails had tiny longitudinal ridges, something that can be normal but that is also seen in certain types of arthritis. However, his joints, the source of his main complaint, seemed completely normal. There was a little bit of tenderness in the sacroiliac joint, where the two bones that make up the hip girdle meet. However, even here there was no redness, no swelling, nothing abnormal.\nA Confusing PictureWhatever the patient had, it certainly wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t obvious, the rheumatologist told him once he\u00e2\u0080\u0099d gotten dressed. One possibility she was considering was a condition called psoriatic arthritis, or PsA, an unusual and aggressive type of inflammatory arthritis that can affect people with psoriasis. The geographic tongue, the ridged nails, the family history of Crohn\u00e2\u0080\u0099s disease were all seen in psoriatic arthritis. And in PsA, the usual tests for arthritis will be negative. But it wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t a slam dunk. The patient clearly didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have psoriasis \u00e2\u0080\u0094 at least not yet. But the arthritis could precede the skin rash, sometimes by years. And although most people with psoriatic arthritis have pain, swelling and redness as well as severe bone destruction, some have only mild symptoms, like this man. She\u00e2\u0080\u0099d get some blood tests to look for inflammation, she told the patient, and gets X-rays to look for the kind of bony destruction psoriatic arthritis can cause. But even if those tests weren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t informative, she planned to start him on a very gentle medicine that was effective in reducing the pain and joint destruction.\nA Drug TrialThe blood tests and X-rays were unrevealing, and so at the next visit she started the patient on sulfasalazine, one of the oldest drugs used to treat both inflammatory arthritis and inflammatory bowel diseases (like Crohn\u00e2\u0080\u0099s). He took the drug for three months. No relief. She gave it another few weeks. Still, nothing. Perhaps this wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t an inflammatory arthritis after all. There was one final treatment she could try. If he didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t respond to a week of daily prednisone, a steroid pill, he wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t likely to respond to any of the other anti-inflammatory medications used in the treatment of these diseases. The steroid did nothing but keep him awake at night. The constant roving joint pains continued unabated.The doctor was disappointed but clear. Whatever he had, it wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t an inflammatory disease. She was sorry, but she didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t think she could help him. You can view the rheumatologist\u2019s notes here.\n            These are the doctor\u00e2\u0080\u0099s notes.        You can view the lab results here.\n            Here is a copy of the lab report.        Solving the MysteryThe patient was discouraged but not surprised. Yet another doctor was unable to figure out why he had all these weird problems. His wife was crushed. This doctor had figured out what was wrong with her friend; why not her husband? Maybe it was just fibromyalgia. Or just really bad luck.But the patient did end up getting a diagnosis. From an unexpected quarter. Can you figure out what this patient has? The first person to figure out the diagnosis will get a signed copy of my book, and that great feeling you get which you solve a tough case.I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll post the answer tomorrow.

The brand, best known as a leading manufacturer of the Wellington boot, had completed just four seasons of shows, all by the creative director Alasdhair Willis, husband of the fashion designer Stella McCartney. While not a favorite of the fashion critics, the company\u2019s playful runway shows (inspired by music festivals, where wellies are a wardrobe staple) generated lots of reaction on social media.But in the months since that announcement, that decision has proved a prescient one. Other brands, including Burberry, Tom Ford and Diane von Furstenberg, have all unveiled significant strategic shifts away from the accepted fashion-show system as the industry grapples with the challenges posed by the growing consumer demand for immediate gratification.On Tuesday, deep in the dark belly of Ronnie Scott\u2019s jazz club in the Soho neighborhood here, Hunter held its own alternative event, and there wasn\u2019t a model, buyer or editor in sight.Instead, it hosted a technology- and market-focused \u201cfestival summit\u201d breakfast, with speakers from the likes of Google; EE, a British mobile and Internet provider; Live Nation; and J. Walter Thompson presenting key insights and forecasting for the 2016 music festival season. The audience, far from being a fashion insider coterie, was predominantly made up of advertising and marketing executives, all tackling how best to build long-term relationships with festivalgoers.\u201cThe nondisposable moments at festivals carry so much weight: They are unforgettable, watertight, locked-down emotional memories that, as a brand, you want to access and be associated with,\u201d said Mr. Willis, adding that Hunter would be rolling out a permanent digital hub on festival-related content like playlists and styling advice for its fans as well as pop-ups at major events.\u201cFestivals are more than just a destination for live music,\u201d he said. \u201cThe reach and commercial opportunity of festivals makes them a very serious business that would be foolish to ignore.\u201d Recent research from J. Walter Thompson Intelligence reported at the summit showed that three-quarters of millennials in Britain attend at least one festival per year, and 76 percent would now prefer to spend their money on experiences over \u201cstuff.\u201dWith Ralph Lauren entering the restaurant business, Bulgari opening hotels and Christian Dior starting spas, Hunter would not be the only label vying to become a lifestyle brand.But the decision to create a permanent information portal and share that information with collaborators makes Hunter\u2019s efforts more radical than most. Festivals are cool and defined by roots in Britain (just like the brand), but with events all over the world, constant music trends shaping lineups and hedonistic associations, it is a gamble that could prove harder to control than most made by luxury players.\u201cOur search insights have revealed how demand for Hunter festival product starts in April and grows massively from June, all the way through to September, which as a wet-weather brand was not a trend we ever expected to see,\u201d Mr. Willis said.\u201cWe know now we need to have a sustained narrative from April right through to September, an \u2018always-on\u2019 festival conversation which in the long run will enable us to have a much closer relationship with our customer. And it\u2019s what we are going to do.\u201dAdvertisement"}

When I saw AlphaGo\u2019s moves, I wondered whether the Go moves I have known were the right ones,\u201d the human competitor, Lee Se-dol, 33, said during a postmatch news conference. \u201cIts style was different, and it was such an unusual experience that it took time for me to adjust.\u201d\u201cAlphaGo made me realize that I must study Go more,\u201d said Mr. Lee, one of the world\u2019s most accomplished players.Go is a two-person game of strategy said to have been created in China more than 3,000 years ago. The players compete for territory by placing black and white stones on intersections of a board of 19 horizontal and 19 vertical lines.The game has been the last remaining great hurdle for computer programmers attempting to make software more adept than humans at board games since the I.B.M.-developed supercomputer Deep Blue routed the world chess champion Garry Kasparov in 1997.Artificial intelligence experts had predicted that a computer program needed at least 10 more years of development before it would be able to beat Go masters like Mr. Lee.But AlphaGo, created by Google\u2019s artificial intelligence company DeepMind, had already surprised the Go community when it trounced the three-time European Go champion Fan Hui in October, 5-0. It then challenged Mr. Lee, a much stronger opponent with 18 international titles under his belt.AlphaGo quickly decided the best-of-five series, winning the first three matches.Google has said it plans to donate the $1 million prize to Unicef and other charities.But Mr. Lee staged a dramatic comeback and demonstrated a human resilience on Sunday, when he defeated AlphaGo in the fourth game.Millions of Go fans in Northeast Asia, where the game is especially popular, watched intently during the match on Tuesday. It lasted the longest of the series: five hours.Although many viewers did not understand the intricate play, the tension was clearly acute toward the end of the game. Each player was given one minute to deliberate and foresee complex moves and countermoves before placing a stone.During a post-match ceremony, Hong Seok-hyun, head of the Korean national Go association, awarded the AlphaGo team the certificate of an honorary Go degree of Nine Dan, the highest granted. Mr. Lee also holds that degree.Demis Hassabis, the chief executive of Google DeepMind, said playing Mr. Lee had exposed several weaknesses of AlphaGo that his team would try to address. Computer algorithms used for AlphaGo \u201cone day can be used in all sorts of problems, from health care to science,\u201d he said.More than 100 million people watched the AlphaGo-Lee matches, Mr. Hassabis said. He said he hoped that the attention would encourage more people to learn Go, the \u201cmost profound game humankind has devised.\u201dMr. Lee said AlphaGo was unlike any human opponent he had faced.\u201cIt remained unfazed psychologically and stayed focused,\u201d he said. \u201cIn that regard, I don\u2019t think humans can beat it, even though I hesitate to admit that AlphaGo is above humans in Go skills yet.\u201dUntil the matches with AlphaGo, Mr. Lee said he had begun wondering whether he was enjoying the game anymore. But he said the games had renewed his enthusiasm for Go, which he began playing professionally at age 12.\u201cI have some regrets about the matches I have played against AlphaGo,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I could not have enjoyed them more.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "In the Waiting Room of Estranged Spouses", "Date": "2016-03-11", "News": "Supported byModern LoveI Googled \u201ccounseling\u201d and scrolled through pages of possibilities before finally settling on a female psychologist with a kind face. Later that week, I went to her office wanting to talk about fidelity and broken trust, but somehow we ended up talking about sex and guilt. I cried a lot.Eight years earlier, when I was 20, I had served in Afghanistan as a machine-gunner in a security platoon that accompanied convoys, a six-month tour of grinding tedium interspersed with episodes of unpredictable violence and death. But that\u2019s not what drove me to the psychologist\u2019s office. I went because my marriage had fallen apart.My wife had had an affair. As is often the case in marriage, the infidelity was more a symptom of our trouble than its cause. Their situation was typical; they met through work. One evening, before I knew what was happening, the three of us were at the same fund-raising event, and at one point, he and my wife ducked outside for a smoke and I was left alone.Well, not entirely alone. His wife was there too, holding a newborn, looking uncomfortable. We didn\u2019t talk. Someone was making a speech about future goals, and I was eating dessert.After the affair came to light, my wife and I separated. I missed the cat. When I wasn\u2019t feeling self-righteously angry, I missed my wife, too. In the evenings I listened to Springsteen, ordered pizza, watched hockey, slept poorly and spent the gray hours before dawn Googling my wife\u2019s name, the guy\u2019s name and \u201cthe pain of divorce.\u201dOne night the first link told me to pray to God, the second told me to prepare for \u201ca new life with many beautiful women,\u201d and the third led me to a body-hair-removal site. I decided to go for counseling.A few months later, I was in the psychologist\u2019s reception room, paying for my fourth really good cry, when a woman carrying a child walked in. I didn\u2019t recognize her at first, and then I remembered her face from the fund-raiser.\u201cAre you the wife of the guy my wife is having an affair with?\u201d I asked tactlessly.The question is a stupid one. First off, it\u2019s stupid. Second, it assumes that this woman\u2019s identity, like mine, is wrapped up in fidelity and infidelity and everything between. It assumes that her skin, like mine, feels like the translucent noodle paper of a Thai wrap that holds in the lettuce and the shrimp, the peanut sauce and the pain.\u201cYeah,\u201d she said. \u201cBut we\u2019re not together anymore. I\u2019m Catherine.\u201dThe receptionist rushed out and returned with the psychologist.\u201cIs everything O.K.?\u201d the psychologist asked as she walked in.We looked at her, and that\u2019s when she understood what was going on. \u201cOh my God,\u201d she whispered, her worlds colliding.In fairness, the chances of Catherine and me meeting in this fashion were extremely low. She and I had never spoken before. We both worked full time and lived on opposite ends of a large city. We both searched the Internet for counselors and somehow decided on the same psychologist and arranged to meet her on the same day in consecutive hours.The receptionist was still shaking her head.\u201cOh my God,\u201d the psychologist whispered again.Catherine\u2019s baby murmured.Later, Catherine and I went to a breezy cafe and talked about our estranged spouses, the circumstances that brought us here. Catherine\u2019s son bumped away on her knee. She asked if I\u2019d like to hold him; I reached my hands out.He smelled clean and abundant and wonderful, and he didn\u2019t care who I was or what started happening when or why it all began. For a time, my questions and fear and anger resolved into this child sitting on my lap.Then he started to cry and Catherine took him back, cradling him in her forearm and pulling her jacket over her upper body and his.I was attracted to her strength \u2014 maybe to her as well. I wondered if she was attracted to me, but the question was irrelevant. Neither of us knew what to do with love right then. I asked her if she wanted to get married again.\u201cAt some point I think,\u201d she said. \u201cHow about you?\u201d\u201cProbably sometime down the road,\u201d I said.\u201cI\u2019m glad we met,\u201d she said.By early winter, my final day as an inner-city housing worker had arrived, and I was told to go buy a cake for my farewell party later that afternoon. I walked under the bright lights of the supermarket and stared at the walls of food.When I returned from Afghanistan, I hated supermarkets. Like the soldier Jeremy Renner plays in \u201cThe Hurt Locker\u201d who returns from war only to feel overwhelmed by too many choices and too much freedom, I felt paralyzed by possibilities. I wanted to go back to M.R.E.s and the cafeteria and decisions made for me. So I limited the possibilities and got married.Now, unmarried again, I settled on a giant carrot cake. It had fist-size rosettes of pink and blue icing and weighed almost as much as Catherine\u2019s son. I paid for my food, grasped the oversize cake in both hands and headed for the exit, where I somehow ended up a few feet away from my ex-wife\u2019s lover.I hadn\u2019t seen him since the fund-raiser. He had been in my dreams, though. In one dream I was knocking at the door of my childhood home when he opened it and just stood there: handsome, shirtless, confident, everything I was not. I was crying when I awoke, alone in a new apartment and newly divorced.He was in my dreams the same way the suicide bomber was in my dreams the year after I came back from Afghanistan; I couldn\u2019t always see him, but I felt his presence at the edges of consciousness, pushing me somewhere I didn\u2019t want to go, forcing me toward the inevitable conclusion. Dreams like the slow burn of a forest fire, where the roots under the earth smolder and stretch in a hundred different directions.I spent a lot of time thinking about the ways I wanted my ex-wife and her lover to feel that burn. I thought I hated them. Later on, some friends proclaimed that a giant carrot cake in his face in the supermarket line would have been a fitting conclusion to the story. But I didn\u2019t even consider the option. I just stood there with the cake in my hand, feeling ridiculous.He looked tired. Maybe he had custody of his son right then. Maybe he had been up all night taking care of him.\u201cDo you want to go for a beer sometime and talk about it?\u201d he asked.\u201cNo, I don\u2019t want to go for a beer to talk about it,\u201d I said, which was petulant and true. \u201cBut I forgive you,\u201d I added, which was supercilious and false.\u201cO.K.,\u201d he said, still looking tired.I couldn\u2019t summon any real anger. He was just a young boy\u2019s tired father. He wasn\u2019t even unkind. I walked out holding the cake, feeling happy I hadn\u2019t burst into tears or tried to fight.I slowly continued to heal.In the months that followed, thinking of my ex-wife\u2019s lover as that sweet boy\u2019s father was somehow very helpful for me. I had held Catherine\u2019s boy, felt the good weight of his body, and eventually I learned that it\u2019s hard to hate a person when that person was a part of bringing something good into the world.Her boy is much bigger now, a beautiful child. I see his photos on Facebook and sometimes \u201clike\u201d them. Catherine and I haven\u2019t spoken in a while, and that\u2019s O.K. I don\u2019t know what has happened to my ex-wife and Catherine\u2019s ex-husband, and that\u2019s O.K., too. There\u2019s enough pain in the world and I don\u2019t wish it on them anymore.Some days I wish I had taken up Catherine\u2019s ex on his offer of a beer that afternoon, been kinder to my ex-wife, opened myself up to those possibilities a bit more. I remain grateful for the opportunity of meeting Catherine, and I would like to meet her son again when he is older. A coffee shop, a supermarket line or a psychologist\u2019s waiting room all seem like good places for such a meeting.I wouldn\u2019t explain the situation; that wouldn\u2019t be fair. I would probably just smile and mumble, \u201cYou helped me through a tough time when you were young.\u201d Then I would walk away, trusting in the possibilities.Benjamin Hertwig is a writer and poet who lives in western Canada.Advertisement"}

I go through all the typical shower rituals \u2014 I wash behind my ears, shave, and more \u2014 until I\u2019m ready to get out. I grab the handle for the water, pause, take a deep breath and then turn it.I don\u2019t turn it off, but to all-the-way cold. Then I stand there shivering for two minutes. It\u2019s the 23rd day in a row that I\u2019ve done this. If you\u2019re like most people \u2014 including myself, sometimes \u2014 you\u2019re probably wondering why.But I\u2019ve discovered that the biggest benefit I get from taking cold showers isn\u2019t any of the wonderful things listed above (I\u2019ve noticed many of them, though). The thing that most draws me to the cold water is also the thing that most repels me: It\u2019s really hard to do.Even though I know all the research, understand the benefits, and feel great every single time I do it (at least immediately afterward), it\u2019s still hard. Not just hard, but really hard. And maybe even a little bit scary, if I think too hard about how it\u2019s going to feel every time I reach for the handle.Both from the scientific work I\u2019ve read and from my own personal experience, I know it will be beneficial. I even know that I\u2019ll be glad I did it right afterward. And yet, there is still this daunting gap between knowing I want to (and should) take the cold shower and actually doing it.And that, in a nutshell, is the biggest reason to do it (with the caveat that if there is a water shortage in your area, you should find something else to do that is hard). It reminds me a little bit of that Mark Twain saying, \u201cEat a live frog first thing in the morning, and nothing worse will happen to you the rest of the day.\u201d I\u2019m not suggesting that taking a cold shower in the morning will make sticking to your budget in the afternoon trivial by comparison. That\u2019s not the point.The world is full of hard and scary things. We are at our best when we can tackle them bravely and confidently, not when we are accustomed to shying away. Set your alarm for two minutes earlier, get in the shower and before you turn it off, put it on cold. Think of it, quite literally, as stepping out of your comfort zone. It may be really hard, but just remember that most good things are.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Entire Yahoo Board Would Be Ousted if Starboard Value Gets Its Way", "Date": "2016-03-24", "News": "Supported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Tensions between Yahoo and its most outspoken shareholder, the activist hedge fund Starboard Value, were already running high when the two sides agreed early this year on a face-to-face meeting in Manhattan.But on the morning of that meeting on March 10, Yahoo surprised Starboard when it filled two vacancies on its board without consulting the hedge fund, in what many viewed as a poke in the eye.For Starboard, the meeting was yet another bad omen. And on Thursday the hedge fund made good on its months-old threat to try to unseat the ailing web pioneer\u2019s board.The slate \u2014 which includes a former executive at NBCUniversal and a former technology banker at Deutsche Bank as well as Starboard\u2019s chief executive, Jeffrey Smith \u2014 represents the strongest challenge to a board of a major American company in some time. Just 30 or so companies have experienced the ouster of their full boards as a result of activist campaigns, according to data from FactSet.\u201cAs you know from reading our prior letters, we have been attempting to work with Yahoo for the past 18 months,\u201d Mr. Smith wrote in a public letter to investors on Thursday. \u201cOver this time frame, we have repeatedly requested an opportunity to work with the company, including offers to join the board and work constructively with the current directors. At every step of the way, management and the board have pushed us away.\u201dYahoo said in a statement that it would review Starboard\u2019s slate of director candidates. The board election will take place at Yahoo\u2019s annual meeting, expected sometime in June or July.Robert Peck, an analyst with SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, said that shareholder dissatisfaction with Yahoo was broad, and that Starboard \u201chas a good chance of winning the proxy contest.\u201dShares of Yahoo closed up slightly on Thursday, at $34.86.It is unclear whether Starboard would ever have settled for less than majority control of Yahoo\u2019s board. But people with knowledge of the hedge fund\u2019s strategy, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said that the firm had lost faith in Yahoo\u2019s ability to find a turnaround strategy that would work and then doubted the company\u2019s sincerity in exploring a sale of its mainstay web operations.Eventually it came to the conclusion that wholesale change would be needed to ensure a sale.Yahoo has argued that it is serious about potentially selling itself, pointing to the hiring of three investment banks and reaching out to a constellation of potential bidders, ranging from telecommunications giants like Verizon to media companies to private equity financiers.Several potential bidders have had talks with Microsoft over whether it might back a bid for Yahoo, according to a person briefed on the matter. Such an investment would most likely be in the hundreds of millions of dollars.But in its letter, Starboard, which owns a 1.7 percent stake in Yahoo, contends that there are reasons for shareholders to be \u201chighly concerned\u201d about the sale process. Some potential buyers have questioned whether the company is serious.\u201cDespite what appears to be strong interest from large strategic and financial buyers, as referenced in the media, nearly two months have gone by since Yahoo officially publicly announced its intention to pursue strategic alternatives for the core business, and it seems little progress has been made,\u201d it said.The embattled technology company has struggled to find a successful new direction as it has been eclipsed by rivals of all stripes.Starboard has not always succeeded in its efforts to push for change at Yahoo. The hedge fund twice has called for the company to merge with its fellow first-generation web company AOL, but failed to persuade either company to pursue such a deal.Yahoo is no stranger to activist shareholders, who seek to change up a business\u2019s strategy, often by waging noisy public battles. Nearly four years ago, the hedge fund titan Daniel S. Loeb took aim at the company and helped orchestrate the ouster of its chief executive, eventually claiming three seats on the board and pushing for the hiring of Ms. Mayer, a former top Google executive.Yahoo executives have repeatedly expressed frustration over the pressure from the latest wave of activist investors attacking them. In an interview on the \u201cCharlie Rose\u201d program two weeks ago, Ms. Mayer argued that the company had served shareholders well by applying most of the proceeds of its previous sales of Alibaba stock toward buying back Yahoo shares.Yahoo has also noted that its initial plan to spin off its 15 percent stake in Alibaba, announced in January 2015, was adopted in response to pressure from shareholders, including Starboard.When the Internal Revenue Service declined last fall to affirm that the spinoff would be tax-free, many shareholders, including Starboard, urged the company to abandon the plan.In December, Yahoo did just that and said it would instead seek to spin off its core operating businesses to minimize the tax bill.But Yahoo has clearly been reluctant to pursue the top objective of Starboard and other activists: selling the company\u2019s core business of search, websites and mobile apps. That business has continued to decline over the nearly four years since Ms. Mayer took over as chief executive.Although the company formed a strategic review committee to consider possible offers a month ago, potential bidders have complained that the company has dragged its feet.\u201cThe company seemed to halfheartedly embrace the concept of pursuing strategic alternatives,\u201d said Scott Kessler, an analyst with Standard & Poor\u2019s Global Market Intelligence.Yahoo has always been reluctant to consider a sale of its core business, dating back to its wholesale rejection of Microsoft\u2019s $45 billion offer for the company in February 2008, he noted.Nick Wingfield contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

And Max admitted that he was a little apprehensive. As we settled into our green leather booth, he warned, \u201cNo one should expect a Dolly Levi-Returning-to-Harmonia-Gardens moment.\u201dYet he was surprised and pleased to see that, after an 18-month hiatus, the place seemed exactly as he had left it. Leonardo DiCaprio had been spotted at the pool and gays were returning. Zac Posen, whose gowns are Oscar red carpet staples, was at a nearby booth.\u201cSuzanne Pleshette taught me what to order: a McCarthy salad, dressing on the side, and well-done fries,\u201d Max recalled, as the waiter warmly welcomed him. The menu cover had a picture of Warren Beatty \u2013 who held court as a young bachelor in the hotel\u2019s bungalows and shot part of his forthcoming Howard Hughes movie there, and who longs for the boycott to be over.I asked Max afterward if he could elaborate on his justification for breaking the boycott. He emailed me back:\u201cIn sitcom terms, the Beverly Hills Hotel was kind of my \u2018Central Perk.\u2019 Much of my career unfolded at the Polo Lounge. I was signed by my agent and lawyer in that room. David Geffen told me what I had to do to save my career. And one night I sat with Sandy Gallin as he chatted up Sylvester Stallone.

Of course not. I shouldn\u2019t listen to \u2018Emotions\u2019 because it\u2019s a ridiculous song with moronic lyrics.\u201cDoes this boycott make sense? I did not want to go against my core values. Or worse, offend a Higher Power. (Elton John.) But it hit me like a rock being thrown at my face by the village baker in Brunei that, after two years, the only thing that changed at the Beverly Hills Hotel was that the hard-working staff, those least responsible for the offending action, were getting hurt the most. While a hotel representative says the employees are being compensated for lost wages, I\u2019m dubious. We don\u2019t know for how much or for how long.\u201cGay men and women, some married, dining freely in the Sultan\u2019s Lounge, seemed like a pretty powerful statement, too.

{"Headline": "On New York\u2019s Bustling Streets, a Soccer Megastar Roams Freely", "Date": "2016-02-29", "News": "Supported byTo many people around the world, Andrea Pirlo is a god. As a soccer player for some of the planet\u2019s biggest clubs, he has two Champions League trophies and six league titles. In 2006, he won the World Cup with Italy, where he has three times been player of the year, and where his nicknames include \u2018\u2018Mozart\u2019\u2019 and \u2018\u2018The Professor.\u2019\u2019 His 2013 autobiography, \u2018\u2018I Think Therefore I Play,\u2019\u2019 was a best seller in Italy. There are social media accounts devoted entirely to his beard. A quick Google search of his name returns results like \u2018\u201837 Reasons Why Andrea Pirlo Is the World\u2019s Greatest Living Human Man.\u2019\u2019 He has met two popes.But none of that matters in New York City, where Pirlo is standing on a street corner just a block from Herald Square in Manhattan. Last summer, he surprised fans the world over by signing a two-and-a-half-year contract with New York City FC, a first-year team in Major League Soccer. At 36, the Brescia native covers Vanity Fair and GQ in Italy, but today is his first solo magazine shoot in the U.S. Despite a steady drizzle that has interrupted nearly two weeks of mid-November sunshine, Pirlo shows up from training perfectly coiffed in a Massimo Piombo houndstooth blazer and a bright orange cardigan. A team of photographer\u2019s assistants and stylists huddles around a laptop screen while their subject stands statuelike in the rain. Back home, such a happening would most likely devolve into a mob scene, but here most onlookers just file by \u2014 until a trio on holiday from Milan spots him. \u2018\u2018Ciao, Andrea!\u2019\u2019 one of them shrieks. A few tourists also take notice, snapping photos on their phones. Pirlo gives a modest smile before returning to his pose.Pirlo\u2019s American life couldn\u2019t be more different than that of M.L.S.\u2019s other most famous import, David Beckham. Whereas Beckham drove through Los Angeles in a customized Escalade with his jersey number emblazoned on the grille, Pirlo prefers getting around Manhattan by foot. In the evenings, he strolls along the High Line or goes golfing in the Bronx. In October, he took his girlfriend to an Alberto Burri exhibition at the Guggenheim, where they were free to explore, undisturbed. Occasionally, he\u2019ll stop by Felidia, the homey Italian restaurant owned by a friend\u2019s mother, for a glass of wine. \u2018\u2018Just being able to go out to dinner at the trendiest restaurants \u2014 in Italy, I can\u2019t do that,\u2019\u2019 says Pirlo. Anonymity is a delightful novelty for him, after years of contending with fanatical supporters and near-constant police escorts in Europe. \u2018\u2018There were times we were kept in our dressing room until late at night because it wasn\u2019t safe to go home,\u2019\u2019 he says. \u2018\u2018Our bus would get attacked, the tires slit.\u2019\u2019 When his contract with Juventus, the Turin-based club owned by the Fiat scion Andrea Agnelli, expired last June, Pirlo began considering a move to America, where he\u2019d be just another player. Never mind that he\u2019d be giving up the chartered planes and five-star amenities of top-flight European football. Months later, he can hardly believe his luck. \u2018\u2018I always wanted to come here to play,\u2019\u2019 he says, \u2018\u2018but I never thought it would be so soon.\u2019\u2019Soccer fans in New York may be saying the same thing. In a city rich with superstar athletes \u2014 Alex Rodriguez, Eli Manning and Carmelo Anthony among them \u2014 Pirlo is arguably the most decorated (if under the radar). Despite arriving halfway through last season, he still finished third on his team in assists, and his ability to build play from his midfield position helped stabilize a roster long on raw talent. \u2018\u2018He\u2019s someone you watch growing up,\u2019\u2019 says Khiry Shelton, one of N.Y.C.F.C.\u2019s most promising young players and, at 22, 14 years Pirlo\u2019s junior. \u2018\u2018To be able to play with him now is unreal.\u2019\u2019M.L.S., too, seems eager to capitalize on its good fortune. Don Garber, the league\u2019s commissioner and a former N.F.L. executive, calls the impact of Pirlo\u2019s arrival second only to Beckham\u2019s. \u2018\u2018I can\u2019t tell you how many people peripherally connected to soccer emailed me and said, \u2018Oh my God, I need to go to a New York City game,\u2019\u2009\u2019\u2019 he says. That the Italian midfielder\u2019s jersey is already the league\u2019s fourth best seller is a hopeful sign that N.Y.C.F.C.\u2019s hefty investment will pay off: At $2.3 million, Pirlo\u2019s annual salary is nearly 46 times that of the league\u2019s lowest-paid players, several of whom hold second jobs.For his part, Pirlo seems more concerned with the typical expat\u2019s challenges and discoveries. Eight months in, he still orders his clothes from Italy. He\u2019s been reading up on the rules of American football, which he has begun to watch regularly. As his English improves, he has set his sights on another kind of goal: seeing a Broadway show. In less than two years, his contract with N.Y.C.F.C. will be up. And then? \u2018\u2018I don\u2019t rule out the idea of staying here,\u2019\u2019 he says, smiling. \u2018\u2018That could be something interesting.\u2019\u2019Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Cryptography Pioneers Win Turing Award", "Date": "2016-03-01", "News": "Supported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 In 1970, a Stanford artificial intelligence researcher named John McCarthy returned from a conference in Bordeaux, France, where he had presented a paper on the possibility of a \u201cHome Information Terminal.\u201dHe predicted the terminal would be connected via the telephone network to a shared computer, which in turn would store files that would contain all books, magazines, newspapers, catalogs, airline schedules, public information and personal files.Whitfield Diffie, then a young programmer at the Stanford Artificial Intelligence Laboratory, read Mr. McCarthy\u2019s paper and began to think about the question of what would take the place of an individual signature in a paperless world. Mr. Diffie would spend the next several years pursuing that challenge and in 1976, with Martin E. Hellman, an electrical engineer at Stanford, invented \u201cpublic-key cryptography,\u201d a technique that would two decades later make possible the commercial World Wide Web.On Tuesday, the Association for Computing Machinery announced that the two men have won this year\u2019s Turing Award. The award is frequently described as the Nobel Prize for the computing world and since 2014, it has included a $1 million cash award, after Google quadrupled its size.This year, it was announced during the RSA Conference, a security technology symposium held here this week.Named for Alan Turing, the British mathematician and computer scientist, the award is particularly noteworthy because it comes at a time that the Federal Bureau of Investigation is locked in a bitter feud with Apple over the agency\u2019s inability to unlock the cryptographic system that protects digital information stored in the company\u2019s iPhones.While private information can be protected with a so-called \u201csymmetric\u201d key, or a single digital code, that is used to mathematically scramble the data, the problem becomes much more difficult when two parties who have not met physically wish to have a secret interaction.The privacy protection technology that is now used extensively to protect modern electronic communications is based on Mr. Diffie\u2019s and Mr. Hellman\u2019s original research that led to the creation of \u201cpublic-key cryptography\u201d technology.Public-key cryptography is a method for scrambling data in which each party has a pair of keys, one which can be publicly shared and the other which is known only to the intended recipient of a message. It is possible for anyone to encrypt a message using the individual\u2019s public key. However, the message can only be unscrambled with the aid of the private key held securely by the recipient of the message.In the United States and elsewhere, cryptography was once a highly classified military and intelligence agency technology. But in the 1970s academic researchers began delving into the field, which led to clashes with law enforcement and spy agencies.In 2013, documents released by Edward J. Snowden, the former government contractor, revealed widespread government surveillance of Internet traffic, leading companies like Apple and Google to modify the security in their products and to the current fight between Apple and the F.B.I.Mr. Diffie and Mr. Hellman have long been political activists. Mr. Hellman has focused on the threat that nuclear weapons pose to humanity, and he said in an interview he would use his share of the prize money to pursue work related to the nuclear threat. He said he also planned to write a new book with his wife on peace and sustainability.Mr. Diffie, who has spent his career working on computer security at telecommunications firms and at the Silicon Valley pioneer Sun Microsystems, has been an outspoken advocate for the protection of personal privacy in the digital age.He said in an interview that he plans to do more to document the history of the field he helped to create. \u201cThis will free me to spend more of my time on cryptographic history, which is urgent because the people are quickly dying off,\u201d Mr. Diffie said.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": null, "Date": null, "News": "\n                    COLINVAUX--Paul Alfred. Among the last generation of \"explorer\" scientists, Paul Alfred Colinvaux, 85, died February 28, 2016 on Cape Cod, MA, where he had lived and worked at the Marine Biological Laboratories after retiring, in 1998, from the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute in Balboa, Panama. Colinvaux was Professor Emeritus at The Ohio State University, where he was a professor of Zoology from 1964 until 1991. In 2008, a National Public Radio host aptly described Colinvaux as \"Linnaeus meets Indiana Jones.\" Over a fifty-year career, Colinvaux explored the Alaskan and Siberian Arctic, the Galapagos Islands, and the Amazonian jungle in Brazil, Ecuador, and Peru on a mission to discover the history of the climate. Trained as a paleoecologist, with a Ph.D. from Duke (1962) and post-doctoral training at Yale, Colinvaux extracted fossilized pollen from the bottom of ancient lakes as a tool to investigate climate conditions at the end of the last glacial maximum (20,000 years before present). Using little more than rubber boats, and a sediment \"coring rig\" he designed with OSU engineer Vincent Vohnout, Colinvaux and his team of scientists removed tubes of lake mud that had lain undisturbed for thousands of years. The pollen buried in the mud could then be dated and used to identify pre-historic climate conditions. In a pre-Google Earth era, without benefit of GPS technology, Colinvaux explored in the old ways, quizzing tribal fishermen and local traders, and poring over aerial maps to identify sectors of jungle to search for tiny, unmapped lakes undisturbed by human activity. At times, Colinvaux and his team were able to travel by helicopter or bush plane. More often, their targets were accessible only by foot or canoe, and so they marched through dense, uncharted jungle, for weeks at a time, with machetes in their hands, food and equipment on their backs. Colinvaux&aposs early work in Alaska developed a 130,000 year-long data set that is still used to study the climate prevailing during the great Ice Age migrations across the \"Bering Land Bridge.\" Colinvaux continued this work in Siberia in the last days of the Soviet Union, and his leadership role in early Reagan-Gorbachev-era \"glasnost\" helped establish an academic Edtente. At the equator, in the tradition of Darwin, Colinvaux was fascinated by the extraordinary, and to this day unexplained, vastness of equatorial species diversity. Ultimately, Colinvaux published evidence that he argued disproved the long- reigning \"refugia\" hypothesis, which posited that pockets of warm, wet flora might have survived the Ice Age, spurring localized speciation. Although the question remains unresolved, his research was instrumental in laying the foundation for modern thinking and research on Amazonian species diversity. When not in the Arctic, the Amazon or his laboratories, Colinvaux pursued other passions. At Ohio State, he was privileged to win every teaching prize then offered. His skill as an orator was renowned. During the Vietnam-era student uprising and occupation of Ohio State in May 1970, Colinvaux addressed, impromptu, a throng of demonstrating students, using the power of his voice and words to disperse the crowd. His oratory so influenced legendary football coach, Woody Hayes, that generations of OSU football players were urged to take Colinvaux&aposs introductory ecology course. In 1973, Colinvaux authored the first undergraduate textbook in Ecology, which was used, in various editions, to educate generations of students in the United States and abroad. A lifelong oarsman who had rowed in Henley Royal Regatta, Colinvaux also was an original faculty advisor for the Ohio State University crew. In addition to extensive scientific writings and a memoir of his Amazon explorations (\"Amazon Expeditions: My Quest for the Ice-Age Equator\" (2008), Colinvaux was the author of two, widely read \"popular\" explorations of the intersection between science and such modern political issues such as global climate change and crowding due to over-population: \"Why Big Fierce Animals Are Rare: An Ecologist&aposs Perspective\" (1978) and \"The Fates of Nations: A Biological Theory of History\" (1980). Both books were translated into numerous languages and published throughout the world. Paul Colinvaux was born in St. Albans, England in 1930. He grew up in London during the Battle of Britain, studying, even as a boy, the ecology of plant regrowth in the craters left by German bombs. A graduate of Jesus College, Cambridge University (1956), Colinvaux served in the British Army of the Rhine in occupied Germany as a Second Lieutenant, Royal Artillery, 42nd Regiment. In 1966, he discovered a new species of flower in the Galapagos, which was subsequently named for him (\"Passiflora colinvauxii\"), as was the Galapagos diatom, \"Amphora paulii.\" In 1971, he was awarded a Guggenheim fellowship. In 2013, he received a lifetime achievement award from the American Quaternary Association. In addition to his beloved wife of fifty-four years, fellow scientist Llewellya Hillis, Colinvaux leaves a sister (Margaret Robinson of Norfolk, England), two children (Catherine Colinvaux of Northborough, MA and Roger Colinvaux of Washington, DC), four grandchildren, generations of students, and thousands of books. 1/3        "}
{"Headline": "Museums Embrace Digital Offerings as Visitor Numbers Surge", "Date": "2016-03-11", "News": "Supported byArt for TomorrowLONDON \u2014 There is only one Mona Lisa, and only one Sistine Chapel. And every year, millions of travelers flock to Paris and the Vatican in a mad scramble to see them. The visitor numbers are growing. Globally, international tourist arrivals \u2014 in which a person stays at least one night in a destination \u2014 hit a record 1.18 billion last year, up from 25 million in 1950, according to the United Nations World Tourism Organization. Visits to the Sistine Chapel have quadrupled since 1980, according to the Vatican Museums; as many as 25,000 people arrive on peak days.With the planet\u2019s population on the rise, the global middle classes expanding and travel increasingly cheap and easy, tourist numbers are poised to keep rising.For museums, more visitors mean more cash. Yet they also represent a threat to cultural heritage. Body sweat, carbon dioxide exhalation and the dust brought in by visitors can damage works of art. Arts administrators are bracing for an onslaught. Wim Pijbes, the general director of the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam, said museums were likely to face a \u201ctsunami of visitors\u201d in the years ahead. They might have to extend opening hours into the night, he said, or \u201cbe sold out at certain times, like a Rolling Stones concert.\u201d \u201cA fifth of the world\u2019s population is Chinese,\u201d he explained. \u201cWhat happens when the Chinese middle class really comes, and we all get older, and we travel much more than in the past, and museum visitor numbers grow and grow? I don\u2019t have the answer.\u201dFortunately, digital technology is changing the experience of viewing works and sites in increasingly inventive ways. With 360-degree interactive tours, videos and ultrahigh-resolution images, millions of people can take a thorough look at the world\u2019s cultural treasures from their own homes. Google is a trailblazer in this cultural shift. Five years ago, it set up the nonprofit Google Cultural Institute, teaming with 17 museums to offer online access to a few hundred items. Today, more than 1,000 museums and cultural institutions have allowed Google\u2019s high-powered cameras to photograph their collections in sharp detail. The institute offers free web access to more than five million cultural treasures, from the Hall of Mirrors in Versailles to the rotunda of the Guggenheim Museum in New York to the Impressionist treasures of the Mus\u00e9e d\u2019Orsay in Paris.As the technology becomes more sophisticated and offers an increasingly lifelike experience, the question becomes whether the actual museums will be put out of business.Mr. Pijbes of the Rijksmuseum said he did not think so. \u201cI strongly believe in the power of authenticity and the real thing,\u201d he said, pointing out that there was only one \u201cNight Watch\u201d by Rembrandt, and it\u2019s in his museum. Even if someone produced a \u201c3-D hologram, full color, full size\u201d of the original, it would never measure up, he said. \u201cNothing beats the real thing,\u201d he said.Giorgia Abeltino, director of public policy at the Google Cultural Institute, said the purpose of the program was never to replace real art with virtual works. \u201cLooking at a painting is an incomparable experience, and we\u2019re not trying to provide a substitute,\u201d she said. Instead, the aim of the institute was \u201cdemocratizing access to culture.\u201d\u201cNot everyone can make it to the Louvre and the Vatican,\u201d she added. \u201cMuseums need to understand that.\u201d Most major museums do. They are beefing up their digital platforms, offering interactive tours and reaching out to the millions of people who will not come to their galleries. The websites of the British Museum, the Louvre and the Metropolitan Museum of Art offer extensive access to their collections, allowing people to get close to the art in a way that would be impossible in a crowded gallery.On occasion, digital tools can reveal details that are invisible, even to a specialist\u2019s eye. Mr. Pijbes recalled a Rijksmuseum curator walking into his office one day and confessing that, thanks to a high-powered, zoomed-in picture, he had discovered a feature that he had never seen before in a work he thought he knew well. A digital museum can sometimes become a necessity when the contents of an institution have been destroyed. In February 2015, video images showed militants destroying the Assyrian treasures inside the Mosul Museum with sledgehammers and drills. A group of Western archaeologists were so stirred by the footage that they set up Project Mosul, a campaign to recreate the destroyed works digitally. They used crowdsourcing to find photographs of the lost treasures and replicated them through a 3-D reconstruction process known as photogrammetry.Technology can also come to the aid of Western museums. As time goes by and the preservation of age-old masterpieces becomes tougher, cultural sites with particularly fragile contents may be tempted to copy a method being offered for the Lascaux caves, in the Dordogne region of southwestern France. Since 1963, the prehistoric cave paintings at Lascaux have been closed to visitors because of the harm caused by human perspiration, exhalation and body heat. In December, the largest-ever replica of the cave is set to open to the public nearby. Visitors will experience a cave and a series of wall paintings that look much like the original. Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Five Black Teenagers, Innocent, Face a Lifetime of Guilt", "Date": "2016-03-04", "News": "Supported byOp-Ed ContributorTHE news that five young black men were accused of raping a young woman in a Brooklyn park in January captivated the city for weeks. The defendants were tried \u2014 and immediately convicted \u2014 in the court of public opinion. But as details emerged, it became clear that they were innocent, and the prosecutor dropped all charges.However, the dismissal of charges does not undo the damage to the reputations of the so-called Brownsville Five, teenagers ages 14 to 18, including one who is my client. Because they were tried in adult court, their names were made public and were reported widely in the news media, smearing them for the rest of their lives.The incident should prompt a serious public discussion about the need for both sealing laws to help protect the identities of the accused and reform of New York\u2019s archaic discovery laws, which deprive defense attorneys of the evidence gathered by the police and the prosecutor.New York retains some of the most restrictive discovery laws in the nation. Broad discovery is standard in other major cities like Los Angeles, Chicago, Philadelphia, Miami, Detroit, Boston, Denver, Seattle, San Diego and Newark.In my client\u2019s case, the district attorney\u2019s office and other law enforcement agencies had gathered videos from the boys who were arrested and statements from the woman and her father, who was also in the park just before the incident, and witnesses in the neighborhood, all of which cast serious doubt as to the veracity of the allegations. But New York law does not require the prosecutor to provide any police reports or other evidence to a person who has been arrested or that person\u2019s attorney until a trial actually starts \u2014 often a year or more after the arrest.In this case, between arraignment and dismissal, I received nothing but a scant formal felony complaint listing little more than the allegations. Before the arrests, news reports accused the five boys of threatening the woman and her father with a gun.However, at my client\u2019s arraignment, only days after these reports were published, the assistant district attorney made no mention of a gun, probably because the investigation had revealed that the gun allegation made by the father was not credible. Yet no exculpatory evidence \u2014 not a single police report or witness statement \u2014 was ever turned over to me.The rules governing discovery don\u2019t simply delay justice; they deny it. A tiny minority of cases in New York go to trial: A vast majority are resolved by either plea or dismissal. That means that in almost all criminal cases, defendants never get basic information about their case \u2014 or even learn whether exculpatory evidence exists. Without it, clients and their attorneys are forced to make life-changing decisions, and it is no surprise that innocent people plead guilty to crimes they did not commit.Since my client\u2019s charges were dismissed, he will not be faced with such a decision. But the state is not obligated to protect the confidentiality of adolescents charged with a crime and it is not possible to retroactively seal my client\u2019s name once it has been published on the Internet.The need for legislation that would seal the records of all adolescents \u2014 regardless of whether they are tried in adult or family court \u2014 until there is a conviction is clear. While the criminal case against my client has been dismissed and sealed, his name and picture will forever be associated with these horrible allegations and the stigma of being charged with a sex crime. Even absent legislation, prosecutors, the police and the media should show restraint and consider the effect of destroying the reputations of youths regardless of whether they are ever convicted.While nearly every local media outlet reported the allegations against my client, none of them reported that three of his public school teachers, well aware of the seriousness of the situation, came to night court in a demonstration of support for him and his good character, and ultimately pooled money to help pay his bail.After his arrest, he was rejected from an after-school program in the community and was forced to leave his home to escape the media encampment surrounding it. Of course, there will also be many consequences in his future, when a simple Google search will call up these allegations \u2014 he can assume loss of opportunities in education, employment, housing and relationships for the rest of his life.He is not alone. Thousands of adolescents are forever linked to allegations and crimes that result in dismissals or no conviction, and those records \u2014 and characterizations of those records by the media \u2014 follow them into every aspect of their daily lives.By enacting comprehensive sealing statutes and rewriting its regressive discovery laws, New York can protect the innocent, as well as provide a second chance for people who have rehabilitated themselves.Naming my client and the other boys during the initial public uproar may have been intended to create the appearance that the police and prosecutors were taking the case seriously. Their innocence should have a greater claim on our conscience.Debora Silberman is a public defender at Brooklyn Defender Services.

In addition to donating cash, the beverage giant usually provides in-kind contributions, including sodas and other drinks.In a statement, Mr. Landers, the Coca-Cola spokesman, said the company had also provided $75,000 to the 2016 Democratic convention, adding, \u201cThe Coca-Cola Company is a nonpartisan business and does not endorse presidential candidates or nominees, nor do we endorse any specific party.\u201dEmily Lauer, a spokeswoman for the Cleveland 2016 Host Committee, played down any concerns about fund-raising. She said corporations and other donors had already pledged $54 million of the $64 million needed.But a senior Republican official with direct knowledge of convention fund-raising said there was growing worry inside the party about whether donors would follow through with their pledges if Mr. Trump became the nominee.According to the Associated Press, Donald J. Trump and Hillary Clinton have each won enough delegates to claim their party\u2019s nomination for president.Asked how much of the $54 million the committee had in hand, Ms. Lauer said, \u201cthe majority.\u201d The State of Ohio, the City of Cleveland and Cuyahoga County are contributing generously, she said, along with local businesses.But the question of what to do about the Republican convention is more complex for businesses than simply deciding whether to contribute to the host committee: They are also grappling with whether they should send their executives, whether they can just quietly give to ancillary events benefiting other Republicans, and even whether they ought to have their names removed from the off-site concerts that are often convention favorites.The issue is a touchy one for American businesses, which until now have largely avoided the delicate choice between possibly offending Mr. Trump\u2019s passionate followers by distancing themselves from him, or angering the equally vocal constituencies opposed to his candidacy.\u201cThese are Maalox months for everyone,\u201d said Bruce Haynes, a public-relations consultant at Purple Strategies, a Virginia-based bipartisan communications firm. \u201cIf this is going to look like 1968, there will be people that say, \u2018That\u2019s not where I want my product placement,\u2019 \u201d he added, referring to clashes between the police and protesters at the Democratic convention in Chicago.The Color of Change campaign is now being joined by Hispanic, Muslim and women\u2019s rights organizations. While Coke has been the focus of the convention push so far, the advocacy groups have also been in contact with Google, Cisco and AT&T and said the companies would be targeted if they did not withdraw their contributions and vow to give no more.She added, \u201cWell, there\u2019s no greater threat to women and people of color in this country than Donald Trump.\u201dRepresentatives from Cisco and AT&T issued statements pointing to their technological support for both parties\u2019 conventions in the past. They indicated that they would offer the same in-kind assistance this year, while emphasizing that their support was aimed at benefiting the democratic process. They declined to comment further.In a letter sent to Coca-Cola last month, Color of Change implored the company to withdraw its support for the Republican convention, saying the move would be \u201ca sign of corporate leadership.\u201dThe push by Color of Change got the attention of the Coca-Cola executives, who quietly reached out to Mr. Robinson, the group\u2019s executive director, and, in a series of previously undisclosed telephone calls and email exchanges, sought to mollify the activist group.\u201cWe walked them through what a public campaign would look like,\u201d Mr. Robinson recalled, explaining that he described possible protests outside Coca-Cola headquarters and in Cleveland against the company.Coca-Cola has not sought a refund of the $75,000 it gave to the Republican convention, nor has it agreed to refuse to make in-kind contributions.Other companies are hoping to avoid the controversy altogether. Some trade groups, including ones representing airlines and broadcasters, say they are planning to take a smaller role at both parties\u2019 conventions this year.In addition to the strong feelings Mr. Trump generates, there are fears that fewer elected officials, to whom sponsors like to gain access at conventions, might attend if Mr. Trump is the nominee.The question of corporate involvement is not the only challenge. For the first time since the Nixon era, federal funds will not be provided to defray the cost of the conventions, putting a greater burden on the parties to raise money.Conventions are unwieldy productions that often exceed their budgets. In 2012, Mitt Romney\u2019s national finance team helped raise money to cover the costs of the Republican convention in Tampa, Fla., and in 2004, when the Republican Party had its convention in New York, Michael R. Bloomberg, then the mayor, wrote a personal check to cover the host committee\u2019s $2 million shortfall.Ashley Parker contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Google and Apple: the High-Tech Hippies of Silicon Valley", "Date": "2016-03-28", "News": "Supported byWhy are the two companies spending billions to build offices that look lifted straight from the 1960s?11 PhotosFor all the talk of \u201cdisruption\u201d coming out of Silicon Valley, one thing that has tended to remain stubbornly stuck in the past is tech companies\u2019 architecture. Many of today\u2019s most innovative companies are housed in deadly dull, boxy and glassy suburban campuses: Google lives in the rehabbed buildings once occupied by Silicon Graphics, Facebook in a laboratory from the 1960s. Though the interiors might have advanced lighting systems, state-of-the-art fitness facilities and cafeterias serving farm-to-table fare, the exteriors \u2014 flat, unarticulated facades; ribbon windows; hard right angles \u2014 could come from any suburban office corridor anywhere in the country, and from any moment in the past half-century.This is why the recently revealed plans for the new campuses of Google, in Mountain View, Calif., designed by Bjarke Ingels and Thomas Heatherwick, and Apple, in Cupertino, from Sir Norman Foster, are so striking: They, like the companies they will house, point to the future \u2014 the future, that is, as it looked in the 1960s. Images of the projected Apple campus \u2014 a four-tiered ringlike structure nestled in a thickly wooded landscape \u2014 evoke the landing of an alien spaceship. The central structure in Ingels\u2019s and Heatherwick\u2019s design is canopied by a sinuous glass membrane, a protective bubble or amniotic sac, shielding an entire section of the campus \u2014 not just buildings but bike paths and desks \u2014 while letting the abundant Northern California light stream in. In aerial renderings it looks like larvae, incubating a new and possibly terrifying future.Like the rest of Silicon Valley, however, this future is in fact rooted in the past. It comes, transfigured, from the wrecked dreams of communal living, of back-to-the-land utopias, of expanding plastic spheres and geodesic domes that populated the landscape of Northern California around the time (and around the same place) that the first semiconductors were being perfected. This is the world of what a recent exhibit at the Walker Art Center in Minneapolis has termed \u201cHippie Modernism.\u201d Out of the ferment of the \u201960s came a spectacular brew of experiments that softened the edge of the bureaucratic architecture of Modernism and explored new shapes and styles of building, new ideas about how to live and work. In the world of the counterculture, round and pliant was good; sharp and angular was bad. These concepts found their way into the cinema \u2014 into the soft plastic finishes of the circular, rotating space station in Stanley Kubrick\u2019s \u201c2001: A Space Odyssey,\u201d where it was the antithesis of the sourceless, death-bringing black slab monolith, itself almost the clone of that icon of corporate Modernism, Mies van der \u00adRohe\u2019s Seagram Building. Now those same undulations have found their way back to us, in the form of impregnable corporate campuses for the future-plotting, world-dominating, \u201cdon\u2019t be evil\u201d tech industry.It may sound unlikely, but there is in fact a strong connection between the utopian movements of the \u201960s and the tech industry; it\u2019s a topic that\u2019s been well explored by academics, most notably in Stanford professor Fred Turner\u2019s wonderful 2006 history \u201cFrom Counterculture to Cyberculture.\u201d Turner\u2019s book centers on the role played by Merry Prankster-turned-designer Stewart Brand, whose magazine The Whole Earth Catalog, started in 1968 and regularly published through 1972, advocated \u201960s ideals of autonomy, do-it-yourself design and deep ecological thinking. The cover of the first issue was an image of the earth \u2014 another sphere \u2014 taken from space, exemplifying its spirit of holism. Brand advertised where you could get tools to build out the new society, among them, critically, new technology, from calculators to Moog synthesizers, which connected him, and the counterculture, to the burgeoning tech scene. Kevin Kelly, a co-founder of Wired and one of the editors of The Whole Earth Catalog, thought that the magazine\u2019s ethos of sharing products and communications, even its cobbled-together design, prefigured the blog. The young Steve Jobs, for one, was a huge fan. \u201cOn the back cover of their final issue,\u201d Jobs told graduating Stanford students in a 2005 commencement speech, \u201cwas a photograph of an early morning country road, the kind you might find yourself hitchhiking on if you were so adventurous. Beneath it were the words: \u2018Stay Hungry. Stay Foolish.\u2019\u200a\u201d Brand himself would later call Jobs one of the exemplary fusers of the counterculture and technology.Brand was also an enthusiast for countercultural design ideas as a way to build a new society. In an issue from 1971, he called for the creation of an \u201cOutlaw Area,\u201d a territory removed from civilization, where human community could be reinvented. \u201cAny design fantasy is just loose talk until it happens,\u201d he wrote, suggesting that the Outlaw Area would transform our understanding of what human beings were capable of, \u201cbending reality off into unimaginable directions with no restrictions save the harsh ones of nature.\u201dThe designers who followed up on Brand\u2019s injunctions over the next decade would create forms that startlingly presage the new office worlds being designed by Google and Apple. Above all, they would take to heart the idea of \u201cbending reality,\u201d with their embrace of soft, flexible, organic forms. Architects became attracted to furniture and buildings that resembled bubbles. As the design critic Alastair Gordon observed in his book \u201cSpaced Out: Radical Environments of the Psychedelic Sixties,\u201d not only did the trippy shimmer of the bubble delight the hippies, its transparency and unpredictable movement seemed at once stimulating and human. The visionary architect Buckminster Fuller\u2019s famous concept of a \u201cgeodesic dome,\u201d a giant all-purpose shelter, drew heavily on bubble imagery. Meanwhile, students at Antioch College in Ohio conceived of a \u201cNomadic/Pneumatic Campus,\u201d an outdoor classroom sheltered by a 40-foot-high polyvinyl canopy. For a time the \u201coffices\u201d of The Whole Earth Catalog, in their temporary digs in California\u2019s Saline Valley, were sheltered in just such a bubble. The fact that they were temporary was the key: Like the conversion of garages into tech offices, the bubble shelter was meant to be forgiving, improvisatory, for a nomadic and restless society seeking a new relationship with how to fuse life and work.Not that these future society plans were limited entirely to the planet. In 1969, Princeton physics professor, Gerard O\u2019Neill, and his students began to imagine how to create a space colony to house a million people. O\u2019Neill\u2019s vision comprised two concentric cylinders (round forms, again), spinning in opposite directions to generate gravity, and on which each person would be allotted five acres of land. The designer Don Norman did a rendering of the concept, and it bears a striking resemblance to the images of the new Google office: Filled with dazzling foliage, plentiful water and bucolic housing, it looks a lot like Marin County, placed under glass.These images and experiments fueled the imagination of Silicon Valley, even as the young tech entrepreneurs began converting their ramshackle means to far different ends. It was, after all, an earth held in common that inspired the hippie Modernists to find new ways of designing and living. The new unearthly Silicon Valley campuses represent the triumph of privatized commons, of a verdant natural world sheltered for the few. Neither the Google nor Apple campus is open to the public, nor are their designs replicable on the scale that the \u201960s utopians imagined for their designs. Well after the orchards of Northern California were overwhelmed by glass boxes and suburban tracts, the tech companies find themselves looking longingly at an Edenic, prelapsarian moment, when it seemed that \u2014 to adapt a more recent slogan \u2014 another world was possible. But what was originally borne from improvisation and a desire to live simply is now borne from unimaginable mountains of cash. The new Apple office will cost an estimated $5 billion, making it possibly the most expensive office building in history. We are dealing with a bubble of a different kind.A subheading on Page 116 this weekend with an article about plans for the new Silicon Valley headquarters of Google and Apple, and the ways in which they are influenced by utopian-minded 1960s ideas, refers incorrectly to the design of one of the headquarters. It is the design of Google\u2019s headquarters \u2014 not of Apple\u2019s \u2014 that can be said to resemble larvae. The article also refers incorrectly to the technology company Silicon Graphics. Although the company went bankrupt in 2009, its assets were purchased by another company, and today it operates as Silicon Graphics International; it is not \u201clong-defunct.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Bush a year earlier, at a time when the United States was entangled in two wars overseas. But any claim about the motivations for moving, which can often be myriad, relies on anecdotes, said Janice Stein, a professor at the University of Toronto\u2019s Munk School of Global Affairs.For some in the latest crop of potential expatriates, the apprehension over Mr. Trump appears to represent just one more shove in a direction they were already moving.\u201cPeople talk about Donald Trump. They talk about safety, security,\u201d Mr. Calabrese said. \u201cA lot of people say they\u2019ve just been thinking about moving somewhere for a long time and this maybe was the nudge they needed to get the ball rolling.\u201dBut immigration lawyers warn: It won\u2019t be easy.Unless you fall neatly into certain categories, including students in higher education or someone trained in a list of professions found in the North American Free Trade Agreement, you could be out of luck. (If you\u2019re looking to retire in Canada, forget about it, lawyers say.)\u201cSometimes I\u2019ve had Americans who feel that they can just drive across the border,\u201d said Mr. Aujla, the lawyer. \u201cIt comes as a surprise to them, \u2018Oh what do you mean, I have to qualify?\u2019 Yes, you do have to qualify.\u201dAnd even those who do can expect to spend six years or more doing paperwork and living on Canada\u2019s equivalent of a green card to build up residency requirements. A Trump or Clinton presidency could be over by then.If the red tape isn\u2019t enough to deter aspiring Canadians, there are other obstacles.Margaret Wente, an American-born columnist at The Globe and Mail in Toronto, offered some helpful thoughts on the possible deterrents and adjustments. There is no good Southern barbecue, she said, a house in Vancouver will cost you $2.4 million and winter lasts six months.Then there are the cultural differences, she added: \u201cYou will have to learn some weird local customs, like saying \u2018sorry\u2019 when you bump into someone on the sidewalk.\u201dSusan Beachy contributed research.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "In San Francisco and Rooting for a Tech Comeuppance", "Date": "2016-03-08", "News": "Supported bySan Francisco JournalThe sooner the better, some people here say.Cities do not usually cheer the downfall or even the diminishment of the hometown industry, but the relationship between San Francisco and the tech community has grown increasingly tense.In December, 39 percent of Bay Area adults said they thought things in California were headed in the wrong direction, up from 29 percent a year earlier, according to surveys by the Public Policy Institute of California. In Los Angeles, by contrast, the percentage expressing general disapproval fell from 37 percent in 2014 to 33 percent in 2015.\u201cIt\u2019s practically a ubiquitous sentiment here: People would like a little of the air to come out of the tech economy,\u201d said Aaron Peskin, perhaps the most prominent leader of the opposition. \u201cThey\u2019re like people in a heat wave waiting for the monsoon.\u201dMr. Peskin, a combative presence on the city\u2019s board of supervisors a decade ago, was the underdog when he sought to reclaim his seat last fall against an incumbent backed by both Mayor Edwin M. Lee and the tech establishment. But he drew volunteers from all over the city and won by a 9-point margin with the slogan \u201cLet\u2019s take a stand to make San Francisco more affordable and livable.\u201d\u201cThese billion-dollar companies should help ameliorate the impact they\u2019re having,\u201d Mr. Peskin said. \u201cThey can afford to do a lot more. So far, it\u2019s only window-dressing. They can volunteer to be decent.\u201dDuring the late 1990s dot-com boom, the office parks of Silicon Valley were another world to most San Franciscans, a place somewhere to the south that they needed never go. But increasingly Silicon Valley is rooted in the city itself, which makes it inescapable.\u201cAll the renters I know are living in fear,\u201d said Derrick Tynan-Connolly, a teacher at a high school for pregnant teenagers and young mothers. \u201cIf your landlord dies, if your landlord sells the building, if you get evicted under the Ellis Act\u201d \u2014 a controversial law that allows landlords to reclaim a building by taking it off the rental market \u2014 \u201cand you have to move, you\u2019re gone. There\u2019s no way you can afford to stay in San Francisco.\u201dMr. Tynan-Connolly, 52, first came to San Francisco three decades ago, when its origins as a working-class port were still in evidence. The city was a haven of political and sexual tolerance unlike any in America. Now, he and many others feel, it has become something much narrower: a haven for the wealthy.Sentiment is difficult to gauge on a citywide scale. The demonstrations against the shuttles got widespread attention, but quickly petered out. Mr. Tynan-Connolly noted that the long history of activism in San Francisco was driven by young people, and now the young people often work for the tech companies.Some tech folks think things are out of kilter.\u201cThere are valid concerns that San Francisco is becoming a plutocracy,\u201d said Donna Burke, an entrepreneur and investor. \u201cSilicon Valley traditionally valued changing the world over money. We need to get back to that ethos.\u201dNone of the San Franciscans interviewed for this article said they wished any harm to tech workers, but they lamented what they saw as a high degree of cluelessness.Many young dreamers have flocked to the area with the hope of starting a successful start-up or striking it rich by joining the right company at the right time. This is what they look like.\u201cI have a lot of friends who work in those companies, and they literally encourage me every week to quit my job and do what they\u2019re doing,\u201d said Helana Corda, who teaches sixth graders at a public middle school, is a part-time bartender and works at a program for disadvantaged children. \u201cThey think they\u2019re trying to help, but I feel slightly offended.\u201dTech people regularly issue electronic broadsides that irk San Franciscans. The latest came in late February from a start-up founder, Justin Keller, who complained about the homeless and \u201criffraff.\u201dEven those who have benefited from the tech workers and their free-spending ways say something is amiss.Good times do not mean things automatically get better for institutions that were here first. \u201cWe feel the competition,\u201d Mr. Stoll said. \u201cWe didn\u2019t really feel it in the past. There are a lot more restaurants now.\u201dThe issue of the shuttles, the first flash point between San Franciscans and the tech community, was never resolved. The city started charging the companies a small fee. Politicians and the companies are trying to work out a permanent fix, possibly involving the use of hubs to pick up passengers.For Jilanne Hoffmann, like many Synergy parents, every morning flirts with disaster: It seems only a matter of time before a child is hit. A petition has been submitted to the city in an effort to get the stop moved.\u201cIt scares me to want to damage the economy of the Bay Area in any way \u2014 you\u2019ve got to be careful what you wish for, right?\u201d But I think we need a moratorium on the things that benefit the few,\u201d Ms. Hoffmann said. \u201cIf only there were some way to prevent the haves from having it all.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Conservative Lawmakers Push New Legal Protections for Opponents of Gay Rights", "Date": "2016-03-03", "News": "Supported byThe dispute is escalating here in Georgia, where the Senate last month approved a measure barring \u201cadverse action\u201d by the government against anyone following religious beliefs about marriage, including \u201cthat marriage should only be between a man and a woman.\u201d Though some of Georgia\u2019s senior elected officials, including the House speaker and governor, both Republicans, have expressed caution about the proposal, business groups are taking no chances.\u201cWe think the lessons learned in Indiana should allow for some straight thinking by our Legislature that this would be harmful to Georgia if passed in the current form,\u201d said Jenner Wood, the chairman of the Metro Atlanta Chamber of Commerce and one of the founders of Georgia Prospers, a coalition of more than 400 companies, including Coca-Cola and Google, that oppose the bill.Lawmakers in at least seven other states have proposed similar bills, according to the Human Rights Campaign, a gay rights group. The measures are usually known as First Amendment Defense Acts, a new front in the legislative conflict over religion and gay rights.\u201cIt\u2019s easier to focus and easier to have quick talking points and focused information so everyone knows what the issue is,\u201d said Mathew D. Staver, the chairman of Liberty Counsel, a group that has litigated against same-sex marriage. \u201cPeople can focus on exactly what the application would be in a given situation, as opposed to fighting back a bunch of hypotheticals.\u201dStill, given the corporate backlash in Georgia, where a similar outcry helped derail a religious freedom proposal last year, it appears this new approach may play out in much the same way. Gay rights groups say the new bills simply confirm what the recent religious freedom legislation over the past two years was meant to do all along: discriminate against gay and transgender people.\u201cThese bills demonstrate what these legislatures always wanted to achieve from the get-go,\u201d said Sarah Warbelow, the legal director of the Human Rights Campaign. \u201cIt\u2019s taking the blindfold off.\u201dThe bills this year shield people and religious organizations from a variety of government actions, including being fired or fined, losing government grants or contracts, losing access to school meeting spaces, having a license revoked or, in some instances, being subject to a civil claim. Among those whose actions would be protected under various bills are counselors, adoption agencies, government employees and, as mentioned in a Mississippi version, wedding florists and photographers.\u201cIt\u2019s more than personal,\u201d State Senator Adam Ebbin of Virginia, the state\u2019s first openly gay legislator, said of a bill called the Government Nondiscrimination Act, which the House passed. \u201cIt would just give people the right to discriminate against me.\u201dAdvocates and opponents of same-sex marriage acknowledge that the experience of Indiana contributed to a shift in strategy.The backlash there was substantial, even after legislators reworked the law. Chris Gahl, a vice president of Visit Indy, a tourism group, said a dozen conventions that had been considering Indianapolis cited the law as a reason they decided to go elsewhere. State chambers of commerce around the country have contacted their counterparts in Indiana and Arkansas for advice on how to curtail such legislation.Because of this, many lawmakers who might have pushed for similar bills have become gun-shy. A religious freedom bill was rejected by the West Virginia Senate on Wednesday, and there are some similar but more narrowly written measures floating around other state legislatures. But in general, lawmakers have kept their distance.\u201cR.F.R.A.s have become politically toxic,\u201d said Douglas Laycock, a law professor at the University of Virginia, using the abbreviation for Religious Freedom Restoration Acts.Instead, some states are considering bills like the one in Georgia, where the tenor of the debate shifted sharply in a matter of days. At first, the State House unanimously approved a measure ensuring that clergy members could not be compelled to solemnize a marriage that conflicted with their religious views.But a sweeping rewrite in the State Senate left lawmakers weighing the far more controversial protections. Ms. Warbelow\u2019s gay rights group contends that the bill could allow government employees to reject the tax returns of same-sex couples, or certain homeless shelters to refuse entry to single mothers and their children. A report by Georgia Prospers, which a Republican former state senator leads, estimated that the state could sustain $1 billion in losses if the current bill were to become law.The measure\u2019s supporters reject such predictions as fear-mongering.\u201cAlthough detractors want to make this bill out to be something it clearly is not, this legislation was carefully crafted to keep out of the stream of commerce,\u201d Georgia\u2019s lieutenant governor, Casey Cagle, said in a statement. \u201cIt in no way interferes with our world-class tourism or business communities whatsoever.\u201dOther same-sex marriage opponents, such as State Representative Rich Wingo of Alabama, say such legislation reflects concerns more important than commerce.\u201cI worry more about what God thinks than I do what any business or human being thinks,\u201d said Mr. Wingo, a Baptist deacon who has introduced a bill that would prohibit the state from punishing religious groups that refuse to assist same-sex couples with adoptions. \u201cThat\u2019s what I worry about. I worry about the wrath of God on our people, on our nation. I\u2019m scared to death.\u201dAlan Blinder reported from Atlanta, and Campbell Robertson from New Orleans.Advertisement"}

They have world-changing products like smartphones, social networks and Internet search, and exuberant bosses who pretend they know where all this is going.That makes it particularly awkward when big tech companies do not exactly seem in charge of their own futures. That is now happening to both Apple and Yahoo, in two very different ways.Everyone involved thinks that if this case should continue, it could ultimately go before the Supreme Court, as we try to establish law in a new world of instant communications and powerful computing, but first decisions matter. Later courts, along with the lawyers on both sides, will study the way Judge Sheri Pym thinks about the arguments over corporate and federal rights.Yahoo could wish for such control over its fortunes, or such a near-certain profit outlook. The darling of the Internet\u2019s first generation has for years struggled to define its identity and turn that into returns. Hopes were high when Marissa Mayer came in from Google in 2012, but the stock is off 30 percent from its 2014 highs.That would complicate any sale. Adding to the confusion, Ms. Mayer may also have to negotiate with SoftBank, a large Japanese tech company, about the status of Yahoo Japan, a profitable concern in which they both have shares.Great tech companies may start in garages, but that is hardly where they end up.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Germany to Continue Funding to Establish Provenance of Looted Art", "Date": "2016-03-03", "News": "Supported byBERLIN \u2014 Germany will pay for at least another year of research and hire extra people to establish the provenance of works owned by Cornelius Gurlitt, a reclusive Munich collector who sat on a trove of 1,500 artworks acquired by his father, a dealer for the Nazis, Germany\u2019s culture minister said before her first official visit to the United States.The minister, Monika Gr\u00fctters, said in an interview on Friday that the decision to spend more money and effort on the Gurlitt collection is \u201cwhat we owe the victims,\u201d and she reaffirmed Germany\u2019s pledge to return any looted art to its rightful owners or their descendants.She said that there was much to admire about Google, but that \u201cwith 90 percent of all search hits\u201d it \u201cis also a problem.\u201d\u201cCommunications monopolies are monopolies of interpretation, which in turn become monopolies of opinion,\u201d she said. \u201cWe have to discuss this.\u201dMs. Gr\u00fctters, 54 and an art historian by training, acknowledged that many people had been disappointed by the results of the Gurlitt task force, which was set up after the collection emerged in 2013.\u201cWe all had higher expectations than we could meet, and that is because this is a singular case,\u201d she said. \u201cIt is so extraordinary that there is no pattern to follow.\u201dAs World War II recedes into history and survivors of the Nazi era become fewer, provenance research and restitution is generally becoming harder to execute.But the Gurlitt collection is even more fraught than other disputes. The German government came under fierce criticism from art experts and Jewish groups for keeping the discovery secret for more than a year, until a newsmagazine broke the story in 2013, forcing the authorities to go public.That puts the onus on German researchers to do \u201cfaultless\u201d but slow provenance work, Ms. Gr\u00fctters said. Otherwise, she said, there is the danger that works could be incorrectly awarded, which could amount to \u201ca second seizure\u201d of stolen art.In contrast to initial hopes, she said, only 30 to 50 of the 1,500 artworks were of superior quality. As for the rest, \u201cmany of these works are works on paper, are drawings, are multiples, prints and are usually not documented.\u201dShe said the restrictions were frustrating \u2014 \u201cI am an impatient person and would rather give it all back today, not tomorrow\u201d \u2014 but she rejected critics\u2019 assertions that the German government was dragging its feet.Ms. Gr\u00fctters said that she intended to exhibit works from the collection in Bonn this year, and later in Bern. \u201cPerhaps you will see our good intentions when the show is open,\u201d she said.Ms. Gr\u00fctters said that the Gurlitt case had spurred her and the German justice minister, Heiko Maas, to discuss a law that would encourage private owners to return looted art.Most museums have committed to the 1998 Washington conference principles on identifying and giving back art looted by the Nazis, but individual owners are not bound by the agreement. And the only crime not falling under a 30-year statute of limitations in Germany is murder, she said, so there is nothing binding private owners to restitution.Mr. Maas had floated a proposal of some kind of financial incentive for collectors to hand over individual works, she said \u2014 \u201cbut you cannot reward people for voluntarily giving up a work of art which they stole.\u201dGermany does have a board known as the Limbach Commission that mediates in controversial restitution cases, but it can only issue recommendations.Ronald S. Lauder, the president of the World Jewish Congress and a prominent art collector, said the commission had \u201cno teeth\u201d in a telephone interview before a meeting with Ms. Gr\u00fctters in New York on Friday.Mr. Lauder said that when Ms. Gr\u00fctters first came to office, Mr. Lauder was \u201ctruly impressed by her knowledge of art.\u201d But since then, he suggested, bureaucrats beneath her have undermined some of her good intentions.Ms. Gr\u00fctters said she had recently been encouraged by Germany\u2019s Jewish community to appoint a Jewish figure to the commission, which was founded in 2003.\u201cWe did not do this, and for good reason,\u201d she said, because that person \u201cwould be the only voice who would be prejudiced.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "UberPool and the Marvels of Measurement", "Date": "2016-03-30", "News": "Supported byBitsWilliam Hewlett, the Silicon Valley pioneer who was a co-founder of Hewlett-Packard, once said, \u201cYou cannot manage what you cannot measure.\u201d Today\u2019s technology entrepreneurs seem out to prove that the better you measure something, the more you can manage is an equally powerful truth.It\u2019s cheaper than regular Uber. The company says UberPool rides cost less than half a standard Uber ride. A trip takes longer, though, and of course means you\u2019re agreeing to spend time with other Uber customers.Uber makes less on UberPool rides than on its regular service but seems happy to pick up new customers, who might become Uber regulars over time. It is also going out of its way to show that UberPool takes extra cars off the road. Uber says that since it started, UberPool has saved 21 million road miles, with a substantial savings in emissions and less congestion and wear on roads.Let\u2019s set all that aside, though, and marvel at the tech that enables UberPool (and Lyft Line, a similar service from the Uber competitor Lyft).Uber and Lyft work because the location sensors in smartphones can precisely measure the whereabouts of drivers and riders and the companies\u2019 software can efficiently match cars and customers. Later, mutual rating systems are supposed to provide a human measure of the experience, which since good ratings have rewards, is supposed to encourage better behavior. UberPool and Lyft Line take it a step further, by measuring multiple riders and matching them with vehicles in motion.Similar breakthroughs in measurement are at the heart of Google\u2019s traffic maps, which warn of congestion by tracking how fast other users\u2019 cars are moving. New kinds of measurement are how Airbnb matches people to empty rooms in apartments. Insurance companies that reward clients for wearing personal health trackers are using new measurement to lower their risk, and possibly inducing people to be more active.As a culture, we fret about being observed too closely. As consumers, however, we love the benefits of this kind of surveillance, if successes like UberPool are anything to go by. That guarantees a future in which we\u2019ll measure and manage ever more things.Advertisement"}

Not setting the bar terribly high, is it? So the more cynical might say. All the same, an array of scientists and futurists are convinced that the advent of devices with superhuman intelligence looms in the not-distant future. The prospect fills some of our planet\u2019s brainiest specimens with dread.While not discounting that doomsayers may prove someday to be right, Retro Report offers more reassuring views from computer specialists who sense that the end is not nigh \u2014 if only, they say, because machines are not nearly as clever, or necessarily as pernicious, as the fretters believe.Arguably, there is no reason to lose sleep over those souped-up gadgets. Sure, Watson and its brethren are good at games and other sorts of data processing. But contemplating a takeover of the world\u2019s nuclear arsenals? Not a chance. Nonetheless, some experts foresee a time, not far off, when artificial intelligence, A.I., will match and then exceed human intelligence, at ever-accelerating and frightening speeds.\u201cWe humans steer the future not because we\u2019re the strongest beings on the planet, or the fastest, but because we are the smartest,\u201d Mr. Barrat has said. \u201cSo when there is something smarter than us on the planet, it will rule over us on the planet.\u201dHorrific scenarios abound. Superintelligent computers will cause global financial systems to collapse. They will wage war on humans with killer robots far more lethal than today\u2019s drones. They will control nuclear weaponry \u2014 think Skynet in the \u201cTerminator\u201d series \u2014 to dominate humankind or, worse, wipe it out.In these grim predictions, the machines always seem to be anthropomorphic: Their instincts are essentially the same as those of humans at their worst; just as people have run roughshod over lower life forms, artificial intelligence networks will abuse their supremacy. Possibilities for them to do good \u2014 figuring out how to regenerate human cells, for instance, or creating immunities against disease, or gobbling up carbon dioxide in the atmosphere \u2014 tend to get short shrift.Economic issues are unavoidable as well. Lawrence H. Summers, president emeritus at Harvard University and a former Treasury secretary, noted that unemployment is disproportionately higher among those whose duties \u201cin various ways have been mechanized.\u201d There are \u201cimportant consequences for the way the economy is organized and for how fair the economy is,\u201d Mr. Summers said in an interview with Retro Report.There is, too, a question of how smart robots truly are and whether they can develop superintelligence at the blinding speed envisioned by the more pessimistic forecasters. \u201cThings that are easy for humans are hard for computers,\u201d Guruduth S. Banavar, the director of cognitive computing research at IBM, told Retro Report, \u201cand things that are easy for computers are hard for humans.\u201d Yes, a computer can multiply two numbers of 1,000 digits each in a matter of seconds.

{"Headline": "Apple Gets Tech Industry Backing in iPhone Dispute, Despite Misgivings", "Date": "2016-03-02", "News": "Supported byYet behind the scenes, it took time for some of the tech companies to make the decision to support Apple. Several feared the showdown with the government was too risky and could have far-reaching implications for the tech industry if Apple lost.Those misgivings ultimately did not win the day. About 40 companies and organizations are expected to file court briefs on Thursday backing Apple as it fights a judge\u2019s order to help law enforcement break into an iPhone used by a gunman in the San Bernardino, Calif., terrorist attack last year.Dropbox, Facebook, Google, Microsoft, Snapchat and Yahoo are among the tech companies expected to sign on to briefs in the case, according to people with knowledge of the plans who spoke on the condition of anonymity. More than 40 individuals, including prominent security experts and academics, are also planning to sign briefs, which will focus on themes like free speech, the importance of encryption and concerns about government overreach.The show of support \u2014 including briefs filed on Wednesday by groups like the American Civil Liberties Union and Access Now \u2014 is unusual in its breadth, showing that many in Silicon Valley believe that it could have profound implications on the trustworthiness of their products.Still, several executives at tech companies supporting Apple said they were worried that Apple had picked a fight that could end up backfiring on the rest of the industry. In the days since a magistrate judge in California ordered Apple to bypass security measures on the iPhone, lawyers in some of the companies debated these issues with one another and peers at other firms.All of the executives asked to remain anonymous because their deliberations were private, but their views are shared among others in Silicon Valley.Keith Rabois, a venture capitalist with the firm Khosla Ventures, said he was a strong believer in privacy and encryption \u2014 \u201call the normal Silicon Valley views,\u201d he said \u2014 but worried that Apple could lose the case, setting a legal precedent that could force other companies to compromise the security of their products for law enforcement.\u201cIn my view, this is the wrong case to fight,\u201d Mr. Rabois said. \u201cThere are plenty of other cases with a lot less sympathetic case for the government.\u201dApple\u2019s defenders said the company did not pick this fight \u2014 the government did. Critics of Apple\u2019s approach believe that the company could have quietly complied with the government\u2019s request to help break into the iPhone and then taken a public stand in a more favorable case. But Apple has said that once a tool exists for extracting data from the phone, that tool cannot be made to disappear.Yet whatever doubts Apple\u2019s allies voiced privately, they were in the end insufficient to keep a large number of big companies from signing on to the cause.Dropbox\u2019s general counsel, Ramsey Homsany, said in a statement, \u201cWe stand against the use of broad authorities to undermine the security of a company\u2019s products.\u201dBruce Sewell, Apple\u2019s general counsel, said in a statement, \u201cWe are humbled by the outpouring of support we\u2019ve received from our customers, our colleagues in business, nonprofit organizations, the security community and many others.\u201d He added, \u201cThe groups filing briefs with the court understand, as more and more people have come to realize, that this case is not about one phone \u2014 it is about the future and how we protect our safety and our privacy.\u201dOn Tuesday, Apple filed its formal objection to the government order to open up the iPhone, citing the reasons set forth in a previously filed motion.For many tech companies that were initially concerned by Apple\u2019s opposition to opening up the iPhone in the San Bernardino case, the worries centered not only on whether this was the right case for challenging the government but also on how public perceptions of the fight might reflect on the rest of the industry, according to tech executives involved in the discussions, who spoke on the condition of anonymity.Some of the companies were also concerned that the relationships they had forged with the government might degrade because of Apple\u2019s battle, according to the people involved in the tech industry discussions. In the years since the disclosures by Edward J. Snowden, the former intelligence contractor who released a trove of details on United States government surveillance tactics, some tech companies have been trying to educate members of Congress about online privacy practices.Others were also anxious that Apple\u2019s defiance of the government could lead to congressional efforts to reshape, in ways unfavorable to the tech industry, the Electronic Communications Privacy Act, which privacy advocates and tech companies have long claimed needs an overhaul.And these companies are watching what effect the fight could have on a proposal to establish a national commission that would explore ways to obtain encrypted data from consumers while working to safeguard users\u2019 privacy. The proposed commission, the bill for which was introduced on Monday, would be led by the House Homeland Security Committee chairman Michael McCaul, Republican of Texas, and Senator Mark Warner, Democrat of Virginia.Nick Wingfield reported from Seattle and Mike Isaac from New York.

Reading them their Miranda rights on school grounds. Using taxpayers\u2019 money to hire investigators to search school employees\u2019 computers late at night.Many battles have been fought in recent years between education reformers \u2014 who generally favor high-stakes testing and the data-based evaluation of teachers \u2014 and those with a more progressive approach to schooling. But nowhere, it seems, is the fight more pitched than in this liberal, diverse township of nearly 38,000 about 20 miles from New York City.A superintendent who promoted a reform agenda stepped down a year ago, but conflict has raged on in this normally serene suburb that is home to many who work in the media and business empires of New York.\u201cIf you are complicit, resign now and go!\u201d one parent yelled at Montclair\u2019s seven-member Board of Education during an acrimonious public meeting on Monday night. Many of the 100 or so people who had crammed into a stuffy cafeteria behind the local high school leapt to their feet and cheered.The tests, which were never administered, were a key component of Dr. MacCormack\u2019s reform plan, said Shelly Lombard, a former Board of Education member. They were created by teachers in summer 2013, Ms. Lombard said, at a cost of tens of thousands of dollars, to assess and collect data on students\u2019 quarterly progress.Ms. Lombard said Dr. MacCormack hoped to get a better understanding of the \u201cachievement gap\u201d in the Montclair School District, where white students, who made up about 60 percent of the school population, had long outperformed black students, about 30 percent of the population. That meant collecting data more frequently through testing, Ms. Lombard said.After the tests appeared online, the board moved aggressively to determine if someone had leaked them. In addition to having Kroll Associates examine computers used by employees, lawyers for the Board of Education gave the firm a list of 27 people who it believed might have been involved. The investigators were to look for any emails sent from those people\u2019s addresses to a school employee who worked in the district office.The board subpoenaed Google and a local news website, asking for electronic records that would identify an anonymous blogger using the alias \u201cAssessmentgate\u201d who had criticized Dr. MacCormack and the Board of Education just days before the tests showed up online. Board members appeared to suspect the blogger of being involved in obtaining and posting the tests, an accusation the blogger has vehemently denied.In the end, no leaker was found, and among the documents circulating through town recently \u2014 they have been dropped in people\u2019s mailboxes, and even left on the hood of a blue Volvo belonging to a member of an antireform faction \u2014 was one from a district official explaining how gobookee.org might have obtained the tests on its own.Critics of the reform movement said the investigation\u2019s true purpose was to silence and intimidate them. They cited the large number of high-profile backers of a national reform movement who live in Montclair, including Christopher Cerf, a former state education commissioner and current superintendent of schools in Newark. They also complained at the meeting on Monday that tens of thousands of taxpayer dollars had been spent on the inquiry.Some saw a larger conspiracy at work, one that wove together testing and charter schools, another element of the reform movement.\u201cIt\u2019s all about power,\u201d Evan Cutler, an NBC producer with two children enrolled in the Montclair schools, said in a phone interview.\u201cThere are billions of dollars at stake as far as these charter schools go,\u201d he said, \u201cand the whole state has been looking at Montclair as a test to see which side can win\u201d in the battle over education reform.With Dr. MacCormack\u2019s departure, it would seem that the antireform camp had prevailed. The interim superintendent has already loosened testing standards. Nonetheless, the antitesting group said it wanted a full accounting of the Kroll Associates investigation.\u201cI wonder, \u2018Was I on that list?\u2019\u201d Gail Robinson, a local teacher, asked as she stared at board members on Monday. \u201cAnd what criteria was used to determine who would be monitored?\u201dThe current school board members, only three of whom remain from 2013, had little to say. Anne Mernin, the panel\u2019s vice president, said at the meeting that the investigators had only searched computers owned by the district, not any belonging to a teachers\u2019 union. She said the board would have a fuller report on the investigation later.Asked after the meeting whether the 2013 investigation was meant to quell free speech, Jessica de Koninck, the board\u2019s current president, declined to comment.Dr. MacCormack did not return phone calls or an email seeking comment.Ms. Lombard, the former board member, said in a phone interview on Tuesday that she would vote again to authorize a Kroll Associates investigation. She noted that in 2014, the board had asked the State Office of Fiscal Accountability and Compliance to determine how the tests had been made public, and that the agency had concluded that someone with access to a school district-issued user name and password must have been involved.She also said students had been the real losers in the yearslong battle.\u201cWe have a very special district,\u201d Ms. Lombard said, \u201cand so we chose Penny\u201d as superintendent.But, she said, the factions in the town had grown so strident \u201cthat I think she just had enough.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated how many of the Montclair, N.J., school district\u2019s assessment tests were posted online in 2013. There were multiple tests, not one. The error was repeated in the article\u2019s headline.Advertisement"}

He said he maintained a strict schedule thereafter, with checkpoints on Wednesday and Friday to keep him on track throughout the week.\u201cI can split my time and be present at both companies every single day,\u201d Mr. Dorsey said in an interview on Wednesday, noting that Square and Twitter are across the street from each other. \u201cIt\u2019s not something I stress out about.\u201dIn 2016, seven I.P.O.s have been made from across all industries, the least since 2009, according to data compiled by Dealogic. The dearth is largely because of volatile markets that make pricing and selling new shares more difficult. In the meantime, investor attitudes have grown more conservative.\u201cIf you look over the past few years at a lot of recent tech I.P.O.s, there was an almost myopic focus on growth,\u201d said Josh Beck, a research analyst for Pacific Crest Securities. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen a correction and a different focus in the last year. Now everyone is really looking for a path to profitability.\u201dSquare executives said on Wednesday that they were also looking for it to become profitable and that they expect to reach that goal this year. While the company\u2019s net loss in the fourth quarter widened to $80.5 million from $37.1 million a year earlier, that was largely because of a one-time charge.And there were high points. Square processed $10.2 billion in global payments, up 47 percent from a year ago. Its software and services businesses \u2014 like Caviar, Payroll and Appointments, which are offered to small businesses with Square\u2019s core payments processing \u2014 are also growing at a healthy clip, generating $22 million in fourth-quarter revenue, more than triple from a year earlier.Square is also bullish on Square Capital, its cash-advance program for small businesses, which is another high growth area. Square said it made $150 million in cash advances in the fourth quarter through Square Capital; the company earns a fixed fee on each advance.Perhaps what investors appreciate most about Mr. Dorsey\u2019s leadership at Square are his choices in executive staff. He has brought in former Facebook, Amazon and Google executives. Wall Street particularly praises Square\u2019s chief financial officer, Sarah Friar, a former Goldman Sachs technology analyst.\u201cIt\u2019s very important given this arrangement to have someone like that that provides another important layer of leadership,\u201d Mark Palmer, a financial analyst at BTIG LLC, said of Ms. Friar. \u201cFrankly Square is wise to highlight her role.

But the field of artificial intelligence has largely stumbled in giving computers the ability to reason in ways that mimic human thought.Now a variety of machine intelligence software approaches known as \u201cdeep learning\u201d or \u201cdeep neural nets\u201d are taking baby steps toward solving problems like a human.The new research is intriguing because it indicates that steady progress is being made toward \u201cconversational\u201d agents that can interact with humans. The MetaMind results also underscore how far researchers have to go to match human capabilities.Other groups have previously made progress on discrete problems, but generalized systems that approach human levels of understanding and reasoning have not been developed.Five years ago, IBM\u2019s Watson system demonstrated that it was possible to outperform humans on \u201cJeopardy!\u201dLast year, Microsoft developed a \u201cchatbot\u201d program known as Xiaoice (pronounced Shao-ice) that is designed to engage humans in extended conversation on a diverse set of general topics.To add to Xiaoice\u2019s ability to offer realistic replies, the company developed a huge library of human question-and-answer interactions mined from social media sites in China. This made it possible for the program to respond convincingly to typed questions or statements from users.In 2014, computer scientists at Google, Stanford and other research groups made significant advances in what is described as \u201cscene understanding,\u201d the ability to understand and describe a scene or picture in natural language, by combining the output of different types of deep neural net programs.These programs were trained on images that humans had previously described. The approach made it possible for the software to examine a new image and describe it with a natural-language sentence.While even machine vision is not yet a solved problem, steady, if incremental, progress continues to be made by start-ups like Mr. Socher\u2019s; giant technology companies such as Facebook, Microsoft and Google; and dozens of research groups.In their recent paper, the MetaMind researchers argue that the company\u2019s approach, known as a dynamic memory network, holds out the possibility of simultaneously processing inputs including sound, sight and text.The design of MetaMind software is evidence that neural network software technologies are becoming more sophisticated, in this case by adding the ability both to remember a sequence of statements and to focus on portions of an image. For example, a question like \u201cWhat is the pattern on the cat\u2019s fur on its tail?\u201d might yield the answer \u201cstripes\u201d and show that the program had focused only on the cat\u2019s tail to arrive at its answer.\u201cAnother step toward really understanding images is, are you actually able to answer questions that have a right or wrong answer?\u201d Mr. Socher said.MetaMind is using the technology for commercial applications like automated customer support, he said. For example, insurance companies have asked if the MetaMind technology could respond to an email with an attached photo \u2014 perhaps of damage to a car or other property \u2014 he said.There is still significant debate within the research community about the best technical approach and even what is the best way to measure progress.In contrast, his laboratory is focusing on creating software that can answer questions taken from standardized elementary school science tests.Advertisement"}

But you see his style, you feel his essence,\u201d said Sumu, who launched Primitive Modern in Oct. 2015 with a collection of scarves.

{"Headline": "Walesa, Gorbachev and Freedom's End", "Date": "2016-03-13", "News": "Supported bySOFIA, Bulgaria \u2014 The Eastern European revolutions against Communism have been hailed as the best of their kind. Overwhelmingly peaceful, they helped produce two Nobel Peace Prizes. The first went to Lech Walesa, the heroic leader of Poland\u2019s 10-million-strong Solidarity Trade Union, in 1983; seven years later, the leader of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, Mikhail Gorbachev, was honored for having the courage to acknowledge the moral, political and economic bankruptcy of the old regime.These two political figures \u2014 Mr. Walesa, who became the first democratically elected president of Poland, and Mr. Gorbachev, who served as the last Soviet leader \u2014 have since become the most potent symbols of 1989. Now the heroic status of both men, and the very legacy of those revolutions, are being called into question.Mr. Gorbachev has been accused of betraying his country, and Mr. Walesa of betraying his fellow anti-Communists.In Vladimir V. Putin\u2019s Russia, the resentment against 1989 is so intense that when the celebrated movie director and Kremlin loyalist Nikita Mikhalkov recently denounced Mr. Gorbachev\u2019s policies leading to the collapse of the Soviet Union as \u201ca real crime,\u201d the public hardly blinked \u2014 people thought he was just stating the obvious.What did make news was a prankster presenting himself as Mr. Mikhalkov who called Mr. Gorbachev and apologized. Everyone got a good laugh at the Nobel Prize winner, who was grateful to accept an apology that was never made. Russians are not really nostalgic for Communism per se, but they pine for the days of the Soviet Union as a superpower. In Russia, 1989 doesn\u2019t symbolize society\u2019s victory over Communism, but rather Moscow\u2019s defeat and humiliation at the hands of the West.Almost at the same time as the Mikhalkov affair, the Institute for National Memory in Poland released documents, some of them obtained from the widow of the last Communist interior minister, reviving the claims that Mr. Walesa was a secret police informer in the 1970s. (He was cleared by a special court after an earlier wave of accusations in 2000.)Unsurprisingly, Mr. Walesa called the document a \u201cfabrication,\u201d and thousands of people took to the streets of Warsaw, Gdansk and other Polish cities in defense of the former Solidarity leader. But the Polish government, under Jaroslaw Kaczynski\u2019s populist Law and Justice Party, refused to defend him, insisting that the Walesa \u201clegend probably cannot be defended anymore.\u201dCan anyone be confident that Mr. Walesa never collaborated with the police? To be sure, no. It is most likely that Mr. Walesa, like many others, cut various small deals with the authorities in the 1970s to secure his freedom after being arrested for pro-democracy activities.But the demonstrators on the street, some of them old Solidarity activists themselves, also understand that the secret police was hardly above fabricating police files in order to discredit its opponents. And those same demonstrators are fully aware that the miracle of Solidarity would have been impossible without leaders like Mr. Walesa.The larger point, though, is that people on the streets of large Polish cities today are defending something greater than Mr. Walesa \u2014 the legacy of 1989 itself. They suspect the government is using the attack on Mr. Walesa as an instrument to delegitimize liberal democracy.And they seem to be right. Antoni Macierewicz, the current Polish defense minister, claimed bluntly that Mr. Walesa\u2019s police file proved that \u201cpost-Communist Poland was a product of the secret police and not of democratically elected institutions.\u201dIt is one thing to have to defend the 1989 revolution in \u201cdefeated\u201d Russia. But why is it suddenly so hard to do so in victorious Poland, where people are freer and more prosperous than ever before and where Solidarity is a national icon?The irony of the current wave of revisionism is that 1989 is rejected for the same reasons that it has long been acclaimed, namely its absence of radicalism. The fact that it chose to integrate the old elites instead of persecuting them has turned out to be, at once, the revolution\u2019s lasting achievement and its ultimate Achilles\u2019 heel.The populist insurgency feverishly advancing in Poland, Hungary and other parts of Eastern Europe is a rebellion against moderates and moderation. The events of 1989 are condemned as little more than an ingenious plot to transform the elites\u2019 political power into economic power (like the Who song, it\u2019s \u201cmeet the new boss, same as the old boss.\u201d)In this narrative, 1989 marks the liberation not of the people, but of the Communist elites. They were liberated from fear (of party purges and anti-Communist uprisings), guilt, ideology, the chains of community and even national loyalty \u2014 before they had the privilege to travel; now they have the right to be part of the West. Before they ran the country, but now they own it. The shadow power of the old elites has become the ultimate explanation for everything that went wrong after 1989 \u2014 rising inequality, betrayed expectations.Mr. Kaczynski\u2019s politics of anger, like Mr. Putin\u2019s politics of resentment, resonates with the younger generations, who live in a world where history no longer matters. They have Google and smartphones but little patience for the moral complexities of the Communist period, and thus no desire to understand what Mr. Walesa actually did in the 1970s, or what choices Mr. Gorbachev faced in the 1980s. For those generations that cannot claim any personal experience with the destructive and self-destructive nature of revolutionary politics, moderation is neither inspiring nor justified.The heroes of 1989 traded peace for justice. It was a noble compromise. But today, when peace is taken for granted, the deficit of justice is all that remains.Advertisement"}

Facebook\u2019s international headquarters are in Dublin.The change means the company will pay taxes in Britain on its local sales, as opposed to the current structure, in which Facebook primarily pays taxes through its Irish operation. The new structure will take effect in early April, according to the company.\u201cU.K. sales made directly by our U.K. team will be booked in the U.K., not Ireland,\u201d Lena Pietsch, a Facebook spokeswoman, said in a statement on Friday. \u201cFacebook U.K. will then record the revenue from these sales.\u201dWhile Facebook did not disclose how much more British tax it would pay, it is likely the company will pay significantly more than it currently does on its operations in Britain.In 2014, the latest year for which records are available, Facebook paid a mere $6,100 in British corporation tax, or slightly less than the average British worker paid in income tax.From 2008 to 2014, it paid a combined $1.2 million in taxes to the British government, while recording a $76.5 million loss over the same period, according to DueDil, a data research company.That compares with $16.2 million in taxes that Facebook paid to Ireland\u2019s tax authorities from 2008 to 2014, according to company filings analyzed by DueDil. Facebook had $3.6 million in pretax profit on its Irish operations over the period.The biggest American tech companies face intensifying scrutiny by European regulators, with \u2014 pressure that could potentially curb their sizable profits in the region and affect how they operate around the world.Facebook\u2019s efforts to revamp its accounting structure in Britain follow changes in the country\u2019s tax laws aimed at forcing companies to pay more tax on revenue generated there.The so-called Google tax \u2014 officially called the diverted profits tax \u2014 charges companies a 25 percent tax rate on profits on British revenue that the country\u2019s tax authorities consider to be artificially moved overseas to avoid the British system.For many American tech companies, many of which use complicated tax structures through the likes of Ireland and Luxembourg to reduce their global tax burdens, Europe\u2019s more aggressive stance is starting to bite.Along with its continuing negotiations with French and Italian tax authorities over potential back taxes, Google also recently agreed to pay an extra $183 million in taxes to the British government to cover the 10-year period through 2015.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "It\u2019s Discounted, but Is It a Deal? How List Prices Lost Their Meaning", "Date": "2016-03-06", "News": "Supported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 As traditional retailing falters, shutting stores and shedding workers, online merchants are reaping the rewards. People like the convenience of e-commerce, and they love the feeling that they are getting a deal.The perception of a bargain is fostered by online retailers\u2019 use of something variously labeled list price, suggested price, reference price or manufacturer\u2019s suggested retail price. Whatever its name, the implication is that people are paying much more somewhere else.But with many products online, you could not pay the list price even if you wanted to. That is because hardly anyone is actually charging it. It is a sales tactic that is drawing legal scrutiny, as well as prompting questions about the integrity of e-commerce. If everyone is getting a deal, is anyone really getting a deal?Here is one recent example of how retailers use list prices to motivate online buyers: Le Creuset\u2019s iron-handle skillet, 11 \u00be inches wide and cherry in color.The use of list prices online is at the heart of a case in a California Court of Appeal. Overstock.com, a popular online merchant, was found liable in a lower court for using misleading reference prices to exaggerate potential customer savings. It was fined $6.8 million, twice the size of the next-largest penalty for false advertising in California.In its appeal, Overstock said it followed \u201cstandard industry practices\u201d to come up with its reference prices. Internet retailers including Wayfair, Walmart, Rakuten (formerly Buy.com), Crate & Barrel and Williams-Sonoma employ list prices to varying degrees. Amazon, the biggest e-commerce player, uses them extensively and prominently.If some Internet retailers have an expansive definition of list price, the Federal Trade Commission does not.\u201cIf you\u2019re selling $15 pens for $7.50, but just about everybody else is also selling the pens for $7.50, then saying the list price is $15 is a lie,\u201d said David C. Vladeck, the former director of the F.T.C.\u2019s Bureau of Consumer Protection. \u201cAnd if you\u2019re doing this frequently, it\u2019s a serious problem.\u201d\u201cThe list price has become a meaningless piece of information,\u201d said Mr. Compeau, who was an expert witness for the California district attorneys who brought the case against Overstock.Meaningless, but useful. Even as the importance of a fixed list price has waned in the physical world, it has become more deeply embedded online.Retailers, as Amazon indicated, often are supplied with list prices by the manufacturer or the brand. \u201cThe manufacturer uses list price in an aspirational way \u2014 it\u2019s what they wish they could charge,\u201d said Victor Rosenman, the chief executive of Feedvisor, a start-up that helps e-commerce companies price competitively.\u201cThen the retailer says to his customer, \u2018The manufacturer recommended X, but I\u2019m selling it at Y. It\u2019s a better deal,\u2019 \u201d Mr. Rosenman said. \u201cAs to how that price compares to anyone else, it\u2019s your job as a consumer to figure out.\u201dThe Overstock case went to trial in late 2013. In one example cited by the district attorneys, a man bought a patio set from the retailer. It cost him $450, a discount of 55 percent from the list price of $999. The buyer was somewhat alarmed to find a Walmart price tag on his purchase for $247, a price he confirmed was the going retail price.Overstock said that was a simple error, but among the evidence presented during the trial were internal documents indicating that deals were not as good as they seemed. \u201cOh I think it\u2019s been established that the \u2018List Price\u2019 is egregiously overstated,\u201d one Overstock memo said. \u201cThis place has some balls.\u201dIn another email, Overstock asked a supplier to increase its list price, presumably so the Overstock price would appear even cheaper by contrast. An internal Overstock survey revealed during the trial found that its reference prices were on average 15 percent higher than the highest price that could be found online.Overstock maintained to the appeals court that \u201cinjury to consumers was minimal\u201d and said the $6.8 million in penalties was \u201cgrossly disproportionate.\u201d A spokesman declined to comment.In an earlier era, list prices were intended to prevent retailers from gouging customers \u2014 if $40 was printed on the box, a customer might flee if charged $60. Manufacturers also wanted to signal quality by discouraging deep discounting. They hoped retailers would stick to the printed price.But online, list prices are even more important.After the Overstock suit, online pricing policies are coming under greater scrutiny.Last month, a proposed class-action suit was filed against Wayfair in California asserting that the retailer falsely advertised discounts for items that it had never sold at a higher price. \u201cThe referenced former retail prices were fabricated,\u201d the plaintiffs claimed. Wayfair declined to comment.Mary Rodgers, a spokeswoman for Cuisinart, said the $75 list price was \u201cthe highest price you could actually see the product being sold for.\u201d She said as far as she knew, no one was selling the processor for that price.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Technology Expands the World for African Artists", "Date": "2016-03-24", "News": "Supported byArt for TomorrowADDIS ABABA, Ethiopia \u2014 A visit to Dawit Abebe\u2019s painting studio on a recent morning was, to put it bluntly, a bit boring. The room, which he shares with two other artists in a nondescript building down a dirt alleyway in the center of Addis Ababa, was remarkably bare for the workplace of a successful artist: a few blank canvases stacked against the back wall and a lone, large, paint-splattered canvas on an easel. When asked what the piece was meant to represent, Mr. Abebe, wearing a black T-shirt, jeans and a large silver Ethiopian Orthodox cross necklace, laughed heartily: \u201cIt\u2019s the canvas I use to clean my brushes.\u201dThe fact that Mr. Abebe\u2019s studio space was empty is a mark of success. He had recently taken a few works to the Netherlands for an exhibition, and he had shipped off the rest to his London gallerist, Kristin Hjellegjerde, who was taking them to the Volta art fair in New York in early March, where she sold all 13 of them. The two met over Facebook a few years ago, after Ms. Hjellegjerde read an article about Mr. Abebe, who had just set up his account after a friend recommended that it might help broaden his career outside of Ethiopia. \u201cI checked out what she did and with whom, and got a feel for her work,\u201d said Mr. Abebe, who, after being taken on by Ms. Hjellegjerde\u2019s gallery, was featured in a group show last year at the Saatchi Gallery in London. \u201cIf you use technology properly, it helps to promote you, to expose your work in an international way.\u201dA growing number of sub-Saharan African artists are realizing the importance and potency of technology \u2014 social media, apps, websites and online platforms focused on the promotion and archiving of African contemporary art.Smartphones, tablets and even satellite television have also played a role, showing artists that despite the crushing lack of artistic infrastructure across the region \u2014 including few strong commercial and noncommercial art galleries, museums not focused on promoting and exhibiting contemporary art and a general lack of curatorial practice, artist residencies and good art schools \u2014 there are still ways to reach out and get the attention of art managers, critics, collectors and gallerists across the region and the world. \u201cThere are people who are doing great things, but they have no galleries and no curators to look at and promote their work,\u201d said Victor Ehikhamenor, a Nigerian artist who has a master\u2019s degree in information technology. \u201cBut, say you apply for a residency. Most judges will look at your digital footprint, though they may not tell you that is how they checked your background. So in various ways that we cannot quantify, technology has helped the African artist, and has helped a whole lot of us on the continent be able to push out our work.\u201dWhile some artists, like Mr. Abebe, have been lucky enough to be contacted by a gallery owner, other artists have been the ones reaching out. After uploading their works on Instagram and Twitter, they tag curators and art dealers whom they want to have a look at their work, hoping to make a connection. Nkechi Bakare, who runs her Instagram account Art News Africa out of Lagos and has accumulated more than 86,000 followers since she started in 2014, said that every day she gets at least one message from artists asking her to review and post their work on her account. Others get in contact over social media directly with art collectors and gallerists. \u201cWe are seeing a lot of the Internet democratizing artistic conversations,\u201d said Ayo Adeyinka, an art dealer and owner of the Tafeta Gallery near Oxford Circus in central London. \u201cOne artist, Babajide Olatunji, sent me a friend request on Facebook. If you send a request, I make a polite effort to check out your page, and I saw how talented he was.\u201d They exchanged messages and spoke about where Mr. Olatunji, a young Nigerian artist, wanted to go with his career. Impressed, Mr. Adeyinka took him on as an artist \u2014 brokering sales, introducing him to institutions, and managing press and public relations.The Ghanaian artist Serge Attukwei Clottey said that thanks to the Internet, where he posts his artistic productions on his Instagram account, he not only was offered \u2014 and took \u2014 the chance to study in Brazil but he also was contacted by one of his future collectors, who is based in California.\u201cI think technology helps African artists to reach many people in the global art space,\u201d he said by email. \u201cFor example, I\u2019ve been getting many residency opportunities from all over the world because people always see my work online.\u201d Thanks also to technology like smartphones and satellite television, there are an increasing number of artists who have become interested in examining international issues in their work. \u201cIn the past what was inspiring was very local, but technology has afforded a new generation of artists the ability to tap into global issues,\u201d said Lavinia Calza, who owns the ARTLabAfrica gallery in Nairobi. \u201cSo for me, it is interesting that it has opened up some of the artistic practice here.\u201d She added that one of her artists had been examining the immigration crisis in Europe in his new works, while another was tackling the effects of air pollution across the world. There are also a growing number of online platforms \u2014 including art magazines, online galleries and research websites \u2014 that are also helping the overall promotion of African contemporary artists. Contemporary And, a website based in Germany, is both a magazine about the art scene across the continent and a platform for research and networking. \u201cThe original idea was that it was always important to make visible what was happening on the continent,\u201d said Yvette Mutumba, a curator at the Weltkulturen Museum in Frankfurt am Main, Germany. She, along with Julia Grosse, a journalist, founded Contemporary And in 2013. They recently co-curated \u201cFocus: African Perspectives \u2014 Spotlighting Artistic Practices of Global Contemporaries\u201d at the Armory Show in New York.\u201cApart from reviews and interviews,\u201d Ms. Mutumba added, \u201cart spaces were invited to send materials and photos so we can build a database of spaces. So you could figure out: \u2018I am going to Lagos, what interesting spaces should I go to and what is happening there?\u2019 So that was really important.\u201d Julie Taylor, a former Google executive living in Johannesburg, set up the online African art gallery Guns & Rain two years ago to promote artists from South Africa, Botswana, Namibia and her home country, Zimbabwe. She has mounted online exhibitions, including one with the South African artist Richard Penn, as well as one-night-only pop-up art shows, where she has used crowdfunding to raise money. \u201cGlobally, art has moved online in a big way,\u201d she said. \u201cBut despite that there are dozens of online art ventures, African contemporary art is still very much missing. I am trying to change that.\u201dOf course, the biggest problem with technology-based ventures in Africa is that the infrastructure across the continent lags far behind that in other parts of the world. Rolling electricity blackouts are an issue, as is the fact that Internet penetration, at 28.6 percent, is lower than anywhere else in the world, with countries like Ethiopia \u2014 after Nigeria the second most populous country in Africa, with 94 million people \u2014 at just 3.7 percent.\u201cThings like uploading images take up a lot of time, and if the Internet keeps going down or the electricity keeps breaking \u2014 these are the kinds of obstacles we live with,\u201d said Nana Oforiatta Ayim, a Ghanian writer and filmmaker whose Cultural Encyclopedia website project, funded by the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, was introduced at the end of last year. \u201cWe get around them and complain about them, but, sadly, that is our reality.\u201dMs. Taylor concurred. \u201cWe need to remember the issues of the digital divide,\u201d she said. \u201cI am a massive fan of technology, but it is not a panacea.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Cities to Untangle Traffic Snarls, With Help From Alphabet Unit", "Date": "2016-03-17", "News": "Supported byWheelsMOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif. \u2014 In a world where taxi rides are summoned with a button and where people have become reliant on mapping applications to get around town, a paradox has emerged: Technology companies know a lot more about a city\u2019s traffic patterns than the city officials trying to solve the problem.On Thursday, the federal Department of Transportation announced a partnership with Sidewalk Labs, a unit of Alphabet, the same technology conglomerate that owns Google, that aims to funnel transit data to city officials in hopes of making traffic more bearable and figuring out newer, smarter ways of moving people and goods around the country\u2019s urban areas.The announcement is part of an continuing \u201cSmart City\u201d competition in which the Transportation Department is dangling $40 million in grant money in front of cities to prod them into using more technology. As part of the deal, Sidewalk will work with seven finalists to develop a traffic management system that will be one of the company\u2019s core software products.\u201cWe\u2019re taking everything from anonymized smartphone data from billions of miles of trips, sensor data, and bringing that into a platform that will give both the public and private parties and government the capacity to actually understand the data in ways they haven\u2019t before,\u201d said Daniel L. Doctoroff, Sidewalk\u2019s chief executive, who is a former deputy mayor of New York City and former chief executive of Bloomberg.Sidewalk was hatched out of Google last June as an independent company that will use technology to solve urban problems \u2014 yet another example of how the Internet giant has strayed far and wide from its initial mission in online search. The company is based in New York and was conceived by Mr. Doctoroff, along with a team of Google employees led by Larry Page, one of Google\u2019s founders and now Alphabet\u2019s chief executive.In June, Sidewalk announced that it would help finance a company called Intersection that is installing thousands of Wi-Fi kiosks across New York City, but the company has otherwise said little about its aspirations or what kinds of technologies it might develop.Thursday\u2019s announcement gave some insights. As part of the Transportation Department competition, Sidewalk will work with the seven finalists to develop a software platform called Flow to help cities diagnose and fix congestion problems.Flow looks a lot like Google Maps, and the search giant\u2019s mapping data is at the core of the product. But the idea is to help cities dive deeper.The Flow system makes inferences about where people are coming from or going, so planners could tap on a congested road segment and find out what kind of traffic \u2014 morning commuters, for example, or weekend traffic to a baseball game \u2014 was contributing to the problem. They would also be able to run virtual experiments such as how much traffic would be reduced if they added a bus route or car pool lane along the choke point.Sidewalk is still figuring out how it will try to make money from the system, but it is likely to use a subscription-based model in which cities pay for different tiers of data and higher levels of analytic and diagnostic abilities.Mr. Doctoroff said this idea of partnering \u2014 with private companies, but also governments \u2014 will be central to how he builds Sidewalk.\u201cOur mission is basically to leverage technology to solve big urban problems,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd often, in fact I would argue most often, the path by which you do that goes through at least one level of government.\u201dThe Transportation Department introduced its Smart City Challenge in December, and by February, it had 78 proposals for new ways to use data and technology to improve transportation. Most large and medium-size American cities applied. The winner will receive $40 million to carry out its proposal.The first round of applications was due in February. The Transportation Department announced the seven finalists \u2014 Columbus, Ohio; Kansas City, Mo.; Pittsburgh; Denver; Portland, Ore.; San Francisco; and Austin, Tex. \u2014 last weekend at the South by Southwest music, film and technology festival.Those finalists will now work with each other and Sidewalk to fine-tune their proposals, which, in turn, will help Sidewalk figure out what kinds of features or analytics to build into the Flow system. In addition to the $40 million check, the eventual winner, which will be announced in June, will receive various perks like use of the Flow system and 100 Wi-Fi kiosks that will provide free Internet in parts of the city.\u201cEmpowering disadvantaged communities to take advantage of technology and innovation is a key component of the Smart City Challenge,\u201d Transportation Secretary Anthony Foxx said in an emailed statement.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Whole Foods Plans 100 Rooftop Solar Systems", "Date": "2016-03-08", "News": "Supported byThings at Whole Foods are about to get even greener.The grocery chain plans to install as many as 100 rooftop solar systems, mainly through the power provider NRG Energy, on nearly a quarter of its stores and distribution centers, the companies said on Tuesday. SolarCity will also provide systems for the grocer, which could expand the rooftop solar program as the installations proceed.\u201cInstalling solar at Whole Foods locations across the country will increase the percentage of renewable energy that is generated in communities where we work,\u201d Kathy Luftus, global leader in sustainability at the company, said in a prepared statement. NRG plans to install systems in nine states, including California, Colorado, Connecticut, Massachusetts, Nevada and Texas.Solar energy is in keeping with the Whole Foods image but it will also save the company money, because the solar providers can offer electricity at prices below what the stores and centers would normally pay utilities.The grocer has been under pressure to reduce costs as it has faced increasing competition from other chains offering specialty and organic foods at lower prices.For NRG, the move shows that the company, in retreat from an ambitious attempt under its former chief executive, David Crane, to become the Google or Apple of green energy, will pursue the market for renewables on a large scale.The new chief executive, Mauricio Gutierrez, told investors last month that NRG was refocusing on its core business and was in negotiations concerning the fate of the home solar and electric vehicle charging divisions that he expected to complete in the second quarter of this year.\u201cSimplification of our business is an imperative, both for external perception and internal focus,\u201d he said on a conference call. \u201cNot all renewable businesses are viewed the same in terms of fit and value for NRG.\u201dThat means NRG, which has headquarters in Princeton, N.J., and Houston, will continue to invest in large-scale wind and solar, including rooftop systems for commercial and industrial customers like Whole Foods, said Craig Cornelius, senior vice president.The installations, which will range from five to 200 times the size of a typical home array, are attractive, Mr. Cornelius said, because the larger scale allows NRG to replicate a similar design across several sites.\u201cIt really just comes down to streamlined engineering design, economies of scale in equipment purchasing and construction, and the finance-ability of Whole Foods as a quality customer,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}

But according to several people involved with the settlement on both sides, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss confidential financial terms, Spotify will pay publishers between $16 million and $25 million in royalties that are already owed but unpaid \u2014 the exact amount, these people said, is still undetermined \u2014 as well as a $5 million penalty. In exchange, the publishers will refrain from filing copyright infringement claims against Spotify.The settlement concerns mechanical licensing rights, which refer to a copyright holder\u2019s control over the ability to reproduce a musical work. The rule goes back to the days of player-piano rolls, but in the digital era mechanical rights have joined the tangle of licensing deals that streaming services need to operate legally.Over the last year, it emerged that Spotify \u2014 which has long trumpeted itself to the music industry as a law-abiding partner \u2014 had failed to properly obtain the mechanical licenses for large numbers of songs.The lack of mechanical licenses looms as a major liability for streaming services, and the publishers\u2019 association estimates that as much as 25 percent of the activity on these platforms is unlicensed. Several musicians filed class-action suits seeking as much as $200 million in damages for copyright infringement.Spotify countered that it lacked the data to sort out which publishers had legitimate claims over songs, or even how to locate all the parties, because no central and authoritative database existed covering all music rights. Late last year the company committed to developing an administrative system to solve the problem, but by then its settlement talks with the publishers were already underway.The gaps between what Spotify, Apple Music and others offer have been getting bigger and more complicated as artists have wielded more power in withholding their music from one outlet or another.\u201cI am thrilled that through this agreement, both independent and major publishers and songwriters will be able to get what is owed to them,\u201d David M. Israelite, the president of the publishers\u2019 association, said in a statement.Jonathan Prince, a spokesman for Spotify, added, \u201cAs we have said many times, we have always been committed to paying songwriters and publishers every penny.\u201dAccording to the terms of the deal, participating publishers will use an online portal to register their claims over songs, and then receive their share of royalties owed as well as their portion of the bonus fund. Any unclaimed money would be divided according to the publishers\u2019 market share.The deal is likely to serve as a template for settlements with other services. In recent months, infringement suits have been filed against Rhapsody, Google, Tidal and others.While the deal takes some pressure off Spotify, it has already been criticized as details of the settlement talks \u2014 ostensibly private and confidential \u2014 were leaked widely in recent weeks.\u201cThe N.M.P.A. settlement does not address the problem and it does not fix it,\u201d said Jeff Price, the chief executive of Audiam, a company that specializes in tracking down unpaid royalties online and has tussled with Spotify in the past over publishing data.The settlement will most likely reduce the size of the class-action suits filed against Spotify. Representatives of several publishers said that they expected many publishers, large and small, to participate in the settlement. Mr. Price said that Audiam would pursue its own settlement talks on behalf of its clients.The low penalty from the National Music Publishers\u2019 Association settlement, Mr. Price said, \u201crewards bad behavior.\u201dAdvertisement"}

It was interesting to see how women behave when they\u2019re with each other with no men around.\u201d Ms. Tifford, he said, was \u201cvery gracious as always.\u201d\u201cAll of these men take the credit, but I was the one who saw the Internet\u2019s potential for this kind of testing,\u201d Ms. Zalis said. \u201cThe movie business is online because of me.\u201d (I gave her a look: Wasn\u2019t she overstating things a tad? She stared back, not budging.)\u201cPairing and sharing,\u201d said Ms. Zalis, who has a fondness for catchphrases.The Girls\u2019 Lounge definitely has its detractors. While reluctant to publicly criticize another woman, especially one working toward an admirable goal, a half-dozen women I approached \u2014 senior media executives, a retired state judge, lawyers \u2014 told me that they thought Ms. Zalis was hurting professional women by using the \u201cG word.\u201d \u201cA girl is a juvenile, someone who isn\u2019t ready, and I\u2019ve fought my entire career to avoid being perceived as that,\u201d one Warner Bros. executive said.Among the other comments: \u201cIt sounds like a bathroom\u201d; \u201cAnything that makes us separate from men is harmful\u201d; \u201cI embrace my femininity \u2014 I wear dresses to work, I shop on business trips \u2014 but if I told my male colleagues that I was headed for the Girls\u2019 Lounge, it would only cement in their minds that I\u2019m not as good as them.\u201dEven several of Ms. Zalis\u2019s supporters conceded that the Girls\u2019 Lounge took some getting used to. \u201cIt\u2019s an unlikely name for what is really going on there,\u201d said Joanna Barsh, a director emeritus at McKinsey & Company. Ms. Barsh added: \u201cShelley is not making a difference because she\u2019s timid. She\u2019s brazen. This woman is a force of nature \u2014 an extraordinary, energized bundle.\u201dMs. Zalis, who sometimes describes herself as \u201cchief troublemaker,\u201d knows that she offends some people by using the world \u201cgirls\u201d to describe grown women, especially businesswomen. And she doesn\u2019t care.\u201cA lot of us have never really had girlfriends in business, because we\u2019ve been alone,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s called the boys club. Why can\u2019t I have a Girls\u2019 Lounge?\u201dMs. Rothbard also supported the salon atmosphere. \u201cWithout some kind of psychological safety, it is often very difficult to have these conversations,\u201d she said.Ms. Zalis is certainly talkative. During our nearly two-hour coffee (and subsequent phone chats), she barely let me get a word in, veering from serious to informal and back to serious. One minute she was listing plans for the future \u2014 Girls\u2019 Lounge \u201cboot camps\u201d for companies, a bus tour with Ms. Huffington, a partnership with Barneys New York \u2014 and the next she was recounting a \u201csignature Shelley moment\u201d involving an airborne bra.\u201cWe were driving to the airport in Las Vegas, when the trunk popped open and my suitcase fell out,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was run over by a tour bus, and then every car started dragging my things across the highway. There goes a bra. Here comes a blouse.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Vance Jr., the Manhattan district attorney. \u201cNot together,\u201d stressed Aimee Bell, the deputy editor of Vanity Fair and another regular.\u201cIt\u2019s the new Lamb\u2019s Club,\u201d Ms. Nnadi said of the Odeon, which regulars refer to as \u201cthe O.\u201dMs. Malle, who likes to conclude her lunches by polishing off a dish of house-made ice cream, compared Brookfield Place to the Dubai airport. \u201cAnd I\u2019ve been to Dubai,\u201d she said.The Odeon arrived in TriBeCa in October 1980, opened by the British-born Brian McNally, his younger brother Keith McNally, and Keith\u2019s American girlfriend, Lynn Wagenknecht, with $150,000 in seed money from their families and a couple of close friends.Keith McNally had acquired a substantial customer Rolodex after working as a headwaiter at One Fifth, a restaurant near the north end of Washington Square Park that was decorated like the inside of a cruise ship and had become popular among artists, writers and the cast of \u201cSaturday Night Live,\u201d which had many of its post-show-parties there. (Brian had been the bartender there and Lynn had waited tables.)The three were taking a significant risk. Back then, getting south of the Holland Tunnel was for taxi drivers an endeavor somewhat akin to passing through the Bermuda Triangle. High-end furniture showrooms did not yet exist.Odeon, said the author Jay McInerney, who helped put it on the map and is now a wine columnist for Hearst, was: \u201can oasis in the desert. There wasn\u2019t much down there. There was commercial industrial activity during the day, and at night they were very dark streets.\u201dSeated on a recent afternoon at a table by the wall, Brian McNally said, \u201cAll of us thought it would last a week.\u201d Mr. McNally, a stout man of 67 whose streaks of gray and other markings of middle age do little to detract from his boyish demeanor, was surrounded by the deco furnishings that have ornamented the place since the days of Janice Dickinson and Bolivian marching powder.The McNallys and Ms. Wagenknecht, 62, who has a degree in art history from Stanford and spends much of her spare time painting, had both a voracious appetite for culture (Keith, 64, had briefly been an actor, starring in plays by Alan Bennett) and coolheaded business sense.\u201cWe didn\u2019t do drugs,\u201d Ms. Wagenknecht said. \u201cWe were actually sort of na\u00efve about them.\u201dThe food was always good, mostly impervious to the loopy trends (verticality, foam, pig trotters) that overtook restaurant culture over the next two decades.During that time, Ms. Wagenknecht and Keith McNally would marry and then divorce, Brian would break off from Keith in a feud that lasted many years, and each brother would open other restaurants.\u201cWe would pull down the metal gate in front at 4 a.m. and people inside could stay until 6 a.m.,\u201d Brian McNally said.The writer Dirk Wittenborn, who often accompanied his good friend John Belushi there, said, \u201cNo place was open that late.\u201d (And it no longer is, closing down no later than midnight these days, reflecting the new lock step of affluent Manhattanites to the Google calendar.) Many longtime customers recall Mr. Belushi taking over the kitchen one night, although getting the particulars is about as likely as explaining the Cuban missile crisis.There were other actors as well, like Harvey Keitel, who went there with a date early on, using the occasion to try out a long-coveted belted leather trench coat like the ones he used to see in movies about World War II but was nervous to wear himself.\u201cI thought \u2018Now\u2019s the perfect time, because no one\u2019s around on the street,\u2019\u201d Mr. Keitel said. \u201cSo I put on the trench coat, I go down to the Odeon, and there\u2019s a guy sitting there in a booth on the opposite side of the bar, and he looks at me and he says, \u2018Harv.\u2019 Real slow. I peer down and it\u2019s Jack Nicholson. And the next thing out of his mouth is \u2018You\u2019re wearing a leather trench coat?\u2019 That was the first and last time I ever wore it.\u201dAnother evening that didn\u2019t end so well was a party celebrating the gallerist Mary Boone\u2019s 30th birthday, with the sort of crowd that she described in New York glitterati shorthand as \u201ceverybody.\u201dThis meant a pile of big artists, among them David Salle, Julian Schnabel and Jean-Michel Basquiat. Sometime during the course of the evening, Mr. Schnabel and Mr. Basquiat went downstairs to the bathrooms and decided to do a little art project of their own, soaking all the toilet paper in the toilet bowls, after which they threw them up on the walls.\u201cLike snowballs,\u201d Ms. Boone said, describing perhaps the duo\u2019s only creative efforts from that time not to be sold later on by her or Mr. Gagosian, another super-gallerist regular at the Odeon, for millions of dollars.\u201cKeith just threw us out,\u201d Ms. Boone said. \u201cWe didn\u2019t get to have birthday cake.\u201dOver the next few years, the Odeon\u2019s supremacy (\u201ca downtown Elaine\u2019s,\u201d is how the publisher Morgan Entrekin put it) only seemed to increase. Keith Haring began coming in, as did Andy Warhol, Robert Mapplethorpe and Calvin Klein.But by the publication of Mr. McInerney\u2019s first novel, \u201cBright Lights, Big City\u201d in 1984, which had a picture of the Odeon on the cover and scenes set there, the relationship between Brian and Keith was beginning to fray.\u201cKeith was the driving pulse of the place,\u201d Brian McNally said. \u201cI was, by definition, less responsible.\u201d (Keith said at first that he would prefer to answer questions about the Odeon over email. When asked for a little more than that, he said he\u2019d like not to be interviewed at all.)Brian left the operation and went on to start a number of restaurants, including 150 Wooster Street, the Canal Bar and, most successfully, Indochine. During the aughts, he moved to Saigon, Vietnam, where he still spends part of the year.Keith and Lynn began colonizing the rest of the city, heading first to the Upper West Side with their second successful update on the French bistro Caf\u00e9 Luxembourg (Odeon for the Central Park set). After that came Nell\u2019s, a dinner spot and nightclub on West 14th Street that Ms. Wagenknecht ran until 2006. In 1989, the couple opened Lucky Strike on Grand Street.Following the couple\u2019s divorce in the early \u201990s, Ms. Wagenknecht bought Keith out of Caf\u00e9 Luxembourg and the Odeon, both of which she operates today; Keith kept Lucky Strike. \u201cShe deserved it,\u201d Brian said. \u201cWhy not?\u201dAfter a brief detour in film direction, Keith began building his empire. Many of his restaurants have been remixes of the original concept: Balthazar (which one might think of Hard Rock Odeon) in SoHo, Pastis (\u201cSex and the City\u201d Odeon) in the meatpacking district, Schiller\u2019s Liquor Bar (hipster Odeon) on the Lower East Side and Minetta Tavern (hedge-fund Odeon) in Greenwich Village. There was also Pulino\u2019s on the Bowery, an upscale pizzeria recently refashioned as, you guessed it, yet another French bistro, Cherche Midi. (Bowery Odeon).Meanwhile, the original was changing in profound ways.AIDS killed many of the restaurant\u2019s loyalists, as well as its employees. \u201cI can\u2019t tell you how many waiters died,\u201d Brian McNally said. Others overdosed (see Mr. Belushi 1982) or moved away, particularly as the city and the economy changed.Out went the artists. In rolled the bankers and their blond wives, their bodies honed at nearby Flywheel, followed by Bugaboo strollers. \u201cTriBeCa became what it is today, and I left,\u201d Mr. Bleckner said.And though the McNallys and Ms. Wagenknecht remained and even capitalized on the transformation of the city, they are smart and introspective enough to feel somewhat conflicted about it.Looking out a packed dining room, Ms. Wagenknecht offered that even now, when creative people have returned to the fold, she can barely identify anyone eating there. The expression on her face was actually a little sad, like a person who appears to have gotten over the death of a loved one decades ago and then finds the person\u2019s picture buried at the bottom of a desk drawer. Later this year, Keith is opening a new restaurant near ground zero in the coming Beekman Hotel and Ms. Wagenknecht is aware it will take some of her new customers away.But with Elaine\u2019s gone and the idea of a convivial lunch in New York increasingly old-fashioned, the regulars at the revivified Odeon seem merely grateful it\u2019s still here.They chalk up its success over the years \u2014 including as a local refuge after 9/11 and through two financial crises \u2014 to its excellent service (no one at Odeon seems to wait more than 15 to 20 minutes for anything, and that\u2019s on a bad day) and a broadly appealing menu that now includes a kale salad (\u201cIn the \u201980s it was kiwi,\u201d Ms. Wagenknecht said of the ingredient du hour) along with ye olde reliable oysters and soft, perfect omelets.Speaking of the food at Elaine\u2019s, Mr. Entrekin said, \u201cIf you did a steak or a veal chop, you were O.K.,\u201d adding, \u201cThe food at Odeon is better.\u201dMs. Regan is particularly partial to the fris\u00e9e with poached egg. \u201cThe crowd waxes and wanes, but the truth is, it makes no difference,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s like the boyfriend you\u2019re still friends with. The one you like even after you broke up with him.\u201dShe praised the service, yes, but also the lighting.\u201cThat amber lighting, which becomes more important to you as you get older,\u201d Ms. Regan said. \u201cIt\u2019s home.\u201dThree pictures last Thursday with an article about the re-emergence of the Odeon, a fixture of the downtown Manhattan dining scene, were published in error. They were of scenes from Cafe Luxembourg on the Upper West Side, not of the Odeon. (The filmmaker Gus Van Sant, shown in one photograph, was misidentified as Jim Jarmusch.) In addition, the article described incorrectly the fris\u00e9e salad, a signature dish of the Odeon. It is made \u2014 and always has been \u2014 with a poached egg, not a chopped egg. The article also misidentified a mall near the restaurant. It is Brookfield Place \u2014 not Westfield World Trade Center, which is also nearby. And because of an editing error, the article gave an outdated name for another restaurant owned by Keith McNally and Lynn Wagenknecht, who together opened the Odeon in 1980. It is now the Cherche Midi, no longer Pulino\u2019s.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "American Tech Giants Face Fight in Europe Over Encrypted Data", "Date": "2016-03-27", "News": "Supported byROME \u2014 Silicon Valley\u2019s battle over encryption is heading to Europe.This week, French lawmakers are expected to debate proposals to toughen laws, giving intelligence services greater power to get access to personal data.The battle has pitted Europe\u2019s fears about the potential for further attacks against concerns from Apple and other American technology giants like Google and Facebook that weakening encryption technologies may create so-called back doors to people\u2019s digital information that could be misused by European law enforcement officials, or even intelligence agencies of unfriendly countries.The recent attacks have pushed many Europeans to favor greater powers for law enforcement over privacy. But opponents say such measures should not undermine the region\u2019s tough data protection rules that enshrine privacy on par with other rights like freedom of expression.This balance between national security and privacy has put major countries in the region on opposite sides of the debate, with Germany and the Netherlands dismissing encryption laws being considered by Britain and France.\u201cFundamental rights are just that, fundamental,\u201d said Nico van Eijk, a data protection expert at the University of Amsterdam. \u201cOf course, there are exceptions for national security reasons. But governments have to be pragmatic.\u201dThat pragmatism has led to a series of new proposals across Europe that, if approved, would give national intelligence agencies renewed powers to compel the likes of Apple, Google and Facebook to hand over encrypted information.And on Tuesday, French politicians will debate proposals to update antiterrorism laws that may hand tech executives prison sentences of up to five years, as well as fine their companies around $390,000, if they refuse to provide encrypted information to the country\u2019s investigators.Amendments to the French law \u2014 itself a response to the attacks in November \u2014 may still pass without the encryption proposals, which are opposed by France\u2019s left-wing government.But politicians and industry executives say Apple\u2019s fight with the F.B.I. has focused a spotlight on how companies\u2019 efforts to protect users\u2019 messages and other data have made it increasingly difficult for European intelligence agencies to obtain such information.\u201cWhen we\u2019re able to recover a cellphone, but authorities have no way of accessing its data, it obviously cripples the work of our surveillance agencies,\u201d said Philippe Goujon, a French politician behind the recent encryption proposals.\u201cSure, this could have repercussions internationally,\u201d he added. \u201cBut there are other countries in the world that have similar legislation.\u201dAll the talk about data privacy can get caught up in political wrangling. But the different approaches have practical consequences for people, too.Europe\u2019s attempts to get access to encrypted data have not gone unchallenged by Apple.Timothy D. Cook, Apple\u2019s chief executive, has, for instance, met with a string of European politicians, including France\u2019s prime minister, Manuel Valls, and Britain\u2019s home secretary, Theresa May, in recent months to lobby for tough encryption technology.And to show that the company is trying to be cooperative, Apple\u2019s executives have also provided unencrypted information, including so-called metadata on people\u2019s phone calls and GPS coordinates, as part of terrorism investigations in Europe, according to a person with knowledge of the matter, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak publicly.Such efforts, in part, have paid off with some European governments that remain skeptical of plans to weaken companies\u2019 encryption technology in the name of national security.Such loopholes, the Dutch government said, would \u201calso make encrypted files vulnerable to criminals, terrorists and foreign intelligence services.\u201dAs pressure in parts of Europe mounts over access to encrypted data, industry watchers say attention is expected to focus on Britain \u2014 a top international market for most American tech companies \u2014 where expanded powers for the country\u2019s intelligence services are likely to come into force by the end of the year. The legislation is the brainchild of the ruling Conservative Party, which has a sufficient parliamentary majority to enact the regulatory changes.Under the proposals, the Investigatory Powers Bill would force Internet and telecommunications companies to hold records of websites visited by people in Britain over the last 12 months. It also would provide the country\u2019s intelligence agencies with a legal mandate for the bulk collection of large quantities of data, while allowing them to hack individual devices under certain situations.Ms. May, Britain\u2019s home secretary, told lawmakers this year that such powers were required to defend the country\u2019s security. She added that the legislation offered sufficient transparency and oversight about how British spies conducted their activities to calm people\u2019s privacy concerns.But for Apple and other Silicon Valley companies, the proposal also includes new powers that can permit the British government to demand that companies remove encryption protections where \u201creasonably practicable\u201d to gain access to digital communications.The British government stresses that such rules would not undermine companies\u2019 services because they may not apply to so-called end-to-end encryption, technology used by the likes of Apple\u2019s iMessage and FaceTime services, as well as Facebook\u2019s WhatsApp Internet messenger.Such concerns, security experts say, could be compounded if other national governments \u2014 either in Europe or farther afield \u2014 followed Britain\u2019s lead by passing similar legislation.Hannah Olivennes contributed reporting from London.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Patagonia to Help Fund Residential Solar Installations", "Date": "2016-03-10", "News": "Supported byPatagonia has made a name for itself as an environmentally conscious brand, linking the outdoors clothing and gear that it sells with a commitment to taking care of the planet.Now, it is taking that a step further by investing in placing solar panels on more than 1,500 residential rooftops over eight states. Patagonia announced on Thursday that it was working with four other companies to create a $35 million fund to finance the installations.\u201cI hope that other companies that are interested in having a positive impact will look at this as a model,\u201d said Rose Marcario, Patagonia\u2019s chief executive. She added that the faster clean energy takes off, \u201cthe better off we all are going to be.\u201dPatagonia\u2019s foray into home energy began when a solar developer whom Ms. Marcario knew introduced her to the concept of tax equity investing, a complex type of transaction that was limiting the pool of investors for clean energy development. Financiers of solar projects are entitled to a tax credit worth 30 percent of a project\u2019s cost, but not all developers have enough profit to use it.Over the years, some large companies like Google have taken advantage of the approach by investing in a variety of clean energy installations, as have retail chains like Walmart and Costco, which have the roof space to put in panels for their own energy needs.But not many companies have found a way to help families get over the financial hurdle of installing solar in their homes, a niche that Ms. Marcario decided Patagonia should try to help fill.Patagonia had already created a fund called $20 Million and Change to help start-up companies focused on solving environmental and other issues. Two years ago, through $20 Million and Change, the company formed a $27 million fund with Kina\u2019ole Capital, a solar finance company, to install 1,000 residential systems in Hawaii.Now, Patagonia is again working with Kina\u2019ole, as well as New Resource Bank, Beneficial State Bank and the installer Sungevity, all certified B corporations. Such companies are part of a growing approach that requires executives to take into account not just how decisions will affect profit and shareholders, but also how they will affect the public, generally defined as society or the environment.\u201cWe all recognized that the B-corp relationship created a kind of mutual interest in the business and the social and environmental side of how we run our businesses. That naturally led to a conversation that became this deal,\u201d said Andrew Birch, chief executive of Sungevity. \u201cThis is a new name providing new funding for the solar sector, and that\u2019s very important.\u201dThe systems will be available in Arizona, California, Connecticut, Delaware, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey and New York.An earlier version of this article misstated the incorporation category of Patagonia\u2019s partners in the solar installation fund. Only Patagonia is a benefit corporation, a legal status available in 30 states and the District of Columbia. Its partners are certified B corporations. Both corporate approaches require executives to take public benefits into account in business decisions.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Apple Policy on Bugs May Explain Why Hackers Would Help F.B.I.", "Date": "2016-03-22", "News": "Supported byFor all the steps Apple has taken to encrypt customers\u2019 communications and its rhetoric around customer privacy, security experts said the company was still doing less than many competitors to seal up its systems from hackers. And when hackers do find flaws in Apple\u2019s code, they have little incentive to turn them over to the company for fixing.Apple, which has had relatively strong security over the years, has been open about how security is a never-ending cat-and-mouse game and how it is unwilling to engage in a financial arms race to pay for code exploits.The company has yet to give hackers anything more than a gold star. When hackers do turn over serious flaws in its products, they may see their name listed on the company\u2019s website \u2014 but that is it. That is a far cry from what hackers can expect if they sell an Apple flaw on the thriving underground market where a growing number of companies and government agencies are willing to pay hackers handsomely.But security experts, especially those with a stake in such bug programs, said Apple could now be doing more, especially in this day and age where the conventions of finding bugs and fixing them have changed.Just this week, researchers at Johns Hopkins University uncovered a flaw that would allow attackers to decrypt the contents of photos and videos attached in Apple\u2019s iMessage program. The researchers turned that flaw over to Apple for patching.\u201cEspecially with the stakes being as high as they are, if Apple wants to continue to compete in the modern world, they have to modernize their approach,\u201d said Katie Moussouris, a chief policy officer at HackerOne, which companies like Yahoo, Dropbox and now Uber pay to manage their bug bounty programs.The identity of the third party that approached the F.B.I. with the possible way to unlock the iPhone \u2014 which was used by one of the attackers in a mass shooting in San Bernardino, Calif., last year \u2014 remained unknown on Tuesday. The emergence of the third party halted, at least temporarily, a contentious case between Apple and the United States government over whether the company should weaken the security of its iPhone to help law enforcement.The Justice Department has declined to name the third-party person or organization, or to describe the proposed method for breaking into the device. The third party may not have approached Apple for many reasons.In the past, Microsoft\u2019s systems were a more frequent target for malicious-minded hackers, largely because of the prevalence of its products. But as Microsoft began to embrace the hacking community, its security improved.The technology company has been locked in a major legal battle against law enforcement officials over privacy and security.As Apple\u2019s desktops and mobile phones have gained more market share, and as customers began to entrust more and more of their personal data to their iPhones, Apple products have become far more valuable marks for criminals and spies.An Apple spokeswoman referred to an editorial by Craig Federighi, the company\u2019s senior vice president for software engineering, in which he wrote, \u201cSecurity is an endless race \u2014 one that you can lead but never decisively win.\u201d\u201cOur team must work tirelessly to stay one step ahead of criminal attackers who seek to pry into personal information,\u201d Mr. Federighi said. \u201cDespite our best efforts, nothing is 100 percent secure.\u201dApple has long been less visible in the security community compared with other tech companies. The company has shied away from bug bounty programs and instead relied on large testing programs and the work of its security team to spot vulnerabilities, partly because it is disinclined to keep up with a financial arms race of paying for bugs, according to three former and current employees, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly about security matters.Apple has said it will fight to know more about the flaw in the software or hardware that the third party has presented to law enforcement. A senior executive said in a conference call with reporters Tuesday that if the government found the method did not work and tried to force Apple to help break into the phone, Apple would have questions about what was tried, in order to keep its products as secure as possible.If the third-party method does work, the government may dismiss a court order demanding that Apple weaken its security, but keep the process it used to break into the phone under seal. In that case, Apple would have no way of knowing how the government broke into its software or hardware.Exploits in Apple\u2019s code have become increasingly coveted over time, especially as its mobile devices have become ubiquitous, with an underground ecosystem of brokers and contractors willing to pay top dollar for them.Flaws in Apple\u2019s mobile devices can typically fetch $1 million. Last September, a boutique firm in Washington, called Zerodium, which sells flaws to governments and corporations, announced a $1 million bounty for anyone who would turn over an exploit in Apple\u2019s iOS 9 mobile operating system \u2014 the same operating system used to power the iPhone used by the San Bernardino shooter. By November, Zerodium said a team of undisclosed hackers had successfully claimed the bounty.Chaouki Bekrar, the founder of Zerodium, said his company was not the outside party referred to in the government\u2019s court filing on Monday. But Mr. Bekrar added that even if Zerodium had helped the F.B.I., he would not disclose it.\u201cFor every Zerodium, there are a thousand other organizations like Zerodium that are far less vocal about doing what they do and will pay researchers who find this stuff to keep it a secret,\u201d said Casey Ellis, the founder of BugCrowd, a company in San Franciso that helps vendors manage bug bounty programs.Some security researchers said no bounty Apple could offer now would match the reward they could expect from the underground market. Apple has waited so long that the black market for its flaws has become extremely lucrative, perhaps making any bug bounty program the company would create seem late to the game.\u201cApple can embrace security researchers, or try to facilitate programs that will secure its operating system, but it\u2019s never going to be able to compete with what is going on behind the scenes in the black market,\u201d said Jay Kaplan, a former N.S.A. analyst and co-founder of Synack, a company that deploys hackers to weed out vulnerabilities in clients\u2019 systems. \u201cIt\u2019s just not going to happen.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Review: Nathan Lane, You\u2019ve Got a Part (This Time) in \u2018White Rabbit Red Rabbit\u2019", "Date": "2016-07-18", "News": "Supported byFor all I know, as I write these words, Nathan Lane is lying dead on a chaise longue on the stage of the Westside Theater.Mr. Lane, I am tempted to say, could hardly be bettered. Mr. Soleimanpour\u2019s play allows for interpolations and ad-libs from the actor performing it (Mr. Lane raised his hand when he was departing from the text) and nobody but nobody has a quicker wit and a more deft ability to joust merrily with the audience than he does. When handed a mysterious vial of powder at the start, he quipped, \u201cIt\u2019s the \u201980s again!\u201dAfter a reference to audience participation \u2014 a not insignificant element \u2014 he joked that this was, for him, a blight on the world somewhere between incest and folk-dancing. And perhaps the only tedious passage of the show comes up front, when the audience is counted, or rather counts itself, one by one; thank God, I cracked to myself, aping Mr. Lane, we were not in the voluminous Gershwin Theater. (A tip for those who share Mr. Lane\u2019s aversion: Most of the people conscripted for larger roles came from the first couple of rows, or participated voluntarily.)I thought for a few minutes that Mr. Lane might hijack Mr. Soleimanpour\u2019s play entirely and treat us to a Nathan Lane show, and who would complain? But Mr. Lane is also a dedicated and serious actor, great funnyman though he is, and he honored the playwright\u2019s words dutifully (if, yes, continuing to add his own marvelous asides here and there).Reviewers have been admonished not to give away much about what transpires during these 75 minutes, so my hands are tied, to a certain degree. Maybe this is appropriate, since the play comments implicitly on the strictures that all artists \u2014 indeed, all citizens \u2014 in Iran and other authoritarian states must confront and negotiate on a daily basis.Authoritarian regimes do not allow for freedom of artistic expression, of course. So among the shivery aspects of the play is the ghostly presence of the writer \u2014 absent and present, simultaneously \u2014 and ever in danger of being silenced, whether by the oppression of the country\u2019s rulers or, more darkly, the anguish and despair that this can induce. (The program notes that by the time Mr. Soleimanpour was allowed to travel outside Iran, in 2013, \u201cWhite Rabbit,\u201d his first play, had been performed more than 200 times in 15 languages.)The play also addresses obliquely \u2014 and you soon become aware that writers living in repressive cultures must cloak their ideas in symbols \u2014 the oppression of women in some Muslim nations; the alienation that living in such cultures can engender; and the universal human tendency to obey authority, whether it\u2019s the laws under which people must live, or the text and directions an actor (or an audience member) has just been handed and told to perform.Among the things I will say is that the actor performing the play is required to portray one animal playing another (no, not a rabbit), and that the play is a conversation among playwright, performer and audience, a conversation that, for all its diverting humor, takes on a gravity that prickles your skin when we are reminded that the author might not have the freedom to even see the performance we are watching. Exhortations to send him an email (we are given the address) enhance the sense of his disconnection from the wider world.The title in fact refers to an experiment supposedly performed by the writer\u2019s uncle, in which hungry rabbits had to compete for a lone carrot. This was another metaphor, to be read in any number of ways, for the brutality and divisiveness that living under an authoritarian regime may induce, but more broadly a general comment on human behavior.I\u2019ll admit that I got a bit perplexed during the extensive discussion of the white rabbits and the red rabbits. Some other passages slide perilously close to pretentiousness, and much is shrouded in obscurity and frisky quirkiness. But Mr. Soleimanpour\u2019s elliptical play keeps taking odd, unexpected turns that often lead us back to the relief of laughter.Any worthy theatrical experience is, on some level, a dive down into a rabbit hole, where the destination is unknown, even if we know the play well. The distinction of \u201cWhite Rabbit Red Rabbit\u201d is that the performer moves right alongside us on the journey.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Republican Gun-Free Zone", "Date": "2016-03-31", "News": "Supported byLatest in the long, long line of Controversies We Weren\u2019t Really Expecting: the right to bear arms at the Republican National Convention.A petition calling on the Republicans to allow people to carry their pistols when they assemble this July collected more than 50,000 signatures rather speedily this week. The Secret Service instantly turned thumbs down. The presidential candidates, who are normally so rapturous about all things gun-related, refused to get involved.There was a time when Americans seemed O.K. with a middle-of-the-road approach to guns. The public tended to regard them as things you used for hunting or household defense, and favored laws that regulated them accordingly. But no more. The National Rifle Association is beginning to run out of places to demand that people be allowed to bring their pistols, having already thrown down the gauntlet on bars, kindergartens, airports and college campuses.The theory is that once everybody is armed 24/7, no matter what bad thing occurs, there will always be good guys on hand to shoot the evildoer. In the real world very few people \u2014 including police officers \u2014 are skilled enough to aim accurately during a scary emergency. But if you want to win the Republican presidential nomination, it\u2019s important to pretend otherwise. After the terrorist mass murders in France, Donald Trump argued that if only Parisian concertgoers had been packing heat, the outcome would have been much different.\u201cYou know what? If I\u2019m in that room and let\u2019s say we have two or five or 40 people with guns, we\u2019re going to do a lot better because there\u2019s going to be a shootout,\u201d he said.Two important points here: Even in the confines of Second Amendment aficionados, you don\u2019t normally hear the term \u201cwe\u2019re going to do a lot better because there\u2019s going to be a shootout.\u201d Plus, note the suggestion that people would be safer with an armed Donald Trump in the building.Trump does not appear to know anything much about firearms. Do you remember back in January, when he boasted that he \u201ccould stand in the middle of Fifth Avenue and shoot somebody and I wouldn\u2019t lose voters\u201d? No one took him literally, possibly because no one believed that Trump could stand in the middle of Fifth Avenue and actually hit anything. While he says he owns a gun, when asked if he ever uses it, he replied, \u201cnone of your business.\u201d Mainly, he brags that his sons are crack hunters, and you can see the proof of that if you Google Donald Trump Jr. and \u201cdead elephant tail.\u201dDo you think Hillary Clinton could beat Trump at a firing range? Clinton actually meets the basic political standard for marksmanship, which involves being in possession of one anecdote about having gone hunting and shot a bird. Hers goes back to her days in Arkansas when she was with a group of friends who didn\u2019t believe she knew how to handle a gun, then watched as she downed a duck on the first try. The dead-fowl tradition is sort of silly, but it does hark back to the good old days when people thought about shooting in terms of sport and scaring off burglars.Clinton has been talking a lot about gun regulation lately, because it\u2019s one of the very few issues on which she can attack Bernie Sanders from the left. Sanders, who appears to have no personal interest in guns whatsoever, has been historically weak when it comes to voting on things like background checks. Their debate would be much more useful if it carried on into the general election. But it won\u2019t. The sad truth is that Democrats don\u2019t believe gun control is a winning issue. And the Republicans are so completely in bed with the N.R.A., the mattress is buckling.The one candidate in this year\u2019s race who actually has some skill as a marksman is Ted Cruz. He shot two pheasants while campaigning in Iowa, which is perfectly reasonable. He also carried out the tradition that calls for ambitious right-wing politicians to put on camouflage and face paint and go hunting with someone from \u201cDuck Dynasty,\u201d which is really embarrassing.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "We\u2019re More Honest With Our Phones Than With Our Doctors", "Date": "2016-03-23", "News": "Supported byOn TechnologyIn the late 1960s, an undergraduate psychology student at Wellesley College named Martha McClintock noticed something interesting: Women who spent a majority of their time together tended to get their periods around the same time. She suspected that menstruating bodies could influence one another somehow, but it was just a hunch. So she asked 135 of her fellow students to keep track of their cycles. Three times that year, she quizzed them about their period start and which women they socialized with the most.Initially, it seemed McClintock was right: Close-knit groups of friends tended to start their periods together. The phenomenon of menstrual synchrony was nicknamed the \u201cMcClintock effect,\u201d and her work was lauded as one of the first mainstream studies to demonstrate how one person\u2019s body chemistry can trigger responses in another\u2019s. But McClintock\u2019s results have been difficult to replicate; now, the scientific consensus is that cycles probably don\u2019t sync up \u2014 a claim that rings untrue to anyone who menstruates. My friends and I joke that we even seem to sync up digitally, thanks to constant contact via iMessage, Snapchat and Twitter.The unresolved nature of McClintock\u2019s investigation, now almost 50 years old, underscores the unnerving amount of opacity that still surrounds women\u2019s health. Even today, it\u2019s difficult for women to get a sense of what\u2019s normal and what isn\u2019t. When my friends and I talk about our bodies, we compare feedback from physicians, all of which seems to be slightly different; we warn one another about conditions like uterine fibroids and share horror stories about different methods of contraception. There still seems to be a combination of prudishness and ignorance around the unique, and sometimes idiosyncratic, functions of the female body \u2014 which is shocking, considering half the world is born with one.But in recent years, mobile technology has granted me and countless others the ability to collect an unprecedented amount of information about our habits and well-being. Our phones don\u2019t just keep us in touch with the world; they\u2019re also diaries, confessional booths, repositories for our deepest secrets. Which is why researchers are leaping at the chance to work with the oceans of data we are generating, hoping that within them might be the answers to questions medicine has overlooked or ignored.The researchers found the data collected via Clue to be more detailed \u2014 and more accurate. \u201cThe data is as close to real time as we can get,\u201d McDonald said. They hope their young participants will be more comfortable telling a faceless app about personal health matters \u2014 a slump of depression, gross blood clots, irritated bowels \u2014 than telling a doctor. And it\u2019s not just teenagers; most of us are willing to be much more honest with our phones than with professionals, or even with our spouses and partners. We look up weird symptoms and humiliating questions on Google with the same ease that we search for the name of a vaguely familiar character actor. For many of us, our smartphones have become extensions of our brains \u2014 we outsource essential cognitive functions, like memory, to them, which means they soak up much more information than we realize. When we hand over this information willingly, the effect is even greater.Both scientists say that the app has opened up endless possibilities for their research, because it offers a way to rethink \u2014 and potentially overhaul \u2014 how women\u2019s health is studied. \u201cWe think we know about menarche, because we\u2019ve been looking at it for decades,\u201d Houghton said. \u201cBut there\u2019s still so much to study.\u201d Clue can collect more than just period start dates. It can also gather data on things like bleeding and pain patterns, energy levels and sexual activity, allowing researchers to put old wives\u2019 tales to the test of scientific rigor.Ida Tin, a founder of Clue, hopes that the app will eventually be able to do its own studies, publish findings and loop them back into the app. For example, Clue could recommend users who report high menstrual irregularity to talk to their physicians about polycystic-ovary syndrome, a common (but often hard to detect) disorder that can contribute to obesity, diabetes, high blood pressure and heart disease.It wasn\u2019t until a friend introduced me to period-tracking apps in my 20s that my body became something I understood intimately, that it was more familiar than foreign. Initially, I was skeptical, but the apps were password-protected, which made me feel comfortable being honest about what I was actually feeling and with whom I was actually sleeping. After a few months, the apps weren\u2019t just a repository of daily facts; they had become a legible map to my body. My period no longer caught me off guard, and I eventually learned to connect the arc of my cycle to changes in mood, appetite, fatigue and sex life, and adjust my routines accordingly. By now, I have years of data about my periods and an extremely accurate understanding of how my body works: when I\u2019m likely to experience cramps and breast pain, when to skip yoga and social outings because I\u2019ll need more sleep. All my life, my doctors tended to be vague, making my bodily functions seem ultramysterious, when in fact they are just individualized, and easily understood with the assistance of software.By divulging every last detail to these apps, we make them incredibly valuable \u2014 but also potentially ruinous, if our most sensitive records were to fall into the wrong hands. Clue repeatedly talked up its airtight security, and I currently believe the company about that, just as I once believed eBay\u2019s, Snapchat\u2019s and Evernote\u2019s claims that their services were safe. And yet each was hacked, eventually. These days, breaches are inevitable, which presents an impossible dilemma. The only conclusion I\u2019ve come to is that we have to evaluate each new relationship to hardware and software individually and assess the trade-offs. Clue has this on the \u201cpro\u201d side of the ledger: McDonald, Houghton and Tin all believe Clue will settle the debate over McClintock\u2019s research.Jenna Wortham is a staff writer for the magazine.Advertisement"}

Lofton, senior vice president for global brand marketing at Under Armour.The three new campaign spots are shot in plenty of shadow, underscoring the idea that much of the training required to be the best occurs out of the spotlight.Phelps\u2019s spot, set to \u201cThe Last Goodbye\u201d by the Kills, is intended to highlight his singular focus as he trains for what may be his last Olympics.

In the industry\u2019s lingo, the companies are engaged in a \u201cplatform war.\u201dA platform, in technology, is essentially a piece of software that other companies build on and that consumers cannot do without. Become the platform and huge profits will follow. Microsoft dominated personal computers because its Windows software became the center of the consumer software world. Google has come to dominate the Internet through its ubiquitous search bar.If true believers in A.I. are correct that this long-promised technology is ready for the mainstream, the company that controls A.I. could steer the tech industry for years to come.\u201cWhoever wins this race will dominate the next stage of the information age,\u201d said Pedro Domingos, a machine learning specialist and the author of \u201cThe Master Algorithm,\u201d a 2015 book that contends that A.I. and big-data technology will remake the world.In this fight \u2014 no doubt in its early stages \u2014 the big tech companies are engaged in tit-for-tat publicity stunts, circling the same start-ups that could provide the technology pieces they are missing and, perhaps most important, trying to hire the same brains.At the University of Toronto, IBM pursued a start-up called Ross Intelligence that makes a smart legal assistant, and extended a free offer to use its A.I. software, called Watson. For IBM, the financial payoff would come if start-ups like Ross generated sales, followed by a revenue-sharing arrangement. \u201cNo upfront costs at all,\u201d said Andrew Arruda, chief executive of the start-up, which moved last year to Silicon Valley.Now, Google\u2019s A.I. program is drawing additional attention and pointing to a consolidation among tech\u2019s biggest companies.By 2020, the market for machine learning applications will reach $40 billion, IDC, a market research firm, estimates. And 60 percent of those applications, the firm predicts, will run on the platform software of four companies \u2014 Amazon, Google, IBM and Microsoft.IBM is making the broadest entry into A.I. Its Watson unit, set up as a separate division in early 2014, is both a software and a services business, with technology tailored to specific industries. More than 80,000 developers have downloaded and tried out the software, and the Watson division has 500 industry partners, including big companies and start-ups.\u201cIt\u2019s early days, but the long-term goal is to have hundreds of millions of people use Watson as self-service A.I.,\u201d said David Kenny, general manager of the Watson division.In 2015, Amazon and Microsoft both added machine learning capabilities to their cloud software platforms, Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Azure. The companies are using machine learning software to help customers spot patterns and make predictions in vast amounts of data.Microsoft offers 18 machine learning services, including face recognition, text analysis and product recommendations. More A.I. capabilities, analysts say, should be announced at the end of the month, when Microsoft hosts a large conference for software developers in San Francisco.This week at a conference in San Francisco, Google showed off a new speech-to-text transcription service. The company also said its recently introduced vision software for identifying images would be broadly available soon, and it introduced new tools and training aids to help developers build machine-learning applications more easily.Intelligent software applications will become commonplace, said Jeff Dean, a computer scientist who oversees Google\u2019s A.I. development. \u201cAnd machine learning will touch every industry.\u201dAt Facebook, the A.I. vision is, at least for now, limited to its products.Mike Schroepfer, the chief technology officer, noted that Facebook\u2019s image-recognition software was now used to select what pictures or videos to show in a user\u2019s news feed, based on a person\u2019s friend network and interests.\u201cBefore, the photo was a black box to us,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s the most likely form this takes \u2014 a lot of things that add up to make the service steadily better on Facebook.\u201dIf products come first, a platform strategy typically takes shape later for the big consumer web companies. There are millions of Facebook app developers worldwide. Today, only about 1 percent of all software apps have A.I. features, IDC estimates. By 2018, IDC predicts, at least 50 percent of developers will include A.I. features in what they create.\u201cIt\u2019s where the market is headed,\u201d said David Schubmehl, an IDC analyst.The company, which was founded by Mike Tung, a Stanford computer science graduate student, in 2008, recently raised $10 million to compete directly with Google. Even though Diffbot is still being run out of a home near the Stanford campus, Mr. Tung is thinking big.\u201cOur goal is to capture all human knowledge,\u201d he said. \u201cI would like for Diffbot to build an iconic company around data. There are companies focusing on computing, but there is no Amazon of data.\u201dJohn Markoff reported from San Francisco and Steve Lohr from New York.Advertisement"}

Samsung argued that this \u201ctotal profit rule\u201d did not make sense in the digital era and would \u201creward design patents far beyond the value of any inventive contribution.\u201d\u201cIn other words,\u201d the company\u2019s brief said, \u201ceven if the patented features contributed 1 percent of the value of Samsung\u2019s phones, Apple gets 100 percent of Samsung\u2019s profits.\u201dDesign patents are far less common than utility patents, which cover how products work. The Supreme Court has not heard a design patent case in over a century.A Samsung spokeswoman, Danielle Meister Cohen, said in a statement that the court\u2019s review \u201ccould lead to a fair interpretation of patent law that will support creativity and reward innovation.\u201d Apple declined to comment.The three design elements at issue in the case, Samsung Electronics Co. v. Apple Inc., No. 15-777, are, in Samsung\u2019s description, \u201ca particular black rectangular round-cornered front face\u201d; \u201ca substantially similar rectangular round-cornered front face plus the surrounding rim\u201d; and \u201ca particular colorful grid of sixteen icons.\u201dIn urging the Supreme Court not to hear the case, Apple said the justices should not reward a copycat.The justices agreed to decide only one of the questions on which Samsung had sought review: \u201cWhere a design patent is applied to only a component of a product, should an award of infringer\u2019s profits be limited to those profits attributable to the component?\u201dThe court appeared to acknowledge the possibility that \u201can award of a defendant\u2019s entire profits for design patent infringement makes no sense in the modern world.\u201d But it added that \u201cthose are policy arguments that should be directed to Congress.\u201d\u201cWe are bound by what the statute says, irrespective of policy arguments that may be made against it,\u201d the court said.David Opderbeck, a law professor at Seton Hall University, said the justices had focused on an important issue.\u201cThe key question is whether damages relating to a design patent should be apportioned in relation to the value added by the patented design or can cover the infringer\u2019s entire profit on the infringing product,\u201d he said.\u201cThe Federal Circuit read the design patent law very literally and held that the entire profits can be recovered,\u201d he added. \u201cIn my opinion, this is a far too literal reading of the statute, particularly because a product\u2019s ornamental design very often is not the primary driver of consumer demand and of the manufacturer\u2019s profits. In some ways, the Federal Circuit\u2019s ruling could allow design patent law to swallow utility patent law, making the ornamental design more important than the underlying technology.\u201dAdvertisement"}

It is the first time the railroad has had to ship snow from Fairbanks to Anchorage. The shipping service was donated, according to a railroad official.\u201cMoving snow out of the way, we don\u2019t usually bring it to somewhere else,\u201d Tim Sullivan, a spokesman for the railroad, told The Associated Press. According to the National Weather Service, 27 inches of snow has fallen in the Anchorage area since July. The area normally sees about 61 inches in that time.The backup snow arrived on Thursday, the boulder-shaped material filling up several train cars that are designed to flip open and dump out their contents. It is enough snow to blanket a football field up to three inches, but it is apparently not enough to cover the 11-mile track in Anchorage, which will be used for the ceremonial start of the race on Saturday. So the ceremonial course will be eight miles shorter this year, officials said.The larger races continue, but not without concerns. In February, patches of the 1,000-mile Yukon Quest trail were free of snow, which could affect the safety of sled dogs.Alaska\u2019s tourism industry relies on the ability of people to attend a race like the Iditarod \u2014 and some mushers rely on the tens of thousands of dollars in prize money \u2014 but the consequences of warmer winters go well beyond affecting the viability of a sledding race.Advertisement"}

A news release isn\u2019t what it used to be, in other words. \u201cIf you want to be taken seriously, you have to take some legal action,\u201d Mr. Mayer said.Even if the outcome of such action is predictable: a settlement or outright dismissal. \u201cThere is a good chance this is going to get bounced,\u201d said Bert Fields, a veteran entertainment lawyer who represented Tom Cruise when the actor sued two tabloids after they claimed he had abandoned the relationship with his daughter, Suri. \u201cCharges are tough to prove.\u201dMr. Daniels, 56, had compared Mr. Penn with Terrence Howard, the flamboyant star of \u201cEmpire\u201d who was arrested in 2001 for hitting his wife at the time, Lori McCommas, and, last summer, was battling with another former wife over the terms of their divorce settlement.(In an only-in-Hollywood-kids twist, Mr. Penn, Mr. Daniels and Mr. Howard are all represented by Creative Artists Agency, surely making for some awkward conversations over the kale salad at Hinoki & the Bird.)Mr. Daniels\u2019s legal team is hoping the case will be dismissed, contending in court filings that Mr. Daniels\u2019s comments did not say Mr. Penn was \u201cguilty of ongoing, continuous violence against women,\u201d but instead stated an opinion not subject to the standards of defamation. They argue too that Mr. Daniels\u2019s statement \u201ccould not have tarnished Penn\u2019s reputation for domestic abuse any further than a quarter-century of explicit media coverage already has.\u201dJames Sammataro, the lawyer representing Mr. Daniels, said, \u201cSean is not the first person to want to rewrite the narrative of his life.\u201d (Indeed, \u201conline reputation manager\u201d is now a job description.)\u201cWhen there are so many articles and so much press,\u201d she said, \u201cthere has to be something.\u201dOr does there?But he has had his share of run-ins with the law, mostly a result of outbursts at paparazzi or others who have waved a camera near his face. In 1987, when clandestine TwitPics were just a glimmer in our collective eye, he was sentenced to 60 days in jail for, among other things, punching an extra on a movie set taking his photograph.With this statement on record, \u201canyone who repeats those lies does so at their peril,\u201d Mr. Penn\u2019s lawyer, Mr. Rosengart, said in a statement.For now, both Mr. Penn and Mr. Daniels seem unwilling to back down. Art Linson, who was a producer of the 1982 hit \u201cFast Times at Ridgemont High\u201d and who has known Mr. Penn for decades, summed up their standoff this way: \u201cThis lawsuit isn\u2019t just about Lee, but Lee is unfortunately on the receiving end because he said something reckless and untrue about Sean.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "An Indian Spice Mix, Sambhar Masala, for All Seasons", "Date": "2016-03-29", "News": "Supported byATLANTA \u2014 Like a friendly drill sergeant, Raghavan Iyer was not going to pretend that making the spice mix he was about to teach 13 Emory University cafeteria cooks how to prepare was easy.\u201cIt seems like a very simple technique, but I guarantee you some of you will screw it up,\u201d he said. \u201cBut that\u2019s O.K. Try it again. You will be happy when you create a response from an Indian student who says, \u2018This reminds me of my mother\u2019s.\u2019\u201dA masala is simply a mixture of ground spices. Each state in India has its own blend, and there are countless variations of each. The sambhar masala he was teaching the chefs at Emory is one of thousands of versions of a spice mix from southern India. It gives flavor, heat and texture to sambhar, the region\u2019s ubiquitous vegetable stew. Mr. Iyer learned it from his grandmother, and it is the taste that most reminds him of home.Through books, videos and classes, Mr. Iyer has made a career of demystifying Indian cooking for both American home cooks without Indian roots and for institutions like corporate and college cafeterias. As of late, with renewed attention on cultural awareness in institutional kitchens, teaching the proper way to prepare and serve a dish from another country is increasingly valuable.Mr. Iyer, who only learned how to cook Indian cuisine after immigrating to the United States from Mumbai nearly 35 years ago, has written several books on the subject. His first, \u201cBetty Crocker\u2019s Indian Home Cooking,\u201d was published in 2001 and remains a well-respected guide for cooks with little knowledge of Indian cooking. His latest, on potatoes, is due in the fall from Workman Publishing.\u201cThe spices are the beauty of Indian food, and through them you can learn the beauty of India,\u201d he told the cooks at Emory, explaining that a simple cumin seed can have several different flavors. Raw, it tastes one way. Roasted in oil and used whole, it tastes another. Grind the seed and then roast it, and it changes yet again. It goes on and on.That kind of subtlety is a stretch for many American cooks.\u201cThe perception is \u2018My God, when I come to spices, I freeze,\u2019\u201d Mr. Iyer said.Spice mixes like his masalas are essential for cooks trying to make culturally accurate and tasty food in what is called the captive dining segment \u2013 that is, stadiums, corporations, colleges and other places where diners don\u2019t have much of a choice.To wit, bad sushi and a pulled-pork sandwich on ciabatta bread that was called a banh mi.Mr. Iyer, who lives in Minneapolis, has done more than 75 cooking classes for Bon App\u00e9tit. The food-service company runs 650 cafes in 31 states for clients such as Google, the Art Institute of Chicago and more than 100 universities.The issue at Oberlin, he said, may have been as much about flavor as about insensitivity. What they called a banh mi may have been a decent sandwich, but it should have been called something else.\u201cIt is important to get it right, and you must like what you are serving or it shouldn\u2019t be served,\u201d he said. \u201cBut there is still some room to interpret.\u201dThe trickiest part is getting the eight spices and the yellow split peas called for in the recipe. Fresh curry leaves, still shiny green and pliable, are the biggest challenge. A trip to an Indian or international market may be necessary, although they can be ordered online.Their distinct, almost anise-like aroma makes a big difference in the mix, but one could leave them out. In fact, you could personalize the mix to your taste, as millions of Indian home cooks do.\u201cThere are as many masalas,\u201d he said, \u201cas there are Indian housewives.\u201dAn article last Wednesday about the Indian cooking instructor Raghavan Iyer misidentified the source of his recipe for sambhar, a vegetable stew. It was his grandmother, not his mother-in-law.cookingcookingAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Google Showcases Its Cloud Efforts, Determined to Catch Up to Rivals", "Date": "2016-03-23", "News": "Supported byIn the cloud computing business, Google\u2019s technology prowess is rarely questioned. Its commitment, however, has been doubted.Google, which trails Amazon and Microsoft in the fast-growing market, hopes to change the industry perception that it is halfhearted about its cloud computing service with product announcements, technology demonstrations and strategy briefings at a two-day conference in San Francisco that began on Wednesday.The company is showcasing its cloud software for machine learning, a branch of artificial intelligence. It has a new speech service: Feed in audio, and the software issues a transcript. Its recently introduced vision service for identifying images also will be more broadly available soon, Google said. And new tools and training aids are available to help developers build machine-learning applications more easily.These are the first significant steps since Diane B. Greene, a respected Silicon Valley technologist, became senior vice president in charge of Google\u2019s cloud business in November. Ms. Greene is a co-founder and former chief executive of VMware, whose software is widely used in corporate data centers. She knows the enterprise computing business, which has not been Google\u2019s strength.The new cloud offerings after Ms. Greene\u2019s appointment signal the company\u2019s intent, analysts say. \u201cGoogle finally wants to compete in the cloud for enterprise business,\u201d said Mike Gualtieri, an analyst at Forrester Research.Having technology is only one ingredient in the corporate marketplace, analysts note. Marketing, training and customer service are also important to win businesses.\u201cWe\u2019ve got to get really good at communications and training,\u201d Ms. Greene said in an interview.In the corporate cloud business, Google must address a wide range of customers and requirements, she said. For many, a purely online relationship will be fine, she said, while others want hands-on assistance.For labor-intensive projects, Google will work through partners, she said. The company has no intention of building its own consulting arm. \u201cThat\u2019s not what Google does,\u201d said Ms. Greene, who, since 2012, has been a board member of Google and then its parent company, Alphabet, which was established last year.But Google plans to step up training and certification programs, again working through industry partners to expand that effort. \u201cWe\u2019ll train the trainers,\u201d she explained.Traditionally, technology companies have hired armies of sales representatives who have sold corporations expensive software that resided in their data centers. That business still exists, but it is eroding rapidly as cloud software, with its pay-for-use model, becomes mainstream.Cloud software, Ms. Greene said, is redefining the relationship corporate customers have with technology companies. \u201cNobody has figured it out yet,\u201d she said. \u201cBut it has to span the spectrum from self-service to high touch.\u201dThe essence of Google\u2019s appeal to customers and industry partners, is that \u201cyou sign up for keeping pace with Google\u2019s technology development,\u201d Ms. Greene said.Wix, an online service for building websites, has been using Google\u2019s vision service recently. It lets users search the many thousands of images Wix has in its database. Creating an online jewelry commerce site? Search the Wix digital library of unlabeled, stock photos for \u201cpearls\u201d and \u201cdiamond rings,\u201d and Google software finds those images.\u201cIt\u2019s pretty amazing,\u201d said David Zuckerman, head of the developer experience at Wix. \u201cThe neat thing is that the users never know they are using artificial intelligence.\u201dWix runs its sizable business on the cloud, and it uses the cloud services of Google, Amazon and Microsoft. Mr. Zuckerman welcomes vigorous competition among the three, which should insure lower prices and better deal terms.Recognizing it is the underdog, Google is starting to try harder with better support and terms, Mr. Zuckerman said. \u201cI feel a closer relationship with Google, probably because it is not the king in this space,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Instagram May Change Your Feed, Personalizing It With an Algorithm", "Date": "2016-03-15", "News": "Supported byFor years, we have been trained to view web postings from our friends in a certain order. Refresh the top of your various \u201cfeeds\u201d \u2014 the running column of content on some versions of Facebook, Twitter and Instagram \u2014 and you will see the latest news at the top. The further back you scroll, the older the material gets.\u201cOn average, people miss about 70 percent of the posts in their Instagram feed,\u201d Kevin Systrom, co-founder and chief executive of Instagram, said in an interview. \u201cWhat this is about is making sure that the 30 percent you see is the best 30 percent possible.\u201dMore broadly, the change reflects the adjustments that occur time and again on the consumer Internet. In the early days of the web, users largely congregated around portals like AOL and Yahoo, before Google gained ground, beckoning people to type in queries to find exactly what they were seeking. Then, social networking ushered in the era of the feed: a simple, linear way to gather and display the content contributed by your friends and family worldwide.While feed-based networks have grown dominant over the last decade, they must be reinvented to keep audiences coming back and staying longer. That is especially true as older networks face newer competitors like Snapchat \u2014 which is almost entirely focused on the camera as the user interface \u2014 or text messaging apps like WeChat in China.\u201cThese companies want to always, always give you the next best thing to look at,\u201d said Brian Blau, a vice president at Gartner, an industry research firm. \u201cIf an algorithm can give you much more engaging content more frequently, you\u2019ll stick around longer.\u201dYet changing Instagram\u2019s feed will most likely be tricky and may arouse the ire of fans, who are accustomed to the way their photos and messages are ordered. Many web companies have faced complaints when they altered the way their feeds were presented.When Facebook moved away from a reverse chronological feed in October 2009, for instance, users revolted almost instantaneously. Facebook-hosted groups like \u201cChange Facebook back to normal!!\u201d sprang up and quickly attracted hundreds of thousands of followers. Twitter, too, faced intense criticism last month when it said it was experimenting with moving away from its reverse chronological feed.\u201cI like how I can open the app and see what my stepsister Ashley is doing today with my niece and nephew, right in that very moment,\u201d she said. \u201cI want to judge what\u2019s important, not have some algorithm tell me what it thinks is important.\u201dInstagram said that the change would not be quick or jarring, and that it would start the shift in a series of small tests with a single-digit percentage of user groups before deciding whether to introduce the changes broadly.Instagram plans to rely on its machine -learning technology and a mix of signals to determine the order of photos and videos in users\u2019 feeds, including the likelihood a person will be interested in the content, the timeliness of the posts and the relationship between the two users. As they are now, posts will be clearly stamped with the date they occurred.Mike Krieger, Instagram\u2019s co-founder and chief technology officer, said the changes to the feed may be less disruptive than those of other networks, considering Instagram is centered almost entirely on photos, not words.\u201cLook at my feed now. I follow accounts from all over the world,\u201d Mr. Krieger said, noting that 75 percent of Instagram\u2019s audience is outside the United States, and many of the users he follows post content he would otherwise miss while he\u2019s sleeping. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t really matter to me what time it is.\u201dThe shift will not affect Instagram\u2019s advertising products, which already use and rely on similar targeting principles to serve ads to users. If the changes go well, they could serve to bolster Instagram\u2019s business. The more time people spend using Instagram, the more often the company is able to serve people ads.The idea to adjust how photos and videos are presented in Instagram feeds has been discussed at the service\u2019s Menlo Park, Calif., offices for months. Mr. Systrom said he often found himself waking up in the morning and scrolling back through his feed to see all of the posts he missed while he was asleep, but guessed that he probably missed a great deal of the \u201cbest\u201d material from the 613 people he follows.Mr. Systrom said he was also mindful of how people might react to the change.\u201cIf it\u2019s one thing we do really well as a company, it\u2019s that we take big change slowly and deliberately and bring the community along with us,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not like people will wake up tomorrow and have a different Instagram.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Connecticut Rock Pile Known as Negro Heads May Get a New Name", "Date": "2016-03-04", "News": "Supported byBRANFORD, Conn. \u2014 It may be dwarfed by Denali, the 20,308-foot peak in Alaska long known as Mount McKinley. But the mussel-covered pile of rocks about a mile off shore from this briny town on the Long Island Sound is at the center of a naming debate of its own, one fueled by what many consider the ugliness of the label it carries: Negro Heads.The rock formation and the red buoy that mark it appear by that name on Google Maps and nautical charts. Now, State Senator Ted Kennedy Jr. wants a new name for the local landmark and buoy, which he has often sailed past since moving to Branford 20 years ago.\u201cIt\u2019s anachronistic,\u201d said Mr. Kennedy, a Democrat whose father was the longtime United States senator from Massachusetts. \u201cAnd I think for many people, it\u2019s offensive.\u201d\u201cIt never occurred to me that there may be a process for changing place names,\u201d Mr. Kennedy said. It turned out there was, and he initiated that process by contacting the Connecticut Geographic Names Authority.Mr. Kennedy then contacted school officials in Branford, a New Haven suburb, and together they decided to have an essay contest at the town\u2019s high school, deferring to a new generation to find a suitable replacement for Negro Heads.The move here comes as communities and institutions across the United States are reassessing their nomenclature, amid shifting attitudes about historical figures and heightened attention to issues of race and racial discord.Here in Branford, Negro Heads was once known by an even more offensive slur given to a type of thick-shelled mussel used in button making, according to 19th-century documents. (The rocks are only occasionally visible at extreme low tide.)Margaret A. Thomas, the Connecticut state geologist, said the rock formation\u2019s name had been changed to Negro Heads between the 1830s and 1880s.\u201cIt was probably done to soften the earlier name and make it more socially acceptable at the time,\u201d said Ms. Thomas, who also serves as chairwoman of the Geographic Names Authority.The process for changing the name now is arduous. \u201cNames are very important, and not only from an historical perspective,\u201d Ms. Thomas said. \u201cAll of these names become part of a national geographic names database and also part of the 911 emergency system. They must uniquely identify the geographic location.\u201dThe federal board will then send it back to Connecticut\u2019s Geographic Names Authority, which will survey Branford residents and leaders, including town officials and the local historical society, Ms. Thomas said.After that, the state naming agency will decide whether to officially recommend the new name. If it does make such a recommendation, the proposed name goes back to the federal board, which has the ultimate authority over any changes.A spokesman for the United States Coast Guard, Frank Simmons, said that a name change would not present a challenge for patrol boats near Branford Harbor, since the new name would be added to official nautical charts.Ms. Thomas said there was no guarantee that the federal board would accept a new name.\u201cJust because a name is proposed by a student and blessed by the town committee does not mean that it will be successful,\u201d she said. \u201cThe name that\u2019s selected needs to be appropriate and fulfill the federal guidelines. A good name reflects the identity of the place, which includes everything from the history to the character of the people.\u201dHamlet M. Hernandez, superintendent of the Branford public schools, said that asking students to consider new names for the rock formation was a constructive exercise because it involved historical research and the crafting of argumentative essays.\u201cIt\u2019s something that\u2019s relevant because they live in the community and many students may have passed by the rocks in small dinghies,\u201d he said. \u201cI think it\u2019s a very authentic writing assignment.\u201dNot everyone in Branford, where 94 percent of the 28,000 residents are white, favors changing the name.Mike Infantino, 65, a boat captain who owns the Sea Mist Thimble Island Cruise here, said the name Negro Heads \u2014 offensive or not \u2014 was part of the town\u2019s heritage. \u201cI\u2019m old school,\u201d he said. \u201cWhether they are trying to be politically correct, I don\u2019t think something that was put there hundreds of years ago should be changed.\u201dNichola Roberts, a 28-year-old nurse who has lived in Branford for six years, disagreed. \u201cIt\u2019s nice to be sensitive to other people\u2019s feelings, so why not?\u201d she said.Mr. Kennedy said he felt strongly that local and state residents had a right to rename the landmark. \u201cThe bottom of Long Island Sound is actually owned by the citizens of the state,\u201d he said, \u201cand I think most people would feel that this name is not appropriate.\u201dAs for whether he had any ideas of his own for a new name, Mr. Kennedy was politic. \u201cI don\u2019t want to superimpose my particular views on the town,\u201d he said. \u201cThis should be a community project and it needs to be scrupulously historic, nonpartisan and inclusive.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "25 Songs That Tell Us Where Music Is Going", "Date": "2016-03-10", "News": "By Nitsuh AbebeBy then, though, the song had become such an intense focus of discussion at the digital water cooler \u2014 to the point where it felt difficult to turn on a computer without someone\u2019s views about \u201cFormation\u201d and its various sociopolitical valences reaching out and grasping for your throat \u2014 that my not having heard it acquired some kind of political dimension. A decision had to be made. Either I needed to dutifully consume this object of conversation and develop an opinion about it or I needed to develop a defense of why I hadn\u2019t yet done so.The point being: Here, for a moment, was music that actively dragooned me into paying attention to it, based not primarily on sound, performance or composition, but on the rolling snowball of perspectives, close readings and ideological disputes accreting around it.It\u2019s songs that do this now; individual songs and mass opinion, working in tandem. This wasn\u2019t always the case. We\u2019ve spent the past century or so trying, in creaky and convulsive ways, to figure out what music is even for, and how we intend to use it. When and where will we listen to it? Will other people be there? Should people own music? Who should write it \u2014 the performers? What\u2019s a normal amount to release at once? How will we find out about it? Will there be pictures? Are you absolutely, definitely sure we have to pay money for it? For the moment, there\u2019s only one answer to these questions that seems to connect strangers in a truly monocultural way: We shall gather in huge, fawning riots around towering pop singles to trade politicized takes on them.It\u2019s not the worst thing. One of the great tricks of pop music is that no matter how much we like to imagine it\u2019s about musicians expressing themselves, it tends to be more useful as a way for listeners to figure out their own identities: Each song lets us try on a new way of being in the world. For a long while, the idea was that young people could use music to shape their style \u2014 their clothes, their haircuts, their sense of cool. Then came high-speed Internet and a touching enthusiasm for the idea of playlists: With so much of the world\u2019s music at our fingertips, we\u2019d express our intelligence and taste by playing D.J. and curator, sorting through songs to assemble our own reflections. That didn\u2019t last, either. Showing off your eclectic, handpicked treasures? This has become such a common online performance that there\u2019s no one left in the audience.So these days it\u2019s the song, and the scale of the event surrounding it. One song, one digestible thing, with millions of people standing in a circle around it, pointing and shouting and writing about it, conducting one gigantic online undergraduate seminar about it, metabolizing it on roughly the same level that cable-news debate shows metabolize a political speech. This is an ever-greater share of the public life of music. A song like \u201cFormation\u201d isn\u2019t set up as a story, or an interior monologue \u2014 it\u2019s set up as Beyonc\u00e9, the public celebrity whose biography you already know, addressing the world, like an op-ed with drums. Thus can we argue not about what the song says to us, but about what we think the rest of the world needs to be told, and whether Beyonc\u00e9 is telling it right. What do we make of her dancers\u2019 Black Panther styling? Is she \u201callowed\u201d to work with beloved artists from New Orleans or use references to the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina? How does the song sound through a feminist lens, through a queer lens, through an anticapitalist one? Can we have a conversation about her daughter\u2019s hair, and also about police violence? People talked about these things until, three days in, I\u2019d been quoted every last line of a song I still hadn\u2019t heard.How the pop star won us back with a disappearing act.By Mary H.K. ChoiThe second single from \u201cPurpose,\u201d Justin Bieber\u2019s fourth studio album, \u201cSorry\u201d is an infectious confection \u2014 a Dorito for your ears. There are two official videos for it: a dance video that stars a diverse cast of young women who seem to have been dressed by magpies let loose in a Delia\u2019s catalog; and a lyric video, which is sort of like that footage they use in karaoke bars, but slightly more polished. Between the two, there have been well over 1 billion views. At no point in either does the Canadian heartthrob appear. He simply doesn\u2019t need to.In previous years, by contrast, he was everywhere. He had transformed in the public eye from a teen-star brat to a grown-up brat, with the D.U.I. arrest to prove it. He had become a hollow hashtag of a person. When he visited the Anne Frank house, he wrote in the guest book that he sincerely hoped Frank would have been a \u201cBelieber.\u201d Not only did he come off like Joffrey Baratheon with a Hitler-youth haircut, his callow bad-boy affectation reeked of a keening need to be cool \u2014 anathema, as any teenager can tell you, to actually being cool. But the backlash to the backlash is here, and much like both videos, it has less to do with Bieber \u2014 the actual Bieber \u2014 than you\u2019d expect.Because get this: The most inspired part of Justin Bieber\u2019s reinvention is its erasure of all previously identifiable Bieberish elements. \u201cSorry\u201d is unlike anything Bieber has made in the past. It has been classified as \u201ctropical house\u201d and \u201cdancehall,\u201d but everyone seems to agree on one thing: It\u2019s a banger. The song is about a relationship Bieber has screwed up, and in the lead-in to the hook, he asks, \u201cIs it too late now to say sorry?/\u2019Cause I\u2019m missing more than just your body.\u201d But by the time the actual chorus arrives, Bieber lets the production take over: All you hear is a cooing arpeggio that feels like a gentle breeze on your brain. It\u2019s the best part of the song, and Bieber seems to appear in it only as a sample.This song is a triumph of music over narrative in the hellscape that is the pop music-industrial complex. Consider, for example, the confusing, protracted drama of Kanye West\u2019s latest album release, which involved a huge fashion show, several tweet storms and title changes all leading up to \u201cThe Life of Pablo,\u201d a record that\u2019s being finished in real time on a platform no one wants to pay for.So what is it, exactly, that we want from Bieber? Likability? Yes, Justin Bieber is a contrivance. Yes, Justin Bieber\u2019s lyrics are insipid \u2014 worse still, disingenuous. Yes, his tattoos stink. Yes, he\u2019s lousy at skateboarding. But what does any of this actually matter? In case you missed it, Bieber won. You used to hate him, and now it\u2019s pointless. So who\u2019s sorry now? \u2666Even if you can\u2019t score tickets, the cast album is its own transcendent experience.By Wesley MorrisThere\u2019s being locked out of heaven. Then there\u2019s being locked out of \u201cHamilton.\u201d And with all due respect to Bruno Mars (and God), being locked out of \u201cHamilton\u201d is crueller \u2014 as farce, but still. The musical is sold out \u2014 for, like, ever. And the resale market has achieved spit-take-level hilarity. To wit, this Craigslist ad: \u201cI bought tickets for the wrong night. These are legitimate \u2018Hamilton\u2019 tickets for Friday March 11, 8 p.m., purchased though Ticketmaster. I just want to get back what I paid for them. Great seats! $933.80 per ticket.\u201dBack on Earth, there\u2019s the cast album: a 46-number souvenir for an experience most of us won\u2019t be experiencing. At less than $20 on iTunes, however, where it has been in and out of the Top 10 for months, and Amazon, this is a more-than-adequate substitute for the budget-conscious. It\u2019s a gateway to obsession. To know someone who has this album is to know someone who needs a restraining order.This is to say that the cast recording is its own experience. In an age in which the album is notional \u2014 musical Tupperware \u2014 this one works as a complete concept and doubles as its own playlist, crammed with jams. There are King George\u2019s long-distance interludes, in which, under the mostly brown circumstances, white power sings the same, out-of-style song over and over and over. Meanwhile, the first five numbers alone \u2014 \u201cAlexander Hamilton\u201d; \u201cAaron Burr, Sir\u201d; \u201cMy Shot\u201d; \u201cThe Story of Tonight\u201d; and \u201cThe Schuyler Sisters\u201d \u2014 get halfway to a greatest-hits collection. Pilfered dabs of R.&B., show tunes, rock and rap recombine until identifying whatever you think you\u2019re hearing becomes its own sport.The rapping that Hamilton, played by Lin-Manuel Miranda, the show\u2019s creator, does at the start of the song sounds like some sweaty couplet from LL Cool J\u2019s \u201cI Need Love\u201d from 1987. The \u201cnos\u201d from the ensemble echo the \u201cwhoas\u201d and \u201cheys\u201d from Naughty by Nature\u2019s \u201cHip-Hop Hooray,\u201d from 1993. When Miranda gets to the chorus (\u201cLord, show me how to/Say no to this/I don\u2019t know how to/Say no to this/But my God, she looks so helpless/And her body\u2019s saying, \u2018hell, yes\u2019\u201d) handclaps and guitar licks gently join the percussion and bass line. And suddenly all I can hear is Champaign\u2019s 1981 love jam, \u201cHow \u2019Bout Us.\u201d Pairing those Greek-chorus \u201cnos\u201d with the ecstatic sounds of a harp as Hamilton and Mrs. Reynolds (presumably) do it generates moral tension. The bass line is where \u201cSay No to This\u201d gets both its erogenous nerve and antique heat. Your head spins as the song proceeds to combine sounds from a half-dozen old-school districts.The Karl Ove Knausgaard of grumpy independent musicians.By Sam Hockley-SmithMark Kozelek, who used to front an epically moody band called Red House Painters, is known as something of a jerk. Onstage, when not singing in a voice like crumbling granite, he says things that usually end up offending somebody: hipsters, women, journalists, the band on the next stage. But on the records he now releases as Sun Kil Moon, he examines his life with plain-spoken brutality, saving the most cutting remarks for himself.\u201cI Watched the Film the Song Remains the Same\u201d occupies more than 10 minutes of \u201cBenji,\u201d the album he released in 2014. It begins as the story of the first time Kozelek saw the Led Zeppelin concert film \u201cThe Song Remains the Same\u201d as a child; it ends as a song about nostalgia, chronic sadness and the way people drop in and out of your life. One moment Kozelek\u2019s admiring the electric piano on \u201cNo Quarter\u201d; the next, he\u2019s sharing memories of being a \u201cvery melancholic kid,\u201d or apologizing for the time he punched a classmate in school. The way he writes isn\u2019t so different from Karl Ove Knausgaard, also in his late 40s; both men spent long careers skirting the spotlight, then found new renown when they started excavating their own biographies for details.So on \u201cBenji,\u201d Kozelek sings about his relationship with his parents, about buying lampshades, about death. A second cousin\u2019s death sets him thinking about family; James Gandolfini\u2019s sets him thinking about his prostate troubles. He approaches each topic as if flipping through a disorganized photo album, and the more insular and lived-in the details, the more enthralling they seem. At the end of \u201cI Watched the Film ... ,\u201d he says he\u2019s headed to Santa Fe to visit a friend he hasn\u2019t seen in 15 years. Close Googlers can deduce that friend must be Ivo Watts-Russell, who signed Red House Painters to his 4AD label back in 1992; Kozelek, grave and grateful, says he\u2019s going to New Mexico just to say thank you. \u2666How to chart your own path in a post-label music industry.By Jenna WorthamWatch the virtual-reality film that accompanies this article by downloading NYT VR.The women in attendance seemed especially mesmerized by Sydney Bennett \u2014 better known as Syd tha Kyd \u2014 the frontwoman, whose Tiger Beat sex appeal gave her performance a depth charge. Bennett, 23, brown-skinned with a blond-tinged Mohawk, has the swayback stance of an adolescent skater and dresses like one too: On the \u201cKimmel\u201d set, she wore black vans, a black T-shirt and black jeans low on her hips. As she sang, she roamed across each quadrant of the small stage, staring deep into the throng, as if to find out whether her crush had bothered to make an appearance at the show. To create her stage presence, Bennett studied the R.&B. singer D\u2019Angelo, whose 2000 video for \u201cUntitled (How Does It Feel)\u201d features nothing but his extremely defined and extremely nude upper body dripping with sweat for four and a half minutes. It showed. Bennett flirted with the crowd, peeking at them through her heavily lashed eyes, shooting sly smiles at fans and gently lifting her chin to acknowledge those she knew \u2014 among them, her mom, Janel, and her godmother, Sheryl.The TV appearance was a rarity for the members of the Internet, who, as their name suggests, live online and work from home. Two of the band\u2019s three albums were created and recorded almost entirely at the house where Bennett lives with her parents in L.A.\u2019s Mid-City neighborhood. But their most recent record, last year\u2019s \u201cEgo Death,\u201d caught the attention of the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences, and it was nominated for a Grammy in the Best Urban Contemporary Album category. (Past nominees in the category include Frank Ocean, Rihanna and Beyonc\u00e9.) The \u201cKimmel\u201d performance was a dip into mainstream media that the Internet has largely succeeded without.The band\u2019s name itself hints at an irreversible and inevitable shift in the way music works. For decades, the music industry fancied itself an apparatus for tastemaking, but as technology has made labels\u2019 role less relevant, that has ceased to be the case. Listeners decide what\u2019s popular now, and record labels have to find a way to attach themselves to it. Aside from a few big-name acts, most artists are doomed to languish in relative obscurity with middling profits. This is usually seen as a tragedy \u2014 the death of a musical middle class \u2014 but it has also presented an opportunity for artists to avoid the suffocating effects of the label machine. And so the Internet has carved out an entirely new corner of R.&B., thanks mostly to Bennett: an androgyne who sings seductive incantations about falling in and out of love with women.After the performance, a small constellation of cousins, little sisters and girlfriends milled about, snacking on doughnuts in the greenroom and helping the band pack up. After the equipment was loaded into a caravan of modest sedans and S.U.V.s, the band stood in a circle behind the studio, and someone produced a celebratory blunt. As the smoke drifted overhead, the conversation turned to the next day.The group needed to practice for the first stop on their upcoming tour, which would start a few days later in Japan. Jameel Bruner, who plays the keyboard, wouldn\u2019t be able to come until he was done with his shift at Amoeba Music, where he works as a clerk. There was drama to discuss, too. The 17-year-old guitar player, Steve Lacy, had been photographed smoking weed, and someone had texted the picture to his mother, who was not happy. Despite the chilly El Ni\u00f1o air, the band lingered, seeming reluctant to leave and break the spell of the evening. They eventually agreed to regroup at their home base, Bennett\u2019s house, to make sandwiches, catch their performance on \u201cKimmel,\u201d smoke again and, eventually, crash.The new virtual-reality film from NYT VR takes you inside Sydney Bennett\u2019s home studio as the Internet prepares for a world tour. You\u2019ll experience the rehearsal process as Bennett teaches her band a new song, then get onstage with the band as they perform it for the first time.Turner may have been reacting to the banality of the question, but his answer also illuminated a changing dynamic for rap, which has historically been categorized by regional sounds. People Turner and Bennett\u2019s age are defined by a completely different geography, the social networks and websites they spend their time on. Odd Future was the epitome of this new statelessness: They were neither engineered by a label nor hometown heroes, but something wildly different.Odd Future dominated many conversations about pop culture and the future of music by the end of 2010. They had released all of their early work \u2014 a barrage of clever mixtapes, striking artwork and bizarro music videos \u2014 for free on Tumblr and YouTube. Their sound was prodigious. And not only was their music different but they also looked different too, a bunch of black weirdos who skated in their free time and moshed onstage.The frenzy surrounding Odd Future reached its peak in 2011: Cartoon Network gave the group their own television show; plans for an Odd Future retail shop were in the works. Labels were desperate to sign deals with the group, and Sony Music Entertainment succeeded. The crew had the upper hand and persuaded the label to give them their own imprint, and to award each member a cushy solo record deal. Bennett, the D.J., got one, too.Music came naturally to Bennett. Though her parents are 9-to-5 people \u2014 Janel is a city clerk and her father, Howard, owns a manufacturing company based in China \u2014 her uncle, Mikey Bennett, is a producer in Jamaica. (He co-wrote Shabba Ranks\u2019s 1993 hit \u201cMr. Loverman.\u201d) When she was young, the family took vacations to the island, and Bennett hung out in the studio and watched her uncle work. \u201cAt some point, I started listening to music a little differently,\u201d Bennett said. \u201cRather than being like, Yo, this is dope \u2014 who made this? it started being like, I wish I made this.\u201dWhen she was 16, her parents let her transform their guesthouse into a studio, where she worked on her own songs and recorded local musicians. In high school, she took music-technology classes and piano lessons; at night, she devoured beat-making tutorials and messed around with music software. She downloaded tracks from LimeWire (a file-sharing network like Napster) and remixed them using Pro Tools and GarageBand. She didn\u2019t need much capital to be a producer, just good Google skills and a wealth of persistence and patience.Bennett gravitated toward artists who had pioneered brand-new sounds: The sonic spaciness of Missy Elliott, the stanky soul of Erykah Badu and the acid jazz of Jamiroquai. Pharrell Williams, the original black skater weirdo, is her patron saint. And like most kids interested in music and living in Los Angeles in the mid-2000s, Bennett knew about a teenager named Tyler Okonma who called himself Tyler, the Creator. He had a sizable following on MySpace, where he released his music. \u201cHis production drew me in,\u201d she told me. \u201cIt didn\u2019t sound like what everyone was making \u2014 it was different and hot.\u201d Bennett noticed that one of the people at the top of his friend list was a kid named Matt Martin (who goes by Matt Martians). She browsed through his page, listening to the songs he posted, too. She admired his ability to create deeply complex soundscapes, and she eventually messaged him, seeking advice on ways to advance her own style.The two became friends, trading feedback on songs, which put her into Okonma\u2019s orbit. And when Okonma needed a place to record the early Odd Future mixtapes, Bennett offered up her home studio. She produced some of their early tracks and eventually became the group\u2019s D.J. In old footage of early Odd Future shows, Bennett plays songs from a laptop on a table at the back of the stage. Tomboyish, in a muscle tee and a short haircut, she crackles with the manic energy that Odd Future shows were famous for. She was generally indistinguishable from the boys in the group.From the beginning, Odd Future was meant to be a galaxy of loosely knit projects; the whole point was for the members to collaborate and spin off solo efforts. Christian Clancy, one of the group\u2019s managers, had also been a marketing executive at Interscope Records, and around 2011 he took notice of Bennett and Martin\u2019s tight friendship and encouraged them to start recording together. After all, they liked the same sounds: jazz, old-school slow jams, neo-soul. So they began experimenting, and these experiments would eventually lead to the formation of the Internet.Odd Future was a rare example of a viral sensation with lasting power; the music industry is rife with the ghosts of web talents who couldn\u2019t be repackaged as megastars. The terms of the Internet\u2019s deal with Sony \u201callowed us to shape ourselves,\u201d Bennett says. The band is artistically cocooned, trying to create, as she sees it, an entirely new style of R.&B., one that includes all types of desire. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t a conscious thing,\u201d she emphasizes. \u201cI just like women.\u201dBennett personally related to the themes that lent Okonma\u2019s music its emotional gravity: alienation, isolation, loneliness. She felt they shared a connection, one born of \u201cnot being a typical black kid or even a popular kid.\u201d But eventually the hypermasculinity and caustic sense of humor wore on Bennett, who is naturally low-key. She made tearful calls to her mother from the road, wondering aloud whether she should quit. Bennett also struggled with depression, worsened by the stress of touring and feeling disconnected from her family and her girlfriend at the time. She says that no one in the group \u2014 other than Martin \u2014 seemed to care. \u201cI couldn\u2019t talk to any of them about it,\u201d she says. \u201cWe weren\u2019t all that close, and they never seemed to want to hear it.\u201dNot long after, Bennett began training her little brother, Travis \u2014 who goes by Taco \u2014 to take her place as Odd Future\u2019s D.J. Her musical experiments with Martin had begun to congeal into the core of their first album, \u201cPurple Naked Ladies,\u201d an amorphous but promising collection of experimental jam sessions and fuzzed-out, vibey tracks. One morning while Odd Future was on tour, when the group was watching the sun crest over a beach in Australia, Bennett broke the news that she was leaving. She says it was not well received. It felt like a divorce, like a family \u2014 however dysfunctional \u2014 falling apart.\u201cThey weren\u2019t happy about it,\u201d she says. \u201cI was their get-out-of-jail-free card. It\u2019s easy to say they aren\u2019t homophobic because Syd is there.\u201dBennett\u2019s exit came at a time when gender norms were blurring. Artists now feel more emboldened to hint at sexual fluidity; it\u2019s edgy, if not outright trendy. Musicians like Wiz Khalifa and Jaden Smith have been photographed wearing skirts and dresses. Angel Haze and Shamir have said they\u2019re genderqueer. But being openly gay can still feel especially difficult in the world of hip-hop and R.&B., where artists who are suspected of being closeted can face harsher scrutiny. Lesbianism is often fetishized, made into a hypersexualized performance. While Young Thug can get away with wearing nail polish, female artists who give off an even slightly masculine air, like the rapper Dej Loaf, are hounded about their orientation.Minya Oh, the hip-hop journalist who goes by Miss Info, thinks Bennett has benefited from upheaval in the industry. \u201cI\u2019m sure that on some level of the major-label and old-establishment industry, there are execs and agents who think homosexuality is a liability,\u201d she says. On the other hand, she adds, \u201cthere are more and more handlers and mentors and facilitators who will see a new artist who is gay as either an opportunity to tap into a new market or, at worst, just a talking point.\u201d But even more important than all that, Oh says, is that artists like Bennett may not even have to pander to the mainstream anymore: \u201cAs fragmented as music audiences are these days, it would be difficult to alienate fans who are already bunched into nomad tribes.\u201dBennett\u2019s outward manner is so nonchalant and mellow it can start to seem like an affectation, but as soon as the words left my mouth, Bennett put down her forkful of pancake and slid me a sideways look, the kind you give someone when your patience is wearing thin but you still feel obligated to be polite.The Internet \u2014 the network \u2014 has a way of normalizing fringe ideas, marginalized identities and emerging artists that old media tends to ignore. It has done such a good job, you could argue, that people like Bennett \u2014 black, queer and weird \u2014 can exist without the burden of having to represent something larger. Bennett will never be something she\u2019s not. She\u2019s not looking for validation from record labels, or even really from audiences. Later that night, as thousands of Mexican teenagers rushed the stage, singing along in English and screaming her name, Bennett looked completely at home, and completely herself. \u2666A song as salve in an age of rancor.By George SaundersHow does a song work? What does it actually do? It doesn\u2019t instruct, exactly, or teach, necessarily. A song, I\u2019d say, causes the listener to assume a certain stance. Through some intersection of melody/lyrics/arrangement, it causes a shadow-being within us to get a certain expression on its face and fall into a certain posture. (Argent\u2019s \u201cHold Your Head Up,\u201d for example, would cause my 1970s teenage self to assume a, well, Thor-like posture: stoic, windswept, capable of enduring any hardship while, you know, holding my head up.)How does the song accomplish this? Was that the intention? I\u2019m not sure. Like much of Wilco\u2019s work, it\u2019s fundamentally a damned good popular song (simple chords, compelling melody), rendered symphonic by a process by which the song, seemingly rebelling against its own simplicity, seems to be seeking higher levels of emotionality via sonic complexity. This led me to assume the song had to be a result of weeks of arranging. But reportedly the band recorded it in one take, learning it from the songwriter Jeff Tweedy as the tape rolled. The song starts with a catchy eight-note guitar riff, to which it keeps returning, like a well-intentioned guy steering back to his mantra. Via inventive instrumental fills and a false ending (from which it rejuvenates with renewed purpose), it manages the strange task of seeming contemplative while escalating like crazy. It puts me in mind of a group of lifelong pals on a front porch, trying to musically solve some existential problem they can\u2019t quite articulate.The effect of all of this on the listener \u2014 this listener anyway \u2014 is transformative. Listening to \u201cOne Sunday Morning\u201d (every time) fixes me \u2014 like some sort of aural medicine. I feel a positive alteration in my body and mind: a renewed sense of humility at the sadness of the world, and a corresponding resolve to keep trying to be better; freshly reminded of the stakes of being alive, and of the fact that there are, at my disposal, more positive resources than I am currently employing. In this, \u201cOne Sunday Morning\u201d serves, for me, as a reliable 12-minute prayer. \u2666The radical act of ending an album in midsentence.By Jace ClaytonAt first, I thought my MP3 must have been corrupted. There\u2019s a springy, up-tempo beat that kicks off \u201c\u201906,\u201d the last track on Vince Staples\u2019s 2015 debut double album, \u201cSummertime \u201906,\u201d whose 20 songs are stark portrayals of a childhood caught between gangs and the police in Southern California. A lengthy instrumental stretch in \u201c\u201906\u201d gives the listener a break. When Staples appears with a fulsome \u201cGood mornin\u2019! Hope you had a good time last night\u201d and starts rapping, it\u2019s one of the most optimistic-sounding moments on the album. He\u2019s midway through the first verse (\u201cI\u2019m finna bring the gang in the buil\u2014\u201d) when the song cuts to a blast of loud static, followed by silence. The effect is so jarring that it can easily be mistaken for an error, a glitch in the stream.When I learned that this tear into white noise was intentional, I was shocked. This went beyond breaking the rules. \u201c\u201906\u201d plays an entirely different game than most music. Its words and sounds don\u2019t matter. What matters here is the rupture. The track uses white noise to depict a kind of death, yet it\u2019s also the sound of a channel being changed or a TV or radio shutting off: Someone is controlling this switch. A young man has been unexpectedly silenced. When it\u2019s over for him, it\u2019s over for the listener, too.His compressed rhymes sparkle with aphoristic detail. The opening lines of \u201cSummertime \u201906\u201d are \u201cHey, I\u2019m just a nigga until I fill my pockets/And then I\u2019m Mr. Nigga, they follow me while shoppin\u2019/I feel like Mick and Richards, they feel like Muddy Waters/So tell me what\u2019s the difference, so tell me what\u2019s the difference?/My momma was a Christian, Crip walkin\u2019 on blue-waters.\u201d The references multiply into serious depth. Yet before we have time to consider the Rolling Stones\u2019 relationship to the blues or how churches and gangs may offer similar types of belonging or anything else, Staples has raced ahead to end the verse with a punch: \u201cUber driver in the cockpit look like Jeffrey Dahmer/But he lookin\u2019 at me crazy when we pull up to the projects.\u201dThere are no radio-friendly singles here. Staples likes to call out things as they are, but he is not a stern moralist; if he were, he probably wouldn\u2019t have landed his gig as a brand ambassador for Sprite. (\u201cDifferent \u2019cause I\u2019m just like you\u201d he says in a recent national TV ad for the soft drink.) The preternaturally gifted rapper dresses in unflashy T-shirts and jeans. He\u2019s straight edge (no alcohol or drugs), a shrewd experimentalist with a complex politics.The song that precedes \u201d\u201906,\u201d \u201cLike It Is,\u201d clues us in to what the shocking signal crash might mean. Over a lurching, industrial beat, Staples explains: \u201cYou looking at a person, telling them that they story don\u2019t matter really no better than me/walkin\u2019 down the streets tryna shoot at somebody.\u201d To deny the validity of another person\u2019s story, he says, is to deny them life. And even when one can voice his or her mind freely, to be a successful black rapper is to perform your persona before a predominantly white audience, whose aggregate opinion determines your worth. This is a problem Staples continually addresses, whether discussing how one of his ambitions is to leave the rap game (and move on to more reliable ways of earning a living) during interviews, or in songs like \u201cLift Me Up\u201d: \u201cAll these white folks chanting when I asked \u2019em \u2018Where my niggas at?\u2019/Goin\u2019 crazy, got me goin\u2019 crazy, I can\u2019t get with that.\u201d Rapping about it only aggravates the paradox; those lines have been among the most quoted in reviews of his album, used to praise his self-awareness.Then comes the static.Staples knows that possibilities for mainstream black visibility are few and fraught. Black entertainers in the celebrity spotlight mark one extreme, the grainy videoclips of African-Americans dying at the hands of the police, whose name-recognition is always posthumous, another. How to speak against that? You can\u2019t. You can only unplug.\u201c\u201906\u201d adds to a growing body of work by black artists who flirt with disappearance in order to trouble the idea of representation itself. In \u201cConcerto in Black and Blue,\u201d David Hammons\u2019s 2002 piece for a series of pitch-black rooms in a large SoHo gallery, visitors were invited to explore with tiny blue flashlights. Their looking was the only thing to see. When the dancer-choreographer Storyboard P performs for video, he exploits the camera\u2019s two-dimensional limitations to create on-screen moves that appear simultaneously awkward and impossibly fluid. He dances as if he doesn\u2019t want to be captured, in gravity-defying bends and evasions \u2014 all escape, no center. The poet Claudia Rankine, in her 2004 book \u201cDon\u2019t Let Me Be Lonely,\u201d opens each section with an image of a TV showing static. \u201cThe years went by and people only died on television,\u201d she writes. \u201cIf they weren\u2019t Black, they were wearing black or were terminally ill.\u201dThe jagged conclusion of \u201c\u201906\u201d asks what it might mean to turn away from self-representation in sound. White noise is a spray of pitches and volumes that contains all audible frequencies. It is constant and patternless. Quite literally, it\u2019s the sound of undifferentiated possibility. One can think of Staples\u2019s provocative noise as the opposite of a stereotype, or freedom in sonic form. His signal fritzes into static with a snarl of hope: Noise and silence mark the edges of what can be considered music. To end an album like this points to a world beyond the song and to hands manipulating the transmission. What can be said outside the culture\u2019s limiting expectations, and who might we become if we learn to listen to it? \u2666A singular voice, aching with desperation and resolve.By Carlo Rotella Price usually drops down in pitch when she sings the second syllable of \u201cbottle,\u201d but sometimes she takes it up a bluesy interval instead, turning a honky-tonk lament into a call to arms. The two deliveries of the line play up countervailing qualities of desperation and resolve in her voice. Together they make it sound as if she\u2019s exerting considerable strength of character to keep despair and bad luck from carrying her song off the road and headlong into a telephone pole. This instantly detectable tension in her voice causes listeners to become alert, even alarmed, the moment she starts singing.\u201cHurtin\u2019 \u201c is the first single from Price\u2019s album \u201cMidwest Farmer\u2019s Daughter,\u201d which will be released by Jack White\u2019s Third Man Records on March 25. She\u2019s being rolled out with the fanfare appropriate to the next big thing out of Nashville, as the appearance on Colbert suggests, but she\u2019s not on country\u2019s standard ing\u00e9nue track. At 32, having weathered lean times and near misses, she\u2019s more of a hard-bitten classicist. Her album title evokes Loretta Lynn\u2019s \u201cCoal Miner\u2019s Daughter,\u201d and her diction, especially the way she chews on the word \u201cpain,\u201d raises echoes of Tammy Wynette; her mask of barroom bravado over tender vulnerability recalls Merle Haggard; and her band, the Price Tags, favors old-school arrangements, with Luke Schneider\u2019s pedal-steel guitar weaving prominently around her voice.As attention has built around Price, she has sometimes found herself placed in a cohort with Chris Stapleton, Sturgill Simpson and other scruffy dissenters who have recently made inroads into the dominion of the bro acts currently ruling Nashville\u2019s major labels and country radio. As the underground rocker-turned-\u201dcountry/garage\u201d producer Jonathan Bright has suggested, if current Nashville stars like Luke Bryan and Florida Georgia Line are the equivalent of M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce and other such glam-pop acts who dominated rock in the late 1980s, Price and company could be part of country\u2019s long-awaited back-to-basics riposte. Roots-music boosters are always announcing that the inevitable cyclical swing back to hard-country twang has begun, but listening to Price \u2014 or watching the growly, uncute Stapleton clean up at the Country Music Association Awards last November \u2014 you can begin to believe that maybe it\u2019s really happening.The songs on \u201cMidwest Farmer\u2019s Daughter\u201d mine the experience of further hard knocks. Her parents lost the family\u2019s corn-and-soybean farm in Buffalo Prairie, Ill., and her father went to work as a prison guard. Price endured a run of professional disappointment and personal sorrow after arriving in Nashville in 2003. With her husband, Jeremy Ivey, who plays bass in the Price Tags and writes songs with her, she tried her hand at rock and soul and made a brief, unhappy foray into writing commercial country music. Serially turned away, ripped off and let down by operators in the music industry, she grew used to selling her meager possessions to pick up and start over, waitressing, hoping for some luck. \u201cI can\u2019t count all the times I\u2019ve been had,\u201d she sings in \u201cThis Town Gets Around,\u201d her ode to the lecherous manager, fraudulent publicist and other Music Row animals who preyed upon her.Five years ago she gave birth to twin sons, one of whom died of a rare heart ailment two weeks later. She sank low after that and couldn\u2019t pull herself out of it. Drinking didn\u2019t help. \u201cIt just snowballed,\u201d she says. \u201cI felt as if I was cursed, some kind of running cosmic joke.\u201d A long weekend in the Davidson County jail after a drunken-driving incident persuaded her to get help and break the downward momentum. \u201cWeekender,\u201d a jail song on the album, is a good girl\u2019s rueful acknowledgment that the women in lockup are tougher and less fortunate than she is. \u201cThey were hard, and I was really scared,\u201d she says. \u201cThey could tell by your shoes that you were just a weekender.\u201dShe and Ivey sold their car to finance the recording of \u201cMidwest Farmer\u2019s Daughter\u201d at Sun Studio in Memphis. The album was rejected all over Nashville and eventually picked up by a label they didn\u2019t even consider approaching. Despite having a Nashville office, Third Man Records isn\u2019t widely known for producing country music (though Jack White produced a comeback album for Loretta Lynn in 2004). But Price\u2019s habit of putting vocal soul shadings into even the most straight-ahead country songs makes her an impure traditionalist, and therefore a surprisingly good fit for Third Man. Ben Swank, who runs the company with White and Ben Blackwell, says, \u201cWe\u2019re coming from a punk-rock, indie-rock background that discovered blues and American music in reverse,\u201d an aesthetic that tends to value emotional power over stylistic orthodoxy.Swank believes that Price\u2019s career travails might have fortuitously delayed her album just long enough to allow Third Man to take advantage of a new openness to \u201ca classical sound\u201d in country music. Another name for that sound is Americana: high-gloss corporate country\u2019s earthier foil and partner, which embraces not only folk traditions but also vintage commercial styles drawn magpie-fashion from bygone eras. Pointing in particular to the career of Stapleton \u2014 who went from writing pop-flavored radio fare for established stars to become a major-label juggernaut singing spare, bluesy songs in the outlaw country mold \u2014 Swank says: \u201cNow there are others who have knocked on the door. If she had come along two years earlier, maybe it\u201d \u2014 the next-big-thing buzz \u2014 \u201cwouldn\u2019t have happened.\u201dPrice\u2019s son, Judah, climbed on and off her lap as a stylist enlarged her blond hair. Friends and family were temporarily shooed away as she put on something tight and fringed. Foot traffic milled in and out of other dressing rooms along the hall, and from one came a furious burst of picking as a bluegrass band warmed up.Out on the main stage, Price sang her allotted two songs, ending with \u201cHurtin.\u2019 \u201c The band came to a full stop for her honky-tonk cadenza: \u201cThat don\u2019t touch . . . the paiiiinnnnn . . . you put . . . on . . . meeeeee,\u201d with a slow-rising two-note flourish on the final word. Robust applause followed, and then Mike Snider, the banjo player who serves as one of the Opry\u2019s chief traditionalist voices, said: \u201cGood job, Margo, you sweet little old thing. Good to have somebody come out here and sing country again.\u201d There was laughter, some knowing and some a little too hearty, in the crowd and among the house musicians onstage and the insiders thronging the wings. \u201cBy golly,\u201d Snider said, \u201cthat was stronger than new rope.\u201d \u2666The world\u2019s greatest session drummer confronts the machine age.By Jeff HimmelmanChamberlain, 48, is a session player paid by the project, a below-the-radar rock star who often shows up only in the liner notes. If you watched MTV in the \u201990s, you heard him drumming with Pearl Jam in their \u201cAlive\u201d video or with Fiona Apple or Tori Amos or the Wallflowers. He has appeared on records by everyone from Bruce Springsteen and David Bowie to Frank Ocean and Kanye West, toured with the Indigo Girls and Soundgarden, spent a season as the drummer for the \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d band. He played drums on the \u201cFrozen\u201d soundtrack for Disney. In a world of dwindling recording budgets and increased automation, he could well be the last one drumming before software takes over completely.At Blackbird Studio in Nashville, Urban told Chamberlain that he had \u201cJohn Cougar\u201d down on his acoustic guitar, but it felt too formulaic. He\u2019d been listening to the rapper Kendrick Lamar and wanted a groove that could not only propel the song but inspire an altogether new sound for it. Chamberlain assembled a drum loop \u2014 a small-scale mechanical repetition born more of hip-hop than country \u2014 and then played live drums over the loop, deepening the timbre and also providing accents and fills when the movement of the verses seemed to require it. Urban pronounced the whole package \u201csexy\u201d; in the sought-for moment of inspiration, he would put down his acoustic guitar in favor of an electric bass. Within a couple of hours, the drums-bass-and-voice opening and the entire vibe of the song were effectively complete. The catchy arrangement and on-the-nose country twang of the title and chorus eventually sent \u201cJohn Cougar\u201d to the second spot on Billboard\u2019s U.S. Country Airplay chart.This is the work of the modern session drummer, and it is why, when a major-label project needs drums, Chamberlain is often the first person producers call. When we met in Los Angeles in February, he posed his value proposition as a question: \u201cWhat can you add to a situation that\u2019s totally out of context but works?\u201d Chamberlain is good enough at playing his instruments \u2014 and at reading what producers and artists want \u2014 that they\u2019re willing to pay him well to make that kind of determination for them. And so he lives at an odd intersection, or perhaps a vanishing point; part virtuoso whose skills have never been more relevant, part John Henry figure, hammering away as music is increasingly composed and performed by machines.\u201cI do more and more work out of my studio because nobody has a budget anymore,\u201d he told me. \u201cThe Keith Urbans of the world can fly me to the studio because people still go to Walmart and buy country records.\u201d For the people who can\u2019t afford to fly him out, Chamberlain offers his services remotely from Van Nuys. He has a full recording studio set up: a control room stocked with vintage gear and a large soundproof tracking room where two drum kits sit miked and ready to go. There are drums everywhere, more than anybody should rightly own, stacked on top of each other and hanging from racks: multiple rock kits, a Brazilian pandeiro, Tibetan bells, a 40-gallon oil can rigged with a spring that Chamberlain pounded with evident joy and a built-in cupboard with 20 slots for different snares, each of which is filled. He has a vintage Ludwig Supraphonic (\u201cWhat John Bonham would have played\u201d), a 1930s Slingerland Radio King (\u201cFat and dead\u201d), a 1900s snare with a calfskin head. As he finished giving me a tour, he said: \u201cYou know sample libraries? These are the physical versions of the samples.\u201dWhen I stopped by, Chamberlain was tracking drums for a British singer named Hattie Webb. The first track had some programmed electronic drums already attached as a guide; Webb\u2019s producer had asked Chamberlain, via email, to \u201cbuild it, make it electronic-y with some acoustic elements.\u201d Chamberlain listened to the song twice, charting out its structure on a legal pad, and then he went into the tracking room, where he had a little setup that he called his \u201celectronic/analog kit\u201d \u2014 a small kick drum, a tiny snare that he had purpose-made for work like this and a cymbal with holes in it to sharpen the sound.He cued up the track and then, without any practice, played along with it, sounding so much like the programming that it was almost hard to believe it could be a live performance. And yet his playing also ebbed and flowed in ways that the programmed drums didn\u2019t, or couldn\u2019t. After that single immaculate take, Chamberlain returned to the control room, listened for about 30 seconds and said, \u201cThat sounds cool.\u201d He then set about making a drum loop to go along with the part he had just played. Within an hour or two, the track acquired shaker, tambourine and four flourish-filled runs on a full drum kit, just to give the production team some different options.Chamberlain is an elegant player; no movement is wasted. He plays with a traditional underhand grip, which is more often associated with jazz than rock. Sometimes, looking at him, you can\u2019t believe the range and sheer volume of sound he\u2019s producing. By 6:30 p.m., Chamberlain finished the second of the tracks Webb had sent to him and uploaded both to his Dropbox account to be accessed by the producers in England. Then he went home to make pasta with his wife.North Texas State (now the University of North Texas) accepted him into its music program on a scholarship, but he lasted less than a year. One of the percussion teachers threw a plastic piece of excrement at him while he was performing; another banged a gong in the middle of a piece and yelled, \u201cGo practice!\u201d It wasn\u2019t exactly the atmosphere he had imagined. \u201cI just wanted to play drums,\u201d he says. He didn\u2019t help matters by getting himself thrown out of his dorm for smoking pot. For a while he slept in his practice room with his head on the pillow in his kick drum.After he left school, Chamberlain moved to the Deep Ellum neighborhood of Dallas, about 40 miles away, where he played in several bands, often just for food or enough cash to put gas in his car. He eventually found himself living next door to Brad Houser, the bass player for Edie Brickell & New Bohemians, and after some problems with their original drummer during the recording of their first album, the band hired Chamberlain to tour with them. \u201cWhat I Am,\u201d the first single off \u201cShooting Rubberbands at the Stars,\u201d blew up so fast that his first major gig with the band outside Dallas was on \u201cSaturday Night Live.\u201d Chamberlain had just turned 21. He toured with Brickell for a couple of years and recorded a second record, \u201cGhost of a Dog,\u201d with the band, which broke up around the time Brickell married Paul Simon. (The band, without Chamberlain, has since reunited.)Chamberlain spent a summer touring with Pearl Jam, then returned to \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d as drummer for the house band \u2014 a job that for many musicians would be a career capper. TV gigs in general, and the \u201cS.N.L.\u201d gig in particular, offer the kind of steady, high-paying work that is pretty much impossible for musicians to find anywhere else. After a year, though, Chamberlain decided to move to Seattle. \u201cI had a whole house with a buddy of mine in a decent part of town, we could play music in it all day long and we each paid $250 rent,\u201d he told me, laughing. \u201cHow do you beat that?\u201dIn 1994, Chamberlain got a call from a little-known band called the Wallflowers, fronted by Bob Dylan\u2019s son Jakob. The band liked Chamberlain\u2019s drumming on \u201cGhost of a Dog\u201d and wondered if he\u2019d help them out in the studio. That work resulted in a single called \u201cOne Headlight\u201d that helped the band sell several million records. The Wallflowers\u2019 manager also represented a new and promising artist named Fiona Apple, and he asked if Chamberlain would play the drums for her too. Both albums \u201cdid really well,\u201d he told me, in characteristically understated fashion. \u201cSo that\u2019s kind of how you end up being a session musician. If you\u2019re not in a band, you\u2019re the guy who played on those records.\u201dChamberlain\u2019s network of producers and friends has continued to expand, and that\u2019s mostly how he gets his work. Over the last 15 years, he has played hundreds of sessions with some of music\u2019s biggest names, put out several side-project records and toured with Tori Amos and others whenever he could. A high-level studio musician in Los Angeles like Chamberlain can pull in as much as $2,000 for a day of work, though Chamberlain\u2019s rates fluctuate widely, depending on whom he\u2019s working with. He acknowledged that, with changes in the music business brought on by streaming and other technological innovations, \u201cthe herd is getting thinned\u201d in terms of the number of artists with sizable recording budgets. But demand for his services remains strong. In a poll to be published later this year, the readers of Modern Drummer have named him the best studio player in the business.Ryan Gruss, the Loop Loft\u2019s chief executive, showed me the sheet he had prepared for a previous session with the legendary drummer Omar Hakim, who has played for the likes of Michael Jackson, Madonna and Miles Davis. For Hakim, Gruss had typed out descriptions of beats and suggested tempos to go along with them, but there was no such list for Chamberlain. As an engineer got the kit sounding right in the control room, Chamberlain roamed over the drums and settled into a rhythm that Gruss liked. They set up a click track \u2014 a metronome that plays in Chamberlain\u2019s headphones \u2014 at the same tempo, then Chamberlain let loose for about five minutes, cycling through grooves, chorus feels, different patterns of the same basic beat.Over the next four hours, Chamberlain would roll through nine other grooves and five different setups, swapping out drums and cymbals in search of new sounds and textures. For one set of beats, he moved to the small \u201celectronic/analog kit\u201d and played it with Brazilian shakers instead of sticks. The 1900s snare with the calfskin head made an appearance and, somehow, sounded almost entirely synthetic and computerized, which Chamberlain hadn\u2019t anticipated. The Loop Loft team was happy just to sit back and watch, one of them muttering \u201cJesus\u201d under his breath whenever Chamberlain really let fly.\u201cI\u2019m a working musician,\u201d Chamberlain said to me at one point, with an emphasis on \u201cworking.\u201d Because he\u2019s not a songwriter or a member of a band, he doesn\u2019t get many residual checks or royalty payments \u2014 what musicians refer to as \u201cmailbox money.\u201d Even when times are good, he has to hustle. Sometimes he\u2019s in the studio with the Loop Loft; sometimes he\u2019s the guy Adele\u2019s producers call when she\u2019s writing in Los Angeles (for a track that didn\u2019t make her latest record); sometimes he\u2019s the guy the billionaire Paul Allen hires for a vanity rock project featuring, among other top-tier musicians, the Eagles guitarist Joe Walsh. (Sample song title: \u201cSix Strings From Hell.\u201d) Even on days off, Chamberlain goes into his studio and practices for a couple of hours.When the Loop Loft session was over, Chamberlain wandered in and out of the control room, packing up his gear for another recording stint with Keith Urban. This time the sessions would include the Welsh bassist Pino Palladino, one of the most respected players around. Instead of adding drums to a previously recorded track, Chamberlain would be playing live with Palladino in the studio. Chamberlain loves playing live above all else, for those moments when the music takes an inexplicable turn but somehow everybody stays together. No machine could match it. \u201cWith great musicians,\u201d he said, \u201cyou feel like you can\u2019t do anything wrong.\u201d \u2666A pop star claims a little time for herself.By Doreen St. F\u00e9lixMusical duets are usually ordered by heterosexual difference and its various dramas. As in: She gives, he takes. He pleads, she refuses. They may reconcile, but the performers always observe the classic sex distinction \u2014 making the circumstances of the female vocalist a good barometer for the circumstances of female speech in general.But Rihanna, pop\u2019s great maven of self-gratification, is a known loner, and she flouts that kind of reciprocal identity all the time. So it follows that even on her latest album\u2019s true duet, she would choose a vocal mirror, not a vocal foil. On \u201cConsideration,\u201d the first track on \u201cAnti,\u201d Rihanna and the genre-fluid singer SZA are two branches of the same river, braiding in and out. The women put on their respective versions of a placid attitude \u2014 Rihanna sings with cheek, SZA cheerlessly. Each is calm but, you suspect, coursing toward some possible furor. They sing into each other; their vocal registers match so closely that on first listen, you might even miss that Rihanna isn\u2019t singing by herself. The closeness approaches uncanny, suggests an erotics of the self. Rihanna\u2019s voice sinks into SZA\u2019s, which rises back into Rihanna\u2019s, the voices first crossing on these: \u201cWhy you ain\u2019t ever let me grow?/When I look outside my window/I can\u2019t get no peace of mind.\u201d If \u201dAnti\u201d has a thesis, it\u2019s this declaration of insolence.I almost used the usual expression \u2014 a \u201cdeclaration of independence.\u201d Then I remembered how secretive the two women sound, the complete disinterest the lyrics communicate. The way Rihanna likens herself to our most uncivil cultural child, Peter Pan: \u201cI came fluttering in from Neverland/Time can never stop me.\u201d I hear her indignation; I hear a clear defection from the typical girl-power conceit. \u201cConsideration\u201d could not care less about sounding like a feminist anthem in the proper way, one that telegraphs passive misandry in the service of forcing female communion. It\u2019s an anti-anthem, a song for the individual in a world full of cheap calls to solidarity \u2014 a misanthrope\u2019s chorus, built for people who would rather be alone, unseen and isolated from the work of being a girl. (\u201cWould you mind giving my reflection a break/from the pain it\u2019s feeling now?\u201d) Michael Jackson, long reviled for his identification with the boy Peter Pan, might have originated this kind of audacity, refusing to relate to society as much as society wanted to relate to him.Rihanna often returns to Barbados, the landmass that bore her. Like that island country, \u201cConsideration\u201d connects to nothing outside itself; it\u2019s a salve for those of us seeking mental and political quiet, an adult lullaby castigating the spectacle of public life. The song is haughtily against the \u201coutside\u201d; it invokes the private air of an enclosed room. I\u2019d like to stay inside, too, looking out the window, listening to the echo of my own voice. \u2666Riding a lo-fi sound to semifame.By John Wray\u201cI\u2019ll see discussions sometimes, on message boards online, about the sound I get from my guitar,\u201d Mac DeMarco said one overcast February afternoon as we drove around Far Rockaway, Queens. \u201cIt\u2019s kids, mostly, trying to figure it out: \u2018How does he get that freaky tone? What kind of pedals? What amp?\u2019\u201d He turned to me and grinned, showing the gap between his teeth. \u201cWhat they don\u2019t realize is that the guitar I\u2019ve played since I was 16 is a no-name piece of garbage that I bought at a pawnshop for about 30 bucks. It\u2019s got a loose neck, its pickup magnet is broken into tiny pieces and the pick guard is a piece of siding that I got from my Hasidic neighbor\u2019s house in Montreal.\u201d He laughed. \u201cFor a while there were bugs living in it. Actual bugs. It was cute.\u201dWe were driving along Rockaway Beach Boulevard in a borrowed car, because DeMarco\u2019s station wagon wouldn\u2019t start. At the owner\u2019s request, DeMarco was grading the CDs in the glove compartment with a pen: B+ for Morrissey, C- for Belle and Sebastian, an enthusiastic A+ for the Grateful Dead. \u201cMy life is stupid right now,\u201d he told me. \u201cI put a pair of my sneakers on eBay a while ago \u2014 partly to raise money for this girls\u2019 rock camp in Brooklyn, but mostly just as a joke \u2014 and some dude pushed the bidding up to 21 grand.\u201d He grinned again. \u201cIt turned out he didn\u2019t have the money, because he was, like, 13 years old. But that\u2019s still pretty sick.\u201dGiven the turn DeMarco\u2019s career has taken, his attitude of giddy disbelief makes perfect sense. In the course of four albums in as many years \u2014 \u201cRock and Roll Night Club,\u201d \u201c2,\u201d \u201cSalad Days\u201d and \u201cAnother One,\u201d all released by the pint-size Brooklyn label Captured Tracks \u2014 DeMarco has progressed from quasi squatter to bona fide indie-rock star, playing sold-out shows from New York to Los Angeles and basking in a degree of Internet fame that he finds hard to comprehend. In \u201cBacker,\u201d a bleakly hilarious clip, featuring none of his music whatsoever, DeMarco impersonates a depressed loser from Edmonton who guides cars into parking spots for a living. It has received around 400,000 views on YouTube. \u201cSalad Days,\u201d his 2014 breakout album, has been played more than five million times on YouTube, more than the Wu-Tang Clan album \u201cA Better Tomorrow,\u201d released the same year. DeMarco\u2019s brand of fame, however, is far from the rarefied, untouchable variety that stars like the RZA or Jack White enjoy: The more famous DeMarco gets, the more accessible he seems to become. \u201cKids think of me as a guy who\u2019d hang out with them and actually enjoy myself,\u201d he told me. \u201cAnd they\u2019re basically right.\u201dThe house he rents in Arverne, Queens, is an unprepossessing four-bedroom cottage in a lower-middle-class neighborhood, with cigarette butts peppering the lawn. When I rang his bell, he came to the door in boxers and a rumpled Hugo Boss T-shirt, greeted me with slightly bleary-eyed politeness, then led me past guitar cases and piles of laundry and a cluster of half-inflated party balloons to the kitchen, where Kiera McNally, his girlfriend of five years, was baking gluten-free banana bread. Over a cup of diner-style coffee \u2014 from an industrial steady-drip machine that DeMarco pointed out to me with pride \u2014 I asked what the repercussions of inviting hundreds of thousands of fans to his house had been.\u201cIt\u2019s cold outside now, so it isn\u2019t too bad,\u201d DeMarco said. \u201cRight after the EP came out, in August, we were averaging maybe 50 kids a day.\u201d He glanced toward McNally, who was diplomatically focusing on the banana bread. \u201cThe only thing that bugged me about it, personally, was the feeling I got that some of them hadn\u2019t even heard my music. I\u2019m basically a meme to a lot of these kids. It can get a bit weird.\u201dThe music DeMarco makes has been enthusiastically received by critics, but reviews of his albums can be frustrating to read: They tend to lean heavily on labels like \u201cslacker rock,\u201d \u201cchill wave\u201d and \u201cblue wave,\u201d to name only a few. \u201cWhat the hell does \u2018blue wave\u2019 even mean?\u201d DeMarco said. \u201cI have no idea.\u201dThe first song of his that I heard, \u201cBlue Boy,\u201d from \u201cSalad Days,\u201d is a bright, airy trifle, almost a lullaby, in which heartfelt advice to an insecure friend \u2014 \u201cNo use acting so tough/come down, sweetheart, and grow up\u201d \u2014 is subtly undercut by the ever-so-slightly camp vocals and even more so by the lead guitar, which seems to drift woozily in and out of tune. King Sunny Ade came to mind as I listened, as did Jerry Garcia, an acknowledged influence, but I found it nearly impossible to pin down the music I was hearing, or even to date it. Like many of DeMarco\u2019s best songs, \u201cBlue Boy\u201d sounds like the work of someone who spent his formative years combing through record-store bargain bins, carefully discarding anything that might conceivably be characterized as tasteful. It\u2019s an approach that has yielded dividends for musicians in the Internet age before \u2014 Washed Out comes to mind, as does Ariel Pink \u2014 but none of those artists\u2019 albums can claim five million YouTube plays.The family has musicians on both sides: a lyric soprano, a jazz saxophonist, an uncle who lives in London and sings standards. Agnes herself had a stint, as a teenager, singing at parties and weddings around Edmonton.At 16, Mac started recording songs in his room, by himself \u2014 the way he still records all his music \u2014 and playing in a band called Belgium with two friends from high school, Alec Meen and Peter Sagar. \u201cWe were trying to sound melodic and indie, like Pavement or Dinosaur Jr., even though all I knew how to play were Jeff Beck-style blues riffs,\u201d he told me. \u201cThey kept the band going after I moved to Vancouver, which was fine with me; it was pretty much their thing, anyway. I always hated the name Belgium.\u201dIn Vancouver, where he lived for a time in the boiler room of a printmaking studio for 200 Canadian dollars a month, DeMarco continued recording songs, posting them on Myspace under the name Makeout Videotape. \u201cThe first time you\u2019re out somewhere and some guy comes up to you and says: \u2018I heard that song you put up online. Pretty cool,\u2019 it\u2019s the weirdest thing,\u201d he told me, shaking his head. \u201cI got to be part of a scene that had started around this club called the Emergency Room, with bands who were already touring in the U.S. They were all these great, noisy, lo-fi bands, and I halfway fit in, mainly because I had no idea how to record. But I was trying to write Beatles songs the whole time.\u201dWhile performing at a music festival in Calgary, DeMarco reconnected with McNally, whom he knew in high school, and within the year they moved to Montreal together. \u201cWe had a hard time in Montreal,\u201d he told me. \u201cI worked the night shift at this cheap grocery store called Segal\u2019s, a 50-cents-for-a-wheel-of-brie kind of place.\u201d The job at Segal\u2019s, joyless though it was, provided a pivotal ingredient in his evolving aesthetic: a daily dose of schmaltzy classic rock. \u201cHearing that kind of music all the time \u2014 Dire Straits, Toto, Van Halen \u2014 it affected me,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can either embrace that stuff or let it drive you insane.\u201d He paused for a moment. \u201cTo tell you the truth, I\u2019m not a big Dire Straits fan, even now. But I found something in those songs that I could use.\u201dAfter a barely perceptible hesitation, he played the songs gently, sincerely and with a devotion and skill that were never entirely obscured by the grin on his face or the jokes he cracked. (\u201cA D.U.I.? I don\u2019t think so. I take a helicopter to work. I\u2019m Billy Joel!\u201d) Before his third and final song \u2014 \u201cStill Together,\u201d the closing track on \u201c2\u201d \u2014 he brought McNally out onstage to join him, beaming like a schoolboy, and kissed her lovingly but chastely on the cheek. I was reminded, watching them together, of something DeMarco told me on our drive. \u201cGrowing up in Edmonton, the horizon is so far away, you don\u2019t even realize it\u2019s there,\u201d he said. \u201cThis might all be over in six months, but there\u2019s nothing wrong with my life now. Not a thing.\u201d He nodded to himself for a moment. \u201cThe only thing I\u2019ve got to do is fix my car.\u201d \u2666Let\u2019s get it on. Or not.By Jia TolentinoCharlie Puth\u2019s brand is blandness: he\u2019s a pop star for the age of sponsored content. A fresh-faced, vanilla-flavored, Berklee-trained 24-year-old, Puth landed three singles on Top 40 radio in the year before he released his 2016 debut album, \u201cNine Track Mind.\u201d His style is marked by retro aesthetics and an almost haunting level of glibness, as encapsulated by his first single, the recent radio smash \u201cMarvin Gaye.\u201dYou may think you\u2019ve never heard \u201cMarvin Gaye,\u201d but it\u2019s possible you just haven\u2019t listened to it. It\u2019s a song that tends to register via alternate senses, a clamminess on the nape of your neck or a cloying taste, like children\u2019s cough syrup, in the back of your mouth. The platinum-selling doo-wop duet features the artist Meghan Trainor (who, like Puth, has thus far used her considerable songwriting talent to create songs so depthless they feel like waxworks).It\u2019s a song about sex that induces not lust but a feeling of desolation. \u201cLet\u2019s Marvin Gaye and get it on,\u201d sing Puth and Trainor brightly. \u201cYou got that healing that I want. Just like they say it in the song: until the dawn, let\u2019s Marvin Gaye and get it on.\u201dThe chorus feels like a bouncy castle inflated with hot air and ghosts, but in a technical sense, it\u2019s perfect. Its phrasing follows the classic AABA doo-wop format, and its four-chord progression (I, vi, IV, V) is emblematic of the genre: These are the ice-cream chords of \u201cHeart and Soul,\u201d \u201cBlue Moon\u201d and \u201cPlease Mr. Postman.\u201d Tweaked, the same progression can take on depth and winsomeness \u2014 with a 7th thrown in, you get \u201cUnchained Melody\u201d and with a 9th, \u201cEvery Breath You Take.\u201d But with the exception of a verse that has Trainor singing over a beat Puth describes (inaccurately) as a \u201chard-ass distorted 808\u201d drum machine, the track replicates the late \u201950s with unimaginative servility. Sonically, it lives a decade and a half before the song it\u2019s referencing; Marvin Gaye released \u201cLet\u2019s Get It On\u201d in 1973.In 1965, Gaye recalled to his biographer, he was listening to one of his songs playing on the radio when it was interrupted by a news bulletin about the riots in Watts. \u201cWith the world exploding around me, how am I supposed to keep singing love songs?\u201d No such scruples trouble Puth, who wrote his track as a \u201cmusical icebreaker,\u201d he told Billboard. \u201cIf you hear it on the radio or at a bar, it\u2019s a way to say: \u2018Hey! Let\u2019s Marvin Gaye and get it on.\u2019\u201d And so \u201cMarvin Gaye\u201d got its new use and meaning as a pickup line, dreamed up by an artist whose means is glibness and end is comfort, who can\u2019t imagine the fight that Gaye\u2019s love was built on, who sings about sex as if it\u2019s his due rather than a port of call in a storm. \u2666Who gets to say how black people see themselves?By Marlon James \u201cButterfly\u201d arrived at an unprecedented moment in pop. Black artists, as they conquered the mainstream, were getting even blacker. Kanye might have gotten there first (at least he probably thinks so) with \u201cNew Slaves\u201d and \u201cBlack Skinhead,\u201d and now even Beyonc\u00e9 is place-checking New Orleans and image-checking the Black Panthers. But Kanye was still speaking to the white gaze, the hatred and desire in it, and taking revenge by getting all black-sex-machine on somebody\u2019s white wife. \u201cButterfly\u201d is instead Toni Morrison circa \u201cSula\u201d: not looking outside for either validation or opposition. Black love, black empowerment, black history and black wisdom are explored so deeply and intelligently that you assume that conservative media fetish, black-on-black crime, will never show up. But then, in the third verse of \u201cThe Blacker the Berry,\u201d when Kendrick is waxing lyrical on Trayvon Martin\u2019s death, it does. All of a sudden \u201cBlacker\u201d becomes a song about black accountability while black men are being murdered and the implausible logic of slamming two ideas into the same thought. I was right there with him until that third verse.You can\u2019t be a hip-hop head and not be hit by \u201cThe Blacker the Berry.\u201d It brings the boom-bap from the get-go, dropping funk on the one, like an update of the drum break that opens NWA\u2019s album \u201cStraight Outta Compton.\u201d And even though I was tired of people\u2019s mapping anger onto blackness, Lamar\u2019s detonation of rage and wit was (and is) unmatched in hip-hop. He grabs at stereotypes as if they\u2019re slipping out of his fingers (\u201cMy hair is nappy,\u201d he says. \u201cMy nose is round and wide\u201d) and throws them right back at whoever would deploy them. He\u2019s not even rapping so much as spitting fire, jumping on a line, retracing it, firing it back at you, like the boxer Jack Johnson when he said: \u201cI\u2019m black, they never let me forget it. I\u2019m black, all right, I\u2019ll never let them forget it.\u201d Kendrick fuels his \u201cI\u2019m black\u201d with the knowledge that ain\u2019t a damn thing changed. He leaves it to the Jamaican DJ Assassin to bring backup in the chorus, drawing the line from plantation to street corner and the switch in who controls black self-determination, from the \u201cwhips left scars \u2019pon me back\u201d to the \u201cthe big whip parked \u2019pon the block.\u201dThe last couplet on the second verse echoes the first, with a crucial change: \u201cYou sabotage my community, makin\u2019 a killin\u2019/you made me a killer,\u201d turns into, \u201cHow can I tell you I\u2019m making a killin\u2019?/You made me a killer\u201d \u2014 and the different spin on \u201ckilling\u201d weighs a ton. In the first instance, exploitation and indifference make him a killer. In the second, his success comes from America\u2019s obsession with his assuming he looks like one. It was almost unbearable to anticipate what this prophet of rage was going to drop next.And then he dropped it.I could feel the verse pulling away from me as soon as he got halfway into it. It turned into call-and-response, me and this third verse, which went a little something like this:\u201cIt\u2019s funny how Zulu and Xhosa might go to war. ...Remind me of these Compton Crip gangs that live next door.\u201dMe: Hold up, K-dot, what is this you\u2019re dropping? No, dude, those are two nations going to war. And fine, war is hell, but if Britain and France aren\u2019t called thugs for Waterloo, if Lancaster and York aren\u2019t called bangers despite literally being family killing family, then why do Zulu vs. Xhosa get compared to gang warfare? Because it weakened them both in the face of the real enemy? Either all war is hell, or all war is thuggery. I\u2019m fine with either, but not with a special distinction when Africans do it.Kendrick continues:\u201cSo don\u2019t matter how much I say I like to preach with the PanthersOr tell Georgia State \u2018Marcus Garvey got all the answers\u2019Or try to celebrate February like it\u2019s my B-DayOr eat watermelon, chicken and Kool-Aid on weekdaysOr jump high enough to get Michael Jordan endorsementsOr watch BET cause urban support is importantSo why did I weep when Trayvon Martin was in the streetWhen gangbanging make me kill a nigga blacker than me?Hypocrite!\u201dMe: No, brother, no! Here was a black man invoking the detestable slogan of black-on-black crime to prevent himself from mourning the unjustifiable homicide of a black boy by a Neighborhood Watch vigilante. All I could think was: Where the hell was Kendrick going?\u201cWhat happened to [Michael Brown] should\u2019ve never happened,\u201d he said. \u201cNever. But when we don\u2019t have respect for ourselves, how do we expect them to respect us? It starts from within. Don\u2019t start with just a rally, don\u2019t start from looting. It starts from within.\u201dKendrick wasn\u2019t the first, and he won\u2019t be the last, to make the statement that black deaths are in some way blacks\u2019 fault and that black lives might be a matter of personal responsibility, right down to clothing choice. The idea that a sudden dose of self-respect is part of what is needed to stop the police from killing us is not only ludicrous \u2014 Amadou Diallo wasn\u2019t a gangbanger, but he was shot at 41 times anyway; I think we can assume that the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. had it all right within, but that didn\u2019t protect him from being brutalized by all sorts of authority, nor did his dressing impeccably prevent him from arrest \u2014 it is also old. It\u2019s a belief that the black person has a role to play in the erasure of hate toward herself. That kind of thinking almost suggests that racism makes sense.But racism makes no sense. It is perverse and aberrant yet such a constituent part of the American make up, so normalized in all its forms, that it\u2019s no surprise that the black person would scramble for answers as to why it exists. And in scrambling for answers, you look everywhere, even within: Did I do something to bring this on? Was a part of this outcome in even the slightest way my fault?Fact is, black people have always believed in respectability politics. It\u2019s also at the core of the non-American black\u2019s perspective on race, and I should know, because as a non-American black, I\u2019ve traded in that belief for years. It\u2019s particularly acute with us Jamaicans. Our stories are everywhere: How despite racism, or rather the black American\u2019s self-destructive perception of it, we worked hard to excel and gain respect. We achieved. Everybody knows how hard we Jamaicans work. That\u2019s why I have that job and you, black American, do not. Maybe you should stop whining about your troubles and own up to your laziness. Maybe if you do what I did, you would be manager of that Chase branch on the corner, just like me.Bootstrappism is the chocolate echo of white racism. You can find it in black self-help and how-I-became-a-millionaire books. Prince with \u201cAmerica,\u201d Ice Cube with \u201cLook Who\u2019s Burning.\u201d Lauryn Hill berating black girls who get hair weaves to look like Europeans. Nearly every time Steve Harvey addresses black people. President Barack Obama telling Morehouse College students at their 2013 commencement that there\u2019s \u201cno time for excuses,\u201d a lesson that the fact of their existence proved they didn\u2019t need. It\u2019s a road that leads to the granddaddy of the bootstrap, Bill Cosby, who declared in a 2004 speech that black kids were being shot because they were going around stealing Coca-Cola and poundcake.But Kendrick\u2019s conclusion is far more sophisticated than anything Cosby has ever said. In fact, it\u2019s not a conclusion at all. It was Kendrick doing what he does better than anybody else: complicating a discussion at exactly the point where everybody, including me, tries to simplify it. And this is what he was aiming for all along, questioning what even many black people would never dare question, arguing that yes, every argument, even this one, has two sides. More sides. Adding layers we might need but don\u2019t want. And that\u2019s what he did next, not on wax, but on MTV.\u201cKnow who I am first,\u201d he said. And then he said more than that:\u201cWhen I say, \u2018Gangbanging made me kill a nigga blacker than me,\u2019 this is my life that I\u2019m talking about. I\u2019m not saying you; you might not even be from the streets. I\u2019m not speaking to the community, I\u2019m not speaking of the community,\u201d he continued. \u201cI am the community.\u201dFast-forward to near the end of 2015, and I\u2019m on a flight to New York. Thirty thousand feet above everything, I put on \u201cButterfly,\u201d and something that never happened before happens. This incredible clarity, as if I\u2019d been listening to the soul brother all year but only now was finally hearing him. And then I got to that song, No. 13, the sticking point, the one reason I hadn\u2019t been able to join the best-of-the-year showering of praise, and I realized something that felt sudden yet inevitable. That this song, with its booming beat, the loudest on the record, that seemed to herald it as some global political statement, was in fact Kendrick\u2019s most deeply personal. Almost implosive. That the moment wasn\u2019t about we at all, it just sounded that way. It\u2019s his most \u201cI\u201d moment, reflecting a reality that I couldn\u2019t possibly connect to, only witness and try to understand. It\u2019s as personal as Ice Cube\u2019s \u201cDead Homiez.\u201d He\u2019s not speaking to the community or for the community. He\u2019s speaking for himself or, rather, a version of himself. The smarter me looked in the mirror and asked: \u201cWell, who\u2019s the one playing representational politics here? Who is the one expecting the black man to be Everyman, black man to reflect the universal good will, or at the very least a carefully curated black rage directed at a carefully identified target?\u201dHip-hop has always been about spinning clever fictions, doing what great narratives do: inventing stories that tell the real truth. But post-Biggie and Tupac, it\u2019s so easy to fall hard for hip-hop\u2019s insistence on keeping it real that I\u2019m surprised how easily I still fall for it, thinking that \u201cButterfly\u201d is either confessional or reportage, when it\u2019s neither. We do this over and over, judging artists of color based on a warped idea that legitimacy can come only from experience. You would think I would know better, given that as a novelist, I deal with the same assumption in nearly every interview. One journalist even congratulated me for escaping the ghetto through \u201cthe power of the pen and not the gun.\u201dMy last novel was about Jamaican gang members manipulated by politicians into an attempt on Bob Marley\u2019s life. Young men, murderers before 15, murdered before 18. Nearly everybody assumed that I had experienced some of this. In fact, the first time I heard a live gunshot was watching Martin McDonagh\u2019s play \u201cA Behanding in Spokane.\u201d And once each interviewer was convinced that there was no blood on my hands, then came the skepticism, the disbelief, the doubting: By what authority was I telling these stories? As if knowledge, talent and imagination weren\u2019t enough for a writer of color to make art; as if a work of art can\u2019t be personal and fictitious at the same time, invented and meaningful.And here I was doing the same thing to Kendrick. He was just a man wondering how someone gets to be part of the Black Lives Matter conversation when black lives don\u2019t matter to him. How someone can feel rage at murder while being fine with suicide. He was exploring these themes as concepts \u2014 you know, that thing that artists do. He was posing tricky, difficult questions, for which there were no answers, getting into the middle of his song, feeling it, breathing it, but still inventing. I wonder how much of what I thought my problem was with \u201cThe Blacker the Berry\u201d stemmed from me doing what is still being done to me: Questioning the black gaze, assuming that it must have sprung from something other than the storyteller\u2019s gift. That it must be autobiography or documentary. I\u2019ve never listened to Radiohead\u2019s \u201cA Wolf at the Door\u201d and wondered if Thom Yorke ever paid ransom money for his kidnapped children. Or thought Johnny Cash ever murdered anybody or knew anyone who did. Just like those songs, \u201cThe Blacker the Berry\u201d is several things at once, but mostly, at its essence, it\u2019s just that thing we call art. \u2666Rap and politics, inseparable as ever.By Bijan StephenRap is rooted as much in place and time as it is in rhythm and bass; it\u2019s hyperlocal and organic, if not always cage-free. (Free Max B!) You can tell a song\u2019s provenance from its sound; you can hear what was happening when the record was pressed. A cultural ferment, frozen in amber.Killer Mike & El-P, a.k.a. Run the Jewels, continue to push boundaries with their latest music video. Watch it in virtual reality. Download our NYT VR app.Earlier on the album, on \u201cClose Your Eyes,\u201d Killer Mike, El-P and Zack de la Rocha \u2014 former frontman of Rage Against the Machine \u2014 rap about a prison riot. Listening makes the blood rush to your cheeks, your heartbeat pulse behind your eyes. The value of the album is held between those two songs: It captures the variegated sides of black life in America and its specific feeling, a dizzying mix of frustrated helplessness and joyous survival.Perhaps it\u2019s not surprising that the group\u2019s aesthetic choices are very Public Enemy, which is to say, pretty \u201cretro.\u201d Public Enemy was among the first acts to grasp that for all its durability as an art form, rap is inescapably tied to the black experience. It\u2019s always political, because to live as a black person in America is to be politicized. Run the Jewels gets this. If you listen closely, through their artful grandstanding, you can hear a radical politics. Which is another way of saying the truth; listen, and hear the world change. \u2666A sound like the music on a holistic-medicine website \u2014 but cool.By Max ReadIt used to be, if you wanted to vibrate at the same frequency as the Mayan spacemen, you needed to move to a Southwestern city that specialized in horse art. It used to be, if you wanted your aura photographed, you had to go to a cramped Chinatown crystal shop. These days, there\u2019s a boutique around the corner from my apartment in Brooklyn with a pop-up aura-photography tepee. On a whim, I went to have my aura\u2019s picture taken, only to learn the photographer was fully booked days in advance. New Age is back, and turning up where you wouldn\u2019t have expected it a few years ago \u2014 in places where the young and culturally sophisticated congregate. Places that are, for lack of a better word, hip.It used to be, if you bought an album from a small Vancouver electronic-music label, you could expect some kind of weird minimal techno. These days? You get CFCF\u2019s \u201cThe Colours of Life,\u201d a 40-minute instrumental suite that layers airy synths, noodling guitars, marimbas and, God help us, panpipes over simple, propulsive rhythms. You could talk about it in terms of record-nerd touchstones \u2014 \u201cThe Colours of Life\u201d sounds a bit like the minimalist composer Steve Reich in places, or the Krautrock god Manuel G\u00f6ttsching in others \u2014 but really, it sounds as if it should be advertised on basic cable with stock footage of candles. Or like a cassette tape you would buy from a bookstore with an entire section devoted to \u201cAngels.\u201d Or like seduction music played by a barefoot European man with a soul patch. Do you catch my drift? It\u2019s cool, but it sounds as if it were recorded using a dreamcatcher as a pop filter. It sounds like the music for a 40-minute director\u2019s cut of an airline commercial. It sounds like a poster of a wolf. It sounds like a hologram sticker of a dolphin. It sounds like a tattoo of an open eye. It sounds like the font Papyrus. It\u2019s also really, really good.The assumption always seems to be that the New Age revival is weird, if not insincere in some unspecified, \u201cironic\u201d way. Why would urban-dwelling gentrified-Brooklyn types embrace the atavistic philosophies of conspiracy theorists and mononymous zither players? One answer is that this is how cool works: Things that used to be uncool become cool, and vice versa.But I think maybe it\u2019s the wrong question in the first place. We live in an age of aggressive positivism, a world overtaken by metrics and markets. To accuse New Age revivalism of insincerity \u2014 reducing the possibilities of belief to a binary \u2014 is to miss the point. The gentle woo-woo spirituality of New Age is attractive because it refuses the grinding realities of life spent in the shadow of Wall Street and Hollywood and Silicon Valley. Why wouldn\u2019t people overwhelmed by a slick and well-capitalized culture machine seek their pleasure in something defiantly corny? You can lie, and you can cook the books, but you can\u2019t fake a vibe. If a 40-minute New Age symphony can make you feel good \u2014 instead of harried or judged or pandered to \u2014 why should you care that it sounds like the soundtrack to a 1980s nature documentary? \u2666Is Coldplay bland? The future won\u2019t care.By Jeremy GordonA band that signs up to play the Super Bowl halftime show is making a declaration of immense confidence in its ability to hold a spotlight. It would seem contradictory for that band to then immediately cede that spotlight, but that\u2019s just what Coldplay did. They were contracted as the headliners at this year\u2019s game, but they wisely let Beyonc\u00e9 and Bruno Mars \u2014 both infinitely more charismatic \u2014 take control. As those two stars hit the stage, ready to trade hits and dance moves, the band\u2019s singer, Chris Martin, clung to the background, as if worried he might burst into flames if everyone appeared in the same frame.Coldplay\u2019s deference masks a steady success: For nearly two decades, they\u2019ve written a great many memorable songs, combining earnest Hallmark sentiments with anthemic melodies, worming their way into impressionable hearts and onto the charts. They\u2019re successors to U2, another band that crystallized the ineffable grandeur of the human experience into countless four-minute, radio-ready rock songs. Millions of Super Bowl viewers knew what it meant when Martin sat down at his piano, preparing to bang out the opening chords to \u201cClocks.\u201d As the rapper Future put it in a widely circulated tweet: \u201c#Coldplay legendary forever.\u201dThis brand of wide-screen pop attracts easy put-downs: edgeless, corny, white. But music has never lacked anodyne cornballs who didn\u2019t get their props until years later. Phil Collins used to symbolize the worst of slick \u201980s excess, but over time he has been recognized for his pop craftsmanship and technical innovations (especially the big drum sounds \u2014 you know, that fill in the middle of \u201cIn the Air Tonight\u201d \u2014 that blew a million rappers\u2019 minds). Jokes about how mawkish he seemed in the \u201980s are increasingly irrelevant to young people, who can care only so much about what anything seemed like before they were born.This is likely to be Coldplay\u2019s trajectory, too. Like Phil Collins, Michael McDonald, Abba or any number of desperately unhip artists, their \u201cimage\u201d will evaporate, while their songs will weather the years. In 2009, the Brooklyn band Grizzly Bear conscripted McDonald to sing a version of one of their singles, \u201cWhile You Wait for the Others,\u201d at the peak of their own rarified cool. Chris Martin might be asked to fill a similar role for tomorrow\u2019s Grizzly Bear. Imagine it: Sincerity will once again be on its way out of music, only for a familiar and tender voice to ring throughout the future blogosphere. Because when it\u2019s no longer certain what\u2019s cool, what will be more comforting than an elder statesman who never worried about it to begin with?A few weeks before the Super Bowl, Coldplay and Beyonc\u00e9 released a music video for \u201cHymn for the Weekend,\u201d a collaboration from the band\u2019s most recent and potentially final album. High-profile pop songs like this are conceived as nothing less than events, ready to be performed at mega-happenings like the Super Bowl halftime show. The actual Super Bowl halftime show featured both Coldplay and Beyonc\u00e9 but not the song. Martin said \u201cHymn\u201d was too new and wouldn\u2019t have been \u201cquite right.\u201dWhat his audience wanted was the warmth of familiarity. They wanted \u201cClocks.\u201d The live performance would have been an event, but Martin knows there will be plenty of opportunities in the future. The band is built to endure. \u2666Jeremy Gordon is deputy news editor for Pitchfork.Yes, darling, but is it feminist?By Jamie Lauren KeilesAs good-and-evil Christian morality falls out of fashion among the women in my social universe, a new binary has arisen to organize our outlook. In the heavens, there is all that is feminist: Beyonc\u00e9 singles, the selfie, menstruation ads on the subway and the dream of a woman in the White House. In hell, there is everything else. There are no nonbelievers, and there is no limbo. As new things come into being, we sort them accordingly by asking ourselves, \u201cIs this feminist?\u201dBy June 2015, Fetty Wap\u2019s \u201cTrap Queen\u201d had already claimed its place as the hot song of the summer. Beyond just the pleasures of a classic party anthem \u2014 an infectious hook, synth chords to ramp up your heart rate \u2014 the song offers an American love story for the ages. Fetty is a drug dealer weak-kneed for the girl who can match his hustle. When he cooks crack, she cooks crack with him. When he dreams of Lamborghinis, he dreams in matching pairs. Fetty\u2019s queen doesn\u2019t ride in the passenger seat. The couple make money together, and they spend it together too \u2014 at strip clubs, on weed, on gifts for each other. It\u2019s a vision of a love we can believe in, even outside the dreamland bubble of a rom-com plot. What could be more romantic than two equals teaming up to build their fantasy in a difficult and unjust world?For a summer, \u201cTrap Queen\u201d was everywhere. It would ultimately spend 25 weeks in Billboard\u2019s Top 3. We sang about cooking crack with our babies in the aisles of Duane Reade and on the dance floors of bat mitzvahs. Like Fetty himself, we landed seasonal crushes with \u201cHey, what\u2019s up? Hello!\u201d as our deceptively simple opening line. Rattling trap snares drowned out the sound of ice-cream-truck jingles, and summertime was better for it. But eventually it came time to ask the inevitable: Is \u201cTrap Queen\u201d feminist?I wonder about the purpose of this exercise. Why, in order for \u201cTrap Queen\u201d to be good, must we find a way to wedge it inside the narrow boundaries of white women\u2019s feminism? Is it not good enough on its own? Feminism and \u201cTrap Queen\u201d both spent the last year exploding ever further into the mainstream, and in both cases, we\u2019re still struggling to nail down exactly what they mean. Is the gutted, feel-good pop feminism of that Bustle post the same one that moves a panel of black women to declare Fetty Wap a feminist? Or perhaps the more important question is this: If \u201cTrap Queen\u201d is declared feminist in one system, does it suddenly belong to all feminists, regardless of race, of class or of circumstance?In the year that conversations about identity finally entered the small-talk realm of white folks, we seem to have lost sight of the fact that not everything is created for us \u2014 not even all feminist things. Identity politics is not always about identifying. \u201cTrap Queen\u201d is an immaculate song \u2014 a compelling love story and a true club banger. Perhaps, in the future, we can find a way to say so without needing to claim it for ourselves. \u2666A magnificently cheesy ballad that we\u2019ll never stop listening to.By Jody RosenLionel Richie\u2019s \u201cHello\u201d begins discreetly, almost sneakily, floating a sour little synthesizer melody over tiptoeing piano chords. The song crept into the collective consciousness in similarly stealthy fashion. It arrived in late 1983, buried on Richie\u2019s \u201cCan\u2019t Slow Down,\u201d the second solo album by the former Commodores singer. Reviewers took little notice of \u201dHello\u201d; Richie was ambivalent, cutting the song from \u201cCan\u2019t Slow Down\u201d at one point during the recording sessions before reinstating it. But when \u201cHello\u201d was released as a single in February 1984, it shot to No.1 on Billboard\u2019s Hot 100 and topped charts across the globe.In the decades since, \u201cHello\u201d has never said goodbye. It\u2019s one of those adult-contemporary ballads that has taken up residency in the ether, seeping from the walls of dentists\u2019 offices and tinkling on the phone line while you await a customer-service representative. It\u2019s a song, in other words, that has been judged soothing and innocuous enough to serve as Muzak \u2014 not necessarily an insult, but definitely a misapprehension of the fearsome beast that \u201cHello\u201d is. The song\u2019s narrator is a lovelorn weirdo who is both hapless \u2014 \u201cTell me how to win your heart/For I haven\u2019t got a clue/But let me start by saying/\u2018I love you\u2019\u201d \u2014 and vaguely sinister. The refrain, \u201cHello? Is it me you\u2019re looking for?\u201d sounds benign, but in the video, a dazed-looking Richie stalks the halls of an art school, mooning over a blind sculptor at least 15 years his junior.The revival of \u201dHello\u201d is a curiosity \u2014 a piece of pop flotsam borne back into the mainstream by the Internet\u2019s swirling surf. But it\u2019s also a testament to the magnetism of Lionel Richie, 66, a more durable presence, and a finer musician, than many have cared to admit. The meme-ing of \u201dHello\u201d has coincided with a wider Richie resurgence. \u201cTuskegee\u201d (2012), Richie\u2019s 10th studio album, was a surprise hit that paired the singer with country stars in new renditions of \u201dEasy,\u201d \u201cSay You, Say Me\u201d and other chestnuts. Richie has spent several years barnstorming arenas, quietly re-emerging as a top-grossing touring act. Last June, he played the Glastonbury music festival in England, drawing raves and a crowd of nearly 200,000, the festival\u2019s largest.Back in the \u201980s, I had mixed feelings about Richie: affection for his inescapable hits and regard for his craftsmanship, tinged with disdain I had absorbed from rock critics. He had been the Commodores\u2019 resident softy, the maudlin voice of \u201cThree Times a Lady,\u201d almost too genteel for the band\u2019s tame brand of funk-soul. Critics offered respect, but scorn leaked through: \u201cunctuous,\u201d \u201cmilquetoast,\u201d \u201cwhite-bread.\u201d The bottom line: Richie was talented, but too slight and sappy to be taken seriously.Today he stands as the biggest \u201980s pop star who is not quite canonized. He has sold tens of millions of records worldwide, most of them in the \u201980s, when he strode lofty heights alongside Michael Jackson, Madonna and Prince. But Richie couldn\u2019t match the charisma of those dynamos, and unlike all of them, he has gotten nowhere near the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. The industry celebrates his hit-making: There was an all-star Richie tribute at last month\u2019s Grammys. Still, the highest sort of esteem is denied him.A reappraisal may be in order. What hits me hardest is the robust beauty of Richie\u2019s voice \u2014 a smooth baritone roughened by hints of grit \u2014 and the casual virtuosity with which he puts it to use. Listen to the 1981 Diana Ross duet \u201cEndless Love,\u201d in which Richie enfolds his partner\u2019s rather colorless singing in plush, precise harmony vocals, airlifting the song to its rightful place: the honeymoon suite of a very posh hotel. That mix of understated and overwrought is pure Richie. He deploys one of pop\u2019s subtlest skill sets in the service of ferociously corny songs.The miracle is that Richie makes such sentiments stick. Credit his melodic gift and his knack for arrangements that wash over listeners in cresting, tumbling waves. \u201cHello\u201d is typical, with stately verses that open into a wind-whipped chorus. When the song rears up into its final refrain (\u201c\u2019Cause I wonder where you are ... \u201c), the effect is that of a unicorn rising on its hind legs, mane flashing, to meet the purple dawn.In short, Richie is a great singer-songwriter and a world-historical cheeseball. A century-plus of pop history has not erased the squeamishness we feel when faced with ballads like Richie\u2019s. Today\u2019s music critics have largely abandoned old snobberies, embracing commercial pop in all its gaudy splendor. Yet songs like \u201cHello\u201d remain for many a bridge too far, a musical pleasure we still take with a side helping of guilt.But pop culture has evolved a nifty system, allowing us to luxuriate in music we pretend to hold at arm\u2019s length. The campy karaoke performance, the TV comedy sketch, the \u201cRickroll\u201d \u2014 these bring songs back to us under the cover of irony. It\u2019s canon-making, 2016 style: We mock-venerate old records as kitsch and, lo and behold, they get inscribed in the Celestial Songbook.Richie knows how this game is played \u2014 how to laugh at himself, politely, and all the way to the bank. Last fall, he appeared on \u201cThe Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon,\u201d or rather, his disembodied head did: Richie played the role of the Lionel Richie bust, duetting with Fallon in a \u201cHello\u201d spoof. When Richie performs, though, the irony melts away.That\u2019s what happened at Glastonbury, where a crowd of mostly white rock fans greeted Richie in high tongue-in-cheek mode, waving banners with slogans lifted from memes. But when the opening strains of \u201dHello\u201d sounded, the throng erupted, joining Richie in a singalong as joyously cathartic as any you will hear. Suddenly, \u201cHello\u201d wasn\u2019t a tacky \u201980s artifact \u2014 the song was a communal hearth fire, casting a rosy glow over 200,000 souls. It was an example of pop\u2019s mysterious sorcery, the way that certain alchemical blends of music and words strike us right in the gut, circumnavigating our high-minded aesthetic ideals and studied postures. It was a reminder that some of the most powerful songs are the most gauche, scrambling together beauty and vulgarity, exquisite craftsmanship and appalling taste, exalted chivalric love-oaths and the queasy come-ons of a dork with a mullet. As for that Clay Head From the Lionel Richie \u201cHello\u201d Video: It works equally well as a platter for your cream-cheese dip and a bust on pop\u2019s Mount Rushmore. \u2666The master producer opens up his workshop.Photographs by JRA \u2018classical\u2019 musician with legions of unclassical admirers \u2014 including Kanye West.By Mark LevineA few years ago, Shaw, then 30, shocked the classical-music world by becoming the youngest-ever winner of a Pulitzer Prize in music. Shaw won for a piece she wrote for the cultish vocal group Roomful of Teeth, which specializes in otherworldly sounds that hardly suggest the word \u201cclassical,\u201d and which she is a member of. In swift fashion, Shaw emerged as the face of a flourishing scene of young composers \u2014 people like Nico Muhly, Gabriel Kahane and Missy Mazzoli \u2014 who were blurring the lines between classical and indie music. For the previous month or two, raw video footage from a fund-raiser held by the Democratic National Committee in San Francisco, and attended by President Obama, had been circulating online, showing Shaw singing a long, hypnotic, wordless introduction to Kanye West\u2019s performance of his song \u201cPower.\u201dIn Iowa, Shaw came onstage and sat cross-legged on her chair among the string players. Small and pixieish, she could easily have passed for a college student. She prefaced her work \u201cBy & By,\u201d a setting of three gospel songs, by saying that she was hoping to restore some authenticity to commercialized old-time music, and then began singing in an unadorned, incantatory alto shaded with both sorrow and fervor. Her slow, ribbonlike phrases, hovering just this side of harmonic resolution, might have risen from the Middle Ages as much as from the middle of Appalachia. The players plucked their instruments with picks, banjo-style, and occasionally broke into odd, agitated strumming or sawed away at their strings with the wooden part of the bow. Shaw and JACK could seem to be drifting into different songs, Shaw\u2019s vocals lost in plaintiveness while the quartet fought through bouts of improvisatory chaos. But the strewn-out pieces of sound kept finding their way back to one another. For all the hints of disruptiveness in the music, this was crowd-pleasing stuff, and the young members of the audience responded with shouts.Not long after the concert, Shaw and I struck up a phone and email correspondence. She grew up in Greenville, N.C., where her mother, a violin teacher, started her on the instrument at 2. \u201cI was a straight-up suburban Suzuki kid,\u201d she told me, reared on a strict diet of classical music. \u201cI lived under a rock for many years.\u201d She went to Rice University to study violin, then moved on to Yale for a master\u2019s in performance. While there, she sang in church choirs for $15 an hour to help pay the bills and got a job as an accompanist for dance classes, work that required her to improvise music on demand for a variety of rhythms, tempos and styles of movement. \u201cIf you\u2019re a good accompanist,\u201d she says, \u201cno one notices you. It\u2019s a way of making music to serve something that\u2019s larger than you, but something that\u2019s very human and simple, which is dance.\u201dAfter Yale, she moved to New York and gravitated toward the edges of the classical-music scene. She played a lot of thorny contemporary music, which often left her yearning for the full-bodied pleasures of traditional harmony, and which set her to wondering what she might have done differently had she written the score herself. She had also developed into a specialist in Baroque violin and sang early music in the choir of Trinity Church in Lower Manhattan. In 2009, she heard about an a cappella group that was being put together to explore vocal practices rarely found in standard classical music. \u201cIt was a gig, yes, but what a crazy adventure to learn things like throat singing and yodeling,\u201d she says.That summer, the group, Roomful of Teeth, met for the first time in a three-week residency at Mass MoCA, the contemporary art museum in North Adams, Mass. The eight young members settled in to study with a master throat singer from Tuva, a region of southern Siberia. The group\u2019s director, Brad Wells, invited them to write music for their first performance. Shaw worked late into the night after each day\u2019s rehearsal, \u201ctrying out these chords,\u201d as she puts it, \u201cand moving things around. I had it in my mind that I wanted to hear a mass of people talking, saying things that didn\u2019t have any particular content. Then I wanted to hear the talk break down into a guttural sound, \u2018vocal fry,\u2019 with no words, just vowels \u2014 the kind of thing kids do, just play with sound. And then I wanted to hear that strange sound turn into a big, beautiful chord, sung by all eight of us, a split second later.\u201dAfter 10 days, Shaw had a draft of a piece, \u201cPassacaglia,\u201d to take to rehearsal. It gave the group a chance to practice some of the effects they had been working on, like the lawnmowerish textures of throat singing and the sudden transition between head and chest voice that characterizes yodeling. There was a spoken text \u2014 from \u201cWall Drawing 305,\u201d by Sol LeWitt, on display at Mass MoCA \u2014 which, torn from context, came across as surreal and vaguely menacing. The work\u2019s opening harmonies, though, were straight from classical tradition. The audience at the first concert cheered and applauded when the swarming, crackling sounds of the vocal meltdown in \u201cPassacaglia\u201d resolved, suddenly and triumphantly, by returning to the piece\u2019s opening D-major chord.The following two summers, Roomful of Teeth returned to Mass MoCA, and Shaw wrote three more pieces, which she put together as a four-movement work called \u201cPartita for Eight Voices.\u201d The range of vocalizations expanded to include whispers, sighs, grunts, gasps, murmurs, whoops, heavy breathing. For a work written by a relative novice, \u201cPartita\u201d bristled with assurance. On a lark, Shaw wrote a check for $50 and submitted \u201cPartita\u201d to the Pulitzer committee, thinking it a useful way to get the high-profile judges to listen to Roomful of Teeth. She was walking along the Hudson on a spring afternoon when a friend called to tell her she had won the prize. Nine months later, Roomful of Teeth, which had mounted a Kickstarter campaign to help finance its first recording, which included \u201cPartita,\u201d won a Grammy. The group now has bookings for close to 75 performances this year.Last May, Kanye West heard Roomful of Teeth perform \u201cPartita for Eight Voices\u201d at Walt Disney Concert Hall in Los Angeles and came backstage afterward to meet the group. \u201cHe just seemed like someone who is honestly curious and interested in finding something new,\u201d Shaw recalls. \u201cWe exchanged phone numbers and started talking.\u201d West asked Shaw to produce a new version of his song \u201cSay You Will,\u201d a track from his 2008 album \u201c808s & Heartbreak.\u201d \u201cThere was no assignment given,\u201d Shaw says. \u201cI just did what I wanted to, and he really liked it.\u201d West released the remix on SoundCloud and added Shaw to the legion of collaborators on his new project, \u201cThe Life of Pablo,\u201d bringing her to Los Angeles for three weeks of studio work. She ended up co-writing, co-producing or contributing vocals to several songs.\u201cI\u2019m not really allowed to talk about it,\u201d Shaw told me. But she went on: \u201cThe work was really fun. It was like being given an amazing coloring book and being told to use all your crayons, use your paint and scissors, anything at all.\u201d At first, Shaw had little familiarity with West\u2019s music. She recognized an affinity, though. \u201cEverything is tightly, tightly controlled, held back, held onto. And then the moment comes and it just breaks out, everything explodes.\u201d Shaw paused seriously for a moment, then laughed. \u201cI kinda love that.\u201d \u2666\u2018Mr. Worldwide\u2019 speaks in pan-Caribbean code.By Julianne Escobedo ShepherdThere\u2019s a reason Pitbull christened himself \u201cMr. Worldwide\u201d: The bombastic party rapper is a global phenomenon. He also tends to be served a global helping of ire. In February, he closed out the Grammy Awards with his reggaeton single \u201cEl Taxi,\u201d in a slot normally reserved for rock music (and, occasionally, rock-rap hybrids); by the song\u2019s end, several Twitter users, including the \u201cBroad City\u201d comedy writer Chris Kelly, had likened the performance to the Zika virus.Jamaica and Cuba have enjoyed a friendly relationship since the early 1970s, when the former lobbied the Organization of American States in support of the latter. More important, though, there\u2019s Miami, the spiritual home of the \u201cEl Taxi\u201d sensibilities \u2014 where Caribbean immigrants have for decades melded and commingled culture and influence, with itinerant communities cross-pollinating and building off one another. Chaka Demus certainly approved of \u201cEl Taxi\u201d building on his original, \u201cthe biggest dancehall song of all time,\u201d as he told The Jamaica Star. (Besides, he said, \u201cI have lost track of the amount of persons who have copied the song already.\u201d)Diasporas live and thrive in these sonic interchanges, which work almost like a code among the communities that create them \u2014 a point of conversation among very different peoples whom the mainstream holds equally at arm\u2019s length. Pitbull described himself, in a 2015 Billboard interview, as \u201cthe epitome of the American dream, the underdog, the fighter, the forever hungry, forever appreciative.\u201d Some may be reasonably allergic to the strobe-light pulse of his Miami party zone. But every beat clearly illustrates the way immigrants have learned to flip that disdain to their advantage. \u2666The return of perfectly imperfect soul.By Amanda PetrusichThe R.&B. singer D\u2019Angelo once took a 14-year retreat from his public. After a tour for the 2000 platinum-selling \u201cVoodoo\u201d \u2014 during which grown women were reportedly shrieking, nightly, for D\u2019Angelo to reveal his carved abdomen, then so acutely defined that it seemed unreal, phantasmagoric \u2014 he split, using booze, drugs and solitude to numb his disappointment with a business that seemed to have everything backward. \u201cI\u2019m going to go in the woods, drink some hooch, grow a beard and get fat,\u201d is how he put it to his friend and collaborator Questlove.The decade-plus of pop music that D\u2019Angelo sat out was driven, in large part, by neurotic precision. Some of this is surely attributable to the Swedish superproducer Max Martin, who favors a punchy, airless, symmetrical approach to rhythm. You hit the beat and hit it squarely. Martin\u2019s aesthetic is ubiquitous \u2014 he has worked with Taylor Swift, Katy Perry, Adele, Maroon 5 and dozens of others \u2014 and doesn\u2019t allow for much creative meandering. In the Martin era, so much pop music has been violent in its fastidiousness: no stumbling, no retreat, no lackadaisical exhalations.It\u2019s not that \u201cReally Love\u201d is muddy or inexact \u2014 although by Martin\u2019s yardstick, it probably is \u2014 but that it\u2019s gentle, unstressed, forgiving of itself. This is not so unusual in R.&B. and soul, formative genres for D\u2019Angelo, but it has become anomalous within pop. While a listener might find it easier, at first, to holler along with a more fastidious singer like Taylor Swift (It is extraordinarily satisfying! Shouting each fixed syllable! Participating in the one! And only! Way! The song! Allows for!), D\u2019Angelo\u2019s vocal performance encourages something softer and less preordained. Even the few seconds of gritty crackle included at the end \u2014 a turntable\u2019s needle jerking into a run-out groove \u2014 suggest a way to quiet the mind, let the edges blur a little, like when you accidentally fall asleep in a poolside chaise, drink still in hand. It is hard, now, not to read D\u2019Angelo\u2019s departure as a reiteration of a creative ethos, writ larger; slowness, here, is not ignoble or archaic. It feels, instead, like a subversive act: a revolution of patience. \u2666From a jailed star, a soundtrack for Jamaica\u2019s cynical politics.By Miriam MarkowitzThat is, the party\u2019s political opposition, the Jamaica Labour Party, was too weak to have committed the crime. Riffing on another line from \u201cWeh Dem Feel Like,\u201d Vaz exhorted his listeners to \u201cload up the guns,\u201d before a D.J. played a few bars of the song. In newspapers for days afterward, politicians and private citizens denounced Vaz for his carelessness: On the eve of an election, a time when Jamaica\u2019s fragile political peace has historically been rived by violence, Vaz had channeled the menace of Vybz Kartel.Jailed on suspicion of murder in 2011 and convicted in 2014, Kartel is Jamaica\u2019s pre-eminent entertainer and a quandary for the political class, which has long defined itself in opposition to the nation\u2019s popular music \u2014 first reggae and now dancehall, its rude, raucous up-tempo successor. Jamaican artists like Buju Banton, Bounty Killer and Beenie Man popularized dancehall abroad in the \u201990s, and later crossover stars like Sean Paul and Shaggy scored stateside hits with \u201cGimme the Light\u201d and \u201cBoombastic.\u201d But dancehall\u2019s influence is even more profound, having grown from an indigenous genre into the ghost in the pop-music machine. It seeded the evolution of rap, drum and bass and electronic dance music, and has infiltrated American pop from Justin Bieber to Beyonc\u00e9. \u201cWork,\u201d the newest single from the Barbadian superstar Rihanna, is effectively dancehall, as was her first hit, \u201cPon de Replay\u201d in 2005.Here in Jamaica \u2014 where dancehall is the soundtrack to life, blasting every day and late into the night from car stereos and jury-rigged home speakers, in rum bars and barbershops \u2014 Kartel remains the genre\u2019s reigning monarch, despite having spent the last five years in prison. Born Adidja Palmer, Kartel built his reputation with graphic songs about guns, sex and unapologetic social transgressions, like bleaching his skin. His empire has extended beyond music to products, including a line of cake soap and \u201cdaggering\u201d condoms, named after a dance move in which a couple simulates rough sex on the dance floor. In 2014, he was convicted of murdering an associate, Clyde (Lizard) Williams, who disappeared in 2011 and whose body was never recovered. Kartel, who maintains his innocence, has continued to dominate the airwaves and awards circuit and somehow seems to be recording music in prison; a new album, \u201cViking (Vybz Is King),\u201d appeared last year.As the two political parties fought to form the next government, Vaz was not the only politician to take his cues from Kartel and dancehall. In November, Andrew Holness, the Jamaica Labour Party leader, toured Montego Bay wearing Clarks, Jamaica\u2019s most fashionable footwear, whose prices doubled on the island in 2010 after Kartel penned an ode to the British brand. Holness tweeted a picture of himself dusting off a brown shoe in Kartel\u2019s preferred style, the \u201cdesert boot,\u201d and Twitter went wild. \u201cA weh yuh get dah new Clarks deh daadi?\u201d Holness wrote, echoing the question posed to Kartel by Popcaan, another dancehall superstar and Kartel\u2019s now-estranged prot\u00e9g\u00e9.The People\u2019s National Party, meanwhile, has its own house D.J., Foota Hype. In January, Lisa Hanna, the party\u2019s minister for youth and culture and a former Miss Jamaica, posted lyrics on Instagram from \u201cSchool,\u201d one of Kartel\u2019s newer songs, in which he implores students to study hard and to refrain from bleaching their skin. Hanna might have been returning a compliment paid to her by Kartel, who late last year released a song, \u201cBoss Lady,\u201d that praised Hanna and also Portia Simpson Miller, then the prime minister.In their appeals to dancehall fandom, these politicians hoped to inspire an electorate exhausted by empty promises. Since 1989, when the previously socialist-leaning People\u2019s National Party embraced economic neoliberalism, the ideological gap between the two parties has collapsed. Jamaica\u2019s debt-to-G.D.P. ratio has reached 125 percent, making it one of the world\u2019s premier debtor states; I.M.F.-imposed austerity measures have yielded high unemployment rates and a declining standard of living. For young people \u2014 almost half of whom would, according to a recent poll, relinquish their Jamaican citizenship to live abroad \u2014 party politics is increasingly dispiriting. Dancehall is the perfect accompaniment to their mood: a jaded and bacchanalian lament for the Jamaican future as envisioned by its young.In \u201cWeh Dem Feel Like,\u201d Kartel asks about his enemies, \u201cDem skin too tough fi bleed?\u201d \u2014 a fitting question, too, regarding Jamaica\u2019s frequently violent politics. All told, before the voting, at least four people were shot to death at campaign events, and dozens more were injured in a stampede. When the votes were tallied last month, the nation got what it expected: a virtual tie between two nearly identical parties, with the Jamaica Labour Party eking out a slim majority. Vaz, Holness and Hanna won their seats handily. It was considered, by Jamaican standards, a peaceful election. \u2666110 million views and counting.By Jayson GreeneWhere on earth is the monoculture in 2016? It\u2019s clearly not dead. There is a song out right now: It\u2019s called \u201cStressed Out,\u201d and it is by a group called Twenty One Pilots. I discovered it recently, while poking around online during an office lunch break. As I watched the video play in its tiny YouTube window, I was dismayed to discover something. This song, by this group, of whose existence I had not been even dimly aware, had been viewed 110 million times.Bowled over, I consulted the Billboard charts and saw that \u201cStressed Out\u201d by Twenty One Pilots was the No. 3 song in the nation. (And seriously: Twenty One Pilots? Was this name invented by a spambot? Was their Twitter icon an egg?) A sense of the uncanny crept in: What else didn\u2019t I know about? Where was I, in relation to everyone else? Digging around more, I learned that the duo used to loiter outside a Chick-fil-A in their hometown, Columbus, Ohio, hawking tickets to their shows. Now, just a few years later, they\u2019re scheduled to play 75 arenas and counting in 2016. Their success has a certain \u201cAlex from Target\u201d feel to it, in which incomprehensible unseen forces conspire to lift an arbitrary phenomenon up into the national spotlight.In pop culture, \u201cincomprehensible unseen forces\u201d can reliably be shortened to just \u201cteenagers.\u201d And sure enough, dipping into Tumblr and Vine and Twitter \u2014 alone, again, on my office lunch break \u2014 reveals the band has a deep and devoted learner\u2019s-permit fan base. The appeal of \u201cStressed Out\u201d for teenagers is easy enough to grasp: It sounds like a cheery telegram from turn-of-the-century MTV \u2014 a kind of singsong rap that transforms, in the chorus, into emo pop. The backbeat instantly recalls Eminem\u2019s \u201cMy Name Is,\u201d and the verses take you back to Crazy Town\u2019s \u201cButterfly.\u201d Sometimes Tyler Joseph, their singer, picks up a ukulele, in the manner of so many YouTube stars. The whole thing is like a microhistory of the last 20 years of suburban white people.Music can take you to unexpected places.By Jazmine HughesI\u2019ve held onto that idea \u2014 a song as a route \u2014 ever since. The trick to music, though, is that it doesn\u2019t really take you anywhere; you take yourself. The song is just the ticket, the map, the conduit. You arrive at the destination entirely on your own.That sound brings me directly to my grandmother\u2019s church in Roanoke, Va., where I received my first blessing as a human baby (I don\u2019t remember), learned my first proper hymn (I don\u2019t remember) and, as a toddler, stood up on the pew and interrupted the service in which my Mema received special accolades from the pastor (I don\u2019t remember, but I wish I did). Hearing an organ is my own vibrant Sunday morning: slicing the thick air with a paper fan, tightening my stomach muscles to quiet any rumbling until lunch, trying not to sweat out my freshly pressed hair, searching for a lesson within the sermon that I could believe in. The song made me 2 again, then 5, then 12 and then (and now) 24, in the room but ever-so-slightly out of place, seeing love and trying to feel it. \u201cSunday Candy\u201d took me down South, took me back, put me back into my grandmother\u2019s lap for four generous, holy minutes. Church, still, is a strange sort of refuge: I never want to go, but I\u2019m always glad I went. I really go only whenever I visit my grandma.\u201cSunday Candy\u201d ends the way my grandma\u2019s church service always began: with the choir. The superb, slowed-down version Chance performed on \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d in late 2015 is as close to a hip-hop gospel song as I\u2019ve ever heard, due mostly to the outsize presence of that choir with its call-and-response approach to repetition. Chance ends the performance with a breathless, ecclesiastical freestyle not unlike the climax of a sermon, marrying the spiritual transcendence of a Sunday service with his artistic one.In buttoned-up Bulgaria, a viral sensation who plows through every taboo.By Mac McClellandBorn in Bulgaria\u2019s only women\u2019s prison (his mother was arrested for selling imported clothes before the fall of Communism), Azis was, he says, marked since birth \u201cto be different.\u201d He was gay in a culture that rejects homosexuality and Roma in a country \u2014 one of several \u2014 that continues to persecute the group. \u201cBeing gay and being Roma are highly discriminated against in Bulgaria,\u201d Azis continued. \u201cThey\u2019re both words that people here hate. For me, I\u2019m carrying the burden of the two.\u201dNonetheless, Azis\u2019s mother was determined to make her son a star, and after she got out of prison, she dragged him to endless auditions. But \u201cnobody wanted a Gypsy kid,\u201d Azis went on. \u201cThey just didn\u2019t want a Gypsy in their choir, a Gypsy standing in front, on TV, anywhere; it was beyond imagination to have somebody like me there.\u201d Eventually, this string of humiliations \u201ccrushed\u201d his mother. They moved to West Germany when Azis was 8. He returned to Bulgaria a few years later, after the wall came down; his mother\u2019s dream became his own the night he sang in a restaurant with live accompaniment. \u201cI felt really intoxicated by performing,\u201d he recalled. In his early 20s, he signed with a music agency in Sofia and a year later won best artist at a Bulgarian music festival. Within two years, he sold out the country\u2019s biggest stadium, where, with Communism more than a decade gone, he took the stage wearing high-heeled red leather boots that went up to his crotch.Now 38, Azis has dropped what he calls his \u201cdiva\u201d look. This is partly because he\u2019s \u201ctired and too old for everything\u201d \u2014 it takes him three hours to get into drag \u2014 but also because he no longer feels the need to make statements. \u201cNowadays, you can see boys in tight jeans holding hands on the street. And there is a street in Sofia where you can have sex with a transsexual.\u201d He laughed, a full throaty chuckle like a glamorous Disney villain. \u201cI\u2019ve done what I could to change people\u2019s perceptions,\u201d he later added. \u201cI showed that you can be Gypsy and you can be intelligent, you could be gay and you can be cool. That\u2019s it. I cannot do the very same thing for 20 years.\u201d\u201cHabibi\u201d may take its name from an Arabic endearment, but he insists he\u2019s not trying to imply that, in Bulgaria, Arabs may suffer a fate similar to the Roma. (A recent Amnesty International report noted that migrants live in terror of \u201cxenophobic hate crimes\u201d and admonished Bulgaria to address this climate of fear.) Rather, he explains, it\u2019s that Arab barbershops are trendy in Bulgaria. He has seen young people talking about them on Facebook.One day, the diva look will be back, he promises. In the meantime, he\u2019s considering recording a song entirely in English for American audiences, for whom he does have a message, however apolitical. \u201cI want them to know about Bulgaria,\u201d he said. \u201cI want to tell them that it\u2019s a small but very beautiful country, the nature here is amazing, the people are very friendly, especially in the countryside, and we have the most delicious feta cheese.\u201d \u2666On composing music, and your death, while dying.By Will HermesThere\u2019s a tradition of \u201cdeath poems\u201d in some Asian countries, and as a generation of outspoken musicians shuffles off our coil, the farewell album has become a Western equivalent. John Coltrane\u2019s \u201cExpression\u201d might be considered a forerunner. Warren Zevon made \u201cThe Wind\u201d after a diagnosis of inoperable cancer. On the last of Johnny Cash\u2019s \u201cAmerican Recordings\u201d series released during his lifetime, he performed Trent Reznor\u2019s \u201cHurt\u201d as a sort of deathbed confessional, then closed with \u201cWe\u2019ll Meet Again,\u201d a World War II-era send-off that was the smirking existential finale of \u201cDr. Strangelove.\u201dOther late works tilt toward consecrating summary, like Bach\u2019s \u201cMass in B Minor\u201d \u2014 or the new album by Loretta Lynn, still hale at 83, which reprises pointed favorites like \u201cEverybody Wants to Go to Heaven\u201d (\u201cbut nobody wants to die\u201d). Lou Reed\u2019s parting shot was extreme, even for him: a harsh art-metal collaboration with Metallica that reimagines Frank Wedekind\u2019s violently sexual \u201cLulu\u201d plays. But Reed was always a button-pusher. \u201cThe greatest disappointment/Age withered him and changed him,\u201d he snarled on \u201cJunior Dad,\u201d a song as mercilessly cleareyed as Reed\u2019s signature \u201cHeroin.\u201d Bowie is said to have called \u201cLulu\u201d his friend\u2019s \u201cgreatest work,\u201d a judgment colored, perhaps, by his own exit-music plans.In an era when our deaths are generally scripted by a profit-driven medical establishment, these conscious farewells are inspiring. Death is one of life\u2019s main events: Shouldn\u2019t it be our own composition? Reed died at home, surrounded by friends and family, with a posthumous, invite-only tribute at the Apollo Theater. There was no public funeral service for Bowie, only a final photo left on Instagram taken shortly before he died \u2014 the former and eternal Ziggy Stardust looking dapper in a designer suit, rakish hat and no socks, grinning widely, ready for his next act. \u2666Digital Design: Rodrigo de Benito Sanz and Linsey Fields.A picture caption on March 13 with an article about Sydney Bennett, leader of the band the Internet, misspelled the surname of the band\u2019s bassist. He is Patrick Paige II, not Page.An article on March 13 about the rapper Kendrick Lamar and his song \u2018\u2018The Blacker the Berry\u2019\u2019 paraphrased incorrectly the lyrics of a song by Lauryn Hill. She criticized black women who wear hair weaves that look European; she did not say that they got the weaves from Koreans.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "You Married Them Once, but What About Twice?", "Date": "2016-03-03", "News": "Supported byField NotesAfter 22 years, the divorce didn\u2019t work out for Sagan Lewis and Tom Fontana.They tried to maintain a severed union. And for more than two decades, they were successful. Ms. Lewis, a former actress, lived in the verdant tangle of Hawaii and then Arizona; he moved to the cobblestones of the West Village.She had a child on her own; he wrote and produced some of the most hard-edge, violent shows on television. They saw each other on occasion and still loved each other, but were not, emphatically, a couple.And yet, something kept bringing them together again. Finally, as if orchestrated by a Hollywood show-runner, in July, the woman who found comfort in the red rocks of Sedona and the man who lives in a 10,000-square-foot building in Manhattan, remarried.\u201cI realized I loved Sagan more than having all this space to myself,\u201d said Mr. Fontana, 64, the Emmy- and Peabody-award winning writer, producer and creator of TV shows including \u201cHomicide,\u201d \u201cOz\u201d and \u201cBorgia.\u201d \u201cBy this point in our lives, all that crud \u2014 career, ego, agenda, being obstinate because you think you\u2019re right \u2014 is gone. There\u2019s no more testing.\u201dThey are not alone in their cycle of marriage, divorce and remarriage \u2014 to each other. Phil Collins, the chronicler of failed relationships, recently reconciled with his third ex-wife, Orianne Cevey, after an eight-year separation (and $48 million divorce).\u201cWell, you know, we realized we made a mistake,\u201d Mr. Collins told \u201cCBS This Morning\u201d in an interview this week. He recalled that his son Matthew from that marriage told him: \u201cHe just wished that it would happen. I was very moved.\u201d The singer added, \u201cIt\u2019s simple: We missed each other.\u201dThey join the ranks of Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton; Natalie Wood and Robert Wagner; Melanie Griffith and Don Johnson; Judith Sheindlin (Judge Judy) and Jerry Sheindlin; and Marie Osmond and Stephen Craig, who became her third (and first) husband.The idea of a marriage reprise has seeped into popular culture, too, \u201cThe Parent Trap\u201d notwithstanding. In the 2009 film \u201cIt\u2019s Complicated,\u201d the divorced couple, played by Meryl Streep and Alec Baldwin, consider reconciling, much to their children\u2019s dismay.\u201cVery, very few try to start over again,\u201d said Nancy Kalish, a former psychology professor at California State University, Sacramento, who has been studying divorced couples for decades.Most divorced people \u201cdon\u2019t ever want to speak to each other again, and some struggle to do so for the good of their children,\u201d she said. Of the ones who do reconcile, she said, those who have been most successful in rebuilding their former marriages were much younger when they parted and had been separated a long time.That\u2019s what happened with April and Mike Davidson, of Grand Ledge, Mich. They met when she was 18 and he was 25; by the time she was 30, she was the mother of five.\u201cIt sounds so clich\u00e9, but I completely lost who I was,\u201d said Ms. Davidson, now 38. \u201cI became \u2018Mike\u2019s wife,\u2019 and \u2018so and so\u2019s mom.\u2019 We\u2019d put the kids to bed and then argue.\u201dShe went back to school, made friends of her own and took a job. She was happier, she said, but her newfound independence threatened her husband.They tried couples therapy to no avail; in 2009, they divorced, negotiating the terms of their split in a draft Google document. They amicably co-parented, and dated other people.She was flooded with rage, she said, and called her ex and vented. But instead of lobbing daggers back at her, he invited her out for coffee. She went.\u201cThere was this spark that scared the hell out of me,\u201d she said. \u201cI hadn\u2019t looked a him without bitterness in years.\u201d He walked her back to her car, and as if propelled by some supernatural force, she leaned over and kissed him.In June 2012, three years after their divorce was final, he moved into the house Ms. Davidson had purchased following the dissolution of their union.\u201cPeople really can change through loss,\u201d said Wendy Paris, author of \u201cSplitopia: Dispatches From Today\u2019s Good Divorce and How to Part Well.\u201d \u201cThey don\u2019t change through criticism in a contentious marriage.\u201d\u201cAfter divorce, your ex still has your words in her head,\u201d Ms. Paris said. \u201cShe could change into someone you get along with a lot better. Also, you might change. You could become more confident and reconnected to important parts of yourself once you\u2019re no longer locked in the adversarial position-taking that often develops in a bad marriage. That confidence or clarity can translate into being more generous and magnanimous of spirit, more accepting.\u201dMs. Weiner-Davis concurs, saying, \u201cVery often they come to the relationship with a new maturity and a willingness to learn how things got in disrepair to begin with, and they\u2019re more willing to take a look at what each person can do differently so that they don\u2019t find themselves in the same position again.\u201dLogistics and practicalities play a role; so does sheer exhaustion. Exploring the scintillating world of Tinder may seem appealing to someone who\u2019s been in a committed relationship for eons. But after a while, they may conclude that the devil they know just may be better than the devil they don\u2019t know (or, more pointedly, don\u2019t know as well.)\u201cIt\u2019s hard to be a single parent, responsible for child care and house and mortgage,\u201d she said. \u201cTrying to blend two families and two schedules is such a challenge.\u201dAnd then there\u2019s the fact that people grow in different ways, and their needs and wants don\u2019t always align \u2014 until, miraculously, they do.This was the case with Mr. Fontana and Ms. Lewis, who met in 1978, when she auditioned for the Williamstown Theater Festival in Massachusetts, and he was the \u201cartistic director\u2019s slave.\u201dThey lived together in New York, and then Mr. Fontana got a writing job in Los Angeles on the show \u201cSt. Elsewhere,\u201d which was produced by Bruce Paltrow, who wrote a part for Ms. Lewis on the show.On Dec. 18, 1982, Mr. Fontana and Ms. Lewis married in the backyard of the Paltrow family\u2019s home in Santa Monica, Calif.The couple continued for a few years, each growing dissatisfied with their lives. Not with each other, but with their circumstances. Mr. Fontana was unhappy with Los Angeles. \u201cI found it empty,\u201d he said.Ms. Lewis said she found herself less career focused and more spiritually depleted. But New York wasn\u2019t her dream; she was inspired by hiking the Santa Monica Mountains and staring at the Pacific Ocean.When they finally came to the conclusion in 1993 that they should split, they did it with \u00e9lan, with a Final Anniversary Party. At the bottom of their invitation was this request: \u201cIf you must bring a gift, bring two.\u201d\u201cI was sad when we split up,\u201d Ms. Lewis said. \u201cTom\u2019s such a great human being. It was like, \u2018Why am I needing to do something else when I have this great guy?\u2019 If he\u2019d been a jerk, it would have been easy. It was hard for both of us but we knew it was necessary. He understood that I needed to explore other worlds.\u201dMs. Lewis moved to Maui, and then Sedona, where she taught acting workshops and became program director at the Sedona International Film Festival. About three years after she and Mr. Fontana divorced, she discovered she was pregnant. It was a shock: she and Mr. Fontana had been told that she was unable to have children.Ms. Lewis always planned to raise her son, Jade Scott Lewis, alone. But Mr. Fontana was a part of his life. The three spent some holidays together in New York or Omaha, where she was born, and it was always comfortable. And then a few years ago, after they visited in New York, Mr. Fontana found himself missing her more than usual.\u201cJade was coming to N.Y.U. for grad school, I was here,\u201d he said. \u201cI thought, why weren\u2019t we a family?\u201dAt Christmas 2014, he proposed. She accepted, and they were remarried in July 2015. The couple then took the wedding celebration on tour, with parties in New York, Los Angeles, Omaha and Buffalo, where Mr. Fontana has family. They have upcoming events in Sedona and Maui.Their grand New York party took place Dec. 19 at the Tribeca Rooftop \u2014 35 years and one day after their first wedding. The invitation was an updated version of their original invitation of the two of them kissing, along with this phrase: \u201cAfter 22 years, the divorce didn\u2019t work out.\u201dBoth stress they wouldn\u2019t have had it any other way. Ms. Lewis attributes the split for Mr. Fontana\u2019s artistic prowess. \u201cIf Tom and I had stayed happily married and not gone our separate ways, I\u2019m not sure those shows would have happened,\u201d she said. \u201cI think in his being alone, in life without a mate, I think he really explored the edges of humanity in his writing mind. He went places that I may have said, \u2018Oh, don\u2019t do that.\u2019\u201d\u201cWhen you\u2019re going to write shows like \u2018Homicide\u2019 and \u2018Oz,\u2019 you are testing the extremes in life,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019re going to the darkest place. But there was redemption on both shows, too.\u201dMs. Davidson also believes that divorcing was the best thing she and her husband could have done (they got re-engaged in the spring of 2013; while they refer to each other as \u201chusband\u201d and \u201cwife,\u201d they have not yet legalized the titles).\u201cWe just raced through life from 21 to 31,\u201d she said. \u201cWe lived such an epically fast rate that there was no time for growth. We were both teaching our kids this is what marriage looks like: two people who are unhappy. I don\u2019t want them to feel that way.\u201dStill, their reconciliation wasn\u2019t that smooth. Friends and family were confused: they had taken sides, but were now being told to forget everything they had heard about the other person.Their daughter Josephine, who was 9 when her parents separated and 12 when they reconciled, was furious.\u201cI asked why they would get divorced if only to get back together,\u201d said Josephine, now 14. \u201cThey said they just needed a break from each other and they\u2019re able to be more compatible now. I\u2019m definitely glad now. They seem happier than they did before. But I thought it was kind of dumb to split up and have the kids get used to that situation and then randomly get back together without any notice.\u201dMr. Davidson said: \u201cOur relationship started with a power imbalance, which continued during our marriage, even through ample evidence that it was unhealthy. When it finally fell apart, I was unwilling to make the change that was needed. Instead of embracing equilibrium, I clutched tighter than ever to hold on to control. It took a long time to understand this, and it\u2019s certainly not something I\u2019m proud of, but it was an important lesson. Equality is the foundation of our new relationship.\u201d\u201cAnything that happened that reminded me of the past brought up angry feelings, and we had to experience all that again,\u201d April Davidson said. \u201cBut instead of glossing over it, we had to hash it out. It was messy, but good messy. Sometimes you have to wade in the messy a little bit to come out the other side.\u201d10 Newlyweds Share the Unexpected Ways They MetAn earlier version of this article misstated one of Tom Fontana\u2019s professional credits.

{"Headline": "Microsoft Trumpets Windows 10, and Pushes Into Sci-Fi Tech", "Date": "2016-03-30", "News": "Supported bySEATTLE \u2014 Microsoft continues to bank on its Windows operating system. But the software giant is also increasingly staking out new technology areas, including software that can have natural conversations with people.Those were the twin messages from the company at an event in San Francisco on Wednesday for developers. At the event, Microsoft said Windows 10, the latest version of its operating system, is now running on 270 million active devices, eight months after it was released to the public. That represented the fastest adoption ever for a new version of Windows, outpacing the rate at which Windows 7 was adopted by 145 percent, the company said.Microsoft also revealed new tools for developers to create \u201cbots,\u201d pieces of software that can be used to produce new methods of interacting with computers, such as a chat interface for ordering pizzas online.\u201cWe want to build intelligence that augments human abilities and experiences,\u201d Satya Nadella, Microsoft\u2019s chief executive, said at the event.\u201cWe\u2019re back to the drawing board,\u201d he said.In another area of new technology, Microsoft said it had begun shipping a version of HoloLens, the company\u2019s augmented reality headset that overlays digital images on the wearer\u2019s view of the real world. The $3,000 product is aimed at developers making applications for HoloLens. Microsoft has not said when it will begin selling a version of the product for the public or how much it will cost.The company also emphasized its progress with Windows 10, in a reminder that \u2014 for all of the talk of Microsoft\u2019s fading stature in the technology industry \u2014 Windows is still the software that most of the world uses to run its PCs.Microsoft previously said it intended to get Windows 10 running on one billion devices two to three years after the product shipped last July. In a recent interview, Terry Myerson, the executive vice president of the Windows and devices group at Microsoft, said he was confident the company could still reach that objective.\u201cThe goal was always ambitious, but enterprises are deploying faster than ever before,\u201d Mr. Myerson said.Jan Dawson, an analyst at Jackdaw Research, said developers had little incentive to create software for Windows first when they can reach bigger audiences elsewhere.Windows 10 is supposed to give developers an extra incentive to create apps for Microsoft products by making it easy for them to produce software that can run on any Windows 10 device, including PCs, smartphones and the Xbox One console. Microsoft praises new \u201cuniversal apps\u201d of this nature from the likes of Twitter, Uber, King, Disney, the Wargaming Group, Square Enix and Yahoo.It isn\u2019t clear that the apps being made for Windows 10 will be sufficient to get people to buy phones running the software.\u201cWe obviously have work to do in mobile,\u201d Mr. Myerson said.To keep interest in Windows 10, Microsoft said Wednesday that it would refresh the software with an update that would connect users with Cortana, the virtual assistant in the operating system, without requiring a PC to be unlocked first. People could then use their PCs like Amazon\u2019s Echo device, which can be summoned to answer questions about the weather and trivia from across the room.The Windows 10 update will also enhance a feature called Windows Hello that lets people more securely log into Windows using biometric verification, like facial recognition. The change will allow people to sign into websites and apps with Windows Hello so they don\u2019t have to use passwords.David Smith, an analyst at Gartner, said Windows 10 should be considered a success, especially compared with its predecessor, Windows 8, which many people disliked for too aggressively pushing a striking redesign of the software\u2019s interface. (Microsoft skipped over the Windows 9 name.)Still, he doubts that enough people will see a need to buy PCs to return the market to growth. \u201cI don\u2019t see it creating this massive upgrade cycle,\u201d Mr. Smith said.Advertisement"}

Cruise was valued at $90 million in a fund-raising round late last year before the acquisition, the people said.Founded in 2013, Cruise has been successful in adapting conventional cars to operate on highways with self-driving features. The company installs sensors, computer equipment and other devices that can control steering, braking and acceleration.Other automakers, including Tesla, Audi and Mercedes-Benz, are also rapidly adding equipment that allows vehicles to partly drive themselves. And the technology giant Google is in advanced stages of developing cars that function without any driver involvement.Industry analysts said the G.M. deal underscored how competitive the race toward autonomous vehicles had become.\u201cLike it or not, autonomous cars are coming, and coming fast,\u201d said Akshay Anand, an analyst with the auto research firm Kelley Blue Book.G.M. executives said the acquisition of Cruise was a critical building block in its autonomous-driving efforts. \u201cWe intend to invest significantly to further grow the talent base and capabilities,\u201d said Mark L. Reuss, G.M.\u2019s chief of global product development.Kyle Vogt, the founder of Cruise, said that joining G.M. would accelerate development of his company\u2019s technology. \u201cThis is a groundbreaking step toward rapidly commercializing autonomous vehicle technology,\u201d said Mr. Vogt.While automakers press forward with new technology, federal officials are also stepping up their efforts to regulate driverless cars and set appropriate safety standards.Transportation Secretary Anthony Foxx said on Friday that regulators would hold public meetings this spring in California and Washington to gather information on potential guidelines for autonomous vehicles.\u201cWe are witnessing a revolution in auto technology that has the potential to save thousands of lives,\u201d said Mr. Foxx. \u201cIn order to achieve that potential, we need to establish guidelines for manufacturers that clearly outline how we expect autonomous vehicles to function.\u201dA recent report prepared for the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration found few existing regulatory hurdles to conventional cars equipped with autonomous technology.However, the agency said it needed guidelines for more advanced vehicle designs that, for example, may eliminate steering wheels and brake pedals from autonomous models.Bill Vlasic reported from Detroit and Mike Isaac from New York.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": null, "Date": "2016-03-02", "News": "Mr. McClendon is accused of orchestrating a conspiracy in which two oil and gas companies colluded not to bid against each other for the purchase of leases in northwestern Oklahoma from late 2007 to early 2012. The Justice Department said the companies decided who would win the leases and the winner would allot an interest in the leases to the other company. \u00e2\u0080\u009cHis actions put company profits ahead of the interests of leaseholders entitled to competitive bids for oil and gas rights on their land,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said William J. Baer, assistant attorney general for the antitrust division. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe charge that has been filed against me today is wrong and unprecedented,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. Mr. McClendon, an audacious chief executive at Chesapeake until he was forced to step down three years ago, became a billionaire as the company aggressively outbid competitors for land leases and drilled highly productive wells in virtually every major shale gas field in the country. Chesapeake\u00e2\u0080\u0099s stock price has been sinking for five years now, especially since it was revealed that Mr. McClendon had taken a personal stake in Chesapeake wells and used it as collateral for up to $1.1 billion in loans used mostly to pay for his share of the cost of drilling those wells. Gordon Pennoyer, a spokesman for Chesapeake, said the company was cooperating with the antitrust investigation and did not expect to face prosecution or fines related to the matter.This creates a culture of \u00e2\u0080\u009chaves\u00e2\u0080\u009d and \u00e2\u0080\u009chave-nots,\u00e2\u0080\u009d where a vote is worth everything or nothing. The founders control the company and wield influence more or less with impunity. The idea can work well in principle, allowing the founders to look to the long term. And when one share counts for one vote, too often the vote doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t count. There are indications that shareholders value the power to vote too. Google\u00e2\u0080\u0099s \u00e2\u0080\u009cno vote\u00e2\u0080\u009d shares, for example, trade at a small discount to its one-vote shares.SABMiller agreed to sell its stake in MillerCoors in the United States for about $12 billion in November. Asahi Group Holdings of Japan has also agreed to buy Peroni and Grolsch, as well as parts of SABMiller\u00e2\u0080\u0099s European operations, for about $2.8 billion. The complexity is a result, in part, of the constant jockeying among exchanges to win business from the biggest traders, many of which are so-called high-frequency trading firms that make money by capitalizing on small changes in prices. RBC Capital Markets, found that the New York Stock Exchange, Nasdaq and other exchanges make frequent small tweaks to their prices, influencing trading behavior in ways that are hard for even sophisticated investors to understand. At one exchange highlighted in the research, EDGX, the pricing tiers, for example, include the \u00e2\u0080\u009cInvestor Tier,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the \u00e2\u0080\u009cUltra Tier,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the \u00e2\u0080\u009cMega-Step-Up Tier 1\u00e2\u0080\u009d and the \u00e2\u0080\u009cMega-Step-Up Tier 2,\u00e2\u0080\u009d among others. These tiers, though, were just the first layer of complication that big investors have to navigate to determine the price of buying or selling a stock. The research is likely to strengthen the hand of IEX, a company that is  asking regulators for approval to become an official stock exchange. The founders of IEX were the protagonists in the Michael Lewis book \u00e2\u0080\u009cFlash Boys\u00e2\u0080\u009d and are hoping to provide a more straightforward way to trade stocks.

{"Headline": "Obama, at South by Southwest, Calls for Law Enforcement Access in Encryption Fight", "Date": "2016-03-11", "News": "Supported byBut the president warned that America had already accepted that law enforcement can \u201crifle through your underwear\u201d in searches for those suspected of preying on children, and he said there was no reason that a person\u2019s digital information should be treated differently.\u201cIf, technologically, it is possible to make an impenetrable device or system, where the encryption is so strong that there is no key, there is no door at all, then how do we apprehend the child pornographer?\u201d Mr. Obama said. \u201cHow do we disrupt a terrorist plot?\u201dIf the government has no way into a smartphone, he added, \u201cthen everyone is walking around with a Swiss bank account in your pocket.\u201dMr. Obama\u2019s decision to embrace the law enforcement position on encryption represents a fundamental break with a tech community that has strongly supported his political career. For years, the president nurtured close ties to Silicon Valley, tapping the youthful talent there to help him reshape the federal government\u2019s aging technology infrastructure and seeking out leading executives for private advice and millions in campaign cash.\u00a0That partnership was in part a result of a philosophical affinity between Mr. Obama and technology executives that included broad agreement about gay rights, immigration, civil liberties and health care. Mr. Obama has repeatedly said he remains a fierce defender of civil liberties, including the right to privacy.Within the administration, there is a division over encryption between the F.B.I., along with other law enforcement agencies, which says it must have a way of breaking into encrypted devices, and the intelligence community, which worries that the same techniques could be used against the American government. In his comments, which were greeted with polite silence, Mr. Obama said he, too, supported the development of strong encryption to make sure that the government can protect banks and critical infrastructure. And he said he wanted proper oversight of law enforcement. But, he said, technology executives who are \u201cabsolutist\u201d on the issue are just wrong.\u201cThis notion that somehow our data is different and can be walled off from those other trade-offs we make, I believe, is incorrect,\u201d he said.Mr. Obama spoke broadly at the music, film and technology festival about the need for technology to be used to support civic life and the functioning of democracy.He became the first sitting president to visit the festival, which in the past three decades has become a mecca for the high-tech, social-media set. He made his comments during an hourlong conversation with Evan Smith, the editor in chief of The Texas Tribune.At the festival, the president sought to make the case that the technologies behind today\u2019s entertainment and communication apps should also be directed at solving the problems of voter turnout, access to information and civic engagement. \u201cWe want to create a pipeline where there is a continuous flow of talent that is helping to shape the government,\u201d he told the audience. Mr. Obama is something of a technology geek, so his presence at the festival does not come as much of a surprise. He enjoys dinners with technology moguls and has tapped the wealth of Silicon Valley for his two presidential campaigns.He has talked to his closest advisers about creating a high-tech presidential center when he leaves office, in part to help visitors engage with his legacy and in part to encourage better use of technology in society.Still, questions about how to harness the power of Twitter, Facebook and Snapchat to help government are not always clear, especially when the companies involved are, above all, designed to make money for their shareholders.This spring, the White House will host what it is calling a summit meeting on civic engagement, and aides said the president would use it to continue the conversation about the role that technology could play.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "No Texts, Please, We\u2019re Meditating", "Date": "2016-03-18", "News": "Supported byWhen a photo of a wall covered in lush green foliage showed up on Grace Clarke\u2019s Instagram feed, she felt an immediate urge to track it down. Stressed out and headed to a meeting at Madewell, where she works as a social media copy editor, Ms. Clarke saw that the wall\u2019s location was on East Eighth Street in Manhattan at a meditation studio called MNDFL, which opened in November.The next morning, Ms. Clarke, 29, went to the studio and spent 30 minutes in a meditation class led by Lodro Rinzler, one of MNDFL\u2019s founders.Since that session last December, Ms. Clarke has attended classes nearly every other day, often early in the morning, before work. \u201cHaving a place with a stripped-down aesthetic and a menu of classes makes it feel very approachable and promotes a sense of calm amid the craziness,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s a time-efficient way to quiet my mind so I can think more thoughtfully in life and work.\u201dThe cozy, contemporary lounge area at MNDFL fills up before and after each class with people hanging out and sipping tea. Ethan Herschenfeld, a 47-year-old actor and opera singer, took his first meditation class in December and has since gone to classes almost daily, experimenting with MNDFL\u2019s varied offerings (Breath, Mantra and Heart, for example), which are each based on a different tradition. \u201cMeditation brings me serenity and helps me deal with the things that are out of my control,\u201d he said.All sorts of people are finding themselves sitting together. \u201cOur customer is everyone, because there is an investment banker sitting next to a tree hugger next to a doctor next to a stressed-out mom,\u201d said Suze Yalof Schwartz, owner of Unplug, which is based in Los Angeles and is expected to open a New York location later this year. \u201cI see how people feel better after coming to the studio one time, and the more they come the more I see their attitude toward life changing.\u201dA sense of community \u2014 and freedom from distraction \u2014 draws New Yorkers together for an activity that can actually be practiced alone. \u201cMany people in this city don\u2019t have enough physical space to set up an area to meditate, and they\u2019re always going to be distracted by the stain on the carpet or their to-do list,\u201d said Mr. Rinzler. \u201cHaving a dedicated space where you can go to meditate really brings the practice to life for people.\u201dMNDFL has grown quickly since it opened, Mr. Rinzler said. \u201cPeople sign up to give it a chance for a month and can then practice on their own, but they come back because it\u2019s the community that supports the endeavor,\u201d he said. The fee for the first month at MNDFL is $50 for unlimited classes, and after that jumps to $200 a month. Individual classes are priced at $15 for 30 minutes and $25 for 45 minutes. Normal classes seat 22, but when an event features relatively well-known teachers like Sharon Salzberg or Elena Brower, they\u2019ll squeeze in a few extra cushions so 40 people can attend.The Path offers its customers a chance to meditate but without a home base. The business has formed partnerships with places like ABC Home and the Standard hotel in the East Village, which host sessions. The weekly \u201csits\u201d \u2014 30 minutes long with meditation and tea \u2014 at the Standard cost $24 and are free to hotel guests; a monthly membership of $85 includes admission to the weekly sits and some meditation-related social events.The Path\u2019s larger social gatherings include events like a February session with Thom Knoles, a master vedic (a form of mantra meditation) meditation teacher. It drew 100 people to a SoHo apartment, where those who paid $68 could have dinner; those who had paid $200 could stay for tea in a smaller group with Mr. Knoles. \u201cThe Path has developed relationships with people and event spaces that are a win-win for everyone,\u201d Ms. Kaplan said. \u201cOur social events have become so popular because people want to meet others who are not checking their cellphones every two seconds.\u201dLast August, the Rubin Museum began offering a weekly mindfulness meditation series that is free for members and open to ticket buyers. \u201cIt\u2019s been massively popular from the beginning, where we were selling out even in the middle of August,\u201d said Ms. Eshelman. \u201cMuseums are considered reflective places that inspire us to look at the world more deeply, and the boomerang effect is that we look more deeply within ourselves.\u201dAt a recent session, Dr. Bloom saw the room fill with people from the area: a young couple who had just moved from Australia, a crew in their 20s and an older woman in a wheelchair. \u201cRight away people appreciate the benefits and say, \u2018Oh yeah, that felt really good,\u2019\u201d she said.Some doctors have recommended meditation for patients who have illnesses like heart disease and high blood pressure, or are just plain worn out. \u201cFor these stressed-out finance dudes, they are not stumbling across meditation because they want something more spiritual, they are coming because of the health benefits,\u201d Mr. Rinzler, a MNDFL founder, said.A picture caption in some editions last Sunday with the continuation of a cover article about the growing number of people practicing meditation in New York City misstated the surname of a class instructor shown at the Harlem branch of the New York Public Library.

{"Headline": "Fidel Castro Is Out of Sight as Obama Visits Cuba", "Date": "2016-03-21", "News": "This is not how they imagined it. For years, Cuban exiles in the United States dreamed that the island\u00e2\u0080\u0099s longtime dictator would drop dead one day, ushering a transformational era of greater freedoms on the island and reconciliation among its citizens on both sides of the Florida straits. Fidel Castro remains alive. Yet, as President Obama visits the island, transfixing Cubans and resetting their expectations about the future, Mr. Castro is tucked away, out of sight and largely out of mind. A once towering figure in hemispheric politics is gradually fading into irrelevance. His mixed legacy, to be sure, remains embedded in today\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Cuba. The repressive apparatus Mr. Castro established to clamp down on dissent was on display hours before Air Force One touched down in Havana on Sunday, as state police officers swiftly roughed up and hauled away protesters. Members of the Cuban power structure\u00e2\u0080\u0099s old guard, who remain lodged in Cold War ideological trenches, warned that Mr. Obama\u00e2\u0080\u0099s delegation would include Trojan horses.The Cuban government still strenuously defends the principles of egalitarianism that Mr. Castro imposed on Cubans, and argues that warming relations with the United States will have no bearing on the shape Cuba\u00e2\u0080\u0099s socialism takes in the years ahead. Many Cubans are proud, to this day, of the values of a Socialist system that gave rise to one of the most literate and healthy societies in a region of rampant inequality.And yet, the Obama administration\u00e2\u0080\u0099s opening with Cuba has unleashed a desire for change that seems certain to continue growing long after a new American president is sworn in and the octogenarian Castro brothers are buried. On Monday night, Ra\u00c3\u00bal Castro, the younger brother who took the reins from Fidel Castro in 2008, will host Mr. Obama at a state dinner. After that meeting, the anti-imperialist chants that Cuban children have been taught to recite at school for decades will ring increasingly hollow. The long tentacles of the police state will feel ever more intrusive. The rigidity of the centrally planned economy will seem utterly unjustifiable.On Tuesday, Mr. Obama, who is months away from leaving office, will deliver a speech that will be broadcast live on Cuban television. He is expected to speak about human rights, political freedoms and reconciliation. Prominent Cuban exiles \u00e2\u0080\u0094 the people Fidel Castro once branded as worms and traitors \u00e2\u0080\u0094 will be in attendance, sitting alongside Cubans who chose to stay put. If Mr. Obama succeeds in encouraging economic and political reforms in the short term, it will be through persuasion, rather than the failed policy of subterfuge that did more to tighten than undermine the Castros\u00e2\u0080\u0099 grasp on power. Wisely, Mr. Obama is not attempting to dictate exactly how Cuba ought to change, or how quickly. That is a course that only Cubans should chart out. Instead, Mr. Obama has recognized that the key to greater freedoms and more prosperity in Cuba lies in building bridges between the Cubans who stayed and the millions who left. Advertisement"}

Now it is adding even more technology muscle to its ad business.On Tuesday, Google announced a package of products aimed at helping companies more efficiently figure out what potential customers are interested in and how to sell things to them.The products, called Analytics 360, are Google\u2019s attempt to surpass efforts by companies like Adobe, Oracle and Salesforce in creating marketing clouds that companies use to collect and manage data about customer behavior. A decade ago this was a haphazard affair for data enthusiasts, but increasingly it is an ordinary part of sales.For Google, it is the main business. In the fourth quarter of 2015 the company had revenue of $21 billion, $19 billion of which came from advertising. While some of that is from individual ad purchases, an increasing amount comes from comprehensive marketing campaigns by big companies.Analytics 360 involves figuring out someone\u2019s habits over numerous screens, including desktop web surfing, television, and the web and app parts of smartphones. There are ways to tailor page designs for many of these screens, and place ads using both Google properties and third-party services. There are tools for figuring out the efficacy of ad campaigns and, this being Google, lots of advanced analytics tools in every component.It was a pioneer in personalizing both web searches and the ads that go with them, but over time it has drawn significant competition.Oracle has spent over $3 billion acquiring companies and hiring staff members for the marketing cloud-computing service it started last year. Adobe, once known for its graphics software, last year got $1.4 billion of its $4.8 billion in revenue from its marketing cloud and is racing to add analytic technology to its offerings.Last month, Salesforce, a pioneer in online software, said its marketing cloud revenue grew 29 percent, to $654 million. Numerous start-ups have been created by former Googlers and others for things like tailored web pages and data \u201cjourneys\u201d that follow customers, or the marketers trying to figure out what to sell them and when.Google\u2019s new effort is particularly focused on mobile.\u201cMobile is about moments, shorter and more fragmented. It\u2019s important we string these together,\u201d said Paul Muret, the vice president for display, video and analytics at Google. \u201cWe need to understand the desires of consumers in each point in time to understand their context and intent.\u201dHow well that works will be interesting to watch.

{"Headline": "Googling Is Believing: Trumping the Informed Citizen", "Date": "2016-03-09", "News": "About a week before he used the national political stage to ask viewers to think about Donald Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s \u00e2\u0080\u009cfinger\u00e2\u0080\u009d size, Marco Rubio told the audience during another recent Republican presidential debate to Google \u00e2\u0080\u009cDonald Trump and Polish workers.\u00e2\u0080\u009d They did.Nonetheless, Rubio\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Google gambit and Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s (non)reaction to it, reveals an interesting, and troubling, new change in attitude about a philosophical foundation of democracy: the ideal of an informed citizenry.This is one reason philosophers have always been worried about the ebb and flow of information, and who controls it. Plato argued in \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe Republic\u00e2\u0080\u009d that the fact that democracies couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t control that flow and point it toward truth was one reason they often dissolved into tyranny. In a different vein, Noam Chomsky argued in the 1980s that consent was being \u00e2\u0080\u009cmanufactured\u00e2\u0080\u009d by Big Media \u00e2\u0080\u0094 large consolidated content-delivery companies (like this newspaper) that could cause opinions to sway one way or the other at their whim. Knowledge is power; capture it and you capture power in a democracy.An anthology of essays from The Times\u2019s philosophy series, published by Liveright.The political importance of information \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and the fear that it can be manipulated \u00e2\u0080\u0094 has not changed. What has changed is how we are informed about politics or anything else, or how we aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t. The Big Media that worried Chomsky 30 years ago is largely a thing of the past; many of the largest newspapers are gone, and others are shadows of their former selves. In the halcyon early days of the Internet, when we began excitedly exploring the information Garden of Eden, still free of the shadow of social media, it was easy to think that knowledge itself had become democratic, and that Plato\u00e2\u0080\u0099s worry had at last been shown to be bankrupt. But the worry hasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t gone away \u00e2\u0080\u0094 it has just changed form.The worry is no longer about who controls content. It is about who controls the flow of that content. It is no coincidence that we are now seeing Big Data companies like Facebook sponsor presidential debates. Nor is it a coincidence that people are increasingly following the election on social media, using it both as the source of their information and as the way to get their view out. Consent is still being manufactured, but the manufacturing is being done willingly by us, usually intended for consumption by other people with whom we already agree, facts or no facts.It really isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t a surprise that Rubio would ask us to Google for certain facts; that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s how you and I know almost everything we know nowadays \u00e2\u0080\u0094 it is a way of knowing that is so embedded into the very fabric of our lives that we don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t even notice it. What else could Rubio ask us to do to fact-check Trump? We used to say that seeing is believing; now Googling is believing.Of course, in many ways following that norm \u00e2\u0080\u0094 Google it! \u00e2\u0080\u0094 can help us realize the Jefferson ideal of an informed citizen I sketched above. That ideal, recall, emerges out of the simple fact that reasonable action requires knowledge, and reasonable political action requires political knowledge. And Google places more politically important information at our fingertips than ever before. So if the ideal of being informed means having more information available for uptake, there is a case for saying that we are now closer than ever to realizing that ideal. That is behind the thought, commonly voiced in the early part of this century, that the Internet has \u00e2\u0080\u009cdemocratized\u00e2\u0080\u009d knowledge.One reason for thinking so is that searching the Internet can get you to information that would back up almost any claim of fact, no matter how unfounded. It is both the world\u00e2\u0080\u0099s best fact-checker and the world\u00e2\u0080\u0099s best bias confirmer \u00e2\u0080\u0094 often at the same time. Group polarization on the Internet is a fact of digital life. Liberals \u201cfriend\u201d liberals and share liberal-leaning media stories and opinions with them; conservatives friend conservatives, and do the same.And the flow of digital information is just as prone to manipulation as its content \u00e2\u0080\u0094 even when that flow is directed at an audience larger than our own immediate circle. Take an example: Search for \u00e2\u0080\u009cwhat really happened to the dinosaurs\u00e2\u0080\u009d and one of the top results is likely to be from a site called answersingenesis.org \u00e2\u0080\u0094 not, I suggest, a good source of information on the T-Rex. But it illustrates how canny use of search engine metrics can be used to push an agenda. No wonder Trump and his followers on Twitter immediately shrugged off Rubio\u00e2\u0080\u0099s inconvenient truths; there is nothing to fear from information when counterinformation is just as plentiful.That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s why the real worry here isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t about the regrettable if obvious fact that citizens are less informed than our ideals demand. Nor is it simply the amusing specter of candidates\u00e2\u0080\u0099 shouting competing Googling instructions at the audience like so many carnival barkers. The real worry concerns our faith in the ideal of an informed citizenry itself. That worry, as I see it, has two faces.Read previous contributions to this series.Second, the danger is that increasing recognition of the fact that Googling can get you wherever you want to go can make us deeply cynical about the ideal of an informed citizenry \u00e2\u0080\u0094 for the simple reason that what counts as an \u00e2\u0080\u009cinformed\u00e2\u0080\u009d citizen is a matter of dispute. We no longer disagree just over values. Nor do we disagree just over the facts. We disagree over whose source \u00e2\u0080\u0094 whose fountain of facts \u00e2\u0080\u0094 is the right one.And once disagreement reaches that far down, the daylight of reason seems very far away indeed.More From Fixes \u00bbMore From Private Lives \u00bbMore From Couch \u00bbMore From The Stone \u00bbMore From Moviegoers \u00bbMore From The End \u00bbMore From Draft \u00bbMore From Anxiety \u00bbMore From Menagerie \u00bbMore From Disunion \u00bbMore From Bedside \u00bbMore From The Conversation \u00bbMore From The Great Divide \u00bbMore From Errol Morris \u00bbFollowAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "In Shift to Streaming, Music Business Has Lost Billions", "Date": "2016-03-24", "News": "Supported byBut a closer look shows that the big sales numbers that have sustained the recorded music business for years are way down, and it is hard to see how they could ever return to where they were even a decade ago.Revenue from music sales in the United States has hovered around $7 billion since 2010, according to the Recording Industry Association of America. For 2015, the number was $7.02 billion, up slightly less than 1 percent from 2014.Within that steady total, however, have been drastic shifts in listener behavior. CDs and downloads have been gradually abandoned as streaming has become the platform of choice.The result is that the music industry finds itself fighting over pennies while waving goodbye to dollars. For instance, the growing but still specialized market for vinyl records is generating more revenue than the music on YouTube, one of the biggest destinations on the Internet, but that\u2019s because YouTube pays royalties in the tiniest fractions of cents.Streaming \u2014 whether through paid subscriptions to Spotify or Rhapsody; Internet radio from Pandora; or even videos on YouTube \u2014 now makes up 34.3 percent of sales, edging out digital downloads as the industry\u2019s biggest source of revenue. In 2015, the year that Apple Music arrived and Tidal was reintroduced by Jay Z, paid subscription services generated $1.2 billion in sales in the United States. After adding in free streaming platforms and Internet radio, the total for streaming is $2.4 billion.What gets lost in the battles over fractions of pennies, however, is just how much money has vanished from the music business as consumers have abandoned its most profitable product: the CD.In 2006 \u2014 years after Napster, and well into the iTunes era \u2014 record labels still reaped $9.4 billion from CD sales in the United States, more than the total sales revenue of the business today. Last year, CD sales stood at just $1.5 billion, a drop of 84 percent in a decade. And downloads, also once viewed as the industry\u2019s savior, have now been falling for three consecutive years with no sign of recovery.In a note accompanying the recording industry\u2019s report, Cary Sherman, the group\u2019s chief executive, criticized sites like YouTube \u2014 characterized in the report as \u201con-demand ad-supported\u201d \u2014 for what he described as paltry payouts compared to their enormous popularity online. Last year, YouTube and sites like it generated $385 million in royalties. In comparison, vinyl records \u2014 a niche if there ever was one \u2014 brought in $416 million.\u201cReforms are necessary to level the playing field and ensure that the entire music community derives the full and fair value of our work,\u201d Mr. Sherman wrote. (In response, Google, which owns YouTube, objected to its comparison alongside audio-only platforms, referring to it as \u201capples to oranges.\u201d)It may be possible for the music industry to wring more money out of YouTube. But it seems doubtful that it will ever earn back what it has lost from the CD.Advertisement"}
