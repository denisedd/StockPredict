But investors are struggling to see the silver lining in the headlines about Valeant.Mr. Levine also notes that he does not understand Valeant\u00e2\u0080\u0099s investor-relations strategy. Why have one-on-one calls to reassure analysts, only to  sandbag them with bad results and guidance two weeks later? he asks. Also in question is why the company had to issue a correction over an earnings release that it knew would be heavily scrutinized.  Its stock market value of $11.4 billion after the close of business on Tuesday was less than half of the $31 billion in debt the company carries. Valeant\u00e2\u0080\u0099s reliance on acquisitions makes the company\u00e2\u0080\u0099s true cash flows much harder to fathom and its preferred measure of cash flow is not based on generally accepted accounting principles, so it is not reliable. The acquisitions are probably valued on Valeant\u00e2\u0080\u0099s books at or near the prices paid for them and those prices are often far higher than the businesses are worth, analysts say. One of SunEdison\u00e2\u0080\u0099s yieldcos, TerraForm Power, agreed to buy $922 million of Vivint assets from SunEdison, selling stock to finance the purchase. SunEdison controls the yieldcos but does not own a majority interest. Appaloosa Management protested about the acquisition, asserting that SunEdison used its control position to force TerraForm Power into this deal. Then the price of oil collapsed and investors drove down the stocks of solar power companies. After TerraForm Power openly talked of getting out of the deal and a delay in completing SunEdison\u00e2\u0080\u0099s financial statements, a new ironclad merger agreement was written. Yet SunEdison still has not finished its financial statements and Vivint has now terminated and is suing SunEdison for damages. \u00e2\u0080\u009cHe is pretty much the only game in town,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Michael Sammons, a San Antonio investor who lost money in two Chinese companies, adding that he could not find anyone else to take on the cases.  Jefferies is viewed as a barometer of Wall Street and other banks, like JPMorgan Chase and Citigroup, have already talked about how rocky trading has hurt their first-quarter results.  Jefferies saw its equities struggle, after problems with fixed-income trading and energy market exposure in previous quarters. Several write-downs contributed to the decline in its equity business line, while deals lined up for completion early in the year were delayed. end .ru-story  end .ru-story  end .ru-story  end .ru-story  end .ru-story  end .ru-story  end .ru-story Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Explaining Valeant: The Main Theories", "Date": "2016-03-29", "News": "Supported byDeal ProfessorWhether experiencing schadenfreude or finding insight, many think they know what is responsible for the turmoil at Valeant Pharmaceuticals International as it falls from a darling of Wall Street to its punching bag.Commentators and analysts have drawn lessons, but few of them are convincing and many seem similar to the kinds of snap judgments that led to this mess.Let\u2019s review the various explanations for Valeant\u2019s woes:The Enron theory is seductive, but Valeant is a real operating business that by all accounts is profitable. Unlike Enron, Valeant is not using accounting to cover up huge and unsustainable losses. Indeed, so far the accounting restatements have amounted to only $58 million worth of revenue. And while there may be more accounting restatements on the horizon, there is no indication of outright fraud.This view has gained traction in recent weeks. Valeant\u2019s chief executive, J. Michael Pearson, is a former consultant at McKinsey, having spent 23 years there. And he apparently surrounded himself with former McKinsey people on his team.So did Valeant\u2019s problems arise from a McKinsey-driven ethos devoted to driving shareholder value through financial machinations? Arguably, in the name of these McKinsey principles, Valeant was moved to Canada, shut down large portions of its research and development operations and became a vacuum swallowing up other pharmaceutical companies, all key to its growth strategy.For good or bad, McKinsey advises thousands of companies, including many drug companies that do not engage in Valeant\u2019s business strategy.This argument asserts that Valeant\u2019s business choices are coming home to roost. Valeant built itself on spending a reduced amount on research and development. Instead, it paid to acquire drugs and in some cases built profits by raising prices. This business strategy created its downfall \u2014 by failing to focus on developing drugs, Valeant left itself exposed to failure.The foundation of this theory is the nonsensical notion that research and development can never be bad. Many drug companies, however, have been unable to capitalize on billions of dollars in research and development and are now resorting to purchases. Gilead Sciences, for example, made itself into a $100 billion company largely through the acquisition of a hepatitis C drug.Shareholder activists are currently taking aim at technology companies for excessive spending on research and development without results. Not focusing on R.&D. was part of Valeant\u2019s business model, but that was not necessarily a problem in today\u2019s world. Indeed it made economic sense for Valeant. The company focused on sales and pricing \u2014 something at which it excelled, at least for a while \u2014 while others did the development.The first problem with this theory is that we don\u2019t have transparency around Valeant\u2019s pricing, or indeed that of any pharmaceutical company. Valeant\u2019s headline price increases were most likely fought by insurers, and the actual increases were no doubt reduced in those battles.It is clear that to the extent Valeant\u2019s expansion strategy relied on increasing prices, that is no longer a viable road to growth. But that does not mean there should be a sudden collapse of Valeant. After all, the drugs in its current stable of products are priced where they are and still sell.ValueAct also pressed Valeant to focus on cutting research and development (something that the fund also pushed at Microsoft) and use acquisitions as a substitute. For a time, this was an extraordinarily successful strategy. Even now, ValueAct is still in the black on the Valeant investment.The problem with targeting ValueAct is that this explains the business strategy, but it does not help us understand what went wrong.There is certainly blame all around for the hedge funds that bid up Valeant\u2019s stock price. The Sequoia Fund, for example, inexplicably put more than a quarter of its portfolio into Valeant. (In a you-can\u2019t-make-this-up sidelight, Sequoia\u2019s chairman is Roger Lowenstein, the author of \u201cWhen Genius Failed,\u201d about the collapse of Long-Term Capital Management.)These investors should have known better than to chase returns, but this again has nothing to do with Valeant\u2019s business.It is clear there are problems at Valeant, but if Wall Street built Valeant, it is now running away from it. And the velocity of the turnaround has distorted all views of the company. It has created a volatility untethered by reality. In the Wall Street worldview, Valeant is worth either zero or it is worth $100 a share.But Valeant is a real company. It does not make sense for a company with earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, or Ebitda, of about $5 billion a year to be worth only $9 billion. A rival drug company, Allergan, for example, with Ebitda of $7 billion a year and $40 billion of debt, is worth $110 billion.To be sure, Valeant has about $30 billion in debt upon which it might technically default if it cannot file its annual financial statement by April 29. But such a situation is not that uncommon. Companies typically pay a fee to the banks and get a waiver from the debtholders.There is no doubt that Valeant has taken a major hit. The crisis has crushed its previous business model of raising prices and making acquisitions. This has left it a company in transition. Valeant may still take some wrong steps, but wherever it goes from here, one can\u2019t ignore the business it already has \u2014 with billions of dollars in earnings.The intrinsic worth of that business remains essentially the same. It is the company that is suffering from a crisis of confidence. The flight by Wall Street shut down Valeant\u2019s old business growth model, not its business.But understanding requires thinking that is a bit too clear-eyed for Wall Street, which when things go bad, prefers the worst. And sometimes it creates a self-fulfilling frenzy. Remember the financial crisis, after all.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A City-Size Cruise, With 4,200 Friends", "Date": "2016-03-15", "News": "Supported byHow big is that boat?So big you\u2019re instructed to look at the fish pattern in the carpets to figure out which way is forward (they \u201cswim\u201d toward the bow).So big you can sign up for Pilates and be half the class because scores of other activities are competing for attention.So big you can spend a week roaming the ship and rarely see the same face twice.That happened to me. When I boarded the Escape in Miami for a cruise of the eastern Caribbean last month, I noticed a group of people in matching pale green shirts. Each shirt had the word \u201cShipfaced\u201d on front and a picture of an ocean liner in a liquor bottle on back. Above the picture, a slogan was printed. A blond, middle-age woman\u2019s shirt said, \u201cWhere\u2019s Joe.\u201d She was traveling with a balding man with a mustache, whose shirt said, \u201cI\u2019m Joe.\u201dI never saw them again. Or maybe I just didn\u2019t recognize them among the 4,200 passengers, a rollicking society of families, honeymooners, retired couples and a few loners, like me. How many were blondes and baldies? How many had mustaches?With an assignment to write about that increasingly popular species, the megaship, I made my booking two weeks before the cruise, scoring a balcony room for $1,349. The deal included an unlimited beverage package (any drink under $15, which meant basically anything that wasn\u2019t single-malt Scotch or came in a pewter cup) and a $50 nonrefundable onboard credit. I was also offered four meals at the ship\u2019s specialty restaurants. The catch was I couldn\u2019t choose my room.Norwegian Cruise Line prides itself on what it calls \u201cfreestyle cruising.\u201d There are no dress codes, timed seatings, midnight buffets with ice sculptures or other formalities. Instead, you have a choice of 28 \u201cdining options,\u201d five of which are covered in your fare and the rest supplemental. Passengers are free to eat anytime, anywhere. (Room service is available 24 hours a day.) Gone is the cohort you join, for better or worse, when assigned a regular place at a table.With its lacy white balconies, the Escape looked to me like the cake for a Leviathan\u2019s destination wedding. The ship was only four months old, a shiny, hulking infant with 20 decks and a fuel capacity of 985,626 gallons.As I boarded the ship, I was greeted by a few of the 1,700 crew members. They were dancing to \u201c(I\u2019ve Had) The Time of My Life.\u201d Then a worker sprayed disinfectant on my hands. When I reached deck 9, I followed the carpet fish up a long, dystopian corridor lined with doors. The stateroom that had been assigned to me had a queen-size bed, a sofa and balcony with two chairs and a small table that overlooked a shuffleboard court and the sea.I loved my room. It was small but with generous amenities. The closet had 18 wooden hangers. The bathroom shelves held all my toiletries. Eventually, the reason for this abundance hit me: I was taking up twice the space of a normal double-occupancy passenger. The sliver of desk attached to the wall across from the sofa was mine, all mine. Over the week, I would spend many hours there, cursing the balky Wi-Fi connection that cost $210.But what good was sitting alone in my stateroom? I went to explore the heart of the ship, decks 6 through 8. I found two big atria surrounded by restaurants, theaters, bars, a game room, shops, clubs, an art gallery and a sprawling casino anchored by a two-story-high ribbon-shaped chandelier lit by LEDs that changed color.On the whole, the interior seemed to borrow a lot from casino design. Divorced from the watery, breezy world outside, each venue offered variations of faux wood-grain laminates; dark, patterned carpets; brass railings and flamboyant light fixtures. Restaurants and bars shouldered cartoonish identities. They weren\u2019t called Irish Pub, Art Deco Supper Club, Argentine Steakhouse, French Bistro or Hipster Microbrewery, but they might as well have been. Many spilled into corridors like the places that serve food in airport terminals.Up on decks 17 through 20 was a whole other world. Here were the sun-soaked swimming pools, the full-scale basketball court, the four water slides tangled like enormous sea snakes and the three-story ropes course with 99 different elements, including the Escape\u2019s star feature: a pair of planks cantilevering over the ocean on either side.I was determined to walk the plank. But first I wanted to check out the Mr. Sexy Legs Competition. It was held poolside on Sunday, the day after we sailed. Nine shirtless men with big numbers painted on their bellies twerked for the crowd before submitting to bottom-grabbing and nipple-pinching by three middle-age female judges.Many of the contestants appeared over 40 and had soft, leathery hides. Not No. 9, a hard-bodied young man who could do handsprings.\u201cYou clearly look like you spend time in the gym,\u201d said Silas Cook, the ship\u2019s cruise director and competition M.C., who came from the Casey Kasem school of extreme vocal resonance.\u201cI take steroids,\u201d the man said.By popular choice, the winner was contestant No. 3. He had closely cropped gray hair and a prosthetic leg and had made a big impression dancing with his cane to \u201cGreat Balls of Fire.\u201d\u201cLess is more,\u201d Mr. Cook observed.Where were the children? Mostly secreted away in other parts of the vast ship but soon to reappear in giggling clusters. Not to slight the obvious enjoyment of adults, the Escape was a child\u2019s paradise. I ached to have my 10-year-old daughter with me. She would have found all her favorite things: miniature golf, French fries, bowling, an aquatic playground, gold. This last was displayed on counters in the shopping area, coils of decorative chains that were sold by the inch, like grosgrain ribbon.The guide to my week was \u201cFreestyle Daily,\u201d the activity bulletin. Every evening, it appeared on my bed, along with fresh hand towels that my thoughtful steward, Ahmad Riyadi, folded into the shape of a bulldog, elephant, bird, and frog \u2014 or maybe crab? Tucked under my arm, this bible led me to cupcake decorating demonstrations, karaoke performances and a lecture by the ship\u2019s port shopping consultant, Rita Mantoura, on finding tax-free bargains where we docked. \u201cIf you see it and you love it, buy it!\u201d Ms. Mantoura chanted in call-and-response style. \u201cWho has heard of a company called De Beers? Hands up!\u201dI also found out that solo travelers had their own social hour. They even had their own section on the ship, with 82 small staterooms, a lounge and an activities program.I joined the solos one evening, as they were about to head out to dinner together. Robert Zitsch, a retired mechanical engineer for the oil and gas industry, who lives in Louisiana, told me he had taken cruises regularly since the death of his wife 18 months before. As a frequent customer and dedicated gambler, he had secured a mini-suite with balcony on the Escape for $432, plus credits for purchases on ship and at ports.Mr. Zitsch, who is 76, added that he liked enormous cruise ships because the masses of passengers required more staff, which translated into better service and a greater variety of live entertainment. He was planning to take another Norwegian cruise in June. \u201cI don\u2019t know where that ship is going, and I don\u2019t care,\u201d he said. (When I encountered him again at the end of the week, he was less happy with the experience. He said he found the food and service disappointing and had had to correct the dealers\u2019 math more than once.)The Escape had other exclusive meeting places. The Thermal Suite Spa, a feature of other Norwegian ships, was a glassy area with saunas, steam room, \u201csnow room\u201d (a walk-in freezer with occasional flurries), \u201csalt bath\u201d (a temperate booth furnished with glowing pink crystals) and the thalassotherapy pool, the biggest hot tub I ever swam in. Yes, swam. The seawater tub was more than four feet at its deepest spot and had a curved sculptural element in the middle from which gushed a fountain that massaged my back.Let me be clear. I didn\u2019t pay $219 for one of the 120 Thermal Suite Spa memberships available. Instead, I took advantage of the $54 day pass that could be used only when the ship was at port. On Tuesday, while other passengers scooped up duty-free bracelets and watches on St. Thomas, I hogged a cushioned chair intended for couples, with a many-pillowed backrest. From there I watched yachts in the bay at Charlotte Amalie looking feeble and small.Two days later, I had another exclusive opportunity: a behind-the-scenes tour of the Escape ($79). My 15 tour mates and I soon learned to our disappointment that the bridge and engine room would be off limits because of security concerns. Instead we were treated to a history of Norwegian Cruise Line, followed by a visit to the biggest of the ship\u2019s 20 galleys, an antiseptic steel warren overrun with drones. We were declared kings and queens of the kitchen and invited to pose for free photos wearing a chef\u2019s toque and holding a giant whisk.In the provision area, which extends through three decks, we were told that the ship stocks 60,000 pounds of meat, fish and poultry a week and 4,000 pounds of bananas.In the laundry area, we saw jaw-dropping technology. One machine pressed shirts on an armature that puffed up and steamed the garment. Another folded and stacked 200 towels in an hour. So many linens require washing on a ship this size that their journey down a chute from the passenger floors must be scheduled to avoid traffic jams.\u201cWhat happens when someone dies on board?\u201d a woman in the group asked.Smoothly, as if he gets this question all the time (which is probably the case), our guide explained that the ship has two landing places for helicopters to remove bodies.\u201cYou don\u2019t prop them up on a deck chair with a hat and drink?\u201d the woman asked.Indulgent smile. \u201cNo.\u201d\u201cOr put them in the meat locker?\u201dIndulgent smile. \u201cNo.\u201dBut now the time had come. If I procrastinated any longer, the winds might rise, or the rain might fall, and I would never be able to walk the plank.At the ropes course, I donned a harness and got in line behind a man who looked to be in his late 60s. Climbing a ladder, I found myself about 15 feet above the deck with a view of the ocean many feet below that. An attendant attached one end of a rope to my harness and the other end to a sliding element in a metal track above my head. Now, all I had to do was walk along a beam that was maybe the width of my foot, with nothing to grasp except that dangling line.From there, I needed to scramble over various single- or double-stranded cables and horizontal rope ladders before reaching the plank, which I now could see was hinged to the structure. In other words, it swayed.It\u2019s not that I feared for my life. If I fell, I would merely dangle helplessly while people below shot videos and posted them to YouTube.Or the rope might indeed break, and I would have to be airlifted off the ship by helicopter or \u2014 worst-case scenario \u2014 stored in the meat locker.Blessing the many options the Escape offered, I turned tail and headed for my favorite venue, the 5 o\u2019Clock Somewhere Bar. It was in fact 5 o\u2019clock. Right there.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Why I Don\u2019t Make Financial Decisions on My Smartphone", "Date": "2016-03-25", "News": "Supported bySpecial SectionAccording to a recent survey by the Federal Reserve, 52 percent of adult smartphone owners use mobile banking services. It\u2019s easy to understand the appeal of these financial apps, as they give us the ability to get real-time updates on our account balances and spending. Research I conducted with Yaron Levi has shown that such updates can deliver real benefits, helping people cut their spending by 15.7 percent.However, many financial apps now go far beyond the delivery of information. They also allow us to perform a breathtaking range of actions. We can sell stocks, borrow money from a friend and cash out our 401(k)\u2019s, all without interacting with another person.My concern is that these so-called smartphones could encourage decisions that are not so smart, especially when it comes to our finances. I recently conducted a pilot study with John Payne of Duke University that looked at this question. We found that people did significantly worse on a test of financial literacy \u2014 we asked them questions about such things as inflation and interest rates \u2014 when they took the test on a smartphone, at least when compared with those who used pen and paper.This new data builds on a large amount of evidence outlining the potential decision-making hazards posed by digital technology. As numerous studies have found, these devices fragment our attention, leading us to multitask and to understand less of what we read. They can even encourage shortsighted choices: One study found that people ordering their pizzas online chose those with 33 percent more toppings, 20 percent more bacon and 6 percent more calories.Taken together, these studies suggest that we should be careful about making important decisions on mobile devices. Because smartphones can encourage us to tap and swipe quickly, we might neglect the long-term consequences of our behavior. A pizza smothered in bacon might taste delicious, but it\u2019s probably not good for our diet. Likewise, selling stocks on a phone when markets sneeze might temporarily ease our panic, but is it good for our financial future?This research has led me to avoid making any major financial decisions on my smartphone, whether it\u2019s rebalancing my 401(k) account or making an offer on a house. I\u2019m no Luddite, but I don\u2019t think mobile devices are the best medium for making major money decisions.It\u2019s worth pointing out that the retirement industry is moving in the opposite direction, introducing apps that enable us to execute nearly every conceivable financial transaction on our phones. I\u2019m particularly worried about the rush to make our retirement savings available on mobile devices.Do we really want people to be able to cash out their lifetime savings with one click while shopping at the mall? The extra money might give us a jolt of excitement. But have we thought through the tax implications? It\u2019s at moments like this that the ease and speed of smartphone decision-making can backfire.The smartphone is here to stay, consuming ever greater amounts of our mental bandwidth. The question is how we can use these remarkable devices to help us think better, not worse. Perhaps the first step is realizing that not every decision benefits from taking place on a small touch screen.Shlomo Benartzi is a professor and co-director of the Behavioral Decision Making Group at the Anderson School of Management at the University of California, Los Angeles, and the author of \u201cThe Smarter Screen.\u201dAdvertisement"}

The offices are airy and contemporary \u2014 and in the distance, through panes of glass, one can see the golden fa\u00e7ade of Ch\u00e2teau Blanc, a 15th- and 18th-century building the Sterns restored as part of the offices when the company moved here in 1996.The Sterns, who have been married 15 years and have two teenage children, say they don\u2019t share an office, noting that their tasks are markedly different. (\u201cI work, she draws,\u201d jokes Mr. Stern.) But they do come together to brainstorm ideas. \u201cWe have specific meetings with creation and for the development of the movement,\u201d Mr. Stern said. \u201cBoth come together. That\u2019s how we work, and it\u2019s important.\u201dWith 21 basic calibers and some 100 patents, Patek Philippe is synonymous with technical innovation and thin movements, all of which are made inhouse alongside some 10,000 components.Understanding the company from the inside out has been a kind of baptism for the Sterns. \u201cAfter so many years you get this feeling inside you,\u201d Mr. Stern said. \u201cThe DNA comes in.\u201d That inherent understanding of the house is especially important to Ms. Stern. Like any creative director of a storied watch house, she balances a company archive (a museum houses nearly 2,000 watches and antiques ranging from the 16th century to today) with new design technologies.\u201cIt\u2019s not so difficult to find the right piece,\u201d Ms. Stern said. \u201cIt\u2019s finding what\u2019s natural and in our DNA It\u2019s important that the client will wear the watch and not just put it in the safe.\u201dCustomer preference is where Mr. Stern comes in. He spends as much as four months a year on the road (\u201cMy grandfather, and father also, always said you have to travel\u201d), gathering client opinion. \u201cYou understand what they like and don\u2019t. But it\u2019s not easy,\u201d Mr. Stern said. \u201cThey expect Patek Philippe to surprise them \u2014 and that also is our goal.\u201dAccording to the company, its sales markets are split: about 45 percent in Europe; 30 percent, Asia; and 15 percent, the United States. But the Sterns note that they do not create watches for different regions. \u201cIt\u2019s one watch for the world,\u201d Ms. Stern said. \u201cThis is a challenge.\u201dOn her wrist is a Ref. 7130G World Time, its usually brown strap swapped for a red alligator one. Introduced in 2011, the watch almost never reached the market.\u201cWhen she proposed a dial like this, I looked at her and said \u2018no\u2019,\u201d Mr. Stern recalled. \u201cI didn\u2019t like it that much and thought it was maybe too aggressive for Patek Philippe. But that is also why I asked Sandrine to work on the ladies\u2019 line: because I\u2019m a man. I can go up to 80 percent but will never wear the watch. It\u2019s a ladies\u2019 watch. I needed a feminine point of view.\u201d Eventually he gave his blessing but not without a loving warning: \u201cI told her it won\u2019t be a success but that you\u2019ll learn from that.\u201dThe watch, priced from 33,560 pounds, did well, of course (\u201cThat\u2019s why you need both men and women to work together!\u201d Mr. Stern said, laughing) \u2014 as has its ladies\u2019 business generally.According to John Guy, a luxury analyst at MainFirst Bank in London, women\u2019s watches are estimated to make up 50 percent of Patek Philippe\u2019s sales (the watchmaker does not comment on performance), positioning it well in a market that is forecast to grow 1.5 times faster than the men\u2019s sector.The company has been introducing more complicated ladies\u2019 watches, partly in response to demand by women purchasing watches for themselves but also to the often-infectious nature of haute horology itself. \u201cSometimes their husbands are wearing a Patek Philippe and they give that passion,\u201d Ms. Stern said.For Mr. Stern, his preferred watch is a Calatrava Ref. 5527, among the house\u2019s most recognized designs. But during the interview he wore a Minute Repeater Ref. 5208, a watch with more than 700 components and the house\u2019s second most-complicated watch now in production. Mr. Stern said he was \u201ctesting\u201d the watch. (\u201cIt\u2019s not time for me to own such a watch. I don\u2019t feel I deserve it.\u201d)The timepiece, which sells for around $1 million, is \u201cvery complicated so people will think, \u2018Wow, it\u2019s too fragile\u2019,\u201d he said.Not that the price tag fazes him. \u201cI don\u2019t see the price, I see a watch,\u201d he said, before intentionally banging it against the table. \u201cThat\u2019s what you have to do,\u201d he said, shrugging. \u201cThat\u2019s what my clients expect of me.\u201dThe company manufactures only around 58,000 watches annually, with its 2015 revenues estimated at 1.1 billion Swiss francs, or $1.12 billion, Mr. Guy wrote in an email. Considering its average retail watch price is 21,000 francs, he puts the company\u2019s operating profit margin at 23.8 percent, at the industry\u2019s higher end. And Patek Philippe watches are known for keeping their value, continually breaking auction records. For example, at the Phillips sale in Hong Kong in December, a 1985 white gold, perpetual calendar model sold for $1.6 million, the highest price ever paid for a wristwatch at auction in Asia.Looking ahead, Mr. Stern says a top challenge will be managing the company\u2019s retail network. It has 440 sales points in 67 countries, and only recently expanded beyond its three fully owned salons in Geneva, Paris and London to include about 20 Patek Philippe boutiques operated in partnership with retailers. The selection process is stringent and becoming a retailer can take two to five years. \u201cWe get to know each other, to understand their problems and they get to understand ours,\u201d he said.In 2010, he even reduced the number of dealers worldwide to 425 from 750 as he felt the house could not produce enough stock to satisfy demand while retaining quality. With dealer numbers now at a more manageable level, he said, they can be better educated and trained. \u201cThis is the challenge for today and tomorrow: to give retailers, sales staff and after-sales service all the knowledge they need to explain who we are and what we are doing. Believe me, it takes a long time.\u201dBut it seems that once in, you\u2019re part of the family. Beyer Chronometrie, on Bahnhofstrasse in Zurich \u2014 the Fifth Avenue of that Swiss city \u2014 stocks some 400 Patek Philippe pieces ranging from 10,000 francs to more than 1 million. It has been in partnership with the watchmaker since 1842, something that makes its owner, Ren\u00e9 Beyer, very proud. \u201cPatek Philippe really tries to keep things as a family,\u201d he said. \u201cThey are very traditional in this regard.\u201dG. Collins & Sons in Royal Tunbridge Wells, England, shares a similar sentiment. A Patek Philippe retailer for slightly less than 10 years, it stocks some 60 pieces. And Harry Collins, who also is Queen Elizabeth\u2019s personal jeweler, calls his retail partnership with Patek Philippe the \u201cultimate agency.\u201dUnlike large watch conglomerates that solely focus on sales, Patek Philippe \u201ctruly cares,\u201d he said. \u201cThey are so professional \u2014 we share the same values of quality, service and care for our name.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "On Eve of Retirement, Savings for Medical Costs Can Fall Short", "Date": "2016-03-04", "News": "Supported bySpecial SectionWilliam Seavey, 69, does not fret about paying future medical expenses. He and his wife, Eleanor, are healthy. And they both have Medicare and Medigap policies, which can help pay many health costs. So they have not put any money aside in a medical savings account.If they do need cash, said Mr. Seavey, they can sell one of their three homes. Or they can go to Mexico for cheaper medical treatment.\u201cMy folks ended up in nursing homes,\u201d said Mr. Seavey, who is semiretired and runs a bed-and-breakfast in Cambria, Calif. \u201cBut I don\u2019t want to spend a lot of money on medical issues when we may not need it.\u201dVarious studies show that people in or nearing retirement have not saved nearly enough for medical expenses, which rise substantially with age. Medicare, by itself, covers only about 60 percent of medical expenses. And Medigap, which is supposed to pay for what is left, does not cover expenses such as long-term care, in-home nursing or hearing aids.Health care costs are projected to rise about 6 percent a year, which should be factored into medical savings. And longer life spans mean that some retirees may outlive their savings.Fidelity estimates that couples who retire at 65 will spend $245,000 on health care during their retirement. That number assumes, though, that a man will live to be 85 and a woman 87.Some benefits specialists fear that estimate is too low. The nonprofit, nonpartisan Employee Benefit Research Institute suggests saving $392,000 for health care by age 65 for a 90 percent chance of having enough money to pay for expenses in retirement.\u201cIf you\u2019re saving for medical costs, don\u2019t assume an average,\u201d said Paul Fronstin, director of the health research and education program at the institute. \u201cYou\u2019ve got a 99 percent chance of being wrong, because you don\u2019t know how long you will live.\u201d About half the population outlives its savings, he added.New drugs, which are keeping people alive longer, sometimes including those with chronic illnesses, can be costly and the costs can add up over time.Meanwhile, many employers have reduced retiree health insurance, said Kevin Boyles, vice president at Ascensus, a retirement and college savings service provider based in Pennsylvania. \u201cIt\u2019s rare now,\u201d he said.However, many employers do offer health savings accounts, which let workers contribute pretax money that grows tax-free over time. These accounts may be opened only with health plans that have a deductible of at least $1,300 a person this year.Health savings account contributions of up to $3,350 can be made this year.People 55 and older, however, may add $1,000 to their annual contributions to increase their savings, which specialists advise. The average health savings account balance for people 65 and older is $5,016, according to the institute.So the sooner people start contributing to their health savings accounts the better, Mr. Boyles said.\u201cThese are the best vehicles for having medical savings later in life,\u201d he said. \u201cBut there\u2019s massive misconceptions about them. For example, people think they have to make withdrawals every year, but they don\u2019t.\u201dHealth savings accounts are also \u201cmassively underused,\u201d Mr. Boyles added. They can be invested in stocks and bonds, much like individual retirement accounts.Once retirees turn 65 and enroll in Medicare, though, they can no longer contribute to a health savings account. However, money can still be withdrawn without penalty for medical expenses.Without these accounts, people end up selling their homes or taking out reverse mortgages to pay for medical expenses, said Nathan Garcia, a certified financial planner at Westbourne Investments in Alexandria, Va.\u201cThe stress of not having enough money in medical savings is passed down in the family,\u201d Mr. Garcia said. \u201cChildren end up helping out.\u201dTo fund looming medical expenses, specialists advise keeping three years of income in liquid investments like cash or certificates of deposit. And budgets should be updated yearly to include the rising costs of health care expenses, they say.For those worried about paying for long-term care, taking out a policy makes sense.When Meg Doherty\u2019s husband learned that he had early onset Alzheimer\u2019s disease, she began counting on long-term insurance to help pay his medical bills. By the time her husband died about 12 years later at age 67, she figures that his care cost $650,000, and the insurance paid most of it.Even so, she said, out-of-pocket costs, such as medications and extra nursing care, consumed about $100,000 of the couple\u2019s savings.\u201cAlzheimer\u2019s is a very costly disease,\u201d said Ms. Doherty, chief executive of the Norwell Visiting Nurse Association and Hospice in Norwell, Mass. \u201cAnd Medicare does not cover custodial care.\u201dMs. Doherty ended up selling one of the couple\u2019s rental homes to raise cash, and she used money from her salary.\u201cPrepare for the worst and hope for the best,\u201d said Ms. Doherty, 69, who is increasing the portion of her savings that is liquid as she ages. \u201cBut you also have to do your homework.\u201dAn article last Sunday about the need to set aside money in retirement for medical expenses gave an outdated title for Jean Setzfand, an AARP executive who commented on the matter. She is senior vice present of programs, no longer vice president for financial security.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "When Not Paying Attention Pays Off", "Date": "2016-03-25", "News": "Supported bySpecial SectionPay attention to your teacher. Pay attention to detail. Pay attention, pay attention, pay attention! Our entire lives we\u2019re warned: Pay attention, or.\u2026 Well, you know. The worst will happen.But when it comes to your investment portfolio, please do not pay too much attention to it. Market research clearly shows that when your horizon is not today, not next week, but way in the future, the most profitable strategy is to invest more heavily in riskier assets \u2014 that is, stocks \u2014 than people are prone to do.The real question is, Why don\u2019t people invest more in stocks? This profound mystery is sometimes described as the \u201cequity premium puzzle,\u201d because although over the last century the relationship between risk and return has greatly favored stocks over bonds, enthusiasm for investing in stocks has not followed.Perhaps the best insight into this mystery comes from so-called behavioral economics. People, the thinking goes, tend to be loss-averse. That is, even when their portfolios show gains, they are generally more keenly aware of comparable losses. That means that for most people, the pain of a $100 loss is more acute than the joy of a $100 gain.Loss aversion can put a significant strain on portfolios. Data shows that when people evaluate their investments frequently \u2014 several times a week, or even multiple times a day \u2014 the returns on risky assets like stocks are often lower than those on safer assets like bonds. But when a portfolio is examined less frequently, perhaps once a quarter, the opposite is more likely.The results of lab and field experiments suggest that the investment behavior of even professional traders falls in line with loss aversion. And this aversion, combined with frequent review of investments, leads to underinvestment in riskier assets like stocks.Those who complain about the cost of college or worry that they haven\u2019t saved enough for retirement would probably have made more money if they hadn\u2019t been hobbled by loss aversion.So what can we do? Well, not paying (too much) attention to your portfolio is a good first step. It won\u2019t be easy. Just as Odysseus had himself tied to the mast to keep from being seduced by sirens, summon the will power to keep from micromanaging your investments. Set an appointment calendar with the dates you may look at investments, and stick to it.This is not to dismiss other times when your investments should be re-examined: after a birth, a death, a job loss. But in general you should evaluate your portfolio only once every three months. Even better, do as I do and peek only every six months.I\u2019m proof that this strategy can work. Near the end of 2008, the Dow Jones industrial average hovered around 8,700. I evaluated my portfolio on Dec. 31 and kept everything in place. Six months later, I evaluated it when the Dow was around 8,500. Not a big change, so I left it intact. The index has since doubled, to 17,000.Had I been evaluating my stocks daily in early 2009, loss aversion might have compelled me to sell when the Dow dipped to around 6,500. I would have missed the significant returns that the market has had to offer in the last seven years. And I would have endured a lot of stress even if I had not sold.Avoiding the sweet songs of beautiful sirens wasn\u2019t easy, but Odysseus did it. You can, too.John A.

{"Headline": "Former Porsche Executives Acquitted of Manipulating VW Stock", "Date": "2016-03-18", "News": "Supported bySTUTTGART, Germany \u2014 Two former top executives of Porsche, the sports car company, were found not guilty on Friday of stock market manipulation in a case that had also posed a financial threat to the billionaire families who control Volkswagen.Wendelin Wiedeking, 63, the former chief executive of Porsche, and Holger H\u00e4rter, 59, the former chief financial officer, were acquitted by a German court here of charges stemming from a news release the company issued in October 2008.A panel of five judges rejected arguments by prosecutors that the news release and other statements in the months preceding it were intended to mislead investors and to push up the price of Volkswagen shares. Porsche had amassed a huge stake in Volkswagen as part of an aggressive takeover bid.During that spike, in which Volkswagen\u2019s stock price rose fivefold from its previous level, it was briefly the most valuable company in the world.The trial attracted attention because it shed light on events that culminated in the acquisition of a majority of Volkswagen\u2019s voting shares by the Porsche and Pi\u00ebch families, who owned the sports car maker.In a two-hour explanation for the verdict, in which he was harshly critical of the prosecution case, Mr. Maurer rejected their assertion that the Porsche and Pi\u00ebch families stood to lose 14 billion euros, about $15.8 billion at current exchange rates, if Volkswagen shares had continued falling.Prosecutors had contended that the families\u2019 fortune would have been endangered if their holding company, Porsche SE, had been forced to unwind derivative securities it had used to gain control of the Volkswagen shares.\u201cPorsche is not Mother Teresa,\u201d Mr. Maurer said, but he added that the October news release as well as other statements earlier in the year \u201cwere not inaccurate or misleading.\u201dA guilty verdict would also have helped hedge funds that have filed civil lawsuits against Porsche SE to try to recover some of the billions they say they lost betting that Volkswagen shares would fall.\u201cThe verdict gives us a tailwind for the civil cases,\u201d Albrecht Bamler, a spokesman for Porsche SE, said outside the courtroom.The prosecutors said after the verdict on Friday that they would consider whether to appeal.Mr. Wiedeking was once Germany\u2019s highest-paid chief executive, credited with restoring Porsche to profitability by introducing sport utility vehicles to augment the two-seat sports cars that made the company famous. He and Mr. H\u00e4rter left Porsche in 2009.The verdict \u201cends nearly seven years of continually new public accusations by the state\u2019s attorney,\u201d Mr. Wiedeking said in a statement.Mr. H\u00e4rter was previously convicted of credit fraud in connection with the same events, and he paid a \u20ac630,000 fine after his appeals of that conviction were rejected. On Friday, Mr. H\u00e4rter described himself as the victim of overzealous prosecutors.Ferdinand Pi\u00ebch, a grandson of Mr. Porsche, was the chairman of the Volkswagen supervisory board during most of the period when the company was illegally circumventing air-quality rules. Matthias Prinz, a lawyer for Mr. Pi\u00ebch who attended the Stuttgart court hearing, declined to comment.Also in attendance was Manfred D\u00f6ss, who is simultaneously chief counsel of Porsche SE and of Volkswagen, illustrating the close ties between the carmaker and the Porsche and Pi\u00ebch families. Mr. D\u00f6ss said outside the courtroom on Friday that he was \u201crelieved\u201d by the verdict.Almost 90 percent of Volkswagen shares are held by just three investors: the Porsche and Pi\u00ebch families via Porsche SE, with just over 50 percent; the Qatar government with 17 percent; and the German state of Lower Saxony with 20 percent.The trial of Mr. Wiedeking and Mr. H\u00e4rter revolved around a few turbulent days in October 2008, soon after the collapse of the investment bank Lehman Brothers propelled global financial markets into chaos.Volkswagen shares were plunging, and speculators began betting that the carmaker\u2019s price would fall further. They used a risky strategy \u2014 short-selling \u2014 in which they sold borrowed shares in anticipation of buying them back, at a lower price, and pocketing the difference.On Oct. 26, 2008, a Sunday, Porsche SE issued a statement that German prosecutors argued was an attempt to mislead investors and prop up sagging Volkswagen shares.In the statement, Porsche disclosed that it owned 42.6 percent of Volkswagen voting shares outright and options equal to an additional 31.5 percent. In other words, Porsche had already locked up 74.1 percent of Volkswagen shares and was close to its goal of acquiring the 75 percent needed to control the company under German law.It was no secret by then that Porsche was trying to take over Volkswagen and had acquired a sizable bloc of shares and options. Porsche was eager to protect its relationship with Volkswagen, which helped manufacture highly profitable Porsche cars like the Cayenne sport utility vehicle.But prosecutors contended that the size of the options position shocked the investors betting that the stock would fall.The hedge funds suddenly needed to settle their short-sale bets, which required them to own Volkswagen shares. The Porsche statement left them with the impression that there were not enough available to buy, a situation known as a short squeeze.On Oct. 28, 2008, two days after the Porsche statement, Volkswagen\u2019s share price \u2014 which only weeks earlier had been less than \u20ac200 \u2014 topped \u20ac1,000 as panicked short-sellers scrambled to buy at any price. For a few hours, Volkswagen passed Exxon Mobil as the world\u2019s most valuable company.Prosecutors said the market panic was unwarranted. Porsche, they argued, was on the verge of running out of the cash it needed to sustain the options play, according to prosecutors, and soon would have been forced to dump millions of shares on the market.But lawyers for Mr. Wiedeking and Mr. H\u00e4rter denied that Porsche was in financial difficulty, saying it had \u20ac3 billion in cash in hand plus Volkswagen shares valued at \u20ac25 billion.German news media had given the prosecution little chance of success, partly because of the financial complexity of the case and because two relatively young prosecutors, Heiko Wagenpfeil and Aniello Ambrosio, faced some of Germany\u2019s most prominent defense lawyers.In the courtroom on Friday, Mr. Wiedeking and Mr. H\u00e4rter were surrounded by 11 lawyers, while Mr. Wagenpfeil and Mr. Ambrosio sat alone.Advertisement"}

I write and talk about money, not politics. But this year, it\u2019s the question I hear most often when I travel to other countries. They want to know if I can shed any light on what\u2019s happening in our presidential race.I\u2019m as shocked as everyone else by what is going on. But as I have thought about it, I keep coming back to this great insight from the investing guru Benjamin Graham: \u201cIn the short run, the market is a voting machine, but in the long run, it is a weighing machine.\u201dThe same logic holds true for democracy. In the short term, how markets move and whom we elect depends on humans casting ballots in a voting machine \u2013 buying stocks or making a choice in the voting booth. The results we see represent nothing more than the collective feelings of all those humans \u2014 at that moment. At any given time we\u2019re voting for stocks or politicians based on imperfect information and a very complex set of mental and emotional biases. These are all things that make it incredibly difficult to reach a rational decision.But in the midst of all this angst about what to do or think right now, we can better navigate the messy short term by considering what we want to happen long term. In the long term, we know that markets and elections become the weighing machines that Mr. Graham described. They smooth out the extreme emotions of any one moment and reflect the underlying value of our bigger systems, capitalism and democracy.So we ought to take a step back from what\u2019s happening right now and add some time to our outlook, say 15 to 20 years. We need to find a way to balance the emotion we\u2019re feeling right now with what we\u2019d like to see decades from now. I know that it makes a big difference when it comes to investing, and it stands to reason that it applies to politics, too.When Winston Churchill said, \u201cDemocracy is the worst form of government ever created by the mind of man, except for all the others,\u201d he could have been talking about investing in free capital markets, too. All of the fear and risk and volatility add up to the worst possible way to reach financial goals ever created \u2014 except for all the others. Still, our investing and electoral systems make more sense when we nudge ourselves into looking past short-term emotions and biases.For instance, it already seems like the race for president has lasted forever. But it hasn\u2019t even been a year since Donald Trump rode down an escalator and ushered in the reality show we\u2019re now watching. We need to remember that in our democratic republic, even a four- or eight-year presidency is still short term.Our country is filled with people experiencing frustration, fear and anger. Why not blow up the whole system? At least it would be entertaining, right? But we owe it to ourselves and to the bigger systems to balance how we\u2019re feeling in the short term against what we\u2019d like to see a decade or two from now.It might help to imagine your personal worst-case situation for 2016. Does a President Trump or Sanders mean you will stop believing in democracy? Probably not. You will still vote in the next election and the one after that because you understand the value of the bigger system. So based on your belief in the bigger system, what\u2019s the best possible vote you can cast this time around?Advertisement"}

One dress shirt is not enough; he wears two at once, with khakis and a down vest.The layers come in handy in the cramped, mazelike wine cellar under Eli\u2019s Market, where, stacked at a cool 55 degrees, lie cases upon cases of bottles that would stir the imagination of any Burgundy lover.Sure, he has some superstar names: Roumier of Chambolle-Musigny and Rousseau of Gevrey-Chambertin among the reds; Raveneau of Chablis, Roulot of Meursault and Leflaive of Puligny-Montrachet among the whites.But even more evident is his exquisite taste. His cellar is replete with the work of producers who have not been sanctified as superstars and are not known for their grand crus, but who simply make beautiful, expressive wines whatever their terroirs. These include names like Domaine Arlaud P\u00e8re et Fils, Domaine Trapet, Alain Burguet, Sylvain Cathiard, Mugneret-Gibourg, Denis Bachelet and Michel Lafarge.\u201cThese are not trophy wines,\u201d Mr. Zabar said. \u201cThat\u2019s not my point of view.\u201dAs a young merchant setting out in the 1970s, Mr. Zabar said, he allowed his imperiousness to define his business. He was obsessive about the quality of every piece of cheese and each bottle of oil. He learned to cook and bake so that all the prepared foods he sold were made either by his own hand or from his recipes.\u201cI only sold what I liked, and if you were offended, too bad,\u201d he said. \u201cI was offensive to many customers. I can\u2019t even believe some of the things I said.\u201dHe has mellowed somewhat. He can\u2019t quite exert the control he desires over his markets, except in his wine shop. \u201cI\u2019ve gotten away from that; it didn\u2019t work in groceries,\u201d he said. \u201cBut this wine store is a continuation of that attitude.\u201dIndeed, he sells only wines he likes. He does not stock Bordeaux.\u201cI\u2019ve never liked Bordeaux \u2014 I never liked the cabernet grape,\u201d he said. He said he doesn\u2019t know enough about German wines to sell them, and carries wine from only one American producer, Hermann J. Wiemer of the Finger Lakes, because he loves the riesling.His attachment to Burgundy, though, runs deep. He sees in the Burgundian vignerons the same obsessive concern with craft and quality that he felt as a young man. \u201cThere was a part of me in each bread, each chicken salad I sold,\u201d he said. \u201cIn Burgundy, they are invested in a way only somebody who works with their hands can be.\u201dThough he knows what he likes, Mr. Zabar does not pretend to be a wine connoisseur. He often defers to his associates: Randall Restiano, his wine director, who handles buying wine for the restaurant and shop, and Jean-Emmanuel Simond, a wine importer and consultant in Paris, whom Mr. Zabar credits with a pivotal role in developing his taste.\u201cEli is now being perceived by most top producers we visit not just as a collector, but as someone genuinely passionate, curious to learn every detail about their work and also their lives,\u201d Mr. Simond wrote in an email. \u201cAnd as someone who is doing something that very few people are still trying to achieve today in the wine world, aging the wines in his cellar for sometimes more than a decade before releasing them.\u201dAging wine properly is an obsession for Mr. Zabar. It\u2019s one of the reasons he stocks few grand cru Burgundies in his shop, because they need too much time. \u201cI want to sell village wines,\u201d he said. \u201cOthers need time, and most people aren\u2019t going to age them.\u201dThe grand crus remain in his cellar until he feels they are ready for his restaurant list, often to be snapped up by the Burgundy lovers who monitor his offerings.\u201cI\u2019ve always responded to smells,\u201d he said. \u201cI thought, \u2018This is the only place I want to be.\u2019\u201dAnd so it was with the wine. \u201cI found Burgundy so difficult, so curious,\u201d he said, \u201cand I loved the smells.\u201dMr. Zabar began to acquire a lot of wine but said he didn\u2019t start buying in earnest until 2002, when he opened the store and knew that he eventually wanted to open a restaurant. He buys directly from importers, and never from auctions.Despite his reputation for charging top dollar, the prices on his restaurant list are eminently reasonable, and sometimes steals.\u201cI\u2019m making a living in the food business,\u201d he said. \u201cI didn\u2019t make the wine. It doesn\u2019t have the same value to me as the food we make. I think margins on wine should be reasonable. We\u2019ll make the money on the food we sell.\u201dMr. Zabar offers an ample supply of less expensive wines on his list, often hard-to-find bottles from the Loire and the Jura. And he sticks to his ideals: no wines from Bordeaux, Germany or the United States, not even the Wiemer.\u201cPhilosophy gets beaten up by reality,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I\u2019m going to do what I want, and there are enough people out there who will appreciate it.\u201dThe wine list at Eli Zabar\u2019s restaurant Eli\u2019s Table offers many great values; not just expensive older bottles, but moderately priced wines as well. Here are six examples of sparkling, white and red.Jacques Selosse Champagne Grand Cru Blanc de Blancs Brut Initial NV (disgorged Jan. 15, 2013) $195A rare cult Champagne producer at a retail price.Domaine Pierre Morey Meursault Perri\u00e8res 2001 $190Terrific price for a top Meursault from a fine producer.Domaine Andr\u00e9-Michel Br\u00e9geon Muscadet S\u00e8vre et Maine Sur Lie R\u00e9serve 2004 $60Muscadet ages beautifully; here\u2019s a chance to drink a rare old bottle.Hubert de Montille Pommard 1er Cru Rugiens 1995 $295Exquisitely aged Burgundy from a master.Castell\u2019in Villa Chianti Classico Riserva 1995 $250An object lesson in the beauty of older Chianti.Patrick Corbineau Touraine Croix Fouchet 2007 $60A deliciously old-school Loire red.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Shine Is Off Diamonds and Gold", "Date": "2016-03-20", "News": "Supported byThe adage that a diamond can be a best friend has lost some sparkle in recent years. Dampened by dollar appreciation, an increase in stocks of rough stones and weakened consumer demand, the global diamond market has hit headlines of late, thanks to tumbling prices. In fact, the average, inflation-adjusted price of top-quality stones has weakened by as much as 80 percent in the past 30 years, according to the Rappaport Index, an industry benchmark, suggesting that the free fall in a material once considered a timeless store of value has been in effect for some time. The prospects for gold, also long considered a haven for investors, are not glittering either. Despite a 13-month high for the gold price this month on the back of interest rate cuts and a rise in global equity markets, periodic rallies in recent years have failed to halt a long-term downward trend, primarily stemming from dips in demand from emerging markets, following a long bull run at the beginning of the 21st century. With costs relating to raw precious materials in a constant state of flux, many of the big name purveyors \u2014 luxury groups such as fine watches and jewelry houses \u2014 are under constant pressure to second-guess the market when stocking their inventories for the year ahead, trying both to protect bottom lines and to improve gross margins. \u201cChangeable prices have a big impact on many major players like Swatch Group, Tiffany and Chow Tai Fook,\u201d Jon Cox, head of European consumer equities at the financial consultant Kepler Cheuvreux, wrote in an email this month. \u201cTypically they engage in financial hedging to smooth volatility, but the impacts of any volatility can be delayed as it takes time for shifts to trickle down and onto balance sheets,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd given the industry\u2019s pricing power, lower precious metal and stone prices are rarely passed onto consumers.\u201dGaia Repossi, creative director of the fine jewelry house Repossi, in which LVMH bought a minority stake last year, elaborated on the process this month: \u201cWe have a number of ways in which we negotiate these changes. We have expert in-house teams who have navigated these cycles many times before. So when the market is slower, we buy gold in bulk \u2014 sometimes stones but more often gold \u2014 and are really careful to always buy our materials at the right moment.\u201cIt is the smaller artisans and one-man operations who can often really suffer from these value spirals,\u201d she added. \u201cIf they mistime a gamble with their stone inventory, they can be really stuck.\u201dOther players say the effect of these tectonic shifts in pricing is minimal. The Swiss giant Richemont has said it avoids speculation and stocking ahead for its brands, which include Cartier, Van Cleef & Arpels and Vacheron Constantin, buying only upon need and thus insulating manufacturing from short-term fluctuations. And executives at other houses, such as H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Poulit-Duquesne, chief executive of the Kering-owned jewelry maison Boucheron, stress that the value of the craftsmanship is the primary driver of production costs, rather than the raw materials.\u201cOf course we pay attention to market vacillations, as it inevitably impacts on the day-to-day running of our business, but what we are selling goes far beyond price,\u201d she said last month. \u201cWe don\u2019t just sell diamonds, or emeralds or gold. We sell works of art and that\u2019s what our clients are paying for.\u201dMs. Poulit-Duquesne added that there were competitors in the global marketplace more likely to feel the strain \u2014 those primarily focused on lower-ticket items, geared toward middle-class purchases in emerging markets, many of whom have been hit in recent years by economic slowdown.\u201cIn parts of the jewelry business where margins are far lower, like low-carat white diamond engagement rings, or retailers in China who sell gold pieces at the value of the market that week, then sure, these fluctuations are a problem,\u201d she continued. \u201cBut not for players operating at the top of end of the market where demand \u2014 as you can see from sales \u2014 is still very strong.\u201d Fran\u00e7ois Graff, chief executive of Graff Diamonds, was another luxury executive eager to stress what he called the \u201cextraordinary resilience of the premium end of the market.\u201d\u201cThe scarcity of top-grade diamonds allows them to decouple from economic volatility and enjoy consistent demand,\u201d he said. \u201cPrices for top-quality, larger diamonds are simply not volatile, as demand invariably far outstrips supply.\u201dResponding to customers\u2019 appetite for more individual and rare pieces, some jewelers are breaking away from conventional materials and designs in a bid to stabilize costs. Oliver Chen, luxury managing director at the financial services firm Cowen and Company, said that this strategy, coupled with others to drive top-line growth, should be a strategic priority for jewelers as new spending trends start to shape the industry.\u201cThe gains and losses around prudent inventory management are minimal when compared to the need to continually boost sales demand for product, given the state of the current global trading environment,\u201d he said. \u201cThe need to be best in class when it comes to what you can offer to clients has never been more important.\u201dMr. Chen noted that the business traditionally has been based on gift giving. \u201cBut now,\u201d he continued, \u201cfar beyond just the materials used, which make a sparkling purchase a valuable investment, it will be the brands who create designs that wealthy women will buy for themselves, rather than wait to have it bought for them by their husbands or fathers, that creatively and commercially will really stand out from the crowd.\u201dAdvertisement"}

He eventually earned a master\u2019s degree in computer science and took a job as a web developer. \u201cMy salary literally doubled in three years,\u201d he says. Okupe was a success by almost any measure of the word. But no matter how much money he made, he still felt unfulfilled. Okupe couldn\u2019t stop dreaming about superheroes.An \u201caha moment\u201d is often described as a sudden insight or epiphany that radically changes a person\u2019s perspective. It can be a decision-making moment, spiritual realization or creative breakthrough. Something clicks in the brain and \u2014 pop! \u2014 things just seem to fall into place.Growing up in Lagos, Okupe fell in love with cartoons like \u201cTeenage Mutant Ninja Turtles\u201d and \u201cTransformers,\u201d and superheroes including Batman, Superman and Spider-Man. \u201cI\u2019ve been a total nerd ever since then,\u201d says Okupe, whose passion only increased with the first wave of the Hollywood superhero boom. But even though more African-American superheroes were slowly becoming mainstream, the characters didn\u2019t reflect Okupe\u2019s own experience. \u201cIf you\u2019re not a hardcore comic book and superhero fan, you probably cannot name five superheroes that you know that were born in Africa,\u201d he says.Since 2008, Okupe had been quietly developing a mental image of his own superhero \u2014 the Nigerian-born Wale Williams \u2014 who would defend his home of Lagoon City from the forces of evil. After taking stock of his situation, and seeing other independent comic book writers succeed, everything came into focus. \u201dI saw other people doing it and I believed in myself,\u201d Okupe says. \u201cI decided I had to take the risk, quit my job and follow a passion that I\u2019ve had all my life.\u201d According to Bobinet, an aha moment like Okupe\u2019s is actually the result of many individual thoughts, conscious or unconscious, that accumulate over time. \u201cEvery time I have the thought, \u2018oh, I should do this\u2019 or \u2018I want to be that\u2019 it throws a penny in the jar of my implicit memory,\u201d she says. The struggle between what people want to do versus what they actually do can result in \u201ccognitive dissonance,\u201d which they may not be consciously aware of. After building up as patterns in someone\u2019s implicit memory, a realization can occur.Beveridge had worked numerous oil jobs in his home state, starting as a roughneck on a rig when he was just 18. After setting his dreams on becoming a Texas oilman, Beveridge earned degrees in geology and geophysics from the University of Texas. He then cruised through a laundry list of jobs including, but not limited to: petroleum geologist (\u201cgot laid off\u201d), oil company owner (\u201cwent broke when oil hit six dollars\u201d), seismic data processor (\u201cquit\u201d) and drilling company owner (\u201coil went down again and I went broke again\u201d). As Beveridge puts it, \u201cI loved the oil business and it did not love me back.\u201d After winding up back in Austin and becoming a mortgage broker in the early \u201890s, Beveridge still wasn\u2019t satisfied. But he did have a hobby. \u201cI had been making vodka infusions for friends for Christmas presents and strangers started calling me the vodka guy and telling me I should start selling my vodka infusions,\u201d says Beveridge. \u201cA guy on TV was talking about discovering your passion by listing what you love to do and what you are good at, then you wrap a job around it. I suddenly realized I had a passion for making liquor.\u201d By 1997, Tito\u2019s Handmade Vodka was up and running as a commercial operation.Giordano says decisions stem from a cost benefit analysis where we weigh thoughts, emotions and behavioral pros and cons. An aha moment, according to Giordano, happens when a person shifts from perceiving a big life change as something more necessary than scary. \u201cWhen we\u2019re looking at the things we\u2019re doing on a daily basis and it becomes so negatively balanced for us, the possibility of making something that is a major life change \u2014 and in some cases, may be a little anxiety-provoking or may be dramatically and diametrically different than what we\u2019ve been doing all along \u2014 carries with it such expectational, positive emotion, that it compels us to act.\u201dUntil, of course, she could. Faced with long hours at the office and a growing realization that she wasn\u2019t spending enough time doing the things she cared about, Gavle decided she needed a change. \u201cI was going to move to L.A., make some jewelry, sit on the beach, do some meditation and some yoga, figure it all out and jump back into advertising,\u201d she says. For others looking to find their own aha moment, Bobinet suggests practicing mindfulness, like the yoga and meditation mentioned by Gavle, could free them from the brain\u2019s more inhibitive functions. According to Bobinet, the prefrontal cortex is a part of the brain\u2019s frontal lobe that keeps us in check. \u201cIt keeps us from saying the wrong things,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s the area where we\u2019re most self-conscious.\u201dBobinet also says that aha moments are often paired with an increase in activity on the brain\u2019s right temporal lobe, which lights up during creative activity. \u201cThis area, called the anterior cingulate, opens your vista of what you consider to be a possible solution,\u201d says Bobinet. \u201cAs it is stimulated, you start to consider things that are unusual solutions or may be normally dominated by your realities, your biases or your prejudices.\u201dAfter moving to L.A., Gavle returned home for a wedding in Detroit, still unsure of her next step. \u201cI was staying in the bedroom that I had grown up in, and I had found this piece of paper I had probably written when I was in high school,\u201d says Gavle. \u201cIt was a life to-do list. At the bottom of the list, it said \u2018open a boutique by the time I\u2019m 40.\u2019 It was kind of like this message from the universe.\u201d Gavle\u2019s anterior cingulate was firing full-blast.Though Okupe, Beveridge and Gavle all arrived at aha moments in different ways, they all shared the willpower necessary to deviate from safe career paths to pursue uncertain ambitions. \u201cVery often, we see the grass being greener on the other side,\u201d says Giordano, who urges anyone with an aha moment to carefully consider his or her options. \u201cAn ounce of preparation is probably worth pounds and pounds of cure.\u201dBeveridge, who has won numerous awards for Tito\u2019s Handmade Vodka, now advises others on finding the right intersection between their passions and skill-sets with an initiative called Fresh Start. \u201cIf you fail, it may feel as if you are going to die but you won't and you don't,\u201d he says. \u201cBrush yourself off and make another passion list.

{"Headline": "Stock Exchange Prices Grow So Convoluted Even Traders Are Confused, Study Finds", "Date": "2016-03-01", "News": "Supported byComputer-driven American stock markets have become so complex that at any moment in time more than 800 different pricing possibilities are being offered to trading firms across 12 official exchanges, according to new research attempting to explain the tangled system.The complexity is a result, in part, of the constant jockeying among exchanges to win business from the biggest traders, many of which are so-called high-frequency trading firms that make money by capitalizing on small changes in prices.RBC Capital Markets, the division of the bank which led the research, found that the New York Stock Exchange, Nasdaq and other exchanges make frequent small tweaks to their prices, influencing trading behavior in ways that are hard for even sophisticated investors to understand.Some of the big mutual fund companies that buy and sell stocks on behalf of investors said that before seeing the RBC research even they had not realized how convoluted the system had become.\u201cThe level of complexity has grown to such an extent that it is unknown to most market participants,\u201d said Mehmet Kinak, the head of electronic trading at T. Rowe Price Group, and a client of RBC with which the research has already been shared. \u201cInstead of finding natural buyers and sellers, we\u2019re finding intermediaries who come in and are benefiting from the complexity.\u201dAt one exchange highlighted in the research, EDGX, the pricing tiers, for example, include the \u201cInvestor Tier,\u201d the \u201cUltra Tier,\u201d the \u201cMega-Step-Up Tier 1\u201d and the \u201cMega-Step-Up Tier 2,\u201d among others. These tiers, though, are just the first layer of complication that big investors have to navigate to determine the price of what would seem to be a rather simple act: buying or selling a stock.Many market experts have said that the complexity of the markets is not something that ordinary investors need to worry about. Over the long run, the price of trading stocks has generally gone down as exchanges and trading firms have competed to buy and sell stocks more cheaply.Press officers for the large exchange companies had no comment on the research, which they had not seen.But large investment firms like T. Rowe, which handle the retirement savings of millions, have regularly complained that it has become much trickier to confidently trade large blocks of stocks.Because of the hundreds of pricing structures, the brokers actually buying and selling stocks can be given incentives to make decisions that are not in the best interest of clients like T. Rowe. At a minimum, the opaque pricing structures make it nearly impossible for investors and even brokers to determine what they will pay for a given trade.\u201cWhen we trade we don\u2019t even know what it will cost us,\u201d said Rich Steiner, the head of electronic trading strategy at RBC.Another complaint from critics of the current market structure is that the complexity of the system requires constant software changes that, in turn, increase the chances of technological breakdowns. The trading firm Knight Capital lost hundreds of millions of dollars and sowed panic in the markets in 2012 after installing faulty software in response to rule changes at the exchanges.The prices are far from the only factor introducing complexity into the markets. Twelve public exchanges are now in operation, compared to a time when the markets were largely ruled by one: the New York Stock Exchange.Then there are the dozens of so-called dark pools, where stocks can be traded privately away from the public exchanges.All of these trading venues offer many different types of orders that determine how and when a stock can be traded. A 2014 research report identified 133 unique order types, including some for particular times of the day and others for trades of a particular size.The new research is likely to strengthen the hand of an upstart company, IEX, that is currently asking regulators for approval to become an official stock exchange.The founders of IEX, who were the protagonists in the Michael Lewis book \u201cFlash Boys\u201d about high-speed trading, are hoping to provide a more straightforward way to trade stocks. But one tool that IEX is proposing to use \u2014 a so-called speed bump to slow down trading \u2014 has attracted opposition from existing exchanges and some trading firms.The chief executive of IEX, Brad Katsuyama, developed many of his ideas when he was working at RBC, and the new research from RBC could be viewed as an effort to help a former employee.RBC executives have not taken any public position on whether IEX should be given regulatory approval to become an exchange, and IEX is not mentioned in the new RBC report. The report uses the findings to push for a more basic change to the United States stock markets: doing away with the rebates that trading firms can earn for trading at a particular exchange.RBC and other critics of the stock market structure argue that the rebates given out by exchanges can skew the incentives of brokers and banks, encouraging them to trade where they can get the largest rebate, rather than where they can get the best price for their client.The pricing structures that RBC details in its new report are a result of the efforts by exchanges to calibrate the rebates they offer to some customers and the fees they charge to others.In one example given in the report, the BATS-Y stock exchange \u2014 one of four stock exchanges run by BATS Global Markets \u2014 sent out a fee notice at the end of March 2014 announcing that it would offer 15-hundredths of a cent to traders buying certain stocks, thus bettering the 14-hundredths of a cent that Nasdaq BX had been offering. Fifteen minutes after the BATS-Y filing, Nasdaq made its own filing matching the new BATS-Y price. The next morning, BATS-Y filed again, increasing its offer to 16-hundredths of a cent.Between 2012 and 2015, RBC found 362 filings with regulators announcing changes to trading fees, with some of the filings including multiple fee changes. The number of pricing tiers proliferates quickly because each tier can apply to similar trades in different ways depending on how frequently a trader uses a particular exchange.Vimal Patel, who oversaw the research at RBC, said that he had no idea how tangled it had become until he began trying to sketch it out last summer.\u201cIt snuck up on people that the world is this complicated,\u201d he said.An article on March 2 about the complexity of pricing on computer-driven stock markets misstated the price offered by the BATS-Y exchange, one of four stock exchanges run by BATS Global Markets, to traders of certain stocks. The prices are quoted in the hundredths of a cent, not in the thousandths of a cent.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Trade Deficit Isn\u2019t a Scorecard, and Cutting It Won\u2019t Make America Great Again", "Date": "2016-03-27", "News": "Supported byThe 2016 RaceDonald Trump believes that a half-trillion-dollar trade deficit with the rest of the world makes the United States a loser and countries with trade surpluses like China and Mexico winners.The reality is different. Trade deficits are not inherently good or bad; they can be either, depending on circumstances. The trade deficit is not a scorecard.What\u2019s more, eliminating the trade deficit would not, on its own, make America great again, as Mr. Trump promises. And in isolation, the fact that the United States has a trade deficit does not prove that trade agreements are bad for Americans, a staple of Bernie Sanders\u2019s campaign in the Democratic presidential primary. In fact, trying to eliminate the trade deficit could mean giving up some of the key levers of power that allow the United States to get its way in international politics.Getting rid of the trade deficit could very well make America less great. The reasons have to do with the global reserve currency, economic diplomacy and something called the Triffin dilemma.Imagine a world where there are only two countries, and only two products. One country makes cars; the other grows bananas.People in CarNation want bananas, so they buy $1 million worth from people in BananaLand. Residents of BananaLand want cars, so they buy $2 million of them from CarNation.That difference is the trade deficit: BananaLand has a $1 million trade deficit; CarNation has a $1 million trade surplus.But this does not mean that BananaLand is \u201closing\u201d to CarNation. Cars are really useful, and BananaLandites got a lot of them in exchange for their money.Similarly, it\u2019s true that the United States has a $58 billion trade deficit with Mexico, for example. But it\u2019s not as if Americans were just flinging money across the Rio Grande out of charity. Americans get a lot of good stuff for that: avocados, for example, and Canc\u00fan vacations.If you want to think of it in terms of winners and losers, in fact, you could justifiably reverse Mr. Trump\u2019s preferred framing: \u201cThose losers in Mexico gave us $58 billion more stuff than we gave them last year. Ha, ha, ha. We\u2019re winners.\u201dMaybe.It is true that a trade deficit subtracts from a country\u2019s gross domestic product. G.D.P. measures the value of goods and services produced within a country\u2019s borders, so when a country is selling less stuff abroad than it buys from abroad, the country is making less stuff, and as a result there are fewer jobs. This piece of the Trump theory of trade is true.But when a country runs a trade deficit, as the United States does, there is a countervailing force. Think back to our pretend countries. BananaLand has a $1 million trade deficit with CarNation. But that means that car producers in CarNation are sitting on an extra $1 million a year in income.Something has to happen with that $1 million, and both of the two options have consequences.One option is to keep that money at home. But keeping that money inside CarNation will push the value of its currency upward. And as its currency goes up, cars will become more expensive in BananaLand \u2014 causing people there to buy fewer of them until eventually the trade deficit is eliminated.If CarNation doesn\u2019t want its currency to rise, it has to take that $1 million trade surplus and plow it back into BananaLand. There are different ways it could do that. People in CarNation could buy stocks or bonds in BananaLand, or companies in CarNation could invest in factories in BananaLand, or the government of CarNation could buy assets directly.The choice is stark: A country running a trade surplus must either let its currency rise or let money flow back to its trading partners.This isn\u2019t just an abstraction. It\u2019s what has happened between the United States and China for the last couple of decades. China has had consistent trade surpluses, but it did not want its currency to rise in a way that would undermine its exporters. So money has flowed from China into the United States \u2014 both from the Chinese government\u2019s purchases of United States Treasury bonds and more recently in the form of direct investment from Chinese companies into the United States.So does a trade deficit mean fewer jobs? It depends on which force is more economically powerful: fewer jobs creating exports or investment dollars flowing into the country.It depends on what the country does with the investment that comes in.In theory, that money could go toward long-lasting investments with positive economic returns: new factories and equipment; education for the work force; and new roads and bridges, or repairs and improvements to existing ones.Unfortunately, how countries use these capital inflows is not always so good. In the United States, the influx of foreign capital in the mid-2000s went in large part to fuel an unsustainable housing and mortgage bubble. Greece\u2019s capital inflows in the same time period went to fund bloated public spending.When the world is flinging money at you, it\u2019s important to use it for something productive. It\u2019s not that trade deficits (and the capital inflows that are their flip side) don\u2019t matter \u2014 but just knowing the numbers doesn\u2019t tell you much about whether they are good, bad or indifferent.It\u2019s not clear that that\u2019s even an option, because the dollar isn\u2019t used just in trade between the United States and other countries.The dollar is a global reserve currency, meaning that it is used around the world in transactions that have nothing to do with the United States. When a Malaysian company does business with a German company, in many cases it will do business in dollars; when wealthy people in Dubai or Singapore\u2019s government investment fund want to sock away money, they do so in large part in dollar assets.That creates upward pressure on the dollar for reasons unrelated to trade flows between the United States and its partners. That, in turn, makes the dollar stronger, and American exporters less competitive, than they would be in a world where nobody used the dollar for anything except commerce involving the United States.The roughly $500 billion trade deficit that the United States runs each year isn\u2019t just about poorly negotiated trade deals and currency manipulation by this or that country. It\u2019s also, to some degree, a byproduct of the central role the United States plays in the global financial system.There\u2019s even a name for this: the Triffin dilemma. In the mid-20th century, the economist Robert Triffin warned that the provider of the global reserve currency would need to run perpetual trade deficits to keep the world financial system from freezing, with those trade deficits potentially fueling domestic booms and busts.The key idea is that if a President Trump or any other future leader really wants to reduce our trade deficits in a major way, that leader is going to have to rethink the very underpinnings of global finance.Be careful what you wish for.There\u2019s no doubt that maintaining the global reserve currency creates costs for the United States, namely a less competitive export industry.But it also creates a lot of advantages. Lower interest rates and higher stock prices are among them (though they have the downside of also feeding debt-driven booms and busts). Even more important is what the dollar\u2019s prominence in global finance does for America\u2019s place in the world.It helps ensure that the United States can afford to finance wars, and it gives the government greater ability to fight recessions and panics. A country experiencing a banking panic will see money sent out of the country, causing its currency to fall and its interest rates to rise. All that limits a government\u2019s options for fixing the problem. In 2008, when the United States experienced a near collapse of the banking system, the opposite happened.The centrality of the dollar to global finance gives the United States power on the global stage that no other country can match. It has enforced sanctions on Iran, Russia, North Korea and terrorist groups with the implicit threat of cutting off access to the dollar payments system for any bank in the world that does not cooperate with American foreign policy.Part of what makes the United States powerful is the great importance of the dollar to global finance. And part of the price the United States pays for that status is a stronger currency and higher trade deficits than would be the case otherwise.The debate over the trade deficit is about more than Mexico and China, cars and bananas, or winning and losing. It\u2019s about what makes America great, and which of the country\u2019s priorities should come first.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Pressure on Valeant Puts William Ackman\u2019s Image as Moneymaker at Risk", "Date": "2016-03-15", "News": "Supported byAs an investor, William A. Ackman lives or dies by his big bets. When he is right, the hedge fund titan earns billions of dollars and plenty of accolades.But when he is wrong, things can turn very ugly. Mr. Ackman\u2019s biggest bet yet \u2014 Valeant Pharmaceuticals International \u2014 has cost him more than a billion dollars in losses, at least on paper.And he is not alone. Some of the investment world\u2019s best-known investors have followed him in staying in the stock and have also sustained losses as a result.The carnage in the market has helped shrink Mr. Ackman\u2019s firm, Pershing Square Capital Management, to $12.2 billion from $19.9 billion just as recently as February of last year. So far in 2016, he has already lost his investors 19.3 percent, much of the decline driven by Valeant. Last year, investors lost 20.5 percent.With a 51 percent plunge in Valeant\u2019s stock price on Tuesday, the pressure is only growing, threatening further losses for Mr. Ackman and putting his reputation as a bold moneymaker at risk.For one, the drug company is facing a federal investigation into its pricing strategies, and is facing shareholder lawsuits in the United States and Canada. On Tuesday, the company said it would not be able to file its annual financial statement in time, warning that it could default on some of its debt as a result.Valeant has also become something of a punching bag in the presidential campaign. Hillary Clinton called it \u201cpredatory.\u201dBut if Mr. Ackman has been brought to his knees, you would never know it.On Tuesday, even as shares of Valeant were tumbling, Mr. Ackman wrote to investors, telling them Valeant was \u201cworth multiples of the current market price.\u201dNonetheless, he sought to reassure his investors.\u201cWe are going to take a much more proactive role at the company to protect and maximize the value of our investment,\u201d he said, adding that Steve Fraidin, Pershing Square\u2019s vice chairman, joined the board of Valeant last week in an effort to take control of the situation.Mr. Ackman\u2019s first interaction with Valeant was in 2014, when he teamed up with the company in a joint bid to acquire Allergan, the maker of Botox. Valeant was spurned, and Allergan then agreed to be acquired by another pharmaceutical company, Actavis.Since then, Mr. Ackman has become increasingly vocal. In October, he held a three-hour conference call to defend Valeant after the stock went into a free fall in the face of concerns about a federal investigation.\u201cIt will take some time for the stock to recover,\u201d Mr. Ackman said at the time, adding that investors did not appreciate how valuable the company was.\u201cThe biggest regret I have with Valeant is that we\u2019re not in a position to buy more,\u201d he said on Nov. 9. Later that month, he did just that, sharply increasing his position in Valeant to 9.9 percent from 5.7 percent. Pershing Square now has a 9 percent stake, after selling some of its shares at the end of the year, making it the company\u2019s second-largest shareholder.The largest shareholder is Ruane, Cunniff & Goldfarb, an investment fund once known for its ties to Warren E. Buffett.Ruane, Cunniff increased its stake over the last three months of 2015 and has a 10.4 percent stake. Its position in Valeant caused internal strife at the firm and two of the firm\u2019s five directors abruptly resigned over the position in Valeant.Paulson Partners, a hedge fund founded by John A. Paulson, increased its stake in Valeant during the last three months of 2015, bringing its position to 3.4 percent. Paulson Partners Enhanced, the fund that holds Valeant shares, is down 15.9 percent so far this year.In October, Mr. Paulson, who made billions of dollars on a bet against subprime mortgages, told investors that concerns about specialty pharmaceuticals like Valeant were \u201coverblown,\u201d adding that Valeant had \u201csignificant upside.\u201dJeffrey W. Ubben, a well-known activist investor and founder of ValueAct Capital, is another major shareholder in Valeant. Mr. Ubben, who has a 4.4 percent stake and also has a seat on Valeant\u2019s board, has defended the company.Speaking on the cable channel CNBC on Monday, Mr. Ubben called Valeant\u2019s chief executive, J. Michael Pearson, \u201cincredibly driven\u201d and asserted that things were being resolved behind the scenes.For investors in these firms, it is hard to see the silver lining in the headlines about Valeant.Some may recall other Ackman investments that soured. Mr. Ackman\u2019s battle with J.C. Penney resulted in a seat on the board in 2011, which led to the appointment of Ron Johnson, the former head of Apple retail stores. But Mr. Johnson\u2019s attempts to turn around J.C. Penney failed, causing a big loss in 2013. Eventually, Mr. Ackman resigned, selling his stake at an estimated loss of $473 million.Mr. Ackman\u2019s investors, which include pension funds like the Teacher Retirement System of Texas, have their hands tied, up to a point. Like other hedge funds, Pershing Square puts restrictions on how much and how soon investors can withdraw their money. In some instances, it can be as long as two years.With the turmoil surrounding Valeant, it is anyone\u2019s guess whether the company recovers or falls further in a downward spiral.But Mr. Ackman is convinced that Valeant will be a comeback story. And it is virtually certain he will have more to say about it in the weeks to come.\u201cThe most powerful tool available to the manager is communication,\u201d said Ron Geffner, a lawyer for hedge funds at Sadis & Goldberg. \u201cBeing open \u2014 intelligent and thoughtful communication with investors.\u201dAn article on Wednesday about a sharp drop in the value of Valeant Pharmaceutical International shares and the effect on a major investor, Pershing Square Capital Management, misstated the year Pershing Square\u2019s founder, William A. Ackman, first began to buy Valeant shares. It was 2015 \u2014 not 2014, which is the year Mr. Ackman teamed up with the company in a joint takeover effort.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Valeant, Woes Rising, Backs Away From Boldness to Calm Investors", "Date": "2016-03-13", "News": "Supported byNow, in the face of federal investigations and a tumbling stock price, the company has a different pitch \u2014 as an old-fashioned drug company.Valeant executives, struggling to persuade investors that the company is on the right path, have largely discarded audacious talk about big acquisitions and new business models. Instead, they are talking more about investing in research and development and paying down the company\u2019s more than $30 billion in debt.Investors and analysts will be watching closely for any hints about what kind of company Valeant wants to become.\u201cWe haven\u2019t seen a financial statement out of the company in almost five months, and during this period there was a lot of turmoil,\u201d said David Steinberg, an analyst for Jefferies. \u201cSo the company needs to show their employees and the investment community that the wheels haven\u2019t fallen off.\u201dValeant\u2019s stock price has fallen to less than $70 from over $225 six months ago, as investors\u2019 confidence has been shaken by a series of setbacks.Its pricing strategies are being investigated by the federal government. So are the company\u2019s ties to a mail-order pharmacy, Philidor Rx Services, that it used to help get around efforts by insurance companies to substitute cheaper generic alternatives for some of the company\u2019s high-priced products.Given the mounting scrutiny and looming debt, Valeant has little choice, some analysts said, but to pursue a more conventional path.\u201cAll of these foundations have been pulled out from under them,\u201d said Vicki Bryan, a senior analyst with Gimme Credit, a bond research firm. \u201cWe don\u2019t really have a clear idea of who this company is anymore.\u201dThere is little doubt, though, that the growing debt burden will need to be addressed.For years, Valeant took advantage of a cheap credit market to buy companies, running up debt. Now the company owes more than its market valuation of nearly $24 billion.Laurie W. Little, a company spokeswoman, said, \u201cWe remain committed to bringing innovative products to market, reducing our leverage and delivering strong operating performance.\u201dValeant\u2019s business consists of three main areas: eye care through its subsidiary Bausch & Lomb, dermatology products and gastrointestinal drugs.Sales of prescription medicines such as Jublia and the gastrointestinal drug Xifaxan can be reliably tracked through outside sources. But analysts said there was a lack of good third-party information about the performance of the company\u2019s eye care business, complicating any evaluation of the company\u2019s financial situation.Valeant said late last year that it would stop distributing its dermatology drugs through Philidor, after Valeant\u2019s practices came under scrutiny, a move that most likely slowed sales.Late last year, the company announced a deal with Walgreens to offer discounts to patients buying many of its dermatology drugs. There is still little information, Mr. Steinberg said, about how deep the discounts are and what kind of profit the company is making on these products.In a statement to a congressional committee in February, Howard B. Schiller, the acting chief executive of Valeant while Mr. Pearson was on leave, emphasized that the company had taken an unconventional approach.But he said the company\u2019s development pipeline was still among the most productive in the industry, even as he said \u201cwe have consciously avoided\u201d investing in large, open-ended research operations, which he said were often inefficient.And at a recent dermatology conference, some analysts said they were reassured to see that Valeant had a significant presence there, signaling that the company was dedicated to investing in its existing products, even as some dermatologists expressed skepticism about it.Irina R. Koffler, an analyst for Mizuho Securities USA, said she was willing to allow Valeant time to sort out its recent troubles. \u201cI think they\u2019re just in damage control mode still,\u201d she said. \u201cI think they\u2019re still digging through.\u201d\u201cWith every passing day, some folks believe that there\u2019s something horribly wrong,\u201d Mr. Steinberg said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s why we just need them to put their cards on the table, so we can see the numbers.\u201dAdvertisement"}

He recruited wealthy donors. He persuaded a reluctant Republican establishment to sign on.But the strategy was presumptuous, and the follow-through was questionable. Resistance was greater than he had expected, and his ability to win over skeptics was not as great as he and his inner circle believed. In the end, he failed.In many ways, the episode, in 2007, foreshadowed Mr. Rubio\u2019s faltering campaign for the White House.Today, those who counted on Mr. Rubio to emerge as the Republican standard-bearer and usher the party into a new era talk about the same shortcomings that doomed his sweeping tax plan: an overconfidence in the power of his charisma; an emphasis on inspiring messages, rather than nuts-and-bolts tactics; and a lack of finesse at crucial moments.\u201cIt showed how green he was in this process,\u201d said Ed Connor, an antitax activist who was allied with Mr. Rubio during the 2007 tax push. \u201cHe didn\u2019t know how to go about it.\u201dMr. Rubio declined, through a campaign spokesman, to comment on the tax plan or what he had learned from its demise.The idea, as advertised, was simple: replacing Florida\u2019s surging property tax on primary residences with a 2.5-cent per dollar increase in the sales tax, in stages \u2014 a 42 percent rise that would lift the overall sales tax to 8.5 percent. A patchwork of rules and an overheated housing market had created a mess in Florida. Some homeowners, shielded by exemptions, paid exceedingly low property taxes; others, living in the same-size house next door without the same exemptions, paid three times as much. From 2001 to 2007, Floridians\u2019 overall property tax burden doubled, to $30 billion from $15 billion.The Rubio plan would have saved the average homeowner about $2,300 a year.Mr. Rubio, then the speaker of the Florida House of Representatives, had promoted it not just as a tax cut but as something much bigger: a restoration of basic, inalienable rights. Across Florida, in small-town church halls and big-city banquet rooms, Mr. Rubio had soothed homeowners furious about their property taxes with a radical message.Those property taxes, he told them, the foundation of local government in the United States since its birth, were a perversion of the country\u2019s basic values \u2014 and until their abolition, nobody could ever really own his or her home.Mitt Romney asked Republicans to support multiple candidates in remaining primary and caucus states, an admission that a brokered convention is now the most likely route to block Donald J. Trump from the nomination.\u201cHow,\u201d Mr. Rubio asked, \u201ccan we tax the American dream?\u201dThe political conditions looked favorable: Republicans controlled both chambers of the Florida Legislature and the governor\u2019s office.But in interviews, several of Mr. Rubio\u2019s former House deputies and aides were blunt in their assessment of how he managed the property tax legislation, saying he lacked the political skills to outwit his counterparts in the Senate, who forced him to back a far more modest plan that left most of the existing tax system in place.It was a pattern that played out on several high-profile issues during his tenure as speaker: The Rubio-led House offered a bold but unworkable plan; the Senate rejected it; the House grudgingly accepted the Senate\u2019s will.\u201cIt was a mistake for us to take the tax deal,\u201d said former State Representative Will Weatherford, a Republican who went on to become House speaker. \u201cSometimes you have to be willing to say no. And that was an opportunity to say no.\u201d (Like a number of Mr. Rubio\u2019s former colleagues and deputies, Mr. Weatherford, who backed Mr. Rubio for the Senate, supported former Gov. Jeb Bush\u2019s campaign for president before he left the race.)By the end of 2007, Mr. Rubio acknowledged that the compromise was insufficient when he traveled across Florida encouraging citizens to sign a petition that would put yet another attempt to cut property taxes on the ballot for voters. He was, in effect, encouraging Floridians to circumvent the legislative body he oversaw. But that effort, too, ultimately failed.His frustration was palpable. \u201cThis was a very big idea,\u201d said Dan Gelber, the House Democratic minority leader at the time. \u201cHe would have been remembered for it for a very long time.\u201dFrom the start of his speakership at the improbably young age of 34, big ideas were Mr. Rubio\u2019s calling card. He traveled the state collecting them, from citizens and advocates and lawmakers, compiling the results in a book that he handed out to colleagues: \u201c100 Innovative Ideas for Florida\u2019s Future.\u201dSome were far-reaching (a \u201cmodel transportation system\u201d); others were more parochial (changing the date of Florida\u2019s presidential primary). But the 169-page volume instantly set him apart from the local politicians who had held the job before him, and it guaranteed him a profile beyond Tallahassee.Idea No. 96 was eliminating property taxes, a bold step in a state that has no income tax. It was a concept grounded in the conservative fiscal ideology of Arthur Laffer, the former Reagan administration economist, whose firm advised Mr. Rubio\u2019s office, and was blessed by Grover Norquist, the high priest of Republican tax-cutting.Lawmakers called the proposed transition \u201cthe Swap\u201d (exchanging property tax for a sales tax), but over all, they predicted, taxes would decline, potentially by billions of dollars, leaving government with less money to operate. For the conservative Mr. Rubio, those were two salutary, interwoven outcomes.But the Swap included real risks: It required lawmakers to raise one tax even as they wiped out another, opening them to attack; it would require local governments to make budget cuts; and it would do little or nothing for Florida\u2019s lower-income home renters \u2014 in fact, it could cost them more money.According to analysis at the time, a 50-year-old lawyer who owned a home in Miami would save $10,496 a year under the Swap. But a 35-year-old waiter living in a Miami rental would owe $260 more, Florida TaxWatch, a nonpartisan state group, found.\u201cIt is a very regressive tax,\u201d said Dominic M. Calabro, the longtime president of Florida TaxWatch. \u201cThe reality is that transaction-based taxes tend to be disproportionately on those of lower income.\u201dIt is the same critique leveled against Mr. Rubio\u2019s tax plan as a presidential candidate: It disproportionately favors the rich. Going beyond traditional Republican fiscal demands, Mr. Rubio is calling for the elimination of all taxes on interest, dividends and capital gain income from stocks and for a maximum tax rate of 25 percent on business income, down from the current 35 percent.Back in 2007, Mr. Rubio countered that his property tax plan would make it easier for renters to become buyers by eliminating a major cost of homeownership, and that property taxes themselves were regressive. \u201cYour property tax,\u201d he argued at the time, \u201cnever adjusts. It doesn\u2019t care if your spouse got sick last year, and you had to pay through your savings. Your property tax is your property tax, and your choice is you pay it or you lose your property.\u201dHe threw himself into the public relations and personal persuasion required to advance the legislation. Internal memos from his team talked up the benefits (\u201cImagine a Florida with NO income tax and NO property tax\u201d) and the advice from ordinary constituents. (\u201cThis is NOT Tallahassee making policy mandates from \u2018on high.\u2019 \u201d)But as was typical, Mr. Rubio largely outsourced the corralling of votes to his deputies, having long ago distanced himself from the cajoling and coercive side of lawmaking. It was not in his comfort zone, a fact he did little to hide.\u201cHe stayed above the fray \u2014 sometimes very far above it,\u201d said Mr. Gelber, the House minority leader.On his path to the speakership, Mr. Rubio had been asked to serve as House majority leader, a combative, vote-herding post that he feared would create too many enemies. So he persuaded Johnnie Byrd, then the speaker, to restructure the job to focus on communication, not arm-twisting, Mr. Rubio wrote in his book, \u201cAn American Son.\u201dThe softer-edged approach worked in the conservative-leaning House, where Mr. Rubio wielded immense influence over the lives of the young Republicans, from their committee assignments to their parking spots. In April 2007, it overwhelmingly passed Mr. Rubio\u2019s property tax proposal.The smaller, sober, more moderate Senate, however, was immune to Mr. Rubio\u2019s charms. \u201cHe was not popular with us,\u201d said Victor D. Crist, a Republican state senator at the time. They viewed him, he said, \u201cas a big show dog.\u201dAccording to the Associated Press, Donald J. Trump and Hillary Clinton have each won enough delegates to claim their party\u2019s nomination for president.The Senate\u2019s rejection of his tax swap was total: The chamber refused to even debate it. Privately, senators called it reckless and unworkable. Publicly, they ran out the clock on the 2007 legislative session, consigning it to death.Mr. Rubio pushed the Legislature into a special session, wagering that mounting public pressure to offer property tax relief would force the Senate\u2019s hand. Poll after poll showed public outrage over property taxes but reservations about the Swap. In a special session dedicated to a single issue, however, Mr. Rubio had no bargaining power: There was nothing he could hold over the Senate\u2019s head \u2014 no budget bill or infrastructure project it needed from him. After tense discussions with his House members, Mr. Rubio abandoned the Swap.Many House Republicans were furious with him. \u201cThey had put their re-election at risk only to see our plan abandoned,\u201d he later wrote. \u201cSome of the staff thought we were showing weakness by caving under pressure.\u201dAs negotiations dragged on, that suspicion soon re-emerged. The House kept signing on to less ambitious deals. By the fall of 2007, the Senate gave the House a final offer: a plan favored by Gov. Charlie Crist that doubled property tax exemptions. It was the opposite of the systemic, visionary change Mr. Rubio wanted. But it had the votes to pass.A group of House Republicans urged Mr. Rubio to fight on \u2014 to walk away from negotiations and even send his members home in protest to draw out concessions from the Senate. It was the kind of dramatic tactic the Senate had used on the House.Mr. Rubio accepted the deal instead. Something was better than nothing, he said.\u201cThere were a number of us who wanted to hold out for a better deal,\u201d said Ellyn Bogdanoff, the Republican House whip during Mr. Rubio\u2019s time as speaker.Looking back, Ms. Bogdanoff said, she understands his capitulation.\u201cMarco\u2019s idea about the tax swap was a hard sell; it probably should have taken three years,\u201d she said. \u201cBut he basically only had a year to get it done. It was not enough time.\u201dMr. Rubio, in his book, conceded that his timing was poor. He should have started earlier, he said, building greater public support that could have overcome resistance from a Senate and governor who seemed determined to block him.But the idea\u2019s allure has never waned for Mr. Rubio. In his campaign for president, he still speaks admiringly of a \u201cfair tax\u201d or national sales tax that would replace most existing federal taxes.\u201cI\u2019ve always said, if you were to start a country from scratch, that\u2019s what you want to do \u2014 a consumption tax,\u201d Mr. Rubio said in a November radio interview.He then turned a bit wistful. \u201cI actually tried to do that in Florida,\u201d he said, \u201cwith the property tax.\u201dvideoAdvertisement"}

So when Intrexon acquired the British company Oxitec last summer, it attracted little attention as he extended his reach into genetically modified insects.But that move has thrust Mr. Kirk into the forefront of a scramble to control the Zika virus, suspected of causing babies to be born with tiny heads and damaged brains.

And he must overcome qualms about genetic engineering that have prompted opposition to the mosquitoes in the Florida Keys and elsewhere.\u201cWe don\u2019t have experience about living transgenic mosquitoes in the air,\u201d said Dr. Artur Timerman, an infectious disease specialist in Brazil. \u201cWhat will be the midterm or long-term consequences of this?\u201dMr. Kirk is assembling a powerful lobbying effort, employing the law firm Sidley Austin in Washington as well as relying on one of Intrexon\u2019s board members, Cesar Alvarez, the senior chairman of the prominent law firm Greenberg Traurig, and Intrexon\u2019s head of corporate communications, Jack Bobo, who once directed biotechnology trade policy at the State Department.Dr. Luciana Borio, acting chief scientist at the Food and Drug Administration, told a House subcommittee on Wednesday that the agency was \u201cgreatly expediting\u201d Oxitec\u2019s application to test the mosquitoes in the Florida Keys and would issue a draft environmental assessment very soon.But when asked by Representative Morgan Griffith, a Republican who represents the Virginia district in which Mr. Kirk has a farm, Dr. Borio said the F.D.A. would not eliminate the opportunity for the public to then comment on the draft.Randal Kirk\u2019s ventures range from gene therapies and cancer research, to a collection of genetically engineered animals, fruits and insects.\u201cWhat we don\u2019t know right now is where the public stands on this in the setting of Zika,\u201d she said later in the hearing.Selling his mosquitoes to combat an international epidemic could help relieve the pressure Mr. Kirk is under to prove that Intrexon is more than just a collection of odd science projects, and that it can actually make money and fulfill his vision for a new golden age of biotechnology.He considers this time to be a seminal moment in history, one in which the rapidly improving ability to read and write \u2014 and rewrite \u2014 the DNA code of life will make it possible to engineer all manner of organisms to perform specific tasks.\u201cI think this is the most significant industrial vector to occur in history,\u201d he said, comparing it to semiconductor technology that gave rise to smartphones and the web.And the same DNA tools can be applied to numerous areas. Intrexon\u2019s scientists, he says, \u201cdon\u2019t care if they are working on a primary human T cell or an avocado.\u201d Reflecting that vision, Intrexon uses the web domain name dna.com.The engineering of life is often called synthetic biology, a vaguely defined term meant to convey more systematic genetic manipulation than the cutting and pasting of a single gene that gave rise to early biotechnology companies like Amgen and Genentech. At its most distant point, synthetic biologists would sit at a computer designing life forms from scratch, then hit \u201cprint\u201d and have the necessary DNA made to order to be inserted into a cell.Numerous companies are moving into the field, but Intrexon is \u201cliterally the elephant in the room of the synthetic biology industry,\u201d said John Cumbers, chief executive of SynBioBeta, a fledgling trade group.His supporters say that if anyone can pull off such an enterprise it is R. J. Kirk, whom they call an uncommon visionary and quick study, though he lacks formal training in science. When Mr. Kirk tells people, as he often does, that he is just a country lawyer, they know they\u2019re about to get a schooling in biology or business, interlaced with references to history, philosophy and opera.\u201cHe has an astonishing grasp of science,\u201d said Dr. Samuel Broder, a former director of the National Cancer Institute who now runs Intrexon\u2019s health division. Dr. Broder recalled one instance in which it took him a day to understand the intricacies of a genetic disease. Mr. Kirk, after hearing Dr. Broder\u2019s explanation, got it in five minutes.Even the hedge fund manager Thomas U. Barton, who made his mark as a skeptical short-seller, gushes. \u201cHe understands all businesses,\u201d he said.The biggest criticism is that Intrexon keeps announcing new acquisitions and new collaborations, dozens of them in all. Yet no product made with the company\u2019s technology has reached the market, and it is not clear when any will.Intrexon\u2019s shares have fallen to about $37 from near $70 in July, though biotech stocks in general have also fallen. The company\u2019s market value is $4.3 billion, making Mr. Kirk\u2019s 53 percent worth over $2 billion.One big commercial opportunity could be Intrexon\u2019s pilot project to use genetically altered microbes to turn natural gas, which is cheap and abundant, into isobutanol, a liquid fuel that can be used in cars. Investors want to see if Intrexon\u2019s partner, the energy giant Dominion, commits to building a commercial plant, which Mr. Kirk hopes could happen as early as this year.And the Oxitec mosquitoes, while not something Intrexon developed itself, offer a bonus that Mr. Kirk could not have predicted. The mosquitoes were developed mainly to fight dengue fever, and that alone, Mr. Kirk said, made it worthwhile to pay about $160 million for Oxitec.But because Zika is spread by the same type of mosquito, the Oxitec insects, which contain a lethality gene \u2014 can be used. When the male mosquitoes are released to mate with wild females, the offspring die before reaching adulthood.Intrexon is now building a factory in Piracicaba to produce 60 million male mosquitoes a week, enough to protect at least 300,000 people, and Mr. Kirk believes production could be increased to cover entire cities or countries.Costs may vary, depending on the concentration of mosquitoes, Mr. Kirk said. At $7.50 a person, which Technology Review magazine reported would be the price in Piracicaba, protecting a city of one million people would cost $7.5 million a year.But some experts say it will take a lot of time and money to scale up, and that it is not clear if the technique reduces disease transmission.And there are other new competing techniques for mosquito control that do not involve genetic engineering and therefore may have a quicker acceptance. One, pushed by the International Atomic Energy Agency, sterilizes lab mosquitoes with radiation so they can\u2019t reproduce when they are released.Mr. Kirk dismissed concerns about the Oxitec mosquitoes. They contain a few well-characterized genetic changes, he said, while radiation produces \u201cmillions of unknown mutations.\u201d Regulators giving sterilized mosquitoes a lower hurdle is tantamount to \u201cgiving an award for ignorance,\u201d he said.In asserting that opposition to genetic engineering was \u201cmostly born of fear based on lack of knowledge,\u201d Mr. Kirk contended that synthetic biology was \u201cnot optional\u201d if society wanted to maintain its living standards. If that sounds like something Monsanto, the leader in biotech crops might say, it could be because Mr. Kirk recruited Robert B. Shapiro, former chief executive of Monsanto, to be Intrexon\u2019s lead outside director.Mr. Kirk\u2019s progression to biotech mogul was almost by chance. An Air Force brat who grew up in various states, He said he spent some of his teenage years playing guitar in clubs but grew disenchanted with the prospect of a musician\u2019s life.After studying business at Radford University, he embarked on his first venture, a television station in rural Virginia, while still in law school. He eventually gave up on that but not before moving to tiny Bland, Va., where he was the town\u2019s only lawyer. The town\u2019s only pharmacist, John Gregory, enlisted him in 1983 to start a drug distribution business, General Injectables and Vaccines. It was sold for $65 million in late 1998.Mr. Kirk\u2019s biggest score was New River Pharmaceuticals, which was developing a stimulant to treat attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder that was supposed to be less susceptible to abuse than existing products. While regulators ultimately deemed the drug no less prone to abuse than other products, Shire acquired New River for $2.6 billion in 2007 and made the product, Vyvanse, the successor to Adderall XR, which was losing patent protection. Mr. Kirk, who owned about half of New River, became a billionaire.A similar pattern occurred with Clinical Data, which was trying to develop a genetic test to predict which patients would be most likely to benefit from the company\u2019s experimental antidepressant. The genetic testing did not work but the antidepressant was approved anyway, and Clinical Data was acquired by Forest Laboratories for $1.2 billion.\u201cI would never bet against R. J. Kirk,\u201d said Fred Koller, a former Intrexon executive. \u201cIt\u2019s not necessarily the starting point that is successful, but he always gets there.\u201dNamed for parts of genes called introns and exons, Intrexon was founded in 1998 by Thomas D. Reed and his wife, Jackie, to supply DNA constructs for research with genetically engineered mice. The company moved in 2004 to Blacksburg, Va., to take advantage of economic incentives and landed in the orbit of Mr. Kirk\u2019s investment firm, Third Security. Mr. Kirk envisioned applications for the technology far beyond mice, investing $300 million and assuming control of the company. He took Intrexon public in 2013.\u201cMy impression of R. J. has pretty much stayed one of perpetual awe,\u201d said Dr. Reed, who is Intrexon\u2019s chief science officer. \u201cI joke that he is a mix of Leonard Cohen and Prince,\u201d he said, combining a deep soulful understanding of the world with a risk-taking flamboyance.Mr. Kirk, who once had a ponytail and still wears Birkenstocks and collarless shirts even to some formal business meetings, composes electronic music. Every year at Christmastime he sends his executives and hundreds of other people copies of a book he deems interesting. Last year\u2019s was \u201cThe Railway Journey: The Industrialization of Time and Space in the 19th Century,\u201d by the German cultural historian Wolfgang Schivelbusch.Married and divorced three times, Mr. Kirk has four children ranging in age from 6 to the early 40s. The oldest, Julian, works for his father\u2019s investment firm, Third Security.While Oxitec is nominally headquartered in Germantown, Md., Mr. Kirk spends most of his time in West Palm Beach. His home, on a narrow stretch of land, has property extending from the Atlantic Ocean to the Intracoastal Waterway. He also keeps a residence in the Four Seasons Hotel in San Francisco and owns a 7,200-acre cattle farm near Radford, Va., where he used to raise falcons, hawks, owls and eagles, tramping through the woods to roust squirrels and rabbits that the birds would eat.\u201cYou are mutual predators, you are partners in the hunt,\u201d said Mr. Kirk. \u201cThe thrilling part, really, is the opportunity to enter into a relationship on the animal\u2019s terms, on terms the bird understands.\u201dNow he\u2019s too busy, he says, running Intrexon, which has grown to about 750 employees and has acquired a lot of basic technology beyond UltraVector.The company lost $84.5 million on revenue of $173.6 million for last year. Half the revenues came from an established business that Intrexon acquired \u2014 Trans Ova Genetics, which sells embryos and other products for cattle breeding.Much of the remaining revenue comes from its partnerships with companies who pay to use its technology. For instance, Fibrocell is developing a gene therapy for a rare genetic skin disease and OvaScience is researching a way for women to undergo in vitro fertilization without needing hormone shots.Most of these ventures involve smaller companies in which Mr. Kirk or Intrexon now owns stakes.Its most important collaboration is probably with Ziopharm Oncology, a cancer drug company.One project involves gene therapy to treat cancer. It uses a \u201cgene switch\u201d from Intrexon that acts like a light dimmer, allowing production of an immune-boosting protein inside the body to be decreased if needed to avoid side effects.An Intrexon competitor with similar broad scope is Synthetic Genomics, which is also controlled by a wealthy, visionary entrepreneur, the genome scientist J. Craig Venter.Perhaps tougher competition will come from more focused companies.For example, Intrexon and Ziopharm are behind more specialized companies in engineering cancer patients\u2019 immune system cells so they can better attack tumors. One of those specialized companies, Juno Therapeutics, has a market value almost as high as Intrexon\u2019s.\u201cWe have multiple projects right now, any of which should be worth more than our total market cap,\u201d said Mr. Kirk, somewhat in frustration.If anything in Intrexon\u2019s pipeline works, say perhaps the mosquitoes, the company\u2019s value could climb sharply. Mr. Kirk vowed to make that happen.\u201cThis is my last company,\u201d he said. \u201cI can\u2019t imagine anything else that I will ever see that will be as compelling as Intrexon.\u201dA picture caption last Sunday with an article about the biotechnology evangelist Randal J. Kirk omitted an explanation of the importance of genetically modifying male mosquitoes rather than females to battle Zika and other mosquito-borne diseases. Unlike female mosquitoes, the males do not bite. Thus they cannot transmit the Zika virus; they can only mate with the females and pass on a gene that kills their offspring.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Tenure Voting Could Shift the Balance of Corporate Power", "Date": "2016-03-01", "News": "Supported byDeal ProfessorA great divide exists in the voting power of shareholders in the United States.The majority of American companies have one share, one vote, but more and more companies are going public with a dual-class stock structure. Here, the voting power rests in the hands of the founders or another group of shareholders.It\u2019s time to consider an alternative: \u201ctenure voting,\u201d a system in which shareholders accumulate more votes the longer they hold stock.Dual-class stock, which must be adopted in the initial public offering stage, is all the rage and is not just found at Google and Facebook. Pure Storage, First Data and Square have all gone public with dual-class stock. Last year, some 13.5 percent of I.P.O.s included some type of dual-class stock, according to DealogicThe difference comes down to the value of a vote.In the case of dual-class stock, either your vote is worth nothing or everything. The founders essentially control the company and wield influence more or less with impunity. This insulates the company from shareholder activism and indeed from the other shareholders. The other shareholders, meanwhile, have worthless votes.In the rest of corporate America, shareholders have one vote for every share. This has the same flaws as American democracy. Too often your vote doesn\u2019t count and many shareholders don\u2019t bother to vote. Everyone also has the same kind of voting power, from an index fund that can hold a stock for decades to day traders who care only about the next five minutes.In other words, neither model works in all cases. In addition, this binary world does not reflect an increasingly complicated reality. Today, founders reflexively go about adopting dual-class stock whether it is good or bad for the company. Dual-class stock may work well at Facebook, but whether it does at Fairway Group Holdings, the struggling grocery store chain that appears to be heading for default on its loans, is another story.The one-share, one-vote companies, meanwhile, are vulnerable to being pushed into quick fixes at the expense of the business long term. Activist hedge funds press companies to enact spinoffs, big share buybacks or other financial engineering tricks to generate a pop in the stock price. And then the activists walk away. This can be a real problem.The charge is heatedly disputed by the activists, who contend that they are simply making companies more efficient. They have a point: Activists have successfully overhauled many staid companies like Darden Restaurants, owner of Olive Garden, where the chief executive was accused of spending several months a year serving on other boards while his own business declined.There is, however, a potential middle ground in shareholder voting \u2014 a system that diverts power from founders while allowing companies to reward longer-term shareholders.In tenure voting, more votes are given to shareholders the longer they hold shares. So for example, if you hold shares for three years at the company you will have three votes per share.The award of more votes for a longer holding period is intended to empower those shareholders who stick with the company. They will presumably have a greater stake in the welfare of the company.It can also provide a counterweight in a dual-class setup. The founders may still have a larger voting bloc, but the power held by long-term institutional investors would grow over time. That would allow some measured shareholder activism, while limiting founder power.The beauty of tenure voting is that it is devised to address short-termism while rewarding all shareholders. Blockchain technology can make it easier to track ownership of everyone\u2019s shares to ensure they are given the right number of votes. (Blockchain technology, which is used by Bitcoin, would create a public ledger of all transactions.)Will long-term shareholders value their new voting power? It is possible that such shareholders may become like sheep, never complaining and never trying to influence the company. They will hold and hold and sell only when the news is very bad.Still, there are some indications that shareholders value the power to vote: Google\u2019s \u201cno vote\u201d shares, for example, trade at a small discount to its one-vote shares.Tenure voting is not a cure-all, to be sure. It may turn out that one share, one vote is best and we should simply reward whoever has the most shares.Yet American companies are in a straitjacket because of the current Wall Street obsession on short-term methods and results. They dare not give shareholders any more voting power if they can help it. Otherwise, though, there are no checks on founders and management.A middle path \u2014 tenure voting \u2014 seems worth trying.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Ann Patchett\u2019s Nashville Bookstore Hits the Road, With Dogs in Tow", "Date": "2016-03-24", "News": "Supported by7 PhotosNashville\u2019s newest bookstore is an old van.The bright blue bookmobile, which hit the road this week, is a roving offshoot of Parnassus Books, a popular independent bookstore. It will roam around town, stopping at food truck rallies, farmers\u2019 markets and outside restaurants.The arrival of a bookstore on wheels is a fitting evolution for Parnassus, which is co-owned by Karen Hayes and the novelist Ann Patchett. The store\u2019s name comes from Christopher Morley\u2019s 1917 novel \u201cParnassus on Wheels,\u201d about a middle-aged woman who travels around selling books out of a horse-drawn van.Since Parnassus opened in 2011, Ms. Hayes has wanted a traveling bookstore of her own. She looked at taco trucks and ice cream trucks and felt envious of their freedom to take business wherever people gathered, she said.\u201cA bookmobile made so much sense, because food trucks work so well in this town,\u201d Ms. Hayes said by telephone. \u201cIt\u2019s a great way to get our name out there, too. It\u2019s a rolling advertisement.\u201dMs. Hayes found the van on eBay last spring, and bought it for $10,000 from a library in Georgia. The van was already outfitted with angled shelves, which keep the books from flying off, but still needed $20,000 worth of work.It is a logical and efficient way for a small bookstore to expand its footprint, especially as big chains have shuttered locations, leaving a vacuum for enterprising independent stores to fill. A handful of independent stores around the country have taken the trade on the road, in an effort to stir up business and bring books to neighborhoods and suburbs without a bookstore. Little Shop of Stories, an independent store in Decatur, Ga., used a grant from the author James Patterson to turn a used school bus into a mobile bookstore. Fifth Dimension Books, a bookmobile in Austin, Tex., stocks a rotating selection of science fiction and fantasy books from its collection of 100,000 volumes.Bookmobiles are not about to become as prevalent as food trucks. But their arrival in Nashville and other cities offers another encouraging sign that independent stores are thriving again, after years of decline. Sales at bookstores rose 2.5 percent in 2015 over the previous year, to $11.17 billion, for the first annual increase since 2007, according to the United States Census Bureau.Dozens of small bookstores across the country are opening multiple locations, expanding into mini chains. Books Inc., a San Francisco Bay Area independent store, now has 11 locations. Third Place Books in Seattle will soon open a new store, its third. Greenlight Bookstore, a prominent independent store in Fort Greene, Brooklyn, is opening a second Brooklyn store in Prospect-Lefferts Gardens.In 2015, the American Booksellers Association counted 1,712 member stores in 2,227 locations, a big jump from 2009, when the group had 1,401 stores in 1,651 locations.\u201cThe trend is unmistakable, and we see it not only continuing but growing,\u201d said Oren Teicher, the ABA\u2019s chief executive.Parnassus is expanding too. It will double in size, adding 2,500 square feet of retail space, when it takes over a recently vacated storefront next door. Its owners considered looking for a second location, but decided the book van would be a better way to expand the store\u2019s geographic range and customer base.The van packs around 1,000 books, mostly new releases and best sellers \u2014 a small fraction of Parnassus\u2019s stock of 20,000 books. Its owners have managed to make the cramped space bright and inviting: customers can walk the narrow aisles between the shelves, and can linger and sample books on one of the padded blue benches.\u201cOne of my hopes is that we\u2019ll be able go into some of the outlying suburbs and cities that don\u2019t necessarily have a bookstore,\u201d said Grace Wright, a Parnassus bookseller who will manage the bookmobile. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing like a good bookstore.\u201dAnother bonus: the physical bookstore has four resident dogs \u2014 Opie, Belle, Mary Todd Lincoln, and Bear \u2014 who love riding around town, Ms. Wright said.\u201cThey seem to have fun in the bus,\u201d she said.An earlier version of a home page headline about this article misspelled the surname of the author behind the Nashville bookmobile initiative.

{"Headline": "In the Bizarro World of Negative Interest Rates, Saving Will Cost You", "Date": "2016-03-05", "News": "Supported byStrategiesHere\u2019s a proposition for you: Hand over your money. I\u2019ll skim some off the top, hold it for a while and return whatever is left in a year or two.Until a few years ago, that\u2019s the kind of offer a gangster might have made. In the world as we\u2019ve known it, if you lend someone your cash you expect to receive something \u2014 typically, interest \u2014 in return.But something radically different is afoot today. It\u2019s called negative interest \u2014 and it is an inversion of the traditional relationship between lenders and borrowers.\u201cIt\u2019s all upside down,\u201d said Kathy A. Jones, chief fixed-income strategist at Charles Schwab. \u201cNegative interest is hard to even think about. Our whole financial system is built the other way, on positive interest rates. This is mind-boggling.\u201dThe central banks have been going negative to stimulate their relatively weak regional economies and raise inflation levels, which have been perilously low. They hope negative rates will accomplish these goals in three ways. First, the central banks want commercial banks to lend more money at very low interest rates. Second, they want commercial bank customers to borrow more, spend more and save less.There is a third reason, which central bankers rarely enunciate in public: Negative interest rates tend to drive down the value of a country\u2019s currency, making its exports cheaper and more competitive in global markets.In the United States, Federal Reserve officials say they might use negative interest rates in a future crisis, but they don\u2019t expect to install them here anytime soon. Nonetheless, global markets are tightly linked, and negative rates in Europe and Asia are already influencing financial markets here, in that way affecting the lives of ordinary people.The effects have been mixed: Negative rates on foreign debt have helped keep a wide range of interest rates in the United States unusually low, which translates into good deals for borrowers and bad for ones for lenders, including major banks, whose profit margins have been compressed. For older people trying to live on their bond investments, low rates result in paltry income and painful choices.The unusual conditions defined by negative interest rates also complicate matters for the Federal Reserve, which has begun to raise short-term rates in the United States, only to see longer-term rates decline. That unexpected development is occurring partly because below-zero rates in European and Japanese bond markets have created greater demand for American bonds, raising their prices and driving down yields, which move in an opposite direction. Negative rates have not been common for very long and their consequences aren\u2019t entirely understood.Still, grasping the basics of how negative rates work and how they may be affecting the United States is important for anyone with money in the markets.Negative rates appeared during the global financial crisis in 2008, when yields on some United States Treasury bills fell below zero for brief periods. That happened because so many panicky people wanted to buy Treasuries that their prices soared and their yields dropped into negative territory. In essence, investors were willing to lose a small amount of principal in exchange for the safety. Those negative interest rates were a sign that the financial world was in trouble.Today\u2019s negative rates are not a short-term market anomaly. To the contrary, central banks in Europe and Asia have made negative interest rates part of their official tool kit. The European Central Bank; the central banks of Switzerland, Sweden and Denmark; and, last month, the Japanese central bank have all deliberately set at least some short-term rates below zero \u2014 effectively penalizing commercial banks for depositing funds with them, and giving them a strong incentive to move their money elsewhere.Negative rates abroad have caused another problem for the United States, and, perhaps, created an opportunity.They make it difficult to determine why interest rates in the United States are so low \u2014 much lower than would be expected if the American economy were truly healed from the last recession. Those low rates are a bit of a puzzle given the Fed\u2019s stated intention of continuing to raise short-term rates.Jim Paulsen, chief investment strategist for Wells Capital Management, said in an interview that while these risks were real, barring an unforeseen shock, it was probable that the American economy would continue to strengthen. And if that happens, current American interest rates \u2014 particularly those for inflation-indexed bonds called TIPS \u2014 have been set low. TIPS may be a good investment now because their pricing assumes that the inflation rate will be only about 1.4 percent a year for the next five years \u2014 and, if an economic recovery is in place, inflation is bound to move higher than that, giving investors a tidy profit.A riskier bet could be made with investments in the domestic stock market, which would be likely to rebound significantly if it turned out that despite negative rates abroad, the economy was robust in the United States, he said. \u201cWe would see a rally in a range of risk assets,\u201d he said. \u201cThere would be some real money to be made.\u201d The possibility of significant losses was high, too, he said.Conservative, risk-averse investors find themselves in a hard place. As long as interest rates remain negative for the bonds of major countries like Germany and Japan, it will be difficult for American bond yields to rise much. The safest investments, like 10-year Treasury notes, are providing extraordinarily low yields \u2014 only about 1.9 percent. Junk bonds, with higher yields, are risky when the economy is under stress, Ms. Jones of Schwab says. \u201cWe\u2019re pointing our clients toward a middle ground \u2014 investment-grade corporate bonds,\u201d she said. They provide a modicum of safety and somewhat better yields than government bonds do.That\u2019s not a happy situation. But in some respects it is an upside-down world. Sometimes the best you can do is hold on to your money.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "London Stock Exchange and Deutsche B\u00f6rse Agree on Merger", "Date": "2016-03-16", "News": "Supported byLONDON \u2014 The London Stock Exchange Group and the Deutsche B\u00f6rse said on Wednesday that they had agreed to merge in an all-stock deal that they hoped would create a European champion in a rapidly consolidating industry.The transaction would unite two of the biggest European exchange operators and would create one better able to compete globally for stock listings, as a provider of clearing services and a purveyor of market data.\u201cThe combined group will be well placed to adapt to industry and regulatory dynamics and able to compete globally,\u201d Carsten Kengeter, the Deutsche B\u00f6rse chief executive, said on Wednesday. \u201cThe combination enables Europe to maintain and enhance its capital markets infrastructure long term, invest in state-of-the-art infrastructure and build global connectivity.\u201dYet there may be challenges ahead.Intercontinental Exchange, the owner of the New York Stock Exchange, has said it is considering a rival offer for the London Stock Exchange. The CME Group \u2014 which operates the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, the Chicago Board of Trade and the New York Mercantile Exchange \u2014 and Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing could also enter the fray.Any buyer would face regulatory hurdles, which come at a politically charged time for London and Europe, as Britons prepare to vote in June on whether to leave the European Union.The London Stock Exchange and Deutsche B\u00f6rse have said that an exit by Britain would not change the deal but that it could \u201cwell affect the volume or nature\u201d of business carried out by the combined company.In any case, the merger would allow London, which has served as a financial gateway to Europe, to maintain economic ties to the Continent. The combined company would be based in Britain and would have headquarters in London and Frankfurt, the home of the Deutsche B\u00f6rse.Mr. Kengeter, who was named Deutsche B\u00f6rse\u2019s chief executive in 2015, would run the combined company, and after completion of the merger, Xavier Rolet would step down as chief executive of the London Stock Exchange and serve as an adviser for up to one year.A former Goldman Sachs banker, Mr. Kengeter, 48, served as co-chief and later chairman and chief of the Swiss company UBS\u2019s investment bank from 2009 to 2012. He also ran UBS\u2019s noncore division before leaving in 2013.The board of the combined company would have equal representation from both exchanges, and Donald Brydon, the London Stock Exchange chairman, would be its chairman.Shares of the London Stock Exchange, which have surged in the weeks since the companies confirmed they were in talks, closed down 0.6 percent on Wednesday, while shares of Deutsche B\u00f6rse ended virtually unchanged.Four years ago, Deutsche B\u00f6rse abandoned plans to merge with the parent of the New York Stock Exchange because European antitrust regulators had threatened to block the deal. This is the third attempt to combine the London Stock Exchange and the Deutsche B\u00f6rse since 2000.\u201cThe real issue is achieving scale to compete on a global scale against already consolidated opponents,\u201d said John Colley, a professor at Warwick Business School, in Britain. \u201cEurope needs a strong champion to compete against the U.S. exchanges and Hong Kong.\u201dUnder the terms of the deal with Deutsche B\u00f6rse, shareholders in the London Stock Exchange would receive 0.4421 of a new share in the combined company for every share of the London Stock Exchange. Their counterparts at Deutsche B\u00f6rse would receive one share of the new company for each of their shares, giving them a 54.4 percent stake in the united company.The transaction is expected to close by the end of this year or during the first quarter of 2017.The London Stock Exchange was advised by Barclays, Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase, Robey Warshaw, RBC Capital Markets, Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale and UBS. Deutsche B\u00f6rse was advised by Bank of America Merrill Lynch, Deutsche Bank, HSBC and Perella Weinberg Partners.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Why We Think We\u2019re Better Investors Than We Are", "Date": "2016-03-25", "News": "Supported bySpecial SectionFrom their earliest days, the loosely confederated research efforts that came to be known as behavioral economics spawned a large quantity of studies centered on securities investment. This was not because the field\u2019s pioneers were especially interested in stocks and bonds, nor was the early research commonly underwritten by financial services firms.Rather, the hive of activity that evolved into its own field \u2014 behavioral finance \u2014 reflected that investment markets provide unusually robust data sets for analyzing \u201cjudgment under uncertainty\u201d (the title of a seminal textbook co-edited by the winner of a Nobel in economic science, the behavioral economist Daniel Kahneman) and \u201cdecision under risk\u201d (a phrase in the subtitle of his Nobel-winning \u201cProspect Theory\u201d). Every day, global securities markets provide researchers with billions of data points for understanding how people make choices when resources are at stake and the outcome is unknown.Which, if you think about it, is a fair description of most decisions. Indeed, the majority of cognitive biases and shortcuts that influence everyday judgment and choice have analogues in investment behavior. Consider the \u201csunk cost fallacy,\u201d a primary reason an unhappy lawyer might struggle to leave the law and an unsuccessful investor might balk at selling money-losing shares.Both people are highly likely to obsess over their sunk cost \u2014 law school tuition and time served for the lawyer, the original investment amount for the stock picker \u2014 in a nonconscious desire to justify their earlier decisions. Both are also very likely to fall prey to \u201closs aversion,\u201d a key tenet of Prospect Theory, which tells us that humans typically respond to the loss of resources \u2014 be it time, effort, emotion, material goods or their proxy, i.e., money \u2014 more strongly than they react to a similar gain.What differentiates the typical lawyer and average investor, however, is their justification for engaging in their activity. Lawyers are trained to do what they do, while the majority of investors are not. Ask a random player in a law firm\u2019s basketball league whether he or she could compete with LeBron James, and the most common response will be laughter. Yet many of those lawyers would willingly compete with the billionaire investor Warren E. Buffett.Despite the spectacular growth of index funds \u2014 passive investment vehicles that track market averages and minimize transaction costs \u2014 millions of amateur investors continue to actively buy and sell securities regularly. This despite overwhelming evidence that even professional investors are no more likely to beat the market than monkeys throwing darts at securities listings.Money managers, at least, are paid to make investment bets. But why do amateurs believe they can outperform the professionals \u2014 or even identify those pros who will outperform? (Performance of individual mutual funds cannot be predicted with any greater degree of accuracy than individual stocks or bonds.) Many biases and cognitive errors contribute to this costly behavior, but a few deserve mention.Consider this pair of challenges:Give high and low estimates for the average weight of an empty Boeing 747, picking numbers far enough apart to be 90 percent certain that the true answer falls somewhere in between. Now, give high and low estimates for the diameter of the moon in miles. Again, choose numbers far enough apart to be 90 percent certain that the true answer falls somewhere in between.Come up with a range for each so you could confidently bet $9 against the prospect of winning $1.As it happens, an empty 747 weighs nearly 400,000 pounds, and the diameter of the moon is roughly 2,200 miles. But research involving these and similar problems suggests that these answers do not fall within your high and low estimates. That\u2019s because most people do not realize how little they know about the subjects or how difficult it is to bracket estimates as requested.Instead, people come up with what they believe to be logical estimates of the plane\u2019s weight and moon\u2019s diameter, then they adjust from those figures to arrive at their brackets. But unless you work for Boeing or NASA, your initial estimates are probably going to be wildly off the mark, so the brackets should be wider they probably are \u2014 say, from one pound to one billion pounds for the plane\u2019s weight and from one mile to a billion miles for the lunar diameter. That most people do not default to such broad ranges reflects a trait that behavioral economists call overconfidence. This is not run-of-the-mill arrogance, but rather the tendency we all have to overrate our abilities, knowledge and skill, at whatever level we might place them.Studies have revealed significant overconfidence in the judgments of scientists, lawyers, engineers, doctors and those in other professions. The University of Pennsylvania psychologists Philip Tetlock and Barbara Mellers collected more than 25,000 forecasts from people whose job it was to anticipate how the future would unfold. All demonstrated remarkable overconfidence. When they were 80 percent sure of their predictions, they were correct less than 60 percent of the time.Another example is shown in a 2012 study from the State Street Center for Applied Research, in which investors were asked about their financial acumen.\u201cNearly two-thirds rated their financial sophistication as advanced,\u201d said Mirtha Kastrapeli, a senior research analyst at State Street. \u201cThis seemed a little optimistic, so in our 2014 study, The Folklore of Finance, we ran a financial literacy exam. The average score was just 61 percent, barely a passing grade. This disconnect between actual and perceived financial sophistication, she explains, is evidence of how widespread the overconfidence bias is.\u201dOverconfidence is hard-wired into our brains because it is useful. Many of our mental biases evolved because they make us cautious or they otherwise protect us from harm, but overconfidence is part of a suite of cognitive traits that serve to propel us forward. Just as no one would think to write a children\u2019s book about a train engine that repeats, \u201cI think I can\u2019t,\u201d few explorers would venture into the wild \u2014 and few entrepreneurs would start new businesses \u2014 unless they believed that they would succeed in the face of long odds.A bias toward optimism helps to explain why many, if not most, smokers are confident that they will not develop cancer; why many drivers are certain that their texting will not lead to an accident; and why many investors believe they can outperform the market. \u201cWe are evolutionarily programmed to believe that things will work out,\u201d said David Hirshleifer, a finance professor at the University of California, Irvine.More confounding than the existence of investor overconfidence is its persistence: As markets teach us costly lessons, we should grow humble. But the fact that many do not reflects what Professor Hirshleifer describes as self-enhancing psychological processes. One of the biggest esteem builders is hindsight bias, or the tendency to rewrite our own history to make ourselves look good. In landmark experiments by the psychologist Baruch Fischhoff, then at Hebrew University, study participants were directed to make predictions about real-life events, then were asked periodically to recall the events and their predictions after the fact. His findings? Participants consistently misremembered their forecasts, in ways that made them look smarter. Too often we look back not in anger but in awe, at least of our own capacities.Of course, many people easily recall failures, which suggests that hindsight bias is not all that powerful. But even when our failures remain vivid memories, we remember them in a way that neutralizes their ability to inhibit our present-day decisions. When events unfold that confirm our thoughts or deeds, we attribute that happy outcome to our skills, knowledge or intuition. But when life proves our actions or beliefs to have been wrong, we blame outside causes over which we had no control \u2014 and thus maintain our faith in ourselves. The Harvard psychologist Ellen Langer describes the phenomenon as, \u201cHeads I win, tails it\u2019s chance.\u201dFinally, even if investors are not rewriting history or blaming outside forces, they are still highly likely to miss signs of their own incompetence. The culprit is confirmation bias, which leads us to give too much weight to information that supports existing beliefs and discount that which does not. And those existing beliefs need not be long held, explains Thomas Gilovich, a Cornell University psychology professor. \u201cOnce one entertains the idea that \u2018this seems like a good investment,\u2019 the processing of relevant information narrows considerably \u2014 and in a direction that leads to overconfidence.\u201dProfessor Gilovich, an author of \u201cThe Wisest One in the Room: How You Can Benefit from Social Psychology\u2019s Most Powerful Insights,\u201d warns that overcoming overconfidence is difficult. Common prescriptions include a meaningful period of diligently logging one\u2019s investment ideas, to keep track of hits and misses. Note the emphasis on ideas and not just actions. More often than not, the aforementioned biases lead us to recall investments that soared that we thought to make but did not \u2014 and to forget those that plummeted.Professor Hirshleifer advises a strategy of self-distancing, or considering the opposite side of any transaction before making it.Such a strategy was also recommended by Professor Gilovich, with a caveat. \u201cSomething more specific and guided is likely to be more effective, like conducting a \u2018pre-mortem,\u2019 \u201d he said. \u201cThe idea is to suppose that your idea bombed. What would you be saying to yourself right now about how or why you should have foreseen it?\u201dGary Belsky is an author of \u201cWhy Smart People Make Big Money Mistakes and How to Correct Them: Lessons From the Life-Changing Science of Behavioral Economics.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Fighting a Fake Dating Profile, Together", "Date": "2016-03-19", "News": "Supported byVows8 PhotosBrett Barakett and Meaghan Jarensky didn\u2019t find each other on a dating site, but a posting on Match.com \u2014 a blatantly counterfeit one \u2014 nearly broke them up.\u201cThere\u2019s a reason things happen,\u201d said Mr. Barakett, 49, who admitted that he is finally able to look back and laugh about the misunderstanding caused by a meanspirited Match posting about Ms. Jarensky. \u201cWe may just not know it at the time.\u201dHe and Ms. Jarensky met in 2014 at a yoga class that she, then 36, was teaching in Midtown Manhattan. He was a successful money manager from Canada who lived in Greenwich, Conn., to be close to his four children from his marriage. She was a two-time beauty pageant winner, also divorced, who ran her own charity and was open with friends about wanting a big family.They fell quickly and hard for each other, but that December, as he sat in a doctor\u2019s waiting room reviewing email on his phone, Mr. Barakett, who had signed up with Match.com when his marriage was crumbling, was stopped cold when he saw an update from the site pushing a profile of someone who resembled Ms. Jarensky to a T. \u201cEverything but her name,\u201d he said.The profile claimed to be \u201clooking for Mr. Big,\u201d from someone nicknamed 1078YOGI, and had Ms. Jarensky\u2019s photo on it along with other familiar details like her birthday and devotion to yoga. It listed the many ways she expected to be pampered. \u201cYou take me to fancy places,\u201d she wrote. \u201cYou give me expensive gifts. You give me a credit card and let me go on shopping sprees.\u201d The posting also made clear that suitors with children need not apply. \u201cI am not interested in the hassle,\u201d the woman wrote dismissively.He asked himself, could this be the same coolheaded, captivating yoga instructor whom he had been dating giddily since the summer?Reading no further than the intro, he fired off an angry text to Ms. Jarensky, wanting to know, \u201cWhen were you going to tell me you were on Match.com?\u201dShe said she had no idea what he was talking about and insisted that she had never used the site.He was not sure whether to believe his eyes or his heart.Mr. Barakett had prospered as the head of Tremblant Capital Group, a New York money management firm he founded in 2001, eight years out of Harvard Business School. Tremblant specialized in analyzing stocks of consumer product companies that were rolling out new wares. It was a process honed by walking the aisles of retail outlets, talking up managers and seeing how goods were displayed on shelves.By 2008, his firm had amassed a large stake in Green Mountain Coffee Roasters, which by then also owned the company that made the soon-to-be ubiquitous Keurig coffee machines and pods.Noted short-sellers like David Einhorn had pushed the value of Tremblant\u2019s stake down 44 percent. With $82 million at risk, Mr. Barakett had to decide whether to bail, hang on or buy more.The same contrarian streak that eventually led him to pocket millions by bucking the short-sellers and continuing to buy stock as the price tumbled also buoyed him in the life he was fashioning after his divorce in 2013.Rather than abandon Connecticut for the headier singles scene of New York, Mr. Barakett stayed in the dream house he had constructed for his family in the Belle Haven area of Greenwich, on property that was once the home of Thomas J. Watson Jr., chief executive of IBM.Mr. Barakett even managed to find a girlfriend, who lived nearby. But when that relationship also ended in shambles, he blamed himself and decided to abandon his quest for love. \u201cI was done,\u201d he said. \u201cI was never going to go on another date in my life.\u201d He added, \u201cI was going to become a monk.\u201dSitting in his office in July 2014, \u201cI was all stressed out,\u201d Mr. Barakett recalled. He consulted his phone for the nearest yoga class and was directed to one Ms. Jarensky was about to teach.An outdoorsy Jersey girl, she had won the Miss New York USA title in 2005. She then went on to be Mrs. New York America in 2010, snagging the prize for most whimsical costume (dressed in green ruffles intended to evoke an apple tree) at the nationals.Upon meeting her in person, Mr. Barakett said he noticed immediately how \u201cshockingly beautiful\u201d she was but said he forced himself to look away lest he \u201cturn to stone. I just wanted to do my class.\u201dIn Greenwich, he nudges his children to thank coaches after practices and games. In that vein, he said he approached Ms. Jarensky simply to thank her.He was struck by how kind she was to all who buzzed about her, and returned twice more, observing her from afar, before he finally struck up a conversation after the third class. It revolved around gut bacteria, and they continued talking about it as they stepped out onto the sidewalk on 57th Street and Lexington.Wanting to ask her out but feeling like \u201ca knucklehead\u201d about where to take her, he sought emergency advice from his brother Tim, who was amused that his baby brother was doing yoga to \u201cto help manage the stress\u201d after having sworn off women, only to meet the woman of his dreams in the yoga class.\u201cDude,\u201d the brother replied, \u201cjust go to the Museum of Modern Art.\u201dMr. Barakett, meanwhile, could not resist applying some of the same intensity he used on stocks to learn more about her. For instance, he watched her appearance on a special edition of \u201cFear Factor\u201d that featured delegates of the 2005 Miss USA pageant and revealed her grit. The ickiest challenge had her slithering backward in a tank while live worms and dead fish were dumped on her. \u201cShe\u2019s a tough chick mentally,\u201d Mr. Barakett said.Ms. Jarensky, now 37, said that she found him to be \u201cvery quiet, very grounded and he\u2019s consistent. He has a lot of integrity, and I trusted him. He wasn\u2019t playing games. If he wanted to talk to me, he would call me on the phone. We texted. Sometimes, he\u2019d meet me in the neighborhood and we\u2019d walk for 10 minutes so he could see me.\u201dMore polite-enough dates in Manhattan followed before Mr. Barakett invited her to Connecticut. From the train station, he whisked her back to his house. They shared their first kiss in a hallway, after brushing up against each other accidentally. \u201cHe\u2019s not slick,\u201d Ms. Jarensky said appreciatively from the breakfast nook they now share as husband and wife.\u201cThe minute I kissed her, we were a couple,\u201d Mr. Barakett said. It was also the sweetness she showed his children \u2014 topping off a dinner with friends with homemade madeleines, to please his 9-year-old daughter with the same name \u2014 that ultimately made Mr. Barakett accept that she could not have had anything to do with the tasteless Match.com posting.He said he had an inkling whom the culprit was, but he needed proof.Citing customer privacy, Match.com initially refused Ms. Jarensky\u2019s informal request to reveal who set up the profile because she was not the account holder. The person who made the posting \u2014 who was impersonating her \u2014 was. Nor would the Dallas-based company take down the profile right away, even though Ms. Jarensky believed the unlikable profile could cost her clients.She sought relief from State Supreme Court in Manhattan, and obtained the information from Match.com two months later, once the subpoena was granted.As Mr. Barakett suspected, the perpetrator was a former girlfriend. He surmised: \u201cShe was not doing it to get to me.

{"Headline": "China Sought Fed's Crash Notes", "Date": "2016-03-21", "News": "Supported byInside AsiaWASHINGTON \u2014 Confronted with a plunge in its stock markets last year, China\u2019s central bank swiftly reached out to the United States Federal Reserve, asking it to share its playbook from dealing with Wall Street\u2019s \u201cBlack Monday\u201d crash of 1987.The request came in a July 27 email from an official at the People\u2019s Bank of China, the central bank, with a subject line: \u201cYour urgent assistance is greatly appreciated!\u201dIn the email to a senior Fed staffer, the Chinese bank\u2019s New York-based chief representative for the Americas, Song Xiangyan, pointed to the day\u2019s 8.5 percent drop in Chinese stocks and said, \u201cMy Governor would like to draw from your good experience.\u201dIt is not known whether the People\u2019s Bank of China had contacted the Fed to deal with previous incidents of market turmoil. The Chinese central bank and the Fed had no comment when reached by Reuters.In a Reuters analysis last year, Fed insiders, former Fed employees and economists said that there was no official hotline between the Chinese central bank and the Fed, and that the Chinese were often reluctant to engage at international meetings.The Chinese market crash led to steep declines across global financial markets, and within a few hours the Fed sent China\u2019s central bank a trove of publicly available documents detailing the Fed\u2019s actions in 1987. Fed policy makers started their previously scheduled two-day policy meeting the next day and took note of China\u2019s stock sell-off, according the meeting\u2019s minutes. Several policy makers said a Chinese economic slowdown could weigh on America. Financial market contagion from China was one of the reasons cited by the Fed in September when it put off a rate increase that many analysts had expected, a sign of how important China has become both as an industrial powerhouse and as a financial market.The email exchange, which Reuters obtained through a Freedom of Information Act request, shows how alarmed Beijing has become over the deepening financial turmoil and offers a rare insight into one of the least understood major central banks.The exchange also shows that although the two central banks have a collegial relationship, they might not share secrets even during a crisis. \u201cCould you please inform us ASAP about the major measures you took at the time,\u201d Mr. Song asked Steven Kamin, the director of the Fed\u2019s International Finance Division, in the July 27 email.The message registered in Mr. Kamin\u2019s account just after 11 a.m. in Washington. Mr. Kamin quickly replied from his BlackBerry: \u201cWe\u2019ll try to get you something soon.\u201dWhat followed five hours later was a 259-word summary of how the Fed worked to calm markets and prevent a recession after the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index tumbled 20 percent on Oct. 19, 1987.Mr. Kamin also sent notes to guide Chinese officials through the many dozens of pages of Fed transcripts, statements and reports that were attached to the email.All of the attached documents had long been available on the Fed\u2019s website, and it is unclear whether they played a role in shaping Beijing\u2019s actions. Mr. Kamin\u2019s documents detail how the Fed began issuing statements the day after the Black Monday market crash, pledging to supply markets with plenty of cash so they could function. By the time Mr. Song wrote to Mr. Kamin, China had spent more than a month fighting a stock market slide, and many of the actions taken by the People\u2019s Bank of China and other Chinese authorities shared the contours of the Fed\u2019s 1987 game plan.China\u2019s central bank had cut interest rates on June 27 in similar fashion to the Fed\u2019s swift move to ease short-term rates in 1987.Mr. Song told Mr. Kamin that the Chinese central bank was particularly interested in the details of the Fed\u2019s use of repurchase agreements to temporarily inject cash into the American banking system in 1987. The People\u2019s Bank of China had increased cash injections in June and accelerated repurchase agreements in August as stocks continued to slide. The bank also eased policy on Aug. 11 by allowing a 2 percent devaluation in the renminbi. As Mr. Song and Mr. Kamin exchanged messages on July 27 and 28, other Chinese authorities were busy trying to contain the crash. The July 27 plunge in the Shanghai composite index was the biggest one-day fall since 2007. The Chinese market had lost nearly a third of its value over six weeks. China\u2019s securities regulator said on July 27 it was prepared to buy shares to stabilize the stock market and that authorities would deal severely with anyone making \u201cmalicious\u201d bets that stocks would fall.In 1987, the Fed contacted banks directly and encouraged them to meet \u201clegitimate funding needs\u201d of their customers, according to Mr. Kamin\u2019s email to Mr. Song.In addition to its pledges and cajoling, the Fed in 1987 eased collateral restrictions on Wall Street and tried to calm markets by intervening in trading earlier than normal. The United States economy continued to grow until a recession in 1990.The Chinese central bank does not have as free a hand to conduct policy as does the Fed, which answers to Congress but operates independently from the administration. The Chinese central bank\u2019s governor, Zhou Xiaochuan, implements policies ultimately decided by political leaders in Beijing and lacks the authority to lead debate or shed light on decision-making.China\u2019s vice finance minister told Reuters last year that Chinese supervisors needed to learn from countries like the United States.Premier Li Keqiang said last month that China\u2019s regulators did not respond sufficiently but that China had fended off risks to the system. United States central bankers say their relative transparency helps their effectiveness and legitimacy, but open records laws also make Fed officials cautious about their communications, much of which must be made public when requested. Stanley Fischer, the Fed\u2019s current vice chairman, has said that transparency makes it harder for policy makers to have informal discussions. Mr. Kamin pointed out in his email that everything he was sending was publicly available.\u201cI hope this is helpful,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "El Ni\u00f1o Upsets Seasons and Upends Lives Worldwide", "Date": "2016-03-19", "News": "Supported byIn rural villages in Africa and Asia, and in urban neighborhoods in South America, millions of lives have been disrupted by weather linked to the strongest El Ni\u00f1o in a generation.In some parts of the world, the problem has been not enough rain; in others, too much. Downpours were so bad in Paraguay\u2019s capital, Asunci\u00f3n, that shantytowns sprouted along city streets, filled with families displaced by floods. But farmers in India had the opposite problem: Reduced monsoon rains forced them off the land and into day-labor jobs.In South Africa, a drought hit farmers so hard that the country, which a few years ago was exporting corn to Asian markets, now will have to buy millions of tons of it from Brazil and other South American countries.\u201cThey will actually have to import it, which is rare,\u201d said Rogerio Bonifacio, a climate analyst with the World Food Program, a United Nations agency. \u201cThis is a major drought.\u201dAn El Ni\u00f1o occurs on average every two to seven years, when warm Pacific water shifts eastward, creating an immense warm zone in the central and eastern Pacific. This adds heat and moisture to the air, which condenses high in the atmosphere, releasing energy that affects the high-altitude winds known as jet streams that circle the planet. The warmer the ocean, the more energy that can potentially be released.One effect of the energy is that it alters the course of a jet stream. In the Northern Hemisphere, this can bring more winter storms to the southern United States, including Southern California.But adding all that energy to the upper atmosphere can also introduce a ripple in a jet stream that may affect weather halfway around the world. \u201cIt\u2019s like waving a paddle back and forth in the stream and generating planetary-scale atmospheric waves,\u201d said Michael McPhaden, a senior scientist with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.That leads to patterns of precipitation, or lack of it, that can pop up in far-flung regions at different times \u2014 heavy rains in south-central South America from September to January, increased dryness in Central America for much of the year and a reduced summer monsoon in India, among other effects.Because these patterns often recur in different El Ni\u00f1o years, the effects can be predictable. Nonetheless, they can still test the ability of governments and aid agencies to respond.But as the lack, so far, of prolonged rains in Southern California this winter shows, the effects of El Ni\u00f1o can still be difficult to forecast.Dr. Bonifacio noted, for instance, that the Sahel in Africa often suffers drought in El Ni\u00f1o summers, but last year, after a dry June, rains picked up. \u201cFrom July onward, things just flipped over completely,\u201d he said.El Ni\u00f1o does not just affect people. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration said this month that the concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere \u2014 an important climate-change measurement \u2014 had the greatest year-to-year increase in 56 years, and that the rise was partly because of the effect of El Ni\u00f1o-related weather on vegetation. More drought, for example, means less growth of plants that absorb carbon dioxide from the air.Here is a closer look at how El Ni\u00f1o has disrupted life in different parts of the world.MAHOBA DISTRICT, India \u2014 For the first time in his life, Jeevan Lal Yadav has been getting his wheat and vegetables from the market five miles away, rather from than his own farm.Mr. Yadav, 43, has not been able to grow anything this past year on the five acres he cultivates here in the heart of northern India, parts of which are experiencing a severe drought.He is one of millions struggling after a strong El Ni\u00f1o led to reduced rain from the southwest monsoons.Rainfall in 2015 from monsoons, which sweep over most of India from June to September, was 14 percent below the average. The reduction was more than 40 percent in some areas, including India\u2019s most populous state, Uttar Pradesh, where Mr. Yadav lives.Because most Indians are farmers, and a majority rely entirely on the monsoon rains, a blow to the rainy season is devastating, rendering lives barely recognizable.Instead of guarding his annual harvest against wild buffalo, as he has done for as long as he can remember, these days Mr. Yadav sits among a crowd outside the door of the village headman, hoping to get picked for a public works program that pays 161 rupees (about $2.40) a day. His name is called every other day at best, he said.\u201cI\u2019ve never seen something like this,\u201d he said, outside his two-room mud hut in Thurat, a village of several hundred homes surrounded by dried ponds and mostly barren fields that in years past were green with a harvest of wheat and lentils at this time of year. \u201cIt\u2019s all dry. I didn\u2019t even sow the seeds.\u201dThese programs have existed to varying degrees for years in rural India but have been inadequate, said Vineet Kumar, a climate change officer at the Center for Science and Environment, a New Delhi nonprofit organization that studies farmers\u2019 problems. He said Mr. Modi\u2019s plans had the potential to help farmers but would be too late for millions like Mr. Yadav.D. S. Pai, the deputy director general of the long-term monsoon forecasting division at the Indian Meteorological Department, said India predicted the blow to the summer monsoon, which had happened in previous El Ni\u00f1o years. (This El Ni\u00f1o was also linked to heavier-than-normal rainfall last fall in the southern tip of India and Sri Lanka.)Dr. Pai said his department worked with district officials to inform farmers by text message of long-term predictions and warned them about more immediate outbreaks of bad weather.Mr. Kumar, of the nonprofit group, said that though the warnings may be issued from the top, there was not enough coordination in many states and districts for the news to reach farmers on time.And so Pratap Singh, 65, in the Kidhari village, also in the Mahoba district, had not been alerted when, after months of dry weather, rain suddenly arrived in October, soaking the small harvest of wheat he had laid out to dry. The heavy rainfall rotted the 220 pounds of grain, which was only 20 percent of his usual harvest, he said.Now, with no harvest at all, Mr. Singh said, he and his two adult sons are working when they can as day laborers at a brick kiln. The days they are not hired, he said, they just sit around \u201cwhiling away our time \u2014 there\u2019s nothing to do.\u201dMr. Yadav, the farmer working in the government jobs program, said he prayed for water every morning and evening. He does not pray for anything else, he said, because \u201cif you have water, you have everything.\u201d GEETA ANAND AND SUHASINI RAJASUNCI\u00d3N, Paraguay \u2014 The brutal human cost of El Ni\u00f1o is plain to see here in Paraguay\u2019s capital. Downtown plazas and the median strips of thoroughfares are crammed with temporary houses made of plywood, plastic sheets and corrugated steel, thrown together after heavy rains caused the worst flooding in more than three decades.Seated one recent evening beneath black lapacho trees outside the shack that she is calling home for now \u2014 opposite this city\u2019s 19th-century cathedral \u2014 Esther Falc\u00f3n, 32, who runs a kiosk in a slum along the Paraguay River, said she had never experienced rains like those in December.\u201cThe water came so quickly,\u201d Mrs. Falc\u00f3n said, adding that her home flooded up to about shoulder height. \u201cWe didn\u2019t have time to save everything.\u201dThe water has now receded, but Mrs. Falc\u00f3n\u2019s young family cannot return because the usual rains, which forecasters say should come in April, are expected to cause the still-swollen river to surge again.About 145,000 people were forced out of their homes across Paraguay, a nation of 6.5 million, Joaqu\u00edn Roa, the minister for national emergencies, said. About 60,000 people are still displaced in Asunci\u00f3n, he added.\u201cI have to start from zero,\u201d Mrs. Castro said as she cleaned her electric oven and attended to her young grandchildren. \u201cWe wanted to come home,\u201d she added, \u201ceven if it is only to rest for a month,\u201d referring to the probability that she will have to leave again when the rains come in a few weeks.Mr. Roa said the government had planned for the flooding. For instance, he said, stocks of hospital equipment were secured, and schools readied mobile buildings for future victims so children would continue to go to class. The government also prepared an aid response with the military and the police that included work to ensure that trucks with emergency supplies could reach riverside slums.But some people stood defiant. Bernardo Olmedo, 40, who reads water meters for a living, moved his furniture upstairs as his house flooded. Refusing to abandon his home, he instead built a temporary staircase that climbed 13 feet from the street to an upstairs window. During the floods, his daily commute to work involved descending the steps, hopping onto a raft made of wood planks and polystyrene wrapped in plastic, and paddling for five minutes, out of the flood zone.Ms. Villalba said the rain had fallen hard for two consecutive mornings. After the water did not recede, as it usually did, it soon gushed into her home. Like tens of thousands of others, the family fled and built a shack in the median strip of a road beneath a willow tree, using an orange truck tarpaulin for extra protection from the elements.Still, Ms. Villalba admitted that she may soon be left with no option. \u201cIt\u2019s not a safe place anymore,\u201d she said. \u201cNature is changing things.\u201d JONATHAN GILBERTSOWETO, South Africa \u2014 On a recent evening at Esther Thobagale\u2019s modest four-room house in this township outside Johannesburg, she was preparing pap, the traditional cornmeal porridge that is a staple food of low-income families across South Africa.A few days before, Ms. Thobagale, who lives with her daughter and two grandsons, had learned that she was going to have to pay a much higher price for cornmeal \u2014 80 rand (about $5.20) for a two-week supply, up from 50 rand (about $3.25). That\u2019s a barely affordable increase for Ms. Thobagale, an unemployed grandmother who supports the household on a government pension and other income totaling 1,730 rand (about $112) a month.\u201cI\u2019m now forced to cut down on nonessentials, like treats for my grandkids,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m forced to stick to what is important only.\u201dAlthough rainfall amounts have increased in the last few weeks, the government estimates that the soon-to-be-harvested crop will be 27 percent lower than last year\u2019s.A retail price survey by the Bureau for Food and Agricultural Policy at the University of Pretoria found that cornmeal prices had increased by about 19 percent and were expected to rise an additional 10 percent by the end of March. Those were nationwide averages, however; the price of Ms. Thobagale\u2019s cornmeal increased by 60 percent.The World Bank estimates that the drought has pushed 50,000 more South Africans below the poverty line of about $32 a month. But even for those who can afford to pay higher prices, there may not be enough corn to meet demand.Wandile Sihlobo, an economist at the corn farmers\u2019 lobby group Grain SA, said current estimates are that South Africa would be forced to import more than four million tons of corn from Mexico and Brazil and other South American countries to meet the demand.Part of the problem, said Shukri Ahmed, an official with the Food and Agriculture Organization, is that corn yields were down in early 2015, too.\u201cLast year there was a 30 percent decline,\u201d Mr. Ahmed said. \u201cSo there was already some strain in the market.\u201dSouth Africa grows far more corn than any other country in southern Africa, and regularly exports to many of its neighbors. Mr. Ahmed said the 2015 crop decline had wiped out any surplus available for export, putting some of these countries\u2019 populations at risk. \u201cThis is now one of the biggest worries for us,\u201d he said.Mr. Sihlobo said that of the corn that South Africa will import, about 700,000 tons would be sent on to Botswana, Lesotho, Namibia and Swaziland.But other countries in the region have been badly affected by the drought as well, including Zimbabwe, which probably has a shortfall of about 1.3 million tons, Mr. Sihlobo said. \u201cThe question is where is this going to come from,\u201d he said. \u201cThis might put added pressure on South Africa.\u201dThe drought has caused economic hardship for South Africa\u2019s farmers as well. In North West Province, one of several in which the South African government has declared a disaster, Thean Geldenhuys, a corn farmer, said his income was down by 75 percent because of the drought.Mr. Geldenhuys has had to turn away the seasonal workers who come to his farm every year, he said.\u201cIt\u2019s sad because most of these people won\u2019t go away,\u201d he said. \u201cThey are outside my farm every day hoping to be employed. There is simply no work and no money to pay them.\u201d XOLI MOLOIAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "In Yahoo, Another Example of the Buyback Mirage", "Date": "2016-03-25", "News": "Supported byFair GameIt is one of the great investment conundrums of our time: Why do so many stockholders cheer when a company announces that it\u2019s buying back shares?Stated simply, repurchase programs can be hazardous to a company\u2019s long-term financial health and often signal a management that has run out of better ways to invest in the business.And yet investors love them.Not all stock repurchases are bad, of course. But given the enormous popularity of buybacks nowadays, those that are harmful probably outnumber the beneficial.Those who run companies like buybacks because they make their earnings look better on a per-share basis. When fewer shares are outstanding, each one technically earns more.But a company\u2019s overall profit growth is unaffected by share buybacks. And comparing increases in earnings per share with real profit growth reveals the impact that buybacks have on that particular measure. Call it the buyback mirage.But a good bit of that performance was the buyback mirage. Growth in Yahoo\u2019s overall net profits came in at about 11 percent annually.Given these figures, Mr. Colby reckoned that Yahoo, if it had invested that same amount of money in its operations, would have had to generate only a 3.2 percent after-tax return to produce overall net profit growth of 16 percent annually over those years.Some companies argue that the money they spend repurchasing stock is a shrewd use of their capital. And given Yahoo\u2019s track record in recent years, its management team seems to have had a hard time identifying profitable investments.But Mr. Colby pointed out that buybacks provide only a one-time benefit, while smart investments in a company\u2019s operations can generate years of gains.Yahoo declined to comment on its buybacks.This analysis may be of interest to Starboard Value, an activist investor that is a large and unhappy Yahoo shareholder. On Thursday, Starboard nominated nine directors to replace the company\u2019s entire board, saying its current members lack \u201cthe leadership, objectivity and perspective needed to make decisions that are in the best interests of shareholders.\u201dIn a statement, Yahoo said, \u201cThe board\u2019s nominating and governance committee will review Starboard\u2019s proposed director nominees and respond in due course.\u201dHe found that McDonald\u2019s was another problematic example. Since 2008, McDonald\u2019s has allocated almost $18 billion to buybacks. This has helped produce 4.4 percent increases in annual earnings per share over the period. To equal that growth in overall earnings, the company would have had to generate just a 2.3 percent return on the money it spent buying back stock, Mr. Colby estimated.Becca Hary, a McDonald\u2019s spokeswoman, said the company had a \u201cbalanced and disciplined capital-allocation strategy that promotes long-term value for our shareholders.\u201d She cited McDonald\u2019s plans to invest $2 billion to open a thousand new restaurants and \u201cto reimage 400 to 500 locations\u201d domestically.In an interview, Mr. Colby said his research \u201cconfirms my suspicion that while buybacks are not universally bad, they are being practiced far more broadly and without as much analysis as there should be.\u201dPerhaps the crucial flaw in buybacks is that they reward sellers of a company\u2019s stock over its long-term holders. That\u2019s because a company announcing a repurchase program usually sees its stock price pop in the short term. But passive investors, such as index funds, and other long-term holders gain little from the programs.Especially problematic are buybacks financed with borrowed money; repurchases of stock made at prices above its intrinsic value are also unwise.Another hazard: companies that spend billions to repurchase stock without substantially shrinking the number of shares outstanding. That\u2019s because in these circumstances, prized corporate cash is used to buy back shares that offset stock grants bestowed on company executives in rich compensation plans.And there are plenty of companies whose buybacks have simply left them with less money to invest in more promising opportunities.The proposals ask the companies to adopt a policy of excluding the effect of stock buybacks from any performance metrics they use to determine executive pay packages.\u201cWe\u2019re not against buybacks,\u201d said Adam M. Kanzer, a managing director at Domini. \u201cThe question is at what point do buybacks become excessive and when do they undermine the long-term value of the company?\u201dAt 3M, for example, research and development expenditures plus strategic acquisitions have totaled $22 billion over the last five years, Mr. Kanzer said. In the meantime, the company\u2019s buyback program has cost $21 billion.\u201cWhen the buyback almost equals all the other expenditures, it makes sense to ask questions about whether there\u2019s a more constructive way to invest that capital,\u201d Mr. Kanzer said.Asked about these questions, Lori Anderson, a 3M spokeswoman, referred me to the company\u2019s proxy filing, which stated, \u201cWe believe these concerns are unfounded, as demonstrated by our long-term track record and our balanced capital-allocation approach.\u201d\u201cYou really have to ask why a company\u2019s board decides to return a big chunk of capital instead of replacing managers with ones who can figure out how to develop the operations,\u201d said Gary Lutin, who oversees the Shareholder Forum.\u201cIf the board doesn\u2019t think it\u2019s worth investing in the company\u2019s future,\u201d Mr. Lutin added, \u201chow can a shareholder justify continuing to hold the stock, or voting for directors who\u2019ve given up?\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Puerto Rico Fights for Chapter 9 Bankruptcy in Supreme Court", "Date": "2016-03-22", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Debt-laden Puerto Rico went toe to toe with its creditors at the Supreme Court on Tuesday, arguing that it has been wrongly locked out of the bankruptcy courts, the only place it can reasonably expect to restructure its crushing debt.\u201cWe\u2019ve talked a lot about legal principles,\u201d said the lawyer Christopher Landau, summing up his arguments on behalf of the commonwealth. \u201cBut this is also a flesh-and-blood situation in Puerto Rico.\u201dHanging on the outcome, he said, were questions like \u201cwhether people in a village in Puerto Rico will be able to get clean water.\u201dPuerto Rico is struggling with $72 billion in debt and has been saying for more than a year that it needs to restructure at least some of it under Chapter 9, the part of the bankruptcy code for insolvent local governments. But Puerto Rico cannot do so, because Chapter 9 specifically excludes it, although it is unclear why.In 2014, the island tried to get around that exclusion by enacting its own version of a bankruptcy law, designed for its big public utilities, which account for about $26 billion of the total debt. But that attempt ran afoul of yet another provision of the code, which says that only Congress can enact bankruptcy laws.\u201cCongress has shut the door,\u201d said Mr. Landau. \u201cThere is no door for Puerto Rico, and no key for Puerto Rico.\u201dMany of the justices\u2019 questions, and the parties\u2019 responses, involved possible rationales for tying Puerto Rico\u2019s hands, as Congress went out of its way to do in 1984. Its amendment that year also barred the District of Columbia, without leaving any legislative history or indication of intent.\u201cWhy would Congress preclude Puerto Rico from Chapter 9?\u201d asked Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr.\u201cWhy would Congress put Puerto Rico in this never-never land?\u201d asked Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg. \u201cWhy in the world? What explains Congress wanting to put Puerto Rico in this anomalous position of not being able to restructure its debt?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s the question that everyone asks when they pick up this case,\u201d said Mr. Landau.He and the lawyer representing Puerto Rico\u2019s creditors, Matthew D. McGill, agreed that no one knew for sure, but both offered theories.Mr. McGill said the 1984 amendment was not all that mysterious if you considered that Congress had a long history of micromanaging Puerto Rico\u2019s indebtedness. He cited a 1917 federal law that specifically limited the amount of debt that Puerto Rico could take on, which remained in force until Puerto Rico ratified its own constitution in 1952. Even then, he said, Congress agreed to lift its own debt restriction only because Puerto Rico had included a similar restriction in its new constitution.He also said that Congress had tacitly encouraged the widespread purchasing of Puerto Rican debt, by permitting Puerto Rico to market its bonds as triple-tax-exempt in all American states and cities. As a result, Puerto Rican debt is exceptionally widely held across the United States mainland, and Congress may have wanted to protect investors by making it hard for Puerto Rico to renege.\u201cThe third reason is that by 1984, Puerto Rico and D.C. were the two most indebted territories, by a lot,\u201d he said. Under those circumstances, Congress was unlikely to have wanted to \u201callow the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico to write their own municipal bankruptcy laws, that may or may not treat their nationwide creditors fairly.\u201dMr. Landau offered an entirely different theory as to why Congress had enacted the laws at issue. He said the legal provisions were being misread, and that Congress had not really intended to shut Puerto Rico out of bankruptcy.While lawyers, judges and policy makers have grappled with these issues, Puerto Rico\u2019s finances have gone from bad to worse. The island has already defaulted on about $221 million of debt, prompting lawsuits by some of the affected creditors. And bigger, far more contentious defaults appear imminent.On May 1 the island\u2019s all-important Government Development Bank must make debt payments of $422 million, which it does not seem to have. Two months later, about $2 billion is due from the central government and a number of big public enterprises: the electric power authority, the water and sewer authority and the highway authority, among others. Puerto Rico\u2019s constitution effectively guarantees at least some of those payments, but the money to make them appears to have dried up.Gov. Alejandro Garc\u00eda Padilla has said that he will not make debt payments if it means depriving the Puerto Rican people of essential services. But skipping the big payments due in May and July would probably mean many more creditor lawsuits.And a default by the Government Development Bank, which oversees the island\u2019s finances, could set off a far-reaching chain reaction. The bank has guaranteed the debts of numerous other agencies and private companies, and insured hundreds of personal mortgages. Those guarantees and insurance would presumably lose value in a default, hurting the balance sheets of any number of institutions.Analysts have warned that it could take years to sort out the resulting mess, and in the meantime, Puerto Rico would be a pariah, less and less able to protect the safety and well-being of its more than three million residents.When it first enacted its own version of bankruptcy in 2014, Puerto Rico had hoped to restructure only a few large government enterprises.But two big mutual fund companies, Franklin Advisers and OppenheimerFunds, filed suit on the same day the law was enacted. They argued that no matter how much Puerto Rico might want to take shelter from creditors, the bankruptcy code clearly said it could not file for Chapter 9 protection, nor could it enact its own bankruptcy law. The United States District Court in San Juan and the Court of Appeals for the First Circuit agreed.As the case inched along through the courts, it became increasingly clear that restructuring the public enterprises alone would not be nearly enough to solve Puerto Rico\u2019s problems.Last year, certain congressional committees began working with the Treasury Department on legislation that would give Puerto Rico a legal framework for restructuring all of its debts under the Territorial Clause of the United States Constitution. That approach would help Puerto Rico cope without running into the special exclusion that has been keeping the island out of Chapter 9.\u201cIsn\u2019t there also legislation to put Puerto Rico back in Chapter 9?\u201d Justice Ginsburg asked on Tuesday.\u201cYes there is,\u201d said Mr. McGill. \u201cCongress is considering a range of options for Puerto Rico, including Chapter 9, just as Congress considered a range of options for the District of Columbia during its own financial crisis in the 1990s, which resulted in a financial control board rather than Chapter 9.\u201dA House bill is expected to be introduced by the end of March, in keeping with instructions issued by the speaker, Paul D. Ryan. A Senate bill is likely to follow. They are expected to provide some framework for restructuring other than Chapter 9. Congressional action is likely to come well before any court ruling.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "John Gutfreund, 86, Dies; Ran Wall Street Investment Firm at Its Apex", "Date": "2016-03-09", "News": "Supported byJohn H. Gutfreund, whose aggressive leadership of Salomon Brothers and extravagant lifestyle personified the meteoric rise and fall of Wall Street moguls in the heady 1980s, died on Wednesday in Manhattan. He was 86.His son J. P. Gutfreund confirmed the death, at New York Presbyterian-Cornell Hospital, saying the cause was pneumonia.As chairman and chief executive of Salomon, the giant investment firm, Mr. Gutfreund (pronounced GOOD-friend) was called \u201cthe king of Wall Street\u201d for having transformed his company into one of the world\u2019s largest securities traders. He was hailed as one of Wall Street\u2019s most brilliant and innovative players.Under his guidance, Salomon became the leading dealer in United States Treasury bonds, the predominant underwriter of corporate securities and a pioneer in turning ordinary home mortgages into tradeable securities.Women\u2019s Wear Daily regularly referred to the voluble Mrs. Gutfreund as \u201cSocial Susie\u201d and to her dour-looking husband as \u201cSolemn John.\u201dAt work, Mr. Gutfreund, a short, stocky balding man, was known for a gruff demeanor, foul language and an ever-lit cigar \u2014 fitting the stereotypical image of securities traders who made their fortunes shouting orders and cursing at one another across the trading floor. His advice to novice traders \u2014 to wake up each morning \u201cready to bite the ass off a bear\u201d \u2014 became a Wall Street dictum.Mr. Gutfreund liked to roam Salomon Brothers\u2019 cavernous trading room firing questions at startled employees on their bond deals, especially those that were souring.Once his 12-hour workday was over, though, Mr. Gutfreund shed the blunt, coarse manner. Wearing large, owlish eyeglasses, he was a smartly tailored dresser who affected a near-British accent as he spoke wistfully of his decision earlier in life to forgo a career as a literature professor.Invited to join numerous blue-blood charities, he opted for a lower-profile appointment to the board of the Montefiore Medical Center in the Bronx, where he occasionally volunteered to prepare meals and wash dishes. He was content to show up regularly at black-tie charity fund-raisers.For Mr. Gutfreund\u2019s 60th birthday, his wife threw a bash at the Mus\u00e9e Carnavalet in Paris and bought two seats on the Concorde so that the cake and its baker could be flown over from New York.But only two years later, Mr. Gutfreund\u2019s business reputation and social standing were in tatters. He seemed powerless to control infighting at Salomon, which led to the departure of talented senior executives. Other Wall Street firms outdistanced Salomon after its profits declined and its costs spun out of control.\u201cNo apologies to anybody,\u201d he told Salomon\u2019s stunned managing directors in announcing his resignation in August 1991. \u201cWhat happened, happened.\u201dJohn Halle Gutfreund was born in Manhattan on Sept. 14, 1929, to Manuel and Mary Gutfreund. His father, originally a butcher, became a meat wholesaler and distributor and was able to move his family to affluent Scarsdale in Westchester County. John attended Lawrenceville, the boarding school in New Jersey, and then Oberlin College in Ohio, where he majored in English. Drafted into the Army, Mr. Gutfreund served in the Korean War.Returning to civilian life, he briefly considered pursuing a scholar\u2019s career in literature but in the end opted for finance and joined Salomon Brothers, recruited by William R. Salomon, a family acquaintance whose father had helped found the firm and who became a managing partner.Mr. Gutfreund started in 1953 as a $45-a-week trainee on the municipal bond desk. In 1958, he married Joyce Low, daughter of a Wall Street financier, and they had three sons. By 1963, Mr. Gutfreund had become Salomon\u2019s youngest nonfamily partner.In those days, Salomon, despite its more than 50-year existence, was little known outside of Wall Street because its clients were in the wholesale trade \u2014 banks, insurance companies and pension funds for whom Salomon acted as a broker, buying and selling stocks and bonds. Investment firms at the time had none of the cachet they would later acquire. In the 1960s, more than half of Salomon\u2019s partners did not have college degrees.But by the time Mr. Gutfreund became managing partner in 1978 on Mr. Salomon\u2019s retirement, investment firms were attracting the brightest university graduates with bountiful salaries.Mr. Gutfreund made more than $35 million and earned $3 million more in annual salary as chief executive of Salomon Brothers, which became the financial subsidiary of the new parent company, Phibro Salomon. At the time, that was a whopping compensation package for a Wall Street executive.By 1985, Mr. Gutfreund was at the top of the financial world. Business Week labeled him the \u201cking of Wall Street.\u201d American consumers, corporations and governments, from municipal to federal, were borrowing enormous quantities of money, causing an explosive growth in bonds. And no Wall Street firm knew more about the valuation, trading and sale of bonds than Salomon.Salomon\u2019s competitive advantage over rivals was demonstrated by its early dominance in mortgage securities. Mortgages had never been considered tradeable securities until Mr. Gutfreund appointed a young Salomon executive, Lewis Ranieri, as head trader of a new mortgage security department \u2014 Wall Street\u2019s first \u2014 in 1978. Under Mr. Ranieri, Salomon began buying home loans and repackaging them as bonds backed with government guarantees.Mr. Gutfreund, who lived in Manhattan, married Susan Kaposta in 1981; both of their first marriages had ended in divorce. She survives him. Besides his son J. P., from his second marriage, he is also survived by three other sons, Nicholas, Owen and Joshua, from his first marriage; and four grandchildren.As Mr. Gutfreund rose on Wall Street, so did his profile in New York society. Susan Gutfreund was an inveterate party-giver, an enthusiastic antiques collector and a lover of high fashion. Friends quoted her as lamenting, \u201cIt\u2019s so expensive being rich.\u201dThe couple\u2019s growing reputation for private extravagance soon fed rumors that Mr. Gutfreund was uncharacteristically failing to rein in spending at Salomon Brothers.For some Wall Street observers, ballooning expense accounts were only a small symptom of a wider problem at Salomon. \u201cAt times it was as if we had no management at all,\u201d Mr. Lewis wrote in \u201cLiar\u2019s Poker.\u201d \u201cNo one put a stop to the infighting; no one gave us a sense of direction.\u201dThe strategy worked, and Mr. Perelman beat a hasty retreat. But Mr. Buffett drove a hard bargain: His investment firm, Berkshire Hathaway, bought $700 million of convertible preferred stock \u2014 equivalent to 9 percent of Salomon\u2019s common shares if Mr. Buffett chose to convert his holdings. And he was given two seats on Salomon\u2019s board. At the time, the deal amounted to buying Salomon stock at a large discount.For the next few years, Mr. Gutfreund seemed to steady Salomon\u2019s keel. Though the firm failed to achieve the growth levels of the first half of the 1980s, it managed to bounce back from the bond and stock market crashes of 1987. But then, in 1991, an unforeseen and badly managed episode involving the purchase of Treasury bonds spelled doom for Mr. Gutfreund and almost sank Salomon.According to government regulations, no single purchaser could bid more than 35 percent of the Treasury bonds up for sale at an auction. The limit was designed to prevent a single company from cornering the market for a Treasury bond. An investment firm was allowed to exceed this percentage, however, if it was acting as a broker for customers.Paul W. Mozer, Salomon\u2019s chief government bond trader, far exceeded the 35 percent limit in a February 1991 auction of Treasury bonds, and compounded the illegality of this action by putting in bids in the name of customers who had never asked to purchase the bonds.Although Mr. Gutfreund and other Salomon executives were told of Mr. Mozer\u2019s transgression, they did not report it to the federal government for four months. When the government was finally informed, Salomon admitted that it had purchased substantially more than the 35 percent limit in several other Treasury auctions.Traders and analysts on Wall Street feared the scandal would discredit the American securities market worldwide and raise the government\u2019s cost of financing its debt.Mr. Gutfreund resigned as chairman and chief executive of Salomon, as did the firm\u2019s president, Thomas W. Strauss, and the vice chairman, John W. Meriwether.With fears rising that the government might shut down Salomon, the firm\u2019s board invited Mr. Buffett, a man with a sterling reputation both in the financial community and among government regulators, to become chairman and chief executive on an interim basis. Mr. Buffett quickly agreed to cooperate with government investigators.In May 1992, Salomon paid $290 million in fines to the government, acknowledged that it had on occasion submitted bogus bids to buy more Treasury securities than regulations allowed, and admitted that its senior executives, including Mr. Gutfreund, had known about the fraudulent bids but had failed to make them public or report them to government officials.Mr. Gutfreund\u2019s troubles were not over. In settling government charges against him, he agreed never again to run a securities firm and to pay a $100,000 fine. For years he battled a $300 million suit filed by private lawyers on behalf of Salomon shareholders who felt that the bidding scandal had caused the value of their stock to decline. Mr. Gutfreund spent more than $5 million of his own money on legal fees trying to get Salomon to pay him more than $15 million, which he insisted the firm owed him in retirement and option plans.But an arbitration proceeding ruled entirely in Salomon\u2019s favor, apparently accepting the firm\u2019s contentions that it had almost perished as a result of Mr. Gutfreund\u2019s actions, that he had deceived Salomon\u2019s board and that he should have been fired for cause, thus making him ineligible for the compensation he was claiming.\u201cWhat I have learned, or at least belatedly remembered, is that there is the possibility of a satisfying life that is broader than the Street,\u201d he said. \u201cI never thought of myself as a king. People really want you to be their deity. They forget the fact that you are a person who has feelings and doubts.\u201dAn obituary on Thursday about John H. Gutfreund, a former chairman and chief executive of the investment firm Salomon Brothers, misstated the legal ramifications of a 1991 bond-trading scandal that led to his resignation. Criminal charges were brought against a bond trader, Paul W. Mozer, who spent four months in prison and settled a federal government civil suit that resulted in a fine and a ban from the securities industry. It is not the case that \u201cno one was arrested or indicted.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "When an Analyst Has a Stake in the Stock He Picks", "Date": "2016-03-18", "News": "Supported byFair GameFile this column under: Why It Pays to Read the Footnotes.That\u2019s not unusual. Wall Street research analysts put out buy recommendations every day. Probably too often, in fact.But Longbow\u2019s report was atypical in one way: Mark Rupe, the analyst who wrote it, recently left Tempur Sealy as head of its investor relations unit. Investors didn\u2019t learn that, though, unless they read a disclosure on the penultimate page of the 17-page report, which said that Mr. Rupe or a member of his family owned stock and options in Tempur Sealy.The amount of the holding wasn\u2019t disclosed, but it appears to have resulted from Mr. Rupe\u2019s employment at the bedding maker. The report also noted that Mr. Rupe stood to receive additional incentive compensation from Tempur Sealy over the next two years if the company met certain performance hurdles.So, an analyst who is supposed to offer unbiased opinions on a company owns a position in it that could benefit from his bullishness. What gives?This is just the kind of conflict of interest that brought the wrath of regulators down on Wall Street research a dozen or so years ago. Except in those days, analysts\u2019 conflicts weren\u2019t disclosed. At least close readers of the Tempur Sealy report were armed with the information and could base their decisions on it.Still, it\u2019s hard to imagine that Mr. Rupe\u2019s stake in Tempur Sealy and his close relationship with the company won\u2019t color his view. The question is, why would Longbow, a firm that appears to pride itself on independent research, want to open itself up to this kind of criticism?I tried to ask this of David MacGregor, Longbow\u2019s chief executive and research director. Neither he nor Mr. Rupe responded to my emails seeking comment.Among the new rules were those requiring analysts to tell clients if they were recommending a company when their Wall Street firms also provided other services, such as investment banking.They also had to disclose any ownership of stocks they were covering, as Mr. Rupe did in his report on Tempur Sealy.Mr. Rupe had worked as an analyst at Longbow before. His first stint began in March 2008, according to his LinkedIn page, and extended through 2011. He covered the mattress maker then, according to an archived transcript of a 2008 earnings call. He joined Tempur in January 2012.In recent years Tempur Sealy has struggled. Some of its problems stemmed from the Tempur-Pedic acquisition of Sealy in 2013.Mr. Rupe also noted in his report that he was starting to cover two Tempur competitors, Mattress Firm Holding a specialty retailer, and Select Comfort, a maker of air beds. Mr. Rupe assigned both of those companies\u2019 stocks a neutral rating.In addition to lauding Mr. Thompson\u2019s skills, Mr. Rupe\u2019s report played down the threat from a raft of successful online mattress sellers that other industry analysts see as potentially damaging to Tempur Sealy\u2019s business. These e-commerce companies are gaining a foothold in the higher end of the mattress market, and some analysts think their growth will rise significantly in coming years.Tempur\u2019s stock was trading at around $60 when Mr. Rupe\u2019s report came out. His 12-month target price of $77 is on the high side compared with other analysts who follow the mattress maker. Only two of the seven price targets assigned by analysts covering Tempur Sealy exceed Mr. Rupe\u2019s.Initially, Mr. Rupe\u2019s report didn\u2019t do much to help Tempur\u2019s shares, which drifted down 0.4 percent after the report came out on Tuesday. But in trading the following day, Tempur stock raced ahead 5.5 percent on news that Mr. Thompson, the new chief executive, had been buying shares. On Friday, the stock was at $63.17 in early trading.The purchases, part of a matching program where Tempur contributes a restricted stock unit for each share Mr. Thompson buys, occurred on March 11 and 14, but the public filings detailing it didn\u2019t emerge until after the close of trading March 15.Obviously Mr. Rupe has a deep and abiding knowledge of the mattress business, gained during his years at Tempur Sealy. With this expertise, he could definitely produce astute analysis on the company and other industry players.But his early work indicates that he prefers cheerleading for the company. And cheerleaders are a dime a dozen on Wall Street.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Regulation Alone Will Not Change Bad Behavior on Wall St.", "Date": "2016-03-16", "News": "Supported byStreet ScenePerhaps trying to burnish his legacy on financial reform, President Obama has recently trumpeted his signature steps to transform Wall Street in the years since the financial crisis that confronted him as he began his term eight years ago.But there are reasons to doubt that his efforts will have the profound effect he hopes they will.After a March 7 meeting at the White House with the top Wall Street regulators, including Janet L. Yellen, the chairwoman of the Federal Reserve, Mr. Obama praised the Dodd-Frank reform law, the Volcker Rule that seeks to prevent proprietary trading and the creation of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, which is intended to make the world as safe from bad mortgages as it is from bad toasters.\u201cI want to emphasize this because it is popular in the media, in political discourse \u2014 both on the left and the right \u2014 to suggest that the crisis happened and nothing changed,\u201d he said sternly.\u201cThat is not true. Let me repeat that. In fact, we went at financial regulation very hard to guard against another era of \u2018too big to fail\u2019 and some of the systemic disruptions that occurred because of lax regulation. It has helped us crack down on irresponsible behavior.\u201dHe spoke about how the big banks had collectively raised $700 billion more capital, how there were now mechanisms for \u201corderly unwinding\u201d banks that get into financial trouble without having to bail them out and how financial derivatives were in the process of being more heavily regulated. He painted a pretty rosy picture of how extensively things have changed on Wall Street and in Washington to try to prevent the kind of financial meltdown we endured.The problem is that regulation alone will not change the bad behavior that occasionally breaks out into the open on Wall Street and often leads to disasters on Main Street.Wall Street is not like other industries. As repulsive as it is that executives at Volkswagen sought to evade United States\u2019 emission standards, that deceit is not likely to bring down the world\u2019s economy.But when things go wrong on Wall Street, the consequences can be devastating for the rest of us. On Wall Street, contagion is a real problem. That is why it is not enough to require banks to hold more capital or to have them reduce the amount of risky assets they have leveraged on their balance sheets or to prevent them from making the kinds of proprietary bets that sometimes go awry.Two things still need to change on Wall Street for there to be meaningful reform. First, the culture of what constitutes success inside a Wall Street firm \u2013 who gets promoted and put in charge and for what reasons \u2014 needs to change. Second, the compensation system needs a total revamp so that bankers, traders and executives are no longer rewarded for taking big risks with other people\u2019s money, putting themselves in a position to win big if their risk-taking pays off but not to be held accountable if things go wrong.The good news, if there is any, is that some lip service has been paid to trying to change Wall Street\u2019s culture. Twice in the last two years, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York has held closed-door meetings and seminars with many of the leaders of Wall Street companies to convey to them that Wall Street\u2019s behavior must change or change will be imposed upon it.Even less has changed about the compensation system on Wall Street. People are rewarded for closing deals, underwriting stocks and bonds, securitizing mortgages, car loans and credit-card receivables, and trading with counterparties. They are rewarded for putting together the people who have capital with the people who want capital. That is a hugely important function, assuming we like capitalism and want it to keep functioning properly.But too often on Wall Street, the enduring lust by bankers, traders and executives for big annual bonuses results in behavior that benefits them at our expense. Notwithstanding talk of clawbacks and lower overall pay, the compensation system on Wall Street remains untouched after the crisis. That means that the very system that regulates what people do every day on Wall Street remains the same.To his credit, President Obama recognized at the White House meeting on March 7 that the compensation system on Wall Street remains broken.\u201cWe still have work to do to complete regulations related to executive compensation to make sure that individuals who are working in these financial institutions are less incentivized to take big, reckless risks that could end up harming our financial sector over all,\u201d he said.He\u2019s right about that. And that\u2019s one of the reasons I lament his departure from the Oval Office next January: There\u2019s virtually no chance that either Donald Trump or Hillary Clinton will touch this subject.William D. Cohan is a former senior mergers and acquisitions banker who has written three books about Wall Street.

{"Headline": "The Financial Alchemy That\u2019s Choking SunEdison", "Date": "2016-03-15", "News": "Supported byDeal ProfessorIf SunEdison enters into bankruptcy, the autopsy will no doubt reveal a suicide, finding the solar energy company done in by financial engineering that was too clever and by a failure of its executives and investment bankers to remember the lessons of the financial crisis.SunEdison is not dead yet, but it is floundering. The immediate cause of its distress is the now-terminated agreement to acquire Vivint for $2.2 billion that was struck last July.One of SunEdison\u2019s yieldcos is TerraForm Global, for acquiring solar assets in emerging markets; the other is TerraForm Power, for assets in developing markets. As part of the acquisition of Vivint, TerraForm Power agreed to purchase $922 million of Vivint assets from SunEdison. TerraForm Power would sell stock in the market to finance this acquisition.This is where things started to go awry.David Tepper\u2019s Appaloosa Management protested about the acquisition, asserting that SunEdison had used its control position to force TerraForm Power into this deal.SunEdison is already highly leveraged, with $11 billion in debt, and it runs losses, giving it little room to maneuver. More important, the two TerraForm stock prices declined precipitously, making it difficult for TerraForm Power to raise money to purchase Vivint assets.SunEdison had a case of buyer\u2019s remorse while the TerraForm Power board openly talked of trying to get out of the deal. Moreover, a still-unexplained delay occurred when SunEdison announced that it could not complete its annual financial statements. A delay in completing audited financial statements always creates trouble and often ruins a stock. But in this case, the problems were worse, since SunEdison needed those financial statements to register with the Securities and Exchange Commission the shares being issued to Vivint shareholders. Meanwhile, oil prices kept going down, taking SunEdison and its yieldcos with it.Vivint was now faced with a hard choice: whether to sue SunEdison or renegotiate. In the face of a declining market, Vivint decided to cut the price its shareholders would receive. Blackstone, the owner of 77 percent of Vivint, also agreed to offer financing. The deal was adjusted so that S.E.C. registration was not required.But unfortunately, for whatever reason, SunEdison has not finished its financial statements. Its lenders, now skittish, pulled their financing. Left with no funds and no current financial statements, SunEdison went dark. Its stock now trades in the $2 range, down from about $31 a share at the time the acquisition was announced.A representative of SunEdison declined to comment. Representatives of Vivint did not respond to requests for comment.Now Vivint, left waiting, has terminated its agreement and sued SunEdison for damages in a Delaware court. It\u2019s a good case for Vivint. The agreement allows for Vivint, in the case of a willful breach, to sue for the full benefits of the transaction, which in this case are well over a billion dollars. While SunEdison can argue that this was not a willful breach, it will have a hard time.What is SunEdison\u2019s strategy? No doubt it is the bankruptcy one. With so much debt and little equity \u2014 its market capitalization is only $600 million despite having $2.4 billion in cash \u2014 if SunEdison declares bankruptcy, Vivint will face a drawn-out process and may find that the cash evaporates. Meanwhile, Greenlight is desperate to salvage its investment and has taken a board seat.SunEdison is looking to settle this, no doubt for a few hundred million dollars.What a mess.It is important to place blame here. As for the hedge funds, like Valeant they can be dismissed for chasing a bubble deal and yield yet again. (After the Valeant crash, this is a worrying trend.)But five large investment banks were involved in advising the parties here. Bank of America Merrill Lynch was the main adviser to SunEdison, while Goldman Sachs was also an adviser and provided financing. Barclays and Citibank advised TerraForm Power, while Morgan Stanley advised Vivint.Even with all this firepower, it appears no one said at the beginning that such a highly leveraged acquisition with so many moving parts might create a problem. This is the old Wall Street, where someone can move a percent on the spreadsheet in terms of leverage and it is all fine. But no one, it appears \u2014 not the bankers who financed this, let alone the companies\u2019 officers \u2014 took a step back and said that maybe this type of structure did not make sense in a post-financial crisis world.The oil collapse might have been unforeseen. But looking at the SunEdison structure \u2014 three public companies, enormous debt and the use of various securities to buy this company \u2014 one should have questioned the arrangements. This is even before addressing the issue that Vivint is in consumer solar, an industry very different than that of SunEdison, which builds massive plants. It was a risky transaction across the board.Will Wall Street and corporate America ever learn?An article on the DealBook page on Wednesday about the financial troubles of the solar company SunEdison misidentified the SunEdison affiliate that the hedge fund Appaloosa Management claimed was forced to acquire assets from SunEdison. It is TerraForm Power, not TerraForm Global.Advertisement"}

The new fund \u2014 called GCM Equity Partners \u2014 is down 5.2 percent. Even worse, the Glenview Capital Opportunity fund, a $1.7 billion portfolio that uses leverage or borrowed money to enhance its bets, has lost 22.4 percent through the end of February.Mr. Robbins is not the only one. William A. Ackman, another big-name investor, is also nursing double-digit losses this year.If last year was a tough one for the swing-for-the-fences hedge fund managers who became synonymous with moneymaking in years past, the first few months of 2016 are looking just as bad.These losses have become harder for impatient investors to stomach following big losses last year.The University of California\u2019s endowment fund, for example, said on Thursday that it would cut the number of hedge funds it invests in to about 10 from 32, as part of an effort to simplify its hedge fund investments.Now some brand-name managers who have recorded big losses for many months are facing pressure from investors to redeem their money \u2014 something that could lead them to sell their holdings in stocks in order to come up with the necessary cash.But the continued underperformance from the industry has also raised a broader question from investors like pension funds: What are they getting in return for the hefty fees they pay?In the first three months of this year, investors are expected to withdraw $25 billion from hedge funds, according to a Goldman Sachs Prime Brokerage Services survey of hedge fund investors representing about $425 billion in investments. Of those investors who planned to redeem money, however, more than three-quarters said they would reinvest the money in other hedge funds.\u201cI think they are getting the benefit of the doubt,\u201d Dean Backer, global head of sales and capital introduction at Goldman Sachs, said of many of the biggest hedge fund managers, owing to their historical performance. \u201cI\u2019m not sure people know \u2014 if they took money out of hedge funds\u2014 where they would put it,\u201d he added.Some well-known firms that bucked the negative trend in 2015 are getting punished this year. The Marcato International Fund, run by Mick McGuire, a former prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of Mr. Ackman, was down 12.8 percent as of the end of February. Citadel\u2019s Kensington fund, run by the billionaire Kenneth C. Griffin, had lost 6.2 percent as of the end of February. SkyBridge Capital, a fund of hedge funds run by Anthony Scaramucci, pulled $1 billion in the fourth quarter from hedge funds that focus on event-driven strategies led by John A. Paulson, Daniel Loeb and Barry Rosenstein, taking action ahead of turbulent performance from all three firms this year.Solomon Kumin\u2019s Folger Hill Asset Management is still struggling to gain traction some two years after it opened for business. The firm is down about 10 percent for the year. Mr. Kumin, who was the chief operating officer for Steven A. Cohen\u2019s former multibillion-dollar hedge fund, SAC Capital Advisors, lost 3 percent last year.Maybe one of the biggest surprise losers is Blackstone\u2019s Senfina Advisors, a $2 billion fund the private equity firm started in 2014 that allocates money to several equity trading teams. The fund is down about 15 percent for the year after posting a 20 percent gain in 2015.Some of the declines can be attributed to the underwhelming performance of a basket of 50 stocks that Goldman Sachs says hedge funds like most. The basket \u2014 which includes Allergan, Amazon, Apple, Citigroup, Valeant and Teva \u2014 was down 5.6 percent for the year as of March 4.Meanwhile, the broadest measure of hedge fund performance, the HFRI Fund Weighted Composite Index, was down about 2.6 percent for the year at the end of February, matching the 2.6 percent decline in the S.&P. 500-stock index as of the close of trading on Thursday.Both Mr. Robbins and Mr. Ackman then are consistently faring worse than their peers when it comes to placing bets on stocks.For Mr. Robbins, positions in Monsanto, Cigna, the Laboratory Corporation of America and Teva Pharmaceutical Industries have caused investors a headache. For Mr. Ackman, big bets on Valeant, Platform Specialty Products and the Howard Hughes Corporation have driven losses.And Mr. Ackman\u2019s firm continues to be bedeviled by its longstanding bearish bet against the shares of Herbalife, which have risen a little more than 3 percent this year.It\u2019s not all red ink in the nearly $3 trillion hedge fund universe.David Einhorn\u2019s Greenlight Capital is up 3.3 percent after losing 20.4 percent last year. Horseman Capital Management, a firm based in London and run by John Horseman, is up 9.7 percent this year, after posting gains of 20.4 percent in 2015.One of this year\u2019s early big winners is Boaz Weinstein and his Saba Capital Management. Mr. Weinstein, a one-time star credit trader at Deutsche Bank, has seen his share of ups and downs \u2014 assets at his fund fell to $1.9 billion from a peak of nearly $6 billion in 2012. But the firm now appears to be on the upswing.Saba Capital, which focuses mostly on investments in credit, reported a 3.4 percent gain in its main fund last year. As of the beginning of March, the fund was up a little more than 14 percent \u2014 making it one of the top-performing hedge funds tracked by HSBC. A major driver of the firm\u2019s returns this year is a bet on volatility in Asian markets in both Japan and China, where the swings in stock prices have been far greater than in the United States.Despite the poor returns and hand-wringing from investors in certain funds, many of this year\u2019s worst-performing managers will be fine, as evidenced by their hobbies \u2014 from real estate to art, and even horses.Advertisement"}

The 2,300-year-old city \u2014 which is the capital of Sichuan Province in the nation\u2019s southwest, an area long renowned for its bright, spicy cuisine \u2014 was once a hub for silk brocade and satin, and is also celebrated for being home to the country\u2019s first distillery, as well as the onetime residence of the Tang Dynasty poet Du Fu (China\u2019s equivalent of Horace).These days, Chengdu is also known for its concentration of tech companies: Lenovo, Foxconn and Intel all have large factories here. The recent influx of foreign money and visitors, combined with the centuries-old local obsession with good food and good tea, have made the city one of China\u2019s most aesthetically and gastronomically innovative hubs, while also remaining distinctively, traditionally Chinese. \u2018\u2018Beijing is too political. Shanghai is 100 percent modernized. Xian is old-fashioned,\u2019\u2019 says Claudia Du, a 25-year-old local. \u2018\u2018Chengdu is the city that combines culture and modernization the best.\u2019\u2019It\u2019s also \u2014 refreshingly, in nonstop China \u2014 a place whose residents prize quality of life as much as they do making money. Here, a subtropical climate justifies the occasional siesta, the local sport is retreating to teahouses and an oft-quoted saying instructs old people not to leave and the young not to come, as they risk losing all desire to work. (It seems appropriate that there are multiple sanctuaries in the area for giant pandas, creatures who spend the majority of their time either eating or sleeping.) Here\u2019s what to see and eat now.China\u2019s traditional siheyuan home is reimagined as a glass-box hotel, which is part of the bustling Sino-Ocean Taikoo Li complex, with restaurants and boutiques built around a 17th-century temple. Hotel guests enter through a stone gate, proceed down a path leading to a restored Qing Dynasty translation office and are delivered into the hotel\u2019s brick-lined interior courtyard. The 100 minimalist rooms have off-white linens, pale oak walls and black cabinetry; rough-hewn timber tables lend warmth and texture.This new 390-room hotel showcases Chinese cultural traditions in its vibrant d\u00e9cor, from the seven gardens nestled around the high-rise tower to the lacquer lobby walls. Designer Tony Chi, whose past projects include the Rosewood London, has outfitted the building with porcelain panels and floor-to-ceiling windows that look out on Chengdu\u2019s bustling urban core, and surprisingly rustic guest rooms, with natural oak walls and raw linen upholstery.The maverick chef Yu Bo has spent decades teasing out new flavors from traditional Sichuanese cuisine at this acclaimed restaurant, which recently moved to a luxury community on the southern outskirts of the city. The elaborate tasting menu abounds in imaginative flourishes, such as savory pastries made to resemble calligraphy brushes that can be dipped in tomato \u2018\u2018ink\u2019\u2019 and dumplings in the shape of miniature hedgehogs.This industrial-chic concept shop stocks bright statement pieces by emerging designers, including Min Wu, whose bubble-sleeve blouses recently hung from metal fluorescent light fixtures, and Ejing Zhang, whose silk and bamboo bracelets dangle from a carousel made of glass bulbs.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Does Obama Have This Right?", "Date": "2016-03-23", "News": "Supported byObama\u2019s primary goal seems to be to get out of office being able to say that he had shrunk America\u2019s involvement in Iraq and Afghanistan, prevented our involvement on the ground in Syria and Libya, and taught Americans the limits of our ability to fix things we don\u2019t understand, in countries whose leaders we don\u2019t trust, whose fates do not impact us as much as they once did.After all, the president indicated, more Americans are killed each year slipping in bathtubs or running into deer with their cars than by any terrorists, so we need to stop wanting to invade the Middle East in response to every threat.That all sounds great on paper, until a terrorist attack like the one Tuesday in Brussels comes to our shores. Does the president have this right?Visiting here in northern Iraq, in Kurdistan, and talking to a lot of Iraqis leaves one thinking Obama is not entirely wrong. Sitting through a forum at the impressive American University of Iraq, Sulaimaniya, and watching Iraqi leaders squabble and point fingers at one another did not leave me wanting to buy a lot of stocks on the ISX, the Iraq Stock Exchange.I was most struck by the moment when Sheikh Abdullah Humedi Ajeel al-Yawar, head of the giant Shammar tribe, centered in what is now ISIS-occupied Mosul, stood up in his elegant robes, looked at Iraq\u2019s oil minister and asked: \u201cWhat happened to the $700 billion [in oil money] that came to Iraq, and not a single bridge was built? What happened to this $700 billion? We are asking this from the heart.\u201dHe got the loudest applause all day. We can\u2019t stabilize Iraq or Syria if their leaders won\u2019t share power and stop looting.But sitting here also makes you wonder if Obama hasn\u2019t gotten so obsessed with defending his hand\u2019s-off approach to Syria that he underestimates both the dangers of his passivity and the opportunity for U.S. power to tilt this region our way \u2014 without having to invade anywhere. Initially, I thought Obama made the right call on Syria. But today the millions of refugees driven out of Syria \u2014 plus the economic migrants now flooding out of Africa through Libya after the utterly botched Obama-NATO operation there \u2014 is destabilizing the European Union.The E.U. is America\u2019s most important economic and strategic partner and the other great center of democratic capitalism. It amplifies U.S. power, and if it is hobbled, we will have to do so much more on our own to defend the free world.We and the E.U. together have got to think about how to create safe places in Libya and Syria to stem the refugee tide before it breaks the E.U. History will not be kind to Obama if he just turns away.The West should be all over Tunisia with economic, technical and military assistance. \u201cTunisia is a start-up democracy,\u201d its former Prime Minister Mehdi Jomaa told me. \u201cIt may be small, but its leverage for the future of the region is enormous. I can\u2019t imagine any stability in the region if Tunisia doesn\u2019t succeed.\u201dThe other self-ignited democracy experiment is Iraqi Kurdistan, where the Kurds on their own built an American-style university in Sulaimaniya, because they want to emulate our liberal arts, and just opened a second American University, in Dohuk. But tiny Kurdistan today is hosting 1.8 million refugees from other parts of Iraq and from Syria, and with low oil prices, it\u2019s almost bankrupt.The Kurdish government, which was allowing a strong opposition party to emerge and a free press, is now backtracking, with its president, Massoud Barzani, refusing to cede power at the end of his term, and the stench of corruption is everywhere. The Kurdish democratic experiment is hanging by a thread. More U.S. aid conditioned on Kurdistan\u2019s getting back on the democracy track would go a long way.\u201cIt is one big game of survivor out here,\u201d said Dlawer Ala\u2019Aldeen, president of the Middle East Research Institute in Kurdistan. \u201cAmerica needs to constructively engage the Kurds, offer them conditional help and make them the partner that America deserves. Here, everyone listens to and likes America. [The Kurdish] people want America to protect them from Iran and Turkey.\u201dKurdistan and Tunisia are just what we dreamed of: self-generated democracies that could be a model for others in the region to follow. But they need help. Unfortunately, Obama seems so obsessed with not being George W. Bush in the Middle East that he has stopped thinking about how to be Barack Obama here \u2014 how to leave a unique legacy and secure a foothold for democracy \u2026 without invading.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Stock Buyback Plans, Seen as Shareholder Boon, Can Backfire", "Date": "2016-03-11", "News": "Supported byFair GameStock buybacks are a boon for shareholders, right?That\u2019s been the spin, anyway, as hedge fund activists have pushed corporate managers to spend billions repurchasing shares in recent years.But not all buybacks are created equal, and exhibit A is LPL Financial Holdings, a brokerage and investment advisory firm in Boston. LPL recently completed a $275 million stock buyback spree that was exceedingly costly, increased the company\u2019s debt and wound up primarily benefiting a powerful insider investor.Shareholders typically like repurchase programs because a company\u2019s earnings per share rise as the number of its shares outstanding falls, often propelling its stock price. These purchases can also support a company\u2019s stock when the overall market is in decline.But as LPL Financial\u2019s recent buybacks show, there are pitfalls aplenty in these transactions.In 2010, LPL sold stock to the public for the first time at $30 a share. After the initial offering, the private equity firms held 63 percent of the company. Three years later, Hellman & Friedman exited its investment, distributing its LPL holdings to its investors. TPG kept a stake in the company and two seats on the LPL board.In recent years, Marcato has rattled corporate cages at NCR, a technology company, and Lear, an auto parts maker, prodding the companies to change their capital structures.LPL stock closed at $40.20 that day, a 3 percent rise. A little over a month later, on Oct. 29, LPL announced that it was going to \u201cmaximize shareholder returns.\u201d The chosen formula was to amend its credit agreement to allow for an additional $700 million of borrowing and buy back $500 million of its own shares. The stock closed at $42.91 that day.The company moved quickly to execute the buybacks. By Dec. 10, LPL said it had completed an accelerated plan, repurchasing $250 million in stock, or 5.6 million shares. Its average cost a share was about $44.50, the company said.But instead of going into the open market to buy the stock, LPL repurchased 4.3 million shares from TPG, the private equity firm and partial owner. That meant more than three-quarters of LPL\u2019s $250 million buyback spending went to TPG.Although TPG still owned 8.6 million LPL shares, the transaction allowed the firm to dispose of about one-third of its stake at what turned out to be a very sweet price.LPL declined to answer my questions about the buyback, including those about how its board had determined that buying back TPG\u2019s shares was the best way to execute the repurchases. In regulatory filings, the company said neither of the TPG-affiliated directors had participated in approving the LPL buyback. The company also said TPG approached Goldman Sachs, the company LPL had hired to execute the repurchase.On Jan. 14, Marcato disclosed that it, too, had jettisoned some of its LPL shares, reducing its holdings to 4.9 percent from 6 percent. By then, LPL shares had fallen to around $36.Disaster struck on Feb. 11, after the stock market closed. LPL disclosed fourth-quarter and year-end 2015 results, with profit falling 35 percent in the quarter and 5 percent for the year. The company cited extreme market volatility as the main factor behind the woes.In the disclosure, LPL noted that it was still buying back shares. As of Feb. 11, it said it had paid an average of $39.41 for 630,000 shares.Those purchases and the earlier ones looked unfortunate indeed when LPL\u2019s stock collapsed to $16.50 the next day. It has recovered a bit to $22.42 now.But the damage had been done. In an attempt to enhance shareholder value, LPL increased its debt to buy back shares. Then the stock collapsed to less than half the price it had paid to repurchase those shares. And the biggest beneficiary of the buyback was TPG, a private equity firm with a stake in the company. TPG declined to comment.Marcato, the hedge fund that appears to have instigated LPL\u2019s recent stock buyback, reduced its stake, too. The fund did not reply to an email seeking comment about its investment in LPL.Given that its stock is in the cellar, now would seem to be the time for LPL to ramp up its repurchase program, offsetting some of the high prices it paid in past transactions. From early 2013 through April 2015 \u2014 well before the latest round \u2014 the company bought back almost $300 million of stock at prices between around $42 and $52, regulatory filings show.The company, though, now has less cash to devote to such a buyback plan.So-called hedge fund activists have made a habit of swooping into companies they see as vulnerable and demanding changes to their capital structures. Stock buybacks are a popular page in these funds\u2019 playbooks.But as the LPL Financial story shows, these tactics may not wind up helping shareholders at all.Advertisement"}

You\u2019re a smart person and you\u2019re sure you can beat the market \u2014 or at least do better than a boring basket of mutual funds and income investments.That\u2019s what Elmer Naples, 75, a former utility company engineer in Trenton, said he was thinking when he retired 20 years ago. Then the stock market started doing its trapeze act and he thought better of his plan and switched to a fee-only financial planner 10 years ago.\u201cI tried everything,\u201d Mr. Naples recalled. \u201cI owned stocks, mutual funds, C.D.s, bonds, diamonds and silver. I was handling all of our finances at first, then I got a little tired of the stock market. I wanted to put things on automatic.\u201dLike millions of retirees, Mr. Naples used his time to research investments that he hoped would preserve and increase his wealth. And like millions of others, he learned that it\u2019s hard for an individual investor \u2014 even a retired one with lots of spare time \u2014 to outdo the pros and beat the market\u2019s maddening volatility.The Achilles\u2019 heel for investors in retirement is a punishing stock market downturn that reduces not only their income stream but also their total wealth. Even the most astute individual investors have a hard time seeing bubbles inflating and knowing when to get out. They may even be part of the bubble inflation.\u201cRapid, unexpected increases in wealth during the appreciation phase of asset pricing bubbles can lead investors to experience intense, positive emotions,\u201d the researchers found. If they\u2019re excited about, say, tech stocks, they buy more of them.When markets turn sour, though, and professional investors are buying stocks whose prices have fallen, many individual investors retreat to the sidelines. For those in retirement, this is a sure way to underperform the market and often lose money. Because no one quite knows when it\u2019s time to leave an inflated market or when to return and shop for bargains, millions of people guess wrong or follow the current trend. Market timing is a mug\u2019s game.Indeed, in the 2008-9 sell-off, willingness to take \u201cabove-average or substantial investment risk\u201d fell to 19 percent in 2009 from 23 percent in mid-2008, according to the Investment Company Institute, a mutual fund trade group. The appetite for risk didn\u2019t return to pre-crash levels until 2013 \u2014 and those who stayed out of the market missed most of the rebound in share prices of American stocks.George A. Akerlof and Robert J. Shiller, Nobel laureates and the authors of \u201cPhishing for Phools: The Economics of Manipulation and Deception,\u201d call the siren call of Wall Street\u2019s latest darlings \u201cphishing.\u201d That\u2019s when a profit can be made off deception, enthusiasm, weakness and greed. Too many investors believe the narrative of the next best thing or easy money, derailing millions of retirement portfolios.\u201cIt\u2019s the world\u2019s oldest story,\u201d said Professor Akerlof, who is now at Georgetown University. \u201cSomeone\u2019s always dangling an apple, and that snake decided to be there.\u201dWhen it comes to investing, he noted, people love stories. What company will make everyone\u2019s life easier, connect the world and cure disease? \u201cStories get people to buy,\u201d Professor Akerlof said. \u201cBut when the story goes viral \u2014 or becomes a New Yorker cartoon \u2014 it\u2019s time to sell.\u201dHow many retirees have the discipline to resist compelling narratives, especially when they have a lot of time to think about them? Not many, which builds a case for either studied self-discipline, such as a firm, long-term investment strategy, or employing an outside adviser.In Mr. Naples\u2019s case, after careful consideration he and his wife hired Len Hayduchok, a fee-based certified financial planner based in Hamilton, N.J., who set them up with a passively managed portfolio and counseled them on their financial and estate goals.\u201cFor some folks, investing might be something they\u2019re qualified to do,\u201d Mr. Hayduchok said. \u201cBut many underestimate the expertise needed. The average investor gets returns that are half of the benchmark.\u201dAt the very least, a qualified third party such as a financial planner or a registered investment adviser can take a lot of decisions off the table.No longer will you have to worry about whether you are buying into a bubble or need to know when to get out. The focus will be on your long-term goals and not short-term headlines or manias. Besides, you stand little chance of success in an age of high-frequency trading and mountains of real-time information being absorbed by big traders every second of the day.\u201cMost normal buyers should do buy-and-hold,\u201d Professor Akerlof recommended. He said he invested his own retirement money in index mutual funds.\u201cAdopt a strategy that\u2019s \u2018phool-proof\u2019 and go for long-term investing,\u201d he suggested. That means holding wide swaths of global stocks, bonds and real estate through mutual and exchange-traded funds sold by BlackRock (iShares), Dimensional Fund Advisors, Fidelity Investments, State Street Global Advisors (SPDRs), Charles Schwab and the Vanguard Group.Still, investors might keep their hands in managing if they trade with no more than 10 percent of their portfolio. You may be able to insulate yourself by buying stocks with solid dividends and reinvesting the quarterly payments in new shares commission-free, through dividend reinvestment plans. You can often snag bargains when the market dips, as it did in the first weeks of this year.For the bulk of your portfolio, how do you find a professional who will shield you from your worst instincts? Seek out a fiduciary \u2014 that is, someone legally obligated to put your best interests first. They should not receive a commission from selling you anything. They can charge by the hour, a flat fee or a percentage fee based on annual assets under management.A financial planner, a chartered financial analyst or a personal financial adviser can draft and maintain a holistic financial plan that takes into account taxes, income, estate planning and other financial considerations. At the very minimum, a financial adviser who identifies, analyzes and respects your long-term goals \u2014 and keeps you on track \u2014 may be worth the investment.Advertisement"}

After the sale, Pershing Square will have a 5.6 percent stake, he said.A day earlier, Valeant, in which Pershing Square has a 9 percent stake, announced that it would not be able to file its annual financial statement in time and warned that it could default on some of its debt as a result. The shares halved in value after the news, putting pressure on Mr. Ackman.Shares of Mondelez have lost about 7 percent this year, but that is much less than the 67 percent plunge so far this year in shares of Valeant. The stock sale was negotiated by Citigroup and Credit Suisse. The shares were priced Wednesday evening, and the sale is expected to net $840 million.Valeant has been one of Pershing Square\u2019s worst performing stocks in recent years.Pershing Square Holdings, a publicly traded vehicle set up by Mr. Ackman, said on Wednesday that it was down 26.4 percent for the year as of March 15.Mr. Ackman has been a strong advocate for Valeant, first teaming up with the company in a joint takeover attempt for Allergan, the maker of Botox, in 2014, and then buying Valeant\u2019s shares in 2015.In recent months, however, Valeant has come under pressure for its pricing strategies, and is facing shareholder lawsuits in both the United States and Canada. It has also become a target for Hillary Clinton on the campaign trail.

{"Headline": "As Nuclear Security Summit Begins, Materials Remain Vulnerable to Theft", "Date": "2016-03-29", "News": "Supported byBut despite the progress, several countries are balking at safeguards promoted by the United States or are building new stockpiles.President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, where some of the largest stockpiles of civilian nuclear material remain, has decided to boycott the summit meeting, which begins Thursday night. Mr. Putin has made it clear he will not engage in nuclear cleanup efforts dominated by the United States.Pakistan, China, India and Japan are all planning new factories to obtain plutonium that will add to the world\u2019s stockpiles of bomb fuel.For the first time, the Nuclear Security Summit will include a special session on responding to urban terrorist attacks \u2014 and a simulation of how to handle the threat of imminent nuclear terrorism.\u201cThe key question for this summit,\u201d said Matthew Bunn, a nuclear expert at Harvard and a former White House science adviser, \u201cis whether they\u2019ll agree on approaches to keep the improvements coming.\u201dIngredients for so-called dirty bombs, which use conventional explosives to spew radioactive material, are still scattered around the globe at thousands of hospitals and other sites that use the highly radioactive substances for industrial imaging and medical treatments. Less than half of the countries that attended the last nuclear summit in 2014 pledged to secure such materials, and they in turn represent less than 15 percent of the 168 nations belonging to the International Atomic Energy Agency. The report called highly enriched uranium \u201cone of the most dangerous materials on the planet,\u201d warning that an amount small enough to fit in a five-pound sugar bag could be used to build a nuclear device \u201cwith the potential to kill hundreds of thousands of people.\u201dStill, that does not mean Mr. Obama\u2019s efforts have failed altogether. He is expected to announce a major achievement soon: the removal of roughly 40 bombs\u2019 worth of highly enriched uranium and separated plutonium from Japan. Some of the uranium was fabricated in pieces the size of squares of chocolate that could be easily slipped into a pocket, a terrorist\u2019s dream.And Ukraine was the site of a success that, in retrospect, looks even bigger than it did four years ago.On a bitterly cold day in Kiev, the Ukrainian capital, in March 2012, two years before Ukraine descended into crisis, a team of Americans and Ukrainians packed the last shipment of highly enriched uranium into railway cars, ridding the country of more than 500 pounds of nuclear fuel. It would have been enough to build eight or more nuclear bombs, depending on the skill and destructive ambitions of the bomb maker.\u201cWe had vodka,\u201d recalled Andrew J. Bieniawski, then a United States Energy Department official central to the elimination. \u201cIt was amazing.\u201dYet there are signs that what began as a global effort to prevent terrorists from obtaining the world\u2019s deadliest weapons is fracturing.In fact, there is a case to be made that even as vulnerable stockpiles have shrunk, the risk of nuclear terrorism has not.There is evidence that groups like the Islamic State are more interested than ever in nuclear plants, materials and personnel \u2014 especially in Belgium, where the attacks last week killed more than 30 people.Laura Holgate, Mr. Obama\u2019s top adviser on nuclear terrorism, noted on Tuesday that the United States had worked with Belgium to \u201creduce the amount of nuclear material\u201d at one key site. Asked about the Islamic State\u2019s interest in obtaining nuclear fuel from Belgium, she said, \u201cWe don\u2019t have any information that a broader plot exists.\u201dMs. Holgate told reporters that this week\u2019s meeting would address the question: \u201cHow do you sustain the momentum to the summit after the summit ends?\u201dThe results of previous summit meetings have ranged from treaty ratifications to the establishment of more than a dozen training centers around the globe where guards, scientists, managers and regulators sharpen their skills at preventing atomic terrorism.Near Beijing, one of the largest training centers opened this month. \u201cIt\u2019s in our national interest\u201d to help foreigners secure their atomic materials, said Nick Winowich, an engineer at Sandia National Laboratories, one of the American nuclear labs that helped in the center\u2019s development.The biggest wins have been the removal of all highly enriched uranium from 12 countries, including Austria, Chile, Hungary, Libya, Mexico, Turkey and Vietnam. The material was mostly reactor fuel. But officials said terrorists could have turned it into least 130 nuclear weapons.Critics of the summit process point to vague communiqu\u00e9s that seem to have done little to drive hard decisions. A sense of summit fatigue now seems to prevail, the critics add, noting that Russia\u2019s withdrawal evades some of the biggest security problems.The Obama administration has also presided over a steady drop in American spending on international nuclear security. Budgets fell from over $800 million in 2012 to just over $500 million in 2016. For 2017, the White House has proposed less than $400 million \u2014 half the spending of the high point.\u201cThe summit process has achieved some very important objectives,\u201d said Kenneth N. Luongo, president of the Partnership for Global Security, a private group that advocates new nuclear safeguards. \u201cBut it needed to aim higher. The world is not becoming any easier to deal with. There\u2019s still a responsibility to think big.\u201dLike the Science Times page on Facebook.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Architect of Pipeline Company Merger Said to Be Its Foe", "Date": "2016-03-04", "News": "Supported byIn late January, about 40 Wall Street financiers packed into a private dining room at III Forks Steakhouse in Houston for an update on the troubled multibillion-dollar merger of the pipeline companies Energy Transfer Equity and the Williams Companies.With shares of Energy Transfer down 50 percent since the transaction was announced in September, the investors interrogated Energy Transfer\u2019s chief financial officer, Jamie Welch. He tried to assuage the analysts and investors, assuring them that his company was committed to closing the deal.Less than 10 days later, Energy Transfer fired Mr. Welch.Mr. Welch\u2019s ouster stunned most investors, causing Energy Transfer\u2019s stock to drop 42 percent in one day, but not everyone was surprised. Since December, Mr. Welch, a former investment banker who helped sculpt the $38 billion acquisition, had been actively trying to recut the deal, or get out of it entirely.In recent months, Mr. Welch has called Williams shareholders, urging them to push the board to reconfigure the deal or vote against it, according to interviews with five shareholders who requested anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the private conversations.Mr. Welch argued that the deal\u2019s terms, a mix of stock and a sizable $6 billion cash payout to Williams shareholders, would crush the combined new company under a mountain of debt. In one call, a shareholder said, Mr. Welch referred to the cash payout as \u201cmutually assured destruction.\u201dDeal advisers and bankers said it was extremely unusual for an executive of an acquiring company to contact shareholders of a target to persuade them to back out of a deal. But there have been instances of a company or its executives trying to wiggle out of a deal after it was signed.Jill E. Fisch, a corporate law professor at the University of Pennsylvania Law School, said that Mr. Welch\u2019s communications with some Williams shareholders did not appear to violate any securities laws.\u201cThere could be something in the merger agreement that says the company has to support the deal and executives have to support the deal to shareholders,\u201d Ms. Fisch said. \u201cBut even then, the board and the managements can\u2019t commit to recommending a deal if doing so would not be in the best interest of shareholders.\u201dAnother explanation may be that Mr. Welch\u2019s view on the merger was more negative than anyone else\u2019s inside the company, she said. \u201cMaybe he went rogue,\u201d Ms. Fisch said. \u201cMaybe others inside the company are still in favor of the deal.\u201dMr. Welch did not respond to multiple requests for comment. A spokeswoman for Energy Transfer did not return emails or calls seeking comment.Investors say tensions between Mr. Welch and Energy Transfer\u2019s chief executive, Kelcy Warren, had been brewing since the deal was announced. Besides the cash portion of the deal, another sticking point between the two executives was Energy Transfer\u2019s decision to burn through more than $1 billion in cash last year by buying back the company\u2019s stock when it traded closer to its peak of $35 a share. Today, Energy Transfer\u2019s stock trades around $8.In conversations with investors and analysts, Mr. Warren has said the removal of Mr. Welch, who was the point person on the deal with investors, was a result of a \u201cdifference in communications.\u201dThe marriage between Energy Transfer and Williams was hailed as a transformative deal, one that would create the country\u2019s largest network of pipelines, zigzagging over 100,000 miles.Instead, it has become one of the most ill-fated deals in recent years. As oil and natural gas prices have collapsed, so have the stocks of both companies, which have lost more than half their value since the deal was announced in September. There are growing concerns about the debt levels that the combined company would have. And questions swirl around how that debt could affect the new company\u2019s debt rating and its ability to pay cash distributions in the future.All of this is likely to come to a head in the spring, when Williams shareholders will vote on the deal. If it is approved, shareholders can decide whether to receive either all stock or a stock-and-cash mix.Over the last two and a half years, the oil industry experienced its deepest downturn since at least the 1990s.Inside Energy Transfer, the fear is that the deal that was long coveted could now severely weaken the combined company if energy prices do not rebound. But under the terms of the agreement drafted, in part, by Mr. Welch, the company\u2019s options appear to be severely limited.One potential way out would have been to persuade Williams to agree to terminate the deal. That would have cost Energy Transfer at least $2 billion in a one-time payment to compensate Williams for the breakup, a figure that Energy Transfer briefly weighed but quickly decided was unrealistic, two people briefed on the strategy said last week. The Williams board, which was fiercely divided at the time the deal was signed, unanimously supported the takeover on its original terms by mid-January.Under the agreement hashed out between the two companies\u2019 boards, Williams shareholders will receive stock in the new company and $8 a share in cash. To make the cash payment, Energy Transfer will have to take on an additional $6 billion in debt. The concern is that the debt could cause rating agencies to slash its debt rating, increasing its cost of borrowing.Mr. Welch, a boisterous deal maker who formerly ran investment banking for Credit Suisse in London, commuted between his home in London and Energy Transfer\u2019s headquarters in Dallas. He had worked with Mr. Warren on several other top mergers and was lured to Energy Transfer in 2013 with a pay package that at the time was worth about $45 million.Mr. Welch wanted the cash portion of the Williams deal to go away. So, starting in December, he began reaching out to Williams investors, urging them to push the Williams board to renegotiate for an all-stock transaction with Energy Transfer, according to people familiar with the conversations. Mr. Welch\u2019s pitch was that even though the overall transaction value would be lower with an equity deal, it would be in the best long-term interest of the combined companies not to take on so much debt, these people said.They said Mr. Welch feverishly tried to cajole investors to change the deal, calling them as often as once a week. One of the investors said he threatened that Energy Transfer might simply walk away from the transaction \u2014 an empty ultimatum because the ironclad agreement he helped structure made it nearly impossible to do so.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Janet Yellen Says Fed Still Plans to Raise Interest Rates but Carefully", "Date": "2016-03-29", "News": "Supported byJanet L. Yellen, the Federal Reserve chairwoman, said on Tuesday that the United States economy remained on track despite a rough start to the year because the drag from weak growth in other countries was being offset by lower borrowing costs.The cautious tone of her remarks, however, suggested no rate increase was likely at the Fed\u2019s next meeting, in April, shifting the eyes of Fed watchers to its subsequent meeting in June.\u201cI consider it appropriate for the committee to proceed cautiously in adjusting policy,\u201d Ms. Yellen said.Stocks jumped and bond yields fell in the moments after the publication of Ms. Yellen\u2019s remarks, part of a now-familiar pattern in which markets celebrate signs of economic softness and Fed restraint because that means interest rates will stay lower for longer.\u201cThe Fed chair is clearly in no hurry to undertake the next rate hike, in spite of the generally firmer tone of U.S. domestic data in recent weeks,\u201d Krishna Guha, head of the global policy and central bank strategy team at Evercore ISI, wrote in a note to clients. He said the remarks underscored that Ms. Yellen would rather move too slowly to raise interest rates and rein in the economy than too quickly.The Fed, which raised its benchmark rate in December for the first time since the financial crisis, continues to debate the timing of a second increase.That was half as much as the Fed had predicted at the beginning of the year.Ms. Yellen attributed the deceleration on Tuesday to a judgment by Fed officials that somewhat lower rates were necessary to maintain steady growth.\u201cThe committee in March did rethink to some extent the policy path that is appropriate to achieve an essentially unchanged outlook,\u201d Ms. Yellen said.She described a dynamic in which slower growth in other nations, which tends to drag on domestic growth, had been offset by a loosening of financial conditions.That is the way monetary policy is supposed to work \u2014 markets anticipated the Fed\u2019s reaction to a weaker economic outlook, providing a jolt of stimulus before the Fed even had a chance to speak. The Fed then confirmed the market\u2019s expectations by announcing after its March policy meeting that it expected to raise its benchmark interest rate more slowly.Ms. Yellen said the reaction showed that markets have internalized the Fed\u2019s mantra that its management of interest rates is \u201cdata dependent,\u201d meaning the Fed\u2019s predictions about the likely path of interest rates are contingent on the economy\u2019s actual performance.\u201cThis mechanism serves as an important \u2018automatic stabilizer\u2019 for the economy,\u201d she said.While the Fed\u2019s assessment of the economy\u2019s anticipated performance remains unchanged, Ms. Yellen said officials now saw more risks to that outlook.Alongside the direct effects of slower global growth, she said she remained concerned about sluggish inflation and about the deterioration of inflation expectations.The Fed\u2019s preferred measure of inflation rose by 1.7 percent through the 12 months that ended in January, a stronger pace than it managed the previous year. But Ms. Yellen said it was \u201ctoo early to tell if this recent faster pace will prove durable.\u201dIndeed, Fed officials predicted in March that inflation would subside somewhat in the coming months, attributing the higher readings in the latest inflation survey to unusual jumps in the price of some kinds of goods, most notably clothing.The Fed regards the stability of inflation expectations as a mainstay of effective monetary policy. It wants inflation to be 2 percent a year and it wants people to believe inflation will be 2 percent a year, because expectations help to determine actual inflation.Market-based measures of inflation expectations, however, are running well below 2 percent, while some survey-based measures also have drifted lower.Ms. Yellen acknowledged these trends, a change from last year when Fed officials were largely dismissive. But she said the significance was \u201cfar from conclusive.\u201dFed officials continue to regard the decline in market-based measures as a result of pressures unrelated to expectations about inflation. And Ms. Yellen said that survey-based measures historically had fallen hand-in-hand with oil prices.\u201cTaken together, these results suggest that my baseline assumption of stable expectations is still justified,\u201d she said.\u201cNevertheless, the decline in some indicators has heightened the risk that this judgment could be wrong,\u201d she added. \u201cIf so, the return to 2 percent inflation could take longer than expected and might require a more accommodative stance of monetary policy.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Ambac Financial Gets Pressed to Make a Move", "Date": "2016-03-03", "News": "Supported byBreakingviewsThe Ambac Financial Group is getting the right pressure but from the wrong place.Ambac, a United States bond insurer that spent three years in bankruptcy as a result of the financial crisis, is under threat of a proxy fight from the hedge fund Canyon Capital Advisors. Canyon wants Ambac to hasten settlement proceedings on $4 billion of claims originating from unstable mortgage debt bundles and other instruments. The trouble is that the hedge fund has a position on both sides of the trade.Canyon is run by Joshua S. Friedman, an alumnus of Drexel Burnham Lambert and Goldman Sachs, who owns about a 4.5 percent stake in Ambac. It also has \u201cbuilt a significant economic interest in\u201d the claims under dispute, according to a report this week by Reuters, citing unnamed sources.The logic of Ambac buying up as many claims as possible makes sense. It will reduce interest costs and the financial guarantor ought to be able to pay less than the face value it would require if it waited for them to mature. Even Ambac seems to accept that it\u2019s a good idea. It bought $635 million worth last year.As the company argues, though, snapping up too many of them too quickly could hinder Ambac\u2019s ability to meet other liabilities. These include debt issued by the city of Chicago and Puerto Rico, both of which are under significant duress.That ought to be of concern to Ambac shareholders. The outstanding $4 billion of claims dwarf Ambac\u2019s $700 million market value. Canyon also hasn\u2019t disclosed how big a stake it has in the troubled assets. A couple of other investors share similar views to Canyon, Reuters reported last month, though they have not yet even revealed their names \u2014 and not all are shareholders.In an attempt to achieve its aims, Canyon is lording over Ambac the idea of trying to replace at least half of its board. While the hedge fund may have a case, last decade\u2019s mortgage bond boom and bust is riddled with conflicts of interest at issuers, rating agencies, investment banks and investors alike. Even just a whiff of another one should be enough to put investors on edge.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Art as Collateral in a Fickle Market", "Date": "2016-03-04", "News": "Supported byLONDON \u2014 Art and money have long been closely linked, but in the 21st century, it seems, the two have become synonymous.One way to extract the latter from the former is art-based lending, in which paintings or sculptures are used as collateral for loans. Now that the notoriously fickle and opaque art market is seemingly headed toward a downturn, with money tighter and the prices of many artworks lower, will this kind of niche financing become more attractive to collectors?Carlyle Group, the private-equity behemoth, certainly thinks so. In October, the company started Athena Art Finance Corporation, a collaboration with Banque Pictet that would use $280 million of Carlyle equity to enable owners of high-end art to tap the liquidity of their collections.Crucially, Athena is offering nonrecourse loans, exclusively secured by art works rather than other assets. Those loans can be attractive to borrowers, because the lender can lay claim only to the art in the event of a default.Art lenders who have offered full-recourse loans, secured by a range of personal assets, have faced unfavorable publicity. During the financial crisis of 2008-2009, the photographer Annie Leibovitz pledged her four homes and the rights to her images to secure a $24 million loan from Art Capital. She was unable to service the debt, and a high-profile court action ensued.\u201cThis is an opportunity,\u201d Andrea Danese, a co-founder of Athena and the company\u2019s chief executive, said in a telephone interview. Mr. Danese said there was potentially about $150 billion worth of art in private hands that could be collateralized. He identified three groups to whom his company\u2019s products might appeal.\u201cFirst, there are billionaires who put the money into private equity deals, where they make 20 to 25 percent,\u201d he said. \u201cThen there are collectors with, say, $30 million of art they leverage to buy another piece. And thirdly there are the art-rich and cash-poor in their 70s and 80s who don\u2019t want to sell because of capital gains or estate taxes.\u201dAthena offers loans of at least $1 million over six months to seven years based on a maximum of 50 percent of the low valuation of a collection or artwork. It typically charges annual interest of 7 to 9 percent, including origination fees.Athena is just one of two big self-financed lenders offering nonrecourse loans secured by art. Falcon Fine Art in London is the other. Since opening in January 2015, Falcon has arranged about $50 million in loans against high-value artworks, again at annual interest rates of about 7 to 9 percent.Larger banks, even those with art advisory facilities like Citi Private Bank, offer full-recourse loans to wealthy clients for as little as 2.5 to 3 percent a year, said Paul Ress, the managing director of the art lender Right Capital in London.\u201cArt lending is quite limited because of the affordability conundrum,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you\u2019re a high-net-worth individual, you don\u2019t need to use art solely as collateral for a loan.\u201dBut art lenders, like pawnbrokers, can get a boost when markets dip.On Monday in New York, the evening session of Phillips\u2019s \u201cNew Now\u201d auction of contemporary art, designed to kick-start the week of the Armory Show, contained a meager 23 lots, 13 of which managed to sell, raising just $1.7 million. The only work that was sold significantly above its estimate was a 1983 Jean-Michel Basquiat drawing of a snarling dog\u2019s head, estimated at $80,000 to $120,000, which drew the night\u2019s top price of $257,000.\u201cThere is a process of attrition at the moment. It\u2019s cyclical, and it\u2019s healthy for the market,\u201d said the Los Angeles entrepreneur Carlos Rivera, the founder of Art Rank, a website that uses algorithms to analyze contemporary artists as stocks to be bought, held or sold.Mr. Rivera has a new venture, Levart, that \u2014 much like the new-age pawnbrokers Borro \u2014 aims to provide liquidity at a much lower level of the market than Athena. Levart says it can provide nonrecourse financing within 12 hours, if backed by suitable contemporary works valued at as little as $5,000.The monthly interest is a hefty 4 percent for loans under $250,000. But that has not deterred art insiders from using the site to finance profitable short-term resales.Levart cites, for example, the $20,000 borrowed by a client to buy \u201cNewz!,\u201d a 2014 painting by the Los Angeles artist Math Bass. The work was then sold at Phillips in November for $81,250 against a low estimate of $25,000, reflecting the original purchase price.If the market does take a serious dip, lenders believe they can play a role in preventing a fire sale. \u201cPeople don\u2019t want to sell when things are going down in value,\u201d said Tim Hunter, the vice president of Falcon Fine Art, \u201cbut they might need to take liquidity out of their collection.\u201dWealthy art buyers certainly took plenty of liquidity out of their collections last year at Sotheby\u2019s. Throughout 2015, the auction house\u2019s finance division had an average of $733 million of full-recourse loans on its books, generating $65 million of income, according to fourth-quarter results released on Feb. 26.Those figures might not seem much compared to the company\u2019s $6 billion in auction sales, but Sotheby\u2019s 2015 auction commissions of $719 million were 5 percent less than in 2014, while income from financing rose 38 percent.For many, art collecting today is all about maximizing returns on an investment portfolio. But an auction in France last month is a reminder of the premium buyers place on collections put together without commercial considerations.On Feb. 22 and 23, the Paris auctioneer Artcurial sold the collection of Pierre Hebey, a French intellectual property lawyer who died last year at 89. The sale raised 8.9 million euros, about $9.8 million, well above the estimate of \u20ac6 million, with 85 percent of the 564 lots sold. Top price was the \u20ac845,000 paid for Roberto Matta\u2019s 1938 surrealist painting \u201cMorphologie Psychologique de l\u2019Angoisse.\u201dHebey, who counted Max Ernst and Marc Chagall among his friends, had been well-positioned to acquire 20th century art. But he was also a lifelong collector of Art Deco, 19th-century bronzes and other antiques, and he could often be found at flea markets around Paris, flashlight in hand, at five in the morning.One of his most striking purchases was Emmanuel Fr\u00e9miet\u2019s gilded bronze sculpture \u201cP\u00e9lican Gastronome,\u201d showing the bird feeding its chicks, commissioned in 1890 by the president of the Banque de France. The Petit Palais museum in Paris bought the work at the Artcurial auction for \u20ac76,200.Fabien Naudan, the vice president of Artcurial, explained why he thought buyers were so eager to bid at the Hebey sale.\u201cThey were trying to buy part of his life,\u201d said Mr. Naudan, who added that Mr. Hebey was motivated as a collector solely by his love of an object. \u201cPeople are ready to pay much more for this \u2018charge \u00e9motionnelle.\u201d\u2019How much? \u201cMaybe 20 percent,\u201d Mr. Naudan suggested.The financial industry sometimes classifies art as an \u201cinvestment of passion.\u201d Paradoxically, passion, rather than portfolio planning, seems to be the thing that ensures above-average financial returns.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Bounty Hunter Tracks Chinese Companies That Dupe Investors", "Date": "2016-03-15", "News": "Supported byRobert W. Seiden is a Wall Street bounty hunter. He tracks down executives of Chinese companies that listed on stock exchanges in the United States and then blew up.It is a painstaking business that few are willing to do.One of his current targets is the chairman at Sino Clean Energy, who has battled with investors in a Nevada state court since 2014. On Feb. 16, the trial judge found the executive, Ren Baowen, in criminal contempt and ordered his arrest for failing to comply with earlier court orders.In an attempt to increase the pressure on Mr. Ren, Mr. Seiden, the court-appointed receiver for Sino Clean, prepared a notice about the arrest warrant to be published through PR Newswire, which distributes corporate news releases.The release was published on Feb. 29 \u2014 but not in China, where Mr. Ren lives. PRNewswire, in an email to Mr. Seiden, said it had refused to publish the notice there citing \u201cheightened political sensitivity concerning Chinese investment interests.\u201dIt was not the first time Mr. Seiden\u2019s tactics have been thwarted. It is the reason many remain skeptical of his efforts. Nevertheless, he has embraced the challenge and become the go-to person for American investors who are suing Chinese companies saying that they were swindled.\u201cUnless the Chinese government is coming to arrest me, I\u2019m going to do whatever is legally permissible by court order,\u201d Mr. Seiden said in a recent interview.Mr. Seiden, 52, a former Manhattan prosecutor, has been appointed by judges as the receiver to oversee the management of nine Chinese companies \u2014 many incorporated in Nevada \u2014 that once traded shares in the United States.But his actual dollar recoveries for investors have been small \u2014 just $8 million out of the nearly $90 million he has sought to recoup.A Sherlock Holmes enthusiast (a bust of the fictional detective sits on his desk in Manhattan), Mr. Seiden has built a reputation for being tenacious. And for good reason: Getting Chinese executives to pay up involves extensive meetings, negotiations and cooperation from Chinese authorities and bankers.He is not just focused on China. He employs former agents from intelligence agencies around the world, including the Mossad in Israel and the K.G.B. in Russia, to help him conduct cloak-and-dagger investigations in places like Russia, Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan.He opened his company, Confidential Global Investigation, in 2008. Early on, he did work for hedge funds and their investors. But one of his first jobs in China was for Richemont, the company that owns luxury brands like Cartier, Piaget and Jaeger-LeCoultre. Mr. Seiden tracked down a ring of counterfeiters operating from Latvia and Scotland and manufacturing fake watches in China.In 2013, Mr. Seiden received a call from a lawyer representing a large investor in ZST Digital Networks, a Chinese equipment maker. A Delaware judge appointed Mr. Seiden as the company\u2019s receiver to enforce the terms of a $32 million judgment on behalf of the investor. Mr. Seiden is still trying to get that money back, but the assignment started him on a new career path.More work started to flow from investor lawsuits over reverse mergers. In those deals, Chinese companies looking to trade in the United States bypassed the traditional method of an initial public offering and instead merged with largely defunct companies that already had shares listed on an exchange in the United States.Starting in the mid-2000s, these companies drew a wave of interest from investors who thought they could get rich from China\u2019s surging economic growth. But years later, they had little but burned fingers to show for their investments.Many of the Chinese companies were soon engulfed in accounting irregularities or allegations of outright fraud. Others simply stopped submitting quarterly financial statements in the United States, leaving investors in the dark about what was happening with their operations in China.Critics say regulators have been slow to act.\u201cThe U.S. regulators have been unwilling to go to the mat on this,\u201d said Paul Gillis, an accounting professor at Guanghua School of Management, Peking University in Beijing.At the same time, there has been little political will to do anything about in China. \u201cThe responsibility for this stuff is spread out too widely, there are so many different Chinese bureaucracies involved,\u201d Professor Gillis said.But recently, Mr. Seiden has enlisted some officials in China. With the help of China\u2019s Ministry of Finance and Commerce and the State Administration of Foreign Exchange, Mr. Seiden collected $4 million from a settlement with Shengtai Pharmaceutical in 2015.Mr. Seiden said that he expected to collect an additional $28 million within months as a result of current negotiations, including talks with Mr. Ren\u2019s legal team.In the case of Sino Clean Energy, a clean coal manufacturing company, Mr. Seiden contends in court filings that Mr. Ren \u201cstole millions of dollars\u201d from investors in the United States by \u201cgoing dark.\u201dThe company, based in Xi\u2019an, China, has not filed updated financial statements with the Securities and Exchange Commission since early 2012, according to the investor lawsuit.Sino Clean Energy listed its shares on the Nasdaq stock market after a reverse merger in 2006 with a largely defunct company called Endo Networks. It then raised more than $26 million in the United States.Matthew C. Zirzow, the Las Vegas bankruptcy lawyer for Sino Clean, did not return a telephone call seeking comment. Another lawyer for Mr. Ren could not reached for comment.Investors in companies that Mr. Seiden is pursuing to recover money acknowledge that the efforts are long shots.John J. Kassay Jr. of Parksville, N.Y., said he lost about $20,000 on his investment in Sino Clean and joined the lawsuit in Nevada against Mr. Ren and the company to \u201ctake them to task.\u201dWhatever money he gets back from the litigation will be worth it, he said.Michael Sammons, a San Antonio investor who lost money in two Chinese companies, Weikang Bio-Technology Group and RINO International, said he could not find anyone other than Mr. Seiden to take on these cases.Mr. Seiden\u2019s firm has grown from a handful of employees, including Steven, his brother, to 20 employees. Chinese reverse merger cases account for about 80 percent of the firm\u2019s work.\u201cWe are creating a pathway to get money back,\u201d he said.A recent crackdown on financial firms because of turmoil in the Chinese stock market has heightened concerns about how China treats foreign business interests when they conflict with its own.A spokeswoman for PRNewswire said it did not publish the release in China because of new Chinese government restrictions on what foreign companies may publish online.Yet while China can appear to be uncooperative with demands from outside investors, that attitude is changing as some Chinese leaders want to show that it can be a reliable business partner, Mr. Seiden argued.Still, when he is in China \u2014 where he spends up to one month a year \u2014 he uses disposable phones and changes his hotel room after he checks in to make it more difficult for people to track his whereabouts, he said.The investors he represents say they sense that change could be underway. At the very least, they figure his help cannot hurt.\u201cIt\u2019s a big battle, and it\u2019s a big unknown because it has not been done before,\u201d said Alain Peracca, a former Microsoft executive and an investor in Sino Clean Energy. \u201cIt is the only hope that shareholders have.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Energy Transfer\u2019s Deal Is a Nightmare With No Escape", "Date": "2016-03-10", "News": "Supported byDeal ProfessorEnergy Transfer Equity\u2019s acquisition of a rival pipeline company, Williams Companies, has turned into a nightmare as troubles in the energy industry worsen.Energy Transfer has only itself to blame, but how can it escape its troublesome deal?Let\u2019s start with the simple fact that Energy Transfer is not actually acquiring Williams. Instead, a newly created affiliate, Energy Transfer Corporation, is making the acquisition.Even though the only asset of the Transfer Corporation will be Energy Transfer stock, there are bound to be trading price divergences between the price of Transfer Corporation and Energy Transfer stock. Energy Transfer has committed to equalize the price of the two stocks only for two years after completion of the deal.The deal will also leave Energy Transfer at the center of an orbit of six publicly traded companies \u2014 different pipelines that Energy Transfer manages.This is a Frankenstein creature created only for tax purposes. It should not exist and makes everything that much more complicated.There is no doubt Energy Transfer is good at tax planning, but these sort of machinations are locking the company into the transaction.The transaction was structured as a stock-and-cash deal, with Energy Transfer issuing out only about 19 percent of its outstanding stock. Cash was used to pay up for the rest of the consideration in the transaction. That cash is a problem now because borrowing that sum in a down market will leave Energy Transfer overleveraged.Furthermore, in strategic transactions, as opposed to private equity transactions, there is no \u201cout\u201d that allows the acquirer to simply terminate the deal.Before the financial crisis, provisions in private equity deals sometimes permitted an acquirer to terminate the transaction and pay a reverse termination fee of about 3 percent of the transaction value. After the financial crisis, that practice changed. As a result, a private equity acquirer could typically terminate a deal only if financing became unavailable, and it had to pay a reverse termination fee of about 6 percent of deal value.But that was for private equity deals. In strategic deals, the acquirer has no way to back out unless it has a shareholder vote or specifically negotiates a termination right.Unfortunately for Energy Transfer, it has no vote and it did not negotiate special rights to terminate its agreement with Williams.There are signs of a rift between Williams and Energy Transfer. Energy Transfer completed an offering of preferred securities to its inside executives on Wednesday. The offering was made to lessen the debt load. But Williams refused to give its consent for its audited financials to be used in the exchange, so Energy Transfer could not register the securities with the Securities and Exchange Commission so that they could be freely tradeable.One option for Energy Transfer to back out would be if a tax opinion cannot be delivered, but that does not seem a problem.And the company could in theory invoke the material adverse change clause in its agreement. This clause allows Energy Transfer to terminate the deal on a material adverse change to Williams.Over the last two and a half years, the oil industry experienced its deepest downturn since at least the 1990s.But to be a material adverse change, or MAC, under Delaware law, the bad events to Williams must be long term and significant and generally affect Williams in ways the rest of the oil industry is unaffected.Such a claim would be hard to prove given the near depression in the oil industry today. Indeed, the Delaware courts, where such a claim would be litigated, have never found a reason for the material adverse change clause to be set off.Still, anyone who thinks this is an airtight agreement did not go through the financial crisis.The lessons from these deals is this: Just because the deal appears to be airtight does not mean it will not be renogtiated. Energy Transfer can use litigation or the threat thereof to try to do this. Because Williams\u2019s shareholders will own part of the combined company at some point, this will make more sense as Energy Transfer\u2019s situation becomes worse.Either way, don\u2019t shed any tears for Energy Transfer. It got itself into this mess in the first place.An earlier version of this column referred incorrectly to a stock exchange rule that requires a shareholder vote if more than 20 percent of a company\u2019s shares are issued in a transaction. The rule does not apply to partnerships like Energy Transfer; the company\u2019s planned acquisition of the Williams Companies was structured to include cash and stock for other reasons.

{"Headline": "In Fledgling Exchange-Traded Fund, Striking a Blow for Women", "Date": "2016-03-04", "News": "Supported byWealth MattersThe fund\u2019s goal is to achieve market-rate returns by investing in United States companies that \u201care leaders in advancing women through gender diversity on their boards of directors and in management.\u201d It will track an index of 125 to 150 stocks that have been culled from the Russell 1000 index and have scored high on a scale of gender metrics.\u201cIt\u2019s looking to create a way for investors to put money into companies that have figured out the diversity challenge \u2014 that have managed to recruit and retain women in senior leadership positions,\u201d said Kristi Mitchem, head of the Americas institutional client group at State Street. \u201cWe believe that signal has excess return.\u201dWhat remains to be seen is how impact investors and the investing community more generally will receive the new E.T.F. This is not the first attempt to use an E.T.F. to invest in companies that appear to be better than their peers in promoting women to their senior ranks.Neither has substantial assets nor has had a stellar performance.\u201cWe thought this was a very smart play,\u201d Mr. Ailman said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to put some money behind it and see what happens.\u201dMr. Ailman also worked with Ms. Mitchem and her team to develop the parameters of the E.T.F. \u201cOur board has had a mandate for me \u2014 and the investments for the state\u2019s teachers all the way back to 2003 \u2014 to change the face of Wall Street,\u201d he said. \u201cThat started with diversity, which we\u2019ve made a big push on, but also gender diversity.\u201dMs. Mitchem said her goal was to get assets to $1.5 billion to $2 billion in the first year. That could be a lofty goal, even with the push from California\u2019s teachers.And there is a risk to investors if the E.T.F. does not get to a certain size quickly. Greg Lessard, founder and president of Aspen Leaf Partners, a small adviser in Golden, Colo., that invests $18 million in impact E.T.F.s and index funds, said he occasionally struggled to sell a large position in some of the thinly traded green E.T.F.s in which he invested client money.\u201cA smaller E.T.F. can be thinly traded,\u201d Mr. Lessard said. \u201cI can\u2019t just execute that trade as I normally would at my custodian. I have to call a trader and say \u2018Can you insure there\u2019s a buyer at the other side?\u2019 And sometimes they\u2019ll say, \u2018It\u2019s not going to happen today, Greg.\u2019 \u201dThere are two bigger forces at work in State Street\u2019s introduction of SHE: the increased interest in impact investing and the seeming ease with which investors can buy and sell exchange-traded funds.Michael Lear, a vice president and portfolio manager at Athena Capital Advisors, which manages $6 billion, invests client money across a range of impact strategies, from public equities and debt to venture capital and real estate.Mr. Lear said he could see the interest in impact E.T.F.s from some investors. \u201cIt makes sense in terms of supporting the ecosystem,\u201d he said. \u201cYou want more and more people under the tent.\u201dBut for his wealthier clients, he said, he largely avoids exchange-traded funds for an impact investment because he is worried that the very nature of an E.T.F. \u2014 which is meant to track an index that may have been created for just one E.T.F. \u2014 could be riskier than people imagine.\u201cE.T.F.s are creating new benchmarks or indices, and there\u2019s a risk inherent in that,\u201d Mr. Lear said. \u201cThey\u2019re trying to create something new, and they\u2019re making their best efforts, but this mechanical exercise of having an E.T.F. invest by different weightings can fail.\u201dHe cited a solar E.T.F. created by Guggenheim Partners \u2014 ticker: TAN \u2014 that invested in solar companies based on market capitalization. Last year it had a large investment in a Chinese solar company before shares in the company were frozen when its value plummeted.\u201cWhen I sit down with clients, what I generally talk about is where can you have the most bang for your buck,\u201d he said. \u201cWith fixed income, the low-hanging fruit is microlending \u2014 the return is about 3 percent, it\u2019s pretty stable, there\u2019s a low risk of default and you\u2019re supporting people with loans.\u201dTo have greater impact, Mr. Lear said, he advised clients to measure what the investment says it will accomplish versus what it does accomplish, as well as its risk and return.To make sure that the companies in the index tracked by the SHE E.T.F. are meeting the gender criteria, Ms. Mitchem said the index would be rebalanced annually. Companies will be included if they have the highest level of women in senior leadership in their sector \u2014 meaning the E.T.F. will also seek out the best companies in male-dominated industries like oil and gas to avoid a bias toward one sector.A company in the index that the E.T.F. tracks also has to have either a female chief executive or at least one female board member to prevent a company from appointing just a few senior women.One of the driving forces behind the SHE E.T.F. is to have an impact supporting companies with women in senior roles. But Ms. Mitchem also has a charitable component, which is a first for a State Street E.T.F. The charitable fund, called SHE Gives Back, will donate money to organizations that help limit early gender bias against girls hoping to become leaders.\u201cWhat SHE is really focusing on is the leadership of women once they reach corporate America,\u201d Ms. Mitchem said. \u201cBut what about the women who never realize their potential? How do we get more women into areas where they\u2019re not represented, like tech and the STEM sciences?\u201d \u2014 a reference to science, technology, engineering and mathematics.The giveback provision, while novel, does not amount to a lot of money. It is calculated as 5 percent of State Street\u2019s fee, but since one of the selling points of any exchange-traded fund is its low cost, the fee is only one-fifth of 1 percent. So on the California teachers\u2019 $500 million investment, the charitable donation from SHE would be $50,000.Still, like most things with impact investments, these are early days. For the true impact to be felt, it will take years and, in this case, a lot more in assets invested.Advertisement"}

He called the negotiations \u201cugly.\u201dWhen the two sides finally agreed on a price, Mr. Sacks had to find a way to pay them without crippling the company, which has annual revenue of $25 million.His situation is typical of people who become wealthy through starting private companies but whose wealth is tied up in those companies. While the value of the company may continue to grow, the founders can only borrow so much against it before they are stymied.They can generally cover their expenses. But getting money to buy out existing partners or to invest in other businesses is another story. It gets more challenging if they don\u2019t want to give up control of the company.Mr. Sacks knew one thing: He didn\u2019t want to sell his business to buy out his partners. Soon after he started More Than Gourmet, the owner of the sauce-making plant he used sold to a larger competitor. The sauce maker thought he had freed up some of the money from the business and shed the burden of running the company. Six months later, the buyer ousted him.The best strategy for buying out partners is, not surprisingly, to have an arrangement set up in advance, advisers say.Rick Marcatos, senior vice president at UBS Wealth Management, said that there should be legal documents that discuss just how any buyout would occur. \u201cTo not hamper the company, you can do some payment structure \u2014 \u2018I\u2019ve been given 12, 18 months to pay you back,\u2019 \u201d he said.But, of course, that requires planning at a time when entrepreneurs are scrambling to bring their idea to life. When a buyout isn\u2019t so clearly delineated, the options are more complex.Banks will lend, but they are constrained as to how much. Part of the money Mr. Sacks needed was arranged as a loan from Key Bank, which is the company\u2019s bank. But the bank couldn\u2019t lend all that he needed without putting the company\u2019s debt ratio above the limits set by the Dodd-Frank financial reform law.Mezzanine financing is another option. This type of financing looks like debt but the mezzanine lender has the right to convert it to equity. That conversion happens when the company is doing better than expected, since it increases the return for the lender.\u201cIf the company is projected to be at $2 million to $3 million in a couple of years and it\u2019s at $5 million to $6 million, the mezzanine lender is going to convert to equity and there\u2019s nothing you can do about it,\u201d Mr. Marcatos said. \u201cThey dictate the terms because you need the money.\u201dMr. Sacks kept searching for other options. He could have ended up paying as much as 30 percent on the money from the mezzanine lender if the company performed as he expected it to.The other problem with using mezzanine debt to buy someone out is deciding on the value of the firm, said Ryan Budlong, managing director at Harris Williams & Company. He said he often advised clients to get two appraisals and then split the difference.Short of turning to a private equity firm, there are family offices and other private lenders willing to acquire companies and give the founders the opportunity to sell some portion of their company yet remain involved.William J. Kidd, the founding partner of Kidd & Company, a family office in Greenwich, Conn., said he looks to buy companies with net income of $3 million to $20 million a year that have more potential.\u201cThe businesses we\u2019re interested in have been taken by the founder from the floor to the table,\u201d he said. \u201cThey haven\u2019t been taken to the ceiling for a number of reasons. It takes a different skill set to take a company from the table to the ceiling.\u201dKidd & Company generally pays the founder 70 percent of the price in cash and then structures the remaining 30 percent as a five-year note, which could pay the founder above that amount if the company does well.\u201cThe key when you do this is to make sure the person we\u2019re dealing with has a role in the business that is meaningful to them and fun,\u201d he said.In the end, Mr. Sacks found a niche firm, New York Private Finance, part of Emigrant Bank, that was willing to structure something creative: It would make a personal loan to Mr. Sacks using his ownership in the company as collateral. When he then put that money into the company to buy out his partners, it would appear on the balance sheet as an infusion of equity.\u201cThe only real negative was the fact that it was a personal loan so you couldn\u2019t get away from it if everything fell apart,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I was all in.\u201dLeigh Hoagland, chief executive and chief credit officer at New York Private Finance, said the firm sought out entrepreneurs and lent to them personally, not to an operating company. While the borrowers will be responsible for the loan, they will not have to contend with the lender taking a board seat or exerting control over the company.Mr. Hoagland would not disclose the interest on the loan but said that there was a cap on how much the lender would be paid back, even if the company did better than expected. And the overall cost is less than mezzanine financing. \u201cFor people for whom this product works, it\u2019s an extremely important part of their wealth creation,\u201d Mr. Hoagland said.The loans are generally $4 million to $20 million for periods of three to seven years. Mr. Hoagland said the firm preferred to lend to people who had multiple businesses to act as security.That was the case with Joe Cambi, a private investor in Springfield, Mass., who built up a food service company there and sold it to Sysco in 2001 for $100 million.After the deal was done, he found he couldn\u2019t retire. \u201cI like the building process,\u201d he said.That led him to invest in several businesses, including a minor-league hockey team and a mortgage banking company. In 2008, the mortgage business was struggling and he took on an outside investor, whose money stabilized it.Last year, the investor, a billionaire, wanted to cash out his stake and wasn\u2019t inclined to wait. \u201cBanks aren\u2019t going to lend to someone like me to take out a partner,\u201d Mr. Cambi said. \u201cWe needed to go to a private equity firm, but we didn\u2019t want to give up a lot of equity.\u201dLike Mr. Sacks, Mr. Cambi got a loan from New York Private Finance to bridge the gap, in his case for $5 million of the $25 million the company needed to buy out the investor. Personally guaranteeing the money, he said, was worth it to regain control of the company.\u201cHe had 70 percent and we had 30 percent,\u201d Mr. Cambi said. \u201cNow, we have a lot of debt. It\u2019s heavy to bear, but it was better than having him in the nest.\u201dMr. Sacks shared that feeling. \u201cI was running this business and there was this shadow over my head,\u201d he said. \u201cThe company was limited based on that situation. By changing it, it changed the overall outlook.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Mario Draghi Throws the Kitchen Sink at Europe\u2019s Economic Distress. Again.", "Date": "2016-03-10", "News": "Supported byEconomic TrendsOne hopes that at the very least, Mario Draghi, the president of the European Central Bank, is able to buy kitchen sinks in bulk at a discount from some plumbing supply shop in Frankfurt.Because on Thursday, for the umpteenth time in his five years in that job, he has thrown his and everything else at Europe\u2019s continuing economic malaise. This time, the E.C.B. managed a quadruple whammy: cutting its short-term interest rates even further below zero; pumping more money into the eurozone economy through quantitative easing \u2014 by 20 billion euros a month (with purchases currently planned to continue through March 2017); expanding the Q.E. program to include corporate bonds to make more credit available to businesses; and encouraging more borrowing by creating a new bank lending program.This would seem on its face to be a really aggressive intervention to try to jolt Europe out of its deflationary muddle. Indeed, when it was initially announced, the euro fell 1.1 percent against the dollar, bond yields fell and European stocks rose, all suggesting that financial types saw it that way. But as Mr. Draghi began addressing the news media Thursday morning about the actions, he played down the likelihood of further rate cuts, and those market shifts reversed.It was Mr. Draghi\u2019s answer to the pessimism that has taken over global financial markets in the last few months, a malaise rooted in part by a sense of the impotence of global central banks. For years, new rounds of Q.E. and other moves have been the inevitable response to periods of market tumult and economic weakness. Now markets fear that the central banks just have nothing left to combat global deflationary forces that have seemed more powerful with every tick down in the price of oil.Not so, according to Mr. Draghi. \u201cI think the best answer to this has been given by our decisions today,\u201d he said in his news conference after the policy announcement. \u201cWe have shown that we are not short of ammunition.\u201dThey may be right, of course; the last seven years have upended what we thought we knew about how central banks can and should operate. If you told some time travelers who\u2019d just arrived from 2007 that the E.C.B. had an official bank lending rate of negative 0.4 percent and was buying 80 billion euros of bonds each month, you would blow their minds.But monetary policy works through different channels, and their relative importance shifts with time. For years, Q.E. seemed to have its greatest impact by pumping up prices of stocks and other financial assets. That both made consumers wealthier and lowered the cost of capital for businesses, helping restore confidence and encourage economic activity.That has worked well enough that global financial assets look relatively richly priced relative to historical fundamentals, despite some recent turbulence. It\u2019s not clear that asset prices are as powerful a channel for central bank activism to stimulate the economy as they were in earlier years when they were undervalued. It is also not clear if further large increases in financial markets\u2019 values would provide anything other than an unwelcome bubble.That being the case, attention has shifted in the last year or so toward currencies. With good reason: When a central bank eases monetary policy, the price of its currency tends to decline relative to others, encouraging inflation and giving an advantage to domestic exporters.Negative rates like those in place in Europe may encourage more lending and economic activity, but if they go deeper into negative territory and persist for a long time, they could also cause people to withdraw money from banks and throw the business models of banks into chaos. Going too far into negative rates would be essentially telling banks: We want you to make loans and expand credit, but we\u2019re also taking policy action that could obliterate your business.In other words, Mr. Draghi may still be able to procure a few more kitchen sinks to throw at Europe\u2019s economic problems. But each additional one may start to get a little more expensive, and a lot harder to throw.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Investors Increasingly Bullish on Energy Sector", "Date": "2016-03-14", "News": "Supported byIt was one of the darkest periods of the oil market slump. The global economy was showing fresh signs of slowing, and crude prices were collapsing so steeply that virtually every well in America was unprofitable.But when Diamondback Energy went out to raise $226 million worth of new stock that week in the middle of January, the oil and gas company found more buyers than it could accommodate. It had to nearly double the amount of shares it sold, to four million.Since Diamondback issued equity that day, the company\u2019s share price has increased more than 29 percent.Across the oil industry, investors have been placing their bets that prices have hit bottom. Risk-seeking investors like hedge funds and private equity firms, which were already lending money to struggling energy companies at high interest rates and onerous terms, are among those to have smelled opportunity in a potential comeback.Yet some of the biggest and most successful bets on oil are being wagered by mutual funds and index funds that are scooping up plain-vanilla equity offerings like Diamondback\u2019s deal in January.There is still a way to go before a full recovery. Many analysts caution that the recent recovery in prices could easily reverse itself. They argue that the tentative agreement between Saudi Arabia, Russia and a few other producing countries to freeze output at January levels will probably make little difference to global supplies.On Monday, fresh worries about supplies emerged as analysts expressed more skepticism about whether Iran would abide by a freeze. The United States oil benchmark fell 3.4 percent, to $37.18 a barrel on Monday.Prices, however, are still more than 40 percent higher than their lows in mid-February. And that has made investors more optimistic about energy.Oil and gas companies have issued about $11 billion in equity just in the two first two months of this year, according to the data provider Dealogic, putting the sector on pace to eclipse the $24 billion that was raised last year.Among the companies that have been able to secure capital from the equity markets are many midsize exploration and production companies that have been leaders in the shale revolution, like Marathon Oil, Devon Energy, Pioneer Natural Resources, Concho Resources, Parsley Energy, RSP Permian and Diamondback.The stock offerings are helping the companies maintain their oil fields, meet payrolls and keep up with debt payments at a time when production and revenue are falling.While that adds flexibility for many of the strongest companies, more than 100 mostly small oil and gas companies have been forced into bankruptcy in recent months, as banks call in credit lines and broadly curb lending to the industry.\u201cThe market sees the haves and the have-nots,\u201d said Robert Santangelo, co-head of Credit Suisse\u2019s equity capital markets in the Americas. \u201cAnd has done a good job allocating capital to survivors.\u201dSince the start of 2015, Credit Suisse has netted $126 million in revenue from underwriting equity deals in the oil and gas sectors, including the Diamondback offering, more than any other investment bank, according to Dealogic.Many of the equity issuers are active in the Permian Basin of West Texas and New Mexico, the source of more than 20 percent of the nation\u2019s production, which helps explain why the field\u2019s output has been more resilient than virtually any other field in the country. Production in early February exceeded two million barrels a day, up from 1.4 million barrels a day two years ago.Pioneer Natural Resources, for instance, announced in January a $1.4 billion stock offering intended to help fund its 2016 capital program, heavily weighted in the Permian Basin.Soon afterward, the company decided to reduce drilling when oil prices suddenly dropped by $10 a barrel. The cash from the added equity offering, however, gives the company one of the strongest balance sheets in the industry to increase production when prices stabilize and go up.\u201cIf prices recover mid-2016, if they recover late 2016, if they recover early 2017, we have tremendous firepower to start up faster than anybody else,\u201d Scott D. Sheffield, Pioneer\u2019s chief executive, said in a recent conference call.Over the last two and a half years, the oil industry experienced its deepest downturn since at least the 1990s.Even the strongest companies are not immune to pressure, however. Diamondback, for instance, had to discount its stock 3.5 percent from the market price when it issued new shares in January.Rebounding oil prices have at least temporarily quelled speculation by analysts that many more companies will go bankrupt or look to merge with larger competitors. There are tentative signs that the oil market is beginning to regain its balance between new supply and demand, but there is still a large glut of oil worldwide.United States oil production is dropping fast, by more than a half million barrels a day since last spring, and that decline should quicken: The oil rig count has fallen by roughly 75 percent from the peak in 2014. This is the first time since the 2009 recession that the rig count has fallen below 400 rigs.Now, with weather warming and refineries beginning their spring maintenance for summer blends, surpluses in gasoline inventories are beginning to ease.Crude production is also falling in Nigeria and Iraq as a result of insurgent attacks on pipelines. A wild card is Iran, which has been slow to meet its promise of exporting an additional 500,000 barrels of crude a day now that nuclear sanctions have been lifted. Nevertheless, tankers full of Iranian oil have left port in recent days destined for Spain, France, Romania and Tanzania.The ability of American companies to go to the equity market for capital is helping them finance production. And once the price of oil rises above $45 a barrel, there could be a revival of at least some of the dropped production. Many companies are waiting until oil and gas prices recover to put wells already drilled on line or fix wells that have been sidelined.\u201cThe equity raise isn\u2019t available for everybody out there,\u201d said Vance Scott, oil and gas leader for the Americas at Ernst & Young transaction advisory services. \u201cIf we see a firming of oil prices, in the $40 to $45 range,\u201d he added, \u201cthere are companies out there with good enough acreage position and cost structure that they can get the returns that they want.\u201dProduction costs have declined almost as steeply as crude prices because service companies have been forced to lower their rates and drillers have developed more efficient well designs. Rystad Energy, a Norwegian-based consulting firm that studies oil fields around the world, has estimated that the break-even price for production in the main shale fields of North America declined by more than 40 percent between 2013 and 2015.Although the future for oil prices remains uncertain, experts say the recent rise \u2013 if sustained \u2014 could mean more equity offerings, but only for strong companies.Mr. Santangelo, the Credit Suisse banker, says that while oil prices may still be volatile over the next few months, the shale industry is proving resilient.\u201cComing into this you heard shale would be the first to go,\u201d he said. \u201cThat is not happening. What\u2019s emerging is a healthy shale industry that is very competitive in the global market.\u201dAn article on Tuesday about growing optimism among investors that the energy market is poised for a rebound misstated the amount by which Iran has promised to increase its oil exports. The plan is for an additional 500,000 barrels a day, not 500 million.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "E.C.B.\u2019s Bold Stimulus Takes Aim at Eurozone Economy", "Date": "2016-03-10", "News": "Supported byFRANKFURT \u2014 Faced with a eurozone economy stubbornly resistant to revival, the European Central Bank on Thursday went where no central bank \u2014 at least no major one \u2014 had gone before.It said it would effectively pay commercial banks money to borrow central bank funds.The offer, one of a half-dozen measures the central bank announced on Thursday, means banks that participate would pay back less at the end of the four-year loan than they borrowed. It\u2019s the same as if your bank offered you a no-interest loan, plus a free toaster as a bonus.Banks will qualify for the money only if they lend it on to consumers and businesses. And there are other conditions. The money cannot be used for mortgages, for example.The step represented a significant escalation of the E.C.B.\u2019s efforts to get banks to lend more money, apply a jolt to the eurozone economy and head off the threat of a destructive decline in prices known as deflation.The spending is meant to pump more money into the laggardly eurozone economy.The central bank also cut its benchmark interest rate, the main refinancing rate, to zero, from 0.05 percent.And it lowered its deposit rate \u2014 the interest commercial banks receive for their holdings at the E.C.B. \u2014 to minus 0.4 percent, from minus 0.3 percent. By charging banks more to keep deposits at the central bank and less to borrow from it, Mario Draghi, the E.C.B. president, and his colleagues hope to make it less attractive for commercial banks to hoard cash.Whether the broad and even radical set of measures will have an effect, only time can tell. But their sheer scope underscores the challenges that Mr. Draghi is up against in trying to formulate monetary policy with so many forces working against sustained economic growth in Europe.Those negative forces include a drop in demand for eurozone exports from emerging countries like China, unstable financial markets, and a decline in confidence among consumers and business managers.Together, those drags on the economy of the 19-country eurozone are a reason the bloc\u2019s unemployment rate is more than double that of the United States, and why eurozone growth has lagged the American rebound in recent years.Mr. Draghi on Thursday noted widespread criticism that central banks had become powerless in the face of economic trends. \u201cThe best answer to this is being given by our decisions today,\u201d Mr. Draghi said. \u201cWe have shown that we are not short of ammunition.\u201dBut the unexpected sweep of Thursday\u2019s announced steps was also seen as a sign that the E.C.B. was more worried than analysts thought about the risk of deflation.\u201cThis has all the hallmarks of the E.C.B. having thrown the kitchen sink at the problem,\u201d Patrick O\u2019Donnell, an investment manager at Aberdeen Asset Management, said in a statement.Experts said that paying banks to lend has never been tried by one of the world\u2019s major central banks. In theory, Sweden has such a rate, but banks there have not taken advantage of it because they already have more funds than anyone wants to borrow.The whiff of desperation in Thursday\u2019s moves helped explain why stocks gave up initial gains after Mr. Draghi\u2019s remarks. And the euro rose against the dollar \u2014 a potential drag on eurozone exports \u2014 after he said that rates would not be cut further.In normal times, commercial banks earn interest on money parked at the central bank, and pay money to borrow. That convention will now be reversed, at least in some cases.The new approach, being paid to lend, will apply to a special program that allows banks to borrow money for four years, provided they lend the money on to consumers and businesses.Initially banks will pay zero percent interest, the new main benchmark rate. But if the commercial banks meet certain criteria, they will get a bonus of 0.4 percent annually on the value of the loan after two years, applied retroactively.Theoretically, banks would be able to refinance up to 30 percent of their loan books under this new arrangement.One of the eurozone\u2019s enduring problems is a dangerously low inflation rate. Despite the bank\u2019s stimulus measures to date, inflation in the 19 countries of the eurozone has been stuck near or below zero for more than a year.The inflation rate, which had been slightly positive, was minus 0.2 percent in February, according to official figures.Falling prices are a symptom of slow growth. They also hurt borrowers, whose loan payments become more onerous if there is no inflation. Moreover, a broad, sustained decline in prices can become self-fulfilling and difficult to reverse, which is why economists fear it so much.As recently as December, the central bank had forecast an inflation rate of 1 percent for 2016. On Thursday, Mr. Draghi said the forecast was now for 0.1 percent for this year.The bank\u2019s forecast calls for inflation to revive, rising to 1.3 percent next year and 1.6 percent for 2018. That would still be less than the official target of below, but close to, 2 percent.The central bank last hit the target in 2013.There has been considerable debate among economists about whether the central bank measures have done any good. There are also risks. For example, negative interest rates on central bank deposits could hurt bank profits even as many lenders are struggling with bad loans or other troubled assets.The new, extraordinarily favorable terms announced Thursday on money borrowed from the central bank may help to counteract the drag on lenders\u2019 profits, though Mr. Draghi said that was not the goal.It was almost exactly a year ago that the E.C.B. set eurozone precedent by buying government bonds and other assets. The program, similar to one begun in the United States much earlier, has not been enough to bring eurozone growth back to where it was before the global financial crisis of 2008.On Thursday, he defended the central bank\u2019s stimulus efforts so far, saying that without them the eurozone would have already incurred \u201cdisastrous deflation.\u201dBut he also called on eurozone governments, as he has often done, to do their part to stimulate the economy by taking measures to raise productivity and by making changes to improve the business environment. Those steps, he said, should include more spending on infrastructure.Mr. Draghi also appeared to take pleasure Thursday in defying critics who said the E.C.B.\u2019s Governing Council suffered from internal disagreements that prevented it from aggressively stimulating the economy.As far as the measures announced Thursday were concerned, he said, \u201cThe majority in favor has been overwhelming.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated when the European Central Bank began using negative interest rates on commercial banks\u2019 deposits.

{"Headline": "Risky Rats Give Clues on Brain Circuitry Behind Taking a Chance", "Date": "2016-03-23", "News": "Supported byWhen people make risky decisions, like doubling down in blackjack or investing in volatile stocks, what happens in the brain?The study was conducted in rats, but experts said it built on research suggesting the findings could be similar in humans. If so, they said, it could inform approaches to addiction, which involves some of the same neurons and brain areas, as well as treatments for Parkinson\u2019s disease because one class of Parkinson\u2019s medications turns some patients into problem gamblers.In risk-taking rats, however, those receptors sent a much fainter signal, so the rats kept making high-stakes choices even if they lost out. But by employing optogenetics, a technique that uses light to manipulate neurons, the scientists stimulated brain cells with those receptors, heightening the \u201closs\u201d signal and turning risky rats into safer rats.Step by step, the researchers built evidence that neurons with a dopamine receptor called D2 in the nucleus accumbens, a region integral to brain reward circuitry, play a critical role in risky-or-not decision-making. Strikingly, they found they could alter the message those neurons send.Rats were given a choice of two food levers. One released a consistent amount of sucrose each time; the other often delivered a tiny amount, but in 25 percent of presses, it unleashed a delicious sucrose flood. Over time, both levers gave the same quantity, so rats did not go hungry and their choices came down to whether or not they were gamblers.Risky rats gambled on the iffier lever more than half the time. Risk-averse rats were strongly influenced by their last choice; if they picked the risky lever and received a trickle, they picked the consistent lever next time.To identify the brain location involved in these decisions, the researchers gave rats a drug used to treat Parkinson\u2019s disease, pramipexole, marketed as Mirapex, which acts on D2 receptors and seems to dampen some patients\u2019 ability to restrain risk-seeking behavior. Risk-averse rats receiving pramipexole turned into risk-taking rats, but the drug had much greater effects when piped directly into the nucleus accumbens than when it was administered to another brain area researchers had thought might be involved.The scientists used a technique Dr. Deisseroth helped invent fiber photometry, which uses light particles to track activity of neurons tagged with certain proteins. They found that neurons in the nucleus accumbens with D2 receptors transmitted a signal when rats were making their decisions. That signal was much larger if the choice the rat had made had just had been a loser, yielding just a dribble of sucrose. The signal only spiked in non-risky rats, however; it was negligible in rats that always gambled for the sucrose windfall.So, what to do with those risky rats? Using optogenetics, which Dr. Deisseroth also helped develop, the team stimulated nucleus accumbens neurons with D2 receptors at the very moment of the fateful food-lever decision. That caused the receptors to send strong loss signals to the rats, apparently making them weigh recent losses more heavily, and prompting them to play it safe with their next lever choice.\u201cIt turns out you can explain a large part of whether rats were risky or not by this particular signal at this particular time,\u201d Dr. Deisseroth said. \u201cWe saw it happen, and then we were able to provide that signal, and then see that we could drive the behavior causally.\u201dHuman brains are more complex, of course, and \u201care not only affected by immediate recent losses,\u201d Dr. Deisseroth said, but \u201cyour appetite for risk in many circumstances might be at least possibly reducible to what a particular set of cells in a particular brain area is doing.\u201dDr. Robbins said that might yield insights for drug addiction, since it \u201cclearly involves the dopamine system and these areas of the brain,\u201d and in addicts, as in risky rats, the same receptors produce weaker signals.For Parkinson\u2019s patients, if versions of drugs like pramipexole could be developed to skip the nucleus accumbens and focus on brain areas responsible for movement, \u201cit would be a much more effective therapy,\u201d Dr. Phillips said. \u201cIt\u2019s because it gets to the nucleus accumbens that it has this gambling effect.\u201dHe added, \u201cNow, not only do we know the part of the brain, but we know the particular cells in the brain, and we know that if you manipulate them you can change the behavior.\u201dDr. Deisseroth said optogenetic manipulation is too invasive to be done in humans, but findings from optogenetic studies in animals are now being used to identify brain areas to target with noninvasive brain stimulation for problems like cocaine addiction.Finding the roots of risk in the brain also \u201chelps us understand what might be making people different in terms of their risk appetites,\u201d he said. \u201cIt may help us see them differently, maybe in a more tolerant way, to realize that there\u2019s a real biological basis for their behavior.\u201dBecause of an editing error, an earlier version of a picture caption with a photograph of a rat misidentified the animal. It was like the animals in the study of risk-taking, but did not itself participate.Like the Science Times page on Facebook.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Fall of China\u2019s Hedge-Fund King", "Date": "2016-03-29", "News": "FeatureXu Xiang was a legend in the country\u2019s booming stock market \u2014 until the bubble he helped to create took him down with it.Supported byThat weekend, Xu Xiang, one of the wealthiest men in China, had been visiting Ningbo, his hometown, to attend his grandmother\u2019s 100th birthday party. As the founder of Zexi Investment, one of China\u2019s most successful hedge funds, Xu had consistently produced returns that were truly unbelievable: His worst-performing fund had grown by nearly 800 percent in five years. He had also survived countless corruption investigations, market falls, purges and other scares. Yet even as his legend grew, Xu remained intensely secretive. He had amassed a fortune by trading on knowledge and information no one else had, rumors no one else knew \u2014 a strategy perfectly crafted for China, where information is tightly controlled and reluctantly released. (Almost every source I approached for this article would only speak to me anonymously, fearing government reprisal or harm to their business.) Even as Xu grew richer and more powerful, he kept nearly every detail about his personal life and his trading techniques jealously hidden.That equilibrium seemed certain to crumble on June 12, when the Chinese stock market began a free-fall. In the span of three weeks, the market lost a third of its value. It continued to careen downward throughout the summer, with major declines on July 27 and Aug. 24. On the second of these, named Black Monday by The People\u2019s Daily, the Shanghai composite index fell by 8.5 percent, its worst single-day tumble in eight years. In the span of two and a half months, $5 trillion was wiped out of the market. The ripples were felt around the globe. On Black Monday, the Dow Jones industrial average fell more than 1,000 points shortly after opening, and the FTSE 100 index in London lost $116 billion. Yet Xu (pronounced shu) somehow managed to survive this free-fall unscathed.Despite his wealth, the party in Ningbo had been a low-key affair. Xu\u2019s family shared his taste for anonymity. His wife preferred the subway to her chauffeured car, and his grandmother still lived in the same middle-class neighborhood where Xu grew up. But the festivities were interrupted a little before 10:30 that Sunday, when Xu received a message bearing a warning: The authorities were coming for him.Xu left the party immediately and sped north on the G15 Expressway toward Shanghai. As he drove, he passed neighborhoods of squat gray apartment buildings with smog-stained walls, unkempt courtyards and barred windows. He crossed the Fenghua River, which bisects Ningbo, and curved along Hangzhou Bay, racing toward the bridge. But he didn\u2019t know about the police blockade. When he reached the bridge, the authorities ushered him from his car and shuttled him to the side of the expressway to an office of the highway patrol.Xu began trading while still in high school. He was entirely self-taught: His parents, a retired factory worker and a homemaker, knew nothing about investing. \u201cI studied the stock market by reading books and attending lectures and by studying foreign investment techniques,\u201d Xu later told Caixin, a Chinese news organization, in one of the few interviews he has given. After graduating from high school, he skipped China\u2019s infamous college entrance exam and borrowed 30,000 renminbi (roughly $5,000) from his parents to trade full time. He would later say that he had actually been born in 1993 \u2014 the year he first started trading stocks.At the time, millions of Chinese were opening stock accounts with an enthusiasm that proved long-lasting and transformative. Between Shanghai and a second exchange in Shenzhen, the market grew from a capitalization of $61 billion in 1993 to $10 trillion by the summer of 2015. Unlike in the United States, where institutional investors dominate the market, China\u2019s 200 million mom-and-pop investors make roughly 85 percent of all trades. According to a survey by the State Street Center for Applied Research, 81 percent of these trade at least once a month. But less-experienced individual investors are easily swayed by rumors and operate with a poor understanding of market fundamentals, making them easy prey for more systematic and sophisticated traders. \u201cAll these small individual investors are called \u2018chives\u2019 in the market,\u201d says Hong Yan, a finance professor at the Shanghai Advanced Institute of Finance. \u201cThey get cut over and over again, but they come back every time, like little weeds.\u201dIn his early days, Xu worked from the Galaxy Securities trading hall on South Liberation Road in Ningbo. Stock prices were written in chalk on blackboards, and arbitrary rule changes affecting stock issuance and corporate disclosure constantly jostled an already unpredictable market. In 1992, the Shanghai index grew by 167 percent \u2014 then tumbled roughly 75 percent between April 1993 and July 1994. The fact that China Galaxy Securities was a state-owned enterprise offered little protection; as Xu cut his teeth, the traders around him won and lost fortunes almost overnight.On an overcast Monday morning last December, I visited Galaxy. The building itself had hardly changed from the days when Xu first set foot inside. Located beside a pharmacy that glowed with blue lights, the eight-story structure seemed on the verge of physical collapse. A wide concrete staircase, littered with cigarette butts and sun\u00adflower seeds, led up to the main trading hall on the second floor, which, by 9 a.m., was packed with haggard-looking investors. Directly opposite the trading board, hung above a small statue of a golden bull, was a red banner urging traders to \u201cstay away from illegal securities activities.\u201dAs Xu\u2019s fame grew, so did his network. By the late 1990s, he became the unofficial captain of a group popularly known as the Ningbo Death Squad. The squad made its reputation by manipulating cheap, relatively unknown stocks, which in the Chinese market are not allowed to rise or fall more than 10 percent in a single trading day. To game the system, the squad devised a strategy: Out of nowhere, it would place a gigantic order for a chosen stock. Other traders, seeing the sudden upward movement in price, would flood in, pushing the stock toward its daily 10-percent limit. Once the stock hit the limit on the first day, the momentum became self-perpetuating. Eager traders rushed to buy the stock as soon as the market opened the next day, propelling it toward the 10-percent limit once again. The movement generated its own publicity and easy profits. After a few days, the squad would sell out, and the stock would tumble back to a lower price as other traders followed. In the American context, this tactic was reminiscent of present-day schemes in \u201cpenny stocks,\u201d but with much higher stakes, and playing out in a regulatory environment that mirrored the early days of the United States market. One Chinese day trader I talked to spoke in reverent tones about the turn-of-the-century American stock picker Jesse Livermore, who made and lost several multimillion-dollar fortunes before killing himself in 1940 at 63.As the squad gained notoriety, other traders began to monitor the buy orders coming from the Galaxy trading hall \u2014 any stock they picked was guaranteed to attract attention, and a corresponding surge in buy orders. Profit was almost unavoidable.Despite Xu\u2019s preference for anonymity \u2014 he eschewed flashy purchases while other squad members parked new sports cars conspicuously in front of the trading hall \u2014 the group took on a mythical status. There was a series of books by two self-proclaimed \u201cNingbo masters,\u201d as well as traveling seminars that promised to teach legions of novice investors the moneymaking secrets of the Ningbo Death Squad. Copycat death squads popped up in other Chinese cities.The attention was not all positive. After a 2003 article in The China Securities Journal raised questions, the China Securities Regulatory Commission, the country\u2019s chief market watchdog, assigned a special czar to investigate the trading practices at Galaxy Securities and five other Ningbo trading halls. In the process, the czar called in a number of big-name local traders for an \u201cinformal discussion session.\u201d The squad disappeared from the market, only to return a week later when the czar released a public statement saying he had found no evidence of wrongdoing. Whatever the traders\u2019 methods, they were pulling in millions, and Ningbo \u2014 and the greater Chinese economy \u2014 was thriving.It was only in 2005 that a revision to China\u2019s Securities Law helped pave the way for hedge funds. Those funds that decided to operate openly within the new framework became known as \u201csunshine funds,\u201d to distinguish them from funds who kept their participants hidden. As this was happening, a new class of wealthy Chinese, enriched by the country\u2019s rapid economic boom, suddenly found themselves with billions of renminbi to invest. \u201cIt was just the perfect storm,\u201d says Zhang Howhow, the director of strategy at KPMG in Hong Kong. \u201cPeople were starting to study the regulations more closely, more seriously, to find a relatively legal way to approach this as a business. The market was going up, and you have a group of high-net-worth individuals.\u201d This was Xu\u2019s chance \u201cto build a proper hedge fund in China \u2014 the biggest, the most successful.\u201dOn Dec. 7, 2009, Xu founded Zexi Investments with 30 million renminbi \u2014 a little under $4.5 million \u2014 in capital. The name was a homage to the two men Xu admired most: \u201cZe\u201d for Mao Zedong, the founder of the People\u2019s Republic of China, and \u201cxi\u201d for Emperor Kangxi, the longest-ruling emperor in Chinese his\u00adtory. In March 2010, Xu opened Zexi\u2019s first fund with one billion renminbi. It was technically a sunshine fund, but because it had fewer than 200 investors, he wasn\u2019t required to divulge the names of his clients.As a boss, Xu was obsessive and untiring. Friends say he had no hobbies or interests outside the stock market. He arrived at Zexi\u2019s sleek Shanghai office each morning at 8:45, and often stayed until 2 a.m. From his seat at the back of the firm\u2019s trading floor, he personally directed Zexi\u2019s investments, even as the firm\u2019s assets approached 30 billion renminbi. He remained intensely secretive. The firm\u2019s researchers did not know if he had heeded their stock recommendations until they saw their performance assessments at the end of each year. \u201cXu Xiang is always trading,\u201d a longtime friend said. \u201cIf he\u2019s not trading, he\u2019s thinking about trading.\u201dIn meetings, Xu was glued to two smartphones, one displaying market prices and the other pinging with news about economic developments. He preferred to let others speak, and when he did interject, his answers were brief and dismissive. One Western fund manager said he seemed as if he was \u201cbored of answering questions and would rather get back to trading.\u201d He dressed informally, sometimes in tracksuits.As he had in Ningbo, Xu regularly poured billions into big, risky bets that always seemed impeccably timed. He focused on buying stocks that were either small and relatively unknown or sinking toward bottom-dollar price, then pulled out as soon as he made a profit. The strategy was partly a reaction to the peculiarities of the Chinese market. Practices common among United States hedge funds, like short-selling stocks to protect against downturns in the market (in other words, hedging), are restricted in China, where regulators treat them with suspicion. Instead, fund managers rely almost exclusively on buying and selling stocks at just the right time.The results Xu achieved were unbelievable \u2014 perhaps literally. Between March 2010 and October 2015, Zexi\u2019s Fund No. 1 produced a return of more than 3,270 percent, even while the Shanghai Stock Exchange index grew by only 11.6 percent. Other Zexi funds grew at similarly startling rates. By 2015, Xu controlled at least 28 billion renminbi, the most of any Chinese hedge-fund manager. An adoring public, aspiring to his rags-to-riches tale, called him \u201cChina\u2019s Carl Icahn,\u201d \u201cXu the Legend\u201d and \u201cHedge Fund Brother No. 1.\u201dIn an elegant waterfront coffee house in Ningbo, I met a young stock trader who speculated about the web of political connections that had enriched and ultimately doomed Xu. \u201cXu was pushed onto the stage,\u201d the trader told me, as fashionable young women toting Gucci bags and wearing Cartier watches strode past us. \u201cThere are a lot of red capitalists in Shanghai, the children of leaders and important officials. They put a lot of money into his private fund to use as their personal bank account.\u201dBy the young trader\u2019s telling, Xu\u2019s entire operation was a cover for this simple scheme. \u201cXu had seven products,\u201d the trader told me. \u201cThe most successful are for the red capitalists. The others are rat funds\u201d \u2014 dummy products used to drive up stock prices and enrich Xu\u2019s clients.Nearly every one of the experts I spoke with repeated some version of the same rumor: that Xu was less a financial genius than a puppet of even larger powers. Most often, this explanation was deployed in response to a question that had been troubling observers of the Chinese financial world for months: Why hadn\u2019t Xu stopped earlier? Rumors of his illegal methods were an open secret, and he had already built the most successful hedge fund in China, reaping billions of dollars in personal wealth in the process. Why keep going and risk a reckoning?\u201cThat goes to the investor conspiracy,\u201d a former hedge fund researcher told me. \u201cThe people who give money to him to manage would not like to see the fund wound down.\u201d Whether Xu had begun as a willing partner or was coerced from the start was just further speculation. \u201cWhen you have someone very politically powerful and well connected coming to you who wants you to manage money for him or her,\u201d the researcher said, \u201cthen it\u2019s sort of difficult to say no, right?\u201dIf Xu was indeed tied to figures in the country\u2019s opaque political elite, his carefully protected anonymity was all the more crucial. In a nation where political and economic control are inseparable, and where the flashiest are often the first to fall, remaining unknown can serve as a survival technique. Even the true value of his assets remains a mystery. In 2015, the Hurun Rich List ranked Xu as the 188th-richest person in China, with a value of $2.2 billion. But that figure does not necessarily include all of Xu\u2019s earnings from privately managed funds, the money he controlled through family members or assets stashed outside Zexi. Xu\u2019s true wealth was unknown and unknowable.In late 2010, he began operating through a network of shell companies and affiliated investment funds with near-identical names, purchasing ownership stakes in companies. He took on the role of the activist investor, padding corporate boards with his associates, who would then implement investor-friendly policies \u2014 particularly dividend payouts.Between 2010 and 2014, Zexi invested in 45 companies that issued dividends \u2014 more companies than the average Chinese hedge fund had invested in altogether during that period. \u201cThat strategy was quite unique,\u201d the China-based Western fund manager told me. \u201cMaybe in part because there are only a few managers who can pull that off.\u201d But Xu had the leverage and the connections. A company\u2019s performance or fundamentals did not seem to concern him; if he could find a few winning stocks, he could use his tactics to ride them to huge profits. Zexi would use dividend payouts to purchase additional shares in the company, which it could then sell when prices rose, netting millions more in profits.To execute this scheme, Xu relied on a network of trusted proxies. Two of the most important were his parents. As executives at Zexi and controlling shareholders at several related companies, Xu\u2019s mother and father helped direct billions in investment in their son\u2019s name. They also ran many of the companies that made up Xu\u2019s secret empire. Through a Zexi-affiliated fund, Xu\u2019s father owned a large share of Ningbo Zhongbai, a department store company based in Xu\u2019s hometown. Other corporations, like an unprofitable apparel chain called Shanghai Metersbonwe Fashion & Accessories, were run by friends and allies.The stock rout last summer coincided with the apex of both Xu\u2019s success and his notoriety. The government\u2019s response to the crisis was swift and heavy-handed. Large shareholders were prohi\u00adbited from selling listed stocks; I.P.O.s were halted, and state-run institutions were ordered to maintain their positions or to buy shares. The government also mobilized a \u201cnational team\u201d of brokers and investors, backed by up to three trillion renminbi in state capital, to purchase shares and raise prices.But while the rest of the market was collapsing, Xu continued to thrive. From the beginning of 2015, one of Zexi\u2019s funds grew by 357 percent, ranking first among 1,649 funds in China. Another grew by 187 percent. All five publicly listed funds had growth of at least 20 percent during three weeks of the crash in mid-June.Xu benefited from seemingly miraculous luck and timing, according to The South China Morning Post. At least three of the stocks that Zexi held most heavily were purchased en masse by the \u201cnational team.\u201d More remarkable still, all the funds run by Xu seemed to exit the stock market at just the right moment, when it briefly re\u00adbounded during the late summer before plummeting again. By the end of the summer, the annual return on his funds was more than 200 percent.But as the market dried up, Xu became a target. In September, a social-media post implicating Zexi in corruption and insider trading went viral on the Chinese Internet. The post, written anony\u00admously, claimed that Zexi had conspired with Citic Securities, a powerful state-owned investment house, to direct buyers toward Shanghai Metersbonwe Fashion & Accessories, which saw its share prices surge during the worst of the market rout. Zexi denied that Xu had worked with Citic to manipulate the price of Metersbonwe, but the arrest of several Citic executives that fall only fueled more speculation.The same post provided a possible motive for the swindle. It began when a Shanghai princeling who held shares of Metersbonwe complained to Xu about the stock\u2019s low price during the summer rout. Xu called in a favor at Citic Securities, and in a matter of weeks the \u201cnational team\u201d purchased 15 percent of the company\u2019s total shares in circulation, sending prices soaring. The C.S.R.C. noticed the incident and began investigating. Almost immediately, the government placed restrictions on Xu\u2019s ability to travel outside the country.Nine days later, Xu was fleeing his grandmother\u2019s birthday party, trying to reach Shanghai. The timing was not coincidental. A special group organized by the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection was about to begin a top-to-bottom review of the activities and leadership of the C.S.R.C. Taking down Xu \u2014 especially in public, and with photographic evidence \u2014 was a display of force and competence from a government battered by a summer of bad economic news. \u201cIn China,\u201d one fund manager told me, \u201cthe compromising and bargaining is in the execution of the law, not the formulation. The government is using this case to show that from now on, they will enforce the law.\u201dXu himself seemed to sense the end coming. A year before his arrest, in November 2014, he moved to Beijing and opened an office less than half a mile from the headquarters of the C.S.R.C. According to colleagues, the move was the start of a yearlong effort by Xu to use his connections and money to avoid a reckoning. But despite his billions, Xu was an ordinary man from a poor family. By itself, Xu\u2019s market malfeasance might have been enough to spell his downfall; that he was said to be protected by some of the same corrupt officials targeted by the anticorruption push meant there was no escape.In the months since the crash, the Chinese government has instituted a sweeping crackdown on illegal practices in the financial markets. \u201cThere are many, many, many, many, many other managers in the market who could be apprehended for the same reasons,\u201d the Western fund manager told me. Xu proved an irresistible target not because of his own malfeasance, but because he offered a path to an even larger target \u2014 perhaps the clique of Shanghai princelings. \u201cIf you\u2019re going to knock somebody down, first you take out the whole row of people around them, the people who support them,\u201d the fund manager said. \u201cYou tighten the noose around them.\u201dFrom the beginning of 2015 through September of that year, 34 companies listed on the Chinese stock market reported officials as either missing or under investigation by the authorities, according to Bloomberg News. As of late November, Xinhua, the official Chinese news agency, had identified at least 16 major finance industry figures tied directly to the stock-market cleanup who were either arrested, under investigation or assisting the authorities. In early January, the chairman of Metersbonwe joined the list, disappearing without explanation for more than a week.\u201cThe level of corruption is beyond your imagi\u00adnation,\u201d a prominent Beijing-based hedge-fund manager told me over coffee several weeks after Xu\u2019s arrest. Like all my sources, this fund manager was extremely nervous about being interviewed. The irony of the crackdown was clear: Though a lack of transparency had clearly shattered the market, the Chinese government was responding with a crushing clampdown on information. The fund manager insisted that I could not use his name, for fear of being blacklisted or arrested. The ubiquity of wrongdoing, he said, did not make anyone safe. \u201cNo one knows who will be next. If they want to catch you, they will catch you.\u201dFor China\u2019s would-be tycoons, the stakes of the crackdown go far beyond the market. During my conversation with the Beijing-based fund manager, which took place in a cafe on a university campus, a young man wandered toward us, admiring a pair of paintings on a nearby wall. The manager went quiet, and shifted uncomfortably, watching the potential eavesdropper from the corner of his eye. When the young man had passed, the manager turned back to me. \u201cIn China,\u201d he said, \u201cthe losing side doesn\u2019t get to sleep at night.\u201dAdvertisement"}

He had enlisted the Neutra and Schindler expert Eric Lamers to restore the space, and lived there with his then-girlfriend, Amanda Bacon, the founder of the pressed-juice shop Moon Juice. \u201cI was not the highest offer, but Amanda insisted that Josh sell me the house, because she\u2019s all spiritual,\u201d Bentley says. \u201cShe did me a solid.\u201d Built in 1965, the 1,100-square-foot blueprint is set on a 5,000-square-foot lot that includes a terraced backyard with walnut, loquat and lemon trees dating back to the \u201960s \u2014 as well as agave, lavender, white sage and tangerine and grapefruit trees cultivated by Kritzer.For the interiors, Bentley traveled to Morocco to buy a selection of midcentury and \u201980s and \u201990s-era rugs. From there she slowly amassed interesting pieces: a Matteo Grassi dining set from the estate sale of a Dow Chemical heir, a pair of Mario Bellini chairs she found on eBay, a brash, craggy ceramic vessel purchased directly from the L.A. artist Roger Herman and, more recently, a custom maple and linoleum credenza commissioned from the independent furniture maker Doug McCollough.Every item testifies to her gift for collecting unusual, handmade works \u2014 as well as her support for the people behind them. \u201cI don\u2019t really think of it as decorating \u2014 each thing holds this special experience, this story of getting the piece,\u201d she says. \u201cEverybody that I have art from is a friend first. I don\u2019t think I would connect with the work if I didn\u2019t know the person.\u201d That group also includes the artist Sarah Ball, who built Bentley\u2019s bleached-white-oak bed, and whose photographs, which depict everyday objects in unconventional compositions, dot the space throughout. Still, the look is spare. \u201cI left this place a tiny bit empty to allow room for someone else to move in, but I have not met the right person yet,\u201d Bentley says. \u201cI\u2019m taking it as an opportunity to focus on my art.\u201dShe does this in her upstairs studio, where an array of architectural ceramics \u2014 some her own, others by friends Bari Ziperstein, Cody Hoyt, Laida Aguirre and Sean Brian McDonald \u2014 is on display. A white oak Enzo Mari desk is currently covered with collages Bentley has made from the graphic envelope liners of junk mail; there are paintings in progress too, but those, she admits shyly, are hidden away.Bentley keeps her jewelry design separate, working in the studio in the back of her boutique, and her latest accessories reveal an obsession with the Memphis Milano group, including a black and white striped bronze and enamel cuff dubbed the Noguchi bracelet. \u201cI want to take a little bit more risk \u2014 to explore and go a little bit bigger,\u201d she says of her guiding stylistic impulse. An ongoing flirtation with the postmodern movement also manifests itself in the d\u00e9cor, from an Ettore Sottsass table lamp to the boldly color-blocked bedding, a scheme that stars a linen duvet Bentley hand-printed with cobalt ink in a spongeware pattern. (The textile arose from a collaboration last year with furniture designer Shin Okuda of Waka Waka.)\u201cI don\u2019t buy things anymore, or at least, there\u2019s no impulse buying,\u201d she says. \u201cI have the things I want. And it\u2019s a nice place to be, at least for now.\u201d The sentiment seems to encompass her career stage as well as her relatively incognito coordinates, which allow for breathing room and retreat. \u201cThere is no cool coffee shop over here, and it\u2019s such a relief,\u201d she agrees. \u201cI make coffee here. I just stay.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Apps That Make Saving as Effortless as Spending", "Date": "2016-03-25", "News": "Supported bySpecial SectionA new crop of electronic financial tools is trying to help Americans save.The fledgling apps are appealing to consumers like Brittney Gould, a 28-year-old retirement plan consultant in Rockville, Md. Ms. Gould dutifully maximizes automatic paycheck deductions to fund her own workplace 401(k) account. But for shorter-term savings, she uses the mobile app Qapital that lets users set multiple savings goals and have cash transferred into savings, based on rules the user sets.Users can, for instance, tell the app to save $5 every time they buy a latte.Ms. Gould likes being able to customize her account. When she peeks at her iPhone to see how much she has accumulated for pet expenses, she sees a photo of her dog. \u201cIt\u2019s more motivating, and meaningful,\u201d she said. Since she began using the app last June, she has saved about $5,000.Qapital, along with apps like Digit, Dyme, Acorns and many others, strive to use mobile technology to make saving easy and automatic. Aiming mainly at a young clientele, the new tools offer an updated take on traditional, somewhat stodgy savings advice \u2014 start small, contribute regularly and take satisfaction as your balance grows \u2014 in an effort to make saving fun.Americans are generally lackluster savers. Forty-one percent of households lack liquid savings to cover an unexpected $2,000 expense, according to research from the Pew Charitable Trusts, which also found that a lack of saving is a top financial worry, even among families with higher incomes.\u201cThe vast majority of people need to save more, and some should save much more,\u201d said Dan Ariely, a psychologist and behavioral economist at Duke University and the head of CommonCents Lab, which collaborates with Qapital and other financial tools to identify effective saving strategies. (Mr. Ariely was named chief behavioral economist at Qapital in October, and owns shares in the company).Why is it so hard to save? For one thing, our consumer culture is designed to encourage spending. \u201cEvery coffee shop,\u201d he said, \u201cwants you to buy another cup of coffee.\u201dTechnology has also helped make spending \u201cfrictionless,\u201d he said. Think of the convenience of using Uber: With the tap of a phone, a car ride appears.The new tools aim to reverse that pattern, by using technology to make saving as effortless as spending.Paula Pant, 32, a personal finance and real estate blogger in Las Vegas, has used Digit for about a year. \u201cIt pulls tiny amounts that you\u2019re not going to miss,\u201d she said. \u201cYou just let it hum in the background.\u201d After just a few months, she said, she had saved $814.The apps also use humor. Dyme\u2019s texts use \u201cpersonas\u201d like \u201cTerrible Parent\u201d (\u201cWhy can\u2019t you be more like your sister? Text to save $20. Because I said so.\u201d)The apps are not banks themselves, but act as a financial go-between, ferrying funds between the customer\u2019s checking account and a separate account at an actual financial institution, so the funds are F.D.I.C.-insured. One exception is Acorns, which puts money into investments.The apps are not without drawbacks, however. Perhaps the biggest hurdle for some consumers is that the tools, like many popular online budgeting tools, require users to share their checking account numbers and passwords, in order to link the account with the app so it can withdraw funds.Some apps go beyond simple savings and transfer funds into investment accounts, where there is some risk of losing money. Acorns invests the \u201cspare change\u201d from rounding up purchases in fractional shares in low-cost index exchange-traded funds, investments that are similar to mutual funds but trade like stocks. The tool recommends one of five portfolios, depending on their risk tolerance, and rebalances the investments periodically. (While other so-called robo advisers offer many more investment choices, Jeff Cruttenden, co-founder of Acorns, said Acorns offers fewer options by design, so users are not overwhelmed by choice.)Investing small amounts is less intimidating than investing a large lump sum, said Mr. Cruttenden. \u201cStarting with their change is approachable.\u201dWhile the strictly savings apps are free, Acorns charges monthly fees. The basic charge for Acorns accounts with balances of less than $5,000 is one dollar a month. Accounts with more than $5,000 pay 0.25 percent of the balance a year..Jonathan Jansenius, a 23-year-old state worker in Panama City, Fla., said he and his husband used Acorns to save for college for their two young children. \u201cWe have a regular savings account,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I\u2019d never put any money in it.\u201dBecause Acorns transfers small sums, he said, it fosters savings \u201cwithout feeling like it\u2019s taking more out of my paycheck.\u201d After about 18 months, their account has about $900. \u201cI\u2019m not an expert,\u201d he said, \u201c so it\u2019s an entrance into the market.\u201dWhat about the conventional wisdom that it\u2019s best to save first and invest only after establishing a substantial cushion? \u201cAbsolutely, people should save before they invest,\u201d Mr. Cruttenden said. \u201cBut if it helps them save when they otherwise wouldn\u2019t have, that\u2019s very powerful.\u201dIt is not known how successful the apps are in helping people save in the long term. Most of the emerging savings apps lack a clear current revenue source, and rely on start-up capital to fund operations. Qapital, for one, eventually plans to offer a debit card, so users can access their savings directly; the app would earn a share of the fees that the payment networks charge retailers for processing debit purchases.Ann Carrns is a freelance writer who covers personal finance for The New York Times.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Who Gets the Blame for the Slowing Economy?", "Date": "2016-03-10", "News": "Supported byECONOMIC alarm bells are ringing: Financial markets have wilted. Forecasters have been slicing their projections for future growth. And some leading wise men \u2014 including the megabillionaire George Soros \u2014 are predicting a return to disastrous 2008 conditions. That\u2019s almost certainly an overly pessimistic view. But without a doubt, the leading global economies are in a major slowdown.Not evident is whether another recession looms. While current data suggests that modest growth continues in the United States, economists are notoriously bad at forecasting downturns. As The Economist noted, between 1999 and 2014, the International Monetary Fund, in its April forecasts, failed to predict every one of the 220 instances in which one of its members suffered negative annual growth in the next year. Even the Federal Reserve uncharacteristically recently described the outlook as \u201cunclear.\u201dWhat\u2019s unusual about today\u2019s raft of challenges is the extent to which governments around the world have added to the problems, rather than ameliorating them. Poor policy choices, like misguided spending priorities and too much austerity, have added to the drag on growth. Notably, failing to act at all has cut deeply into business and investor confidence, an important support mechanism for markets and consumers alike.Governments alone are not to blame; the reasons for the sagging economies are multifarious and jumbled, more de Kooning than Mondrian.For a start, global competition and weak productivity growth have held down wages in developed countries. That has depressed consumer spending, as have increased saving and growing income inequality, which has pushed more money into the hands of the rich, who are less likely to spend it.Lacking confidence and seeing weak demand, many businesses have held back on investing, and in the challenged energy sector, cuts are rampant. Meanwhile, the rise of capital-efficient businesses \u2014 from Amazon to Uber \u2014 means less spending on machinery and buildings.Well-intentioned efforts to avoid another financial crisis have put the banking system in a straitjacket, discouraging lending and reducing liquidity on trading desks, which has contributed mightily to market gyrations.In turn, weakening credit markets stir fears of corporate bankruptcies. While falling prices of oil and other commodities help industrialized countries, they signal not just rising supply but also disappointing demand.All that said, governments haven\u2019t done enough to help the situation \u2014 and have done a lot to exacerbate it. Closest to home, of course, is gridlock in Washington. Anti-deficit fervor has led to a meat-ax approach to spending cuts, under which nondefense discretionary outlays (which include key pro-growth areas like research and development and infrastructure) have fallen in real terms by nearly 20 percent over the past five years, at a time when they should be growing substantially.Meanwhile, Congress has not passed a comprehensive tax reform package in three decades, which has given clever experts room to develop loophole after loophole, particularly for multinational companies eager to cut their tax bills by sequestering profits overseas.Fueling still more fear among consumers and businessmen alike is the looming presidential election and the surprising strength of contenders like Donald J. Trump and Bernie Sanders, who promise unconventional, and potentially disruptive, changes if elected.Europe is in far worse shape. Bedeviled by a poorly constructed single currency system, the Continent has lurched from crisis to crisis as weaker countries like Greece fail to keep up with the German juggernaut.And while reforming our regulatory apparatus would be a welcome economic positive, that should be urgent business for Europe. Sclerotic labor laws in countries like France result in unyielding double-digit unemployment. In many European countries, regulatory red tape impedes new business start-ups. Germany\u2019s aggressive tilt toward renewable energy has raised costs enormously for its industrial sector.Meanwhile, key private sector actors are particularly fearful that central banks, which have kept growth alive by keeping interest rates near zero, have run out of ammunition, making the need for more robust fiscal policy even more urgent.Then there\u2019s China. Unlike their counterparts in developed countries, Chinese leaders aren\u2019t afraid to act; their problem is that they often don\u2019t seem to know what to do, particularly when it comes to managing financial markets.When Chinese stocks sagged, the authorities exhorted the citizenry to buy them up. As shares soared, they curtailed the ability to purchase shares on margin, causing prices to plummet. Similarly, beginning last August, China made a muddle of its effort to unpeg its currency from the strong dollar, leading to huge capital flight from the country ($159 billion in December alone).Most scary to China watchers is the country\u2019s fast rising debt. All these worries are exacerbated by the country\u2019s opacity; for example, almost no expert believes that China is growing at the nearly 7 percent rate that it claims.The past two recessions were caused largely by private actors: the risky lending of the mid-2000s and the dot-com bubble at the turn of the century.This time, if we fail to break out of the current stagnation \u2014 or worse, fall into global recession \u2014 the fault will lie with our leaders.Steven Rattner is a Wall Street executive and a contributing opinion writer.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": null, "Date": "2016-03-02", "News": "Mr. McClendon is accused of orchestrating a conspiracy in which two oil and gas companies colluded not to bid against each other for the purchase of leases in northwestern Oklahoma from late 2007 to early 2012. The Justice Department said the companies decided who would win the leases and the winner would allot an interest in the leases to the other company. \u00e2\u0080\u009cHis actions put company profits ahead of the interests of leaseholders entitled to competitive bids for oil and gas rights on their land,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said William J.

Mr. McClendon, an audacious chief executive at Chesapeake until he was forced to step down three years ago, became a billionaire as the company aggressively outbid competitors for land leases and drilled highly productive wells in virtually every major shale gas field in the country. Chesapeake\u00e2\u0080\u0099s stock price has been sinking for five years now, especially since it was revealed that Mr. McClendon had taken a personal stake in Chesapeake wells and used it as collateral for up to $1.1 billion in loans used mostly to pay for his share of the cost of drilling those wells. Gordon Pennoyer, a spokesman for Chesapeake, said the company was cooperating with the antitrust investigation and did not expect to face prosecution or fines related to the matter.This creates a culture of \u00e2\u0080\u009chaves\u00e2\u0080\u009d and \u00e2\u0080\u009chave-nots,\u00e2\u0080\u009d where a vote is worth everything or nothing.

RBC Capital Markets, found that the New York Stock Exchange, Nasdaq and other exchanges make frequent small tweaks to their prices, influencing trading behavior in ways that are hard for even sophisticated investors to understand.

{"Headline": "For China Banks, Swapping Stock for Debt Is a Stopgap With Pitfalls", "Date": "2016-03-10", "News": "Supported byHONG KONG \u2014 A new approach to managing China\u2019s corporate debt burden may offer temporary relief for banks but spell further difficulties for the country\u2019s economy: having deeply troubled companies use stock to pay overdue loans.Early evidence of the strategy emerged late Thursday, when a heavily indebted Chinese shipbuilder disclosed that it would issue equity to its creditors, instead of repaying $2.17 billion in bank loans.If Chinese companies were to broadly adopt the approach for their debt issues, banks could temporarily shore up their balance sheets by replacing troubled loans with shares that have at least some value. But accepting stakes in highly indebted companies is likely to make banks even more reluctant to shut them down.And that could mean China will be stuck with enormous overcapacity in industrial sectors including shipbuilding, steel and cement, hampering economic growth for years to come.\u201cThe program amounts to a sleight of hand that beautifies bank balance sheets but hardly comes to grips with the basic problems of bad loans, distorted incentives in the banking and state enterprise systems, and weak financial regulation,\u201d said Eswar S. Prasad, an economist at Cornell University who used to lead the China division at the International Monetary Fund. \u201cThis is a classic case of putting lipstick on a pig. Bank balance sheets may look prettier but nothing fundamental changes.\u201dThis latest strategy has some advantages. It would allow companies to cut their debt loads. In doing so, they could potentially improve their credit profiles, borrow more from banks, and keep their businesses running.It also makes banks\u2019 loan books appear healthier, since they can reduce the amount of past-due loans. Financial markets have been fixated on Chinese banks\u2019 portfolios of so-called nonperforming loans. And halting the recent expansion of these loans has become a high priority for Chinese bank executives.While repaying loans with shares might seem a quick solution to China\u2019s enormous debt overhang, it could make the problems more pernicious.In effect, it is just another way for troubled Chinese companies to put off making hard choices, like laying off employees or closing operations. Rather, businesses can continue to limp along, even when their underlying operations are not making money and customer demand has evaporated.Such problems have been at the root of China\u2019s economic issues, as many state-owned enterprises, or S.O.E.s, and private companies have continued to roll over the debt and keep their operations going. The government has supported the tactic, in an effort to avert mass layoffs and maintain social stability.The new approach is \u201cin a nutshell, very bad news for S.O.E. reform and, more specifically, for the solvency of Chinese banks,\u201d said Alicia Garcia Herrero, the chief economist for Asia at Natixis, a French investment bank.At this point, it is unclear how widespread this strategy has become among Chinese companies. The shipbuilder, China Huarong Energy Company Limited, had to disclose the move only because it is listed on the Hong Kong stock market. Mainland companies not listed overseas do not face the same stringent rules.Officials at the People\u2019s Bank of China, the country\u2019s central bank, and the China Banking Regulatory Commission could not be reached for comment late Thursday night. Zhou Xiaochuan, the central bank\u2019s governor, and three of his deputies are scheduled to hold a news conference on Saturday morning in Beijing, near the session of the National People\u2019s Congress.The debt issue is core to the debate over where China\u2019s economy is headed.China avoided most of the ill effects of the global financial crisis by ordering the state-controlled banking system to engineer a major increase in the money supply. Those banks channeled huge loans to companies and to government construction projects.China\u2019s economy is faltering, prompting concerns that are now shaking global stock markets.While the stimulus helped stoke growth, the country\u2019s debt burden ballooned.Overall debt in China was equal to slightly more than one year\u2019s economic output as recently as 2008. It now stands at 2.5 years\u2019 economic output \u2014 above levels considered dangerous in other countries. The debt is still rising, and most of it is owed by companies.The stock-for-debt strategy speaks to the underlying trouble at many companies.China Huarong Energy has been a dismal performer on the Hong Kong stock market. Its shares have tumbled even more steeply than broad mainland Chinese stock indexes, falling 83 percent since late April 2015.The stock-for-debt swap is taking shape as Hong Kong financiers say that China\u2019s bad debt problem has worsened appreciably in recent weeks. The problem, they said in recent interviews, is that more companies are stopping payments on their loans from mainland Chinese banks with the country\u2019s economy continuing to slow.That has begun to produce ripples in China\u2019s financial system. Desperate borrowers have pledged in recent weeks to pay several percentage points in extra interest to borrow in Hong Kong, after finding that banks and other financial institutions on the mainland were reluctant to lend.HSBC warned on Thursday that allowing borrowers to pay in shares was a limited solution to bad debt problems. International bank standards on capital assign a large penalty to holdings of shares, meaning banks must hold extra money against the stock.But China\u2019s five biggest banks have somewhat more capital than the standards require. So they may be able to swap some loans for shares without falling below the required minimums for capital, but are unlikely to resolve large portions of their portfolios of troubled loans through this method.\u201cWe think it is unlikely to be of significant scale given there are limited ways of replenishing\u201d capital once it has been allocated to offset equity holdings, HSBC said in a research note.Advertisement"}
