{"Headline": "Karen Hall Alters \u2018Dark Debts\u2019 in a New Edition", "Date": "2016-03-15", "News": "Supported by\u201cDark Debts\u201d was an instant success when Random House published it in 1996, with a 150,000-copy print run. Paramount optioned the film rights. Fans hounded her for a sequel, and Ms. Hall\u2019s publisher and agent urged her to write another novel to capitalize on the momentum. \u201cI can only hope that Ms. Hall will read these reviews, and will provide her readers with another work of fiction,\u201d a reader pleaded in a 2001 Amazon review.She never wrote another book. Instead, Ms. Hall spent the next two decades obsessing about the flaws of \u201cDark Debts.\u201d\u201cI never stopped thinking about it,\u201d said Ms. Hall, 59. \u201cI never said it aloud to anybody, but I always knew I would never write another book until I got this one right.\u201d\u201cI had barely been able to read it in the last 20 years, because everything I didn\u2019t like about it made me cringe,\u201d Ms. Hall said. \u201cBoy, I was in love with the sound of my own voice.\u201dMost artists and writers have lingering regrets about their early work, but very few of them actually get a second shot. It is rare for a novelist to exhume an old story, and even more unusual for a publisher to risk rereleasing a decades-old book that has gone out of print.Luckily for Ms. Hall, her former editor, Jonathan Karp, shared her obsession with \u201cDark Debts,\u201d and her nagging feeling that the book could have been better.\u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s ever been another book quite like it, \u201d said Mr. Karp, who is now the publisher of Simon & Schuster. \u201cIt was the smartest pop thriller I ever read.\u201dThe plan to republish it came about two years ago, when Audible approached Ms. Hall about adapting the novel into an audio drama. When Ms. Hall mentioned the project to Mr. Karp, he suggested releasing an anniversary edition of the book with him at Simon & Schuster. She told him she wanted to republish it only if she could rewrite it.Mr. Karp, who called Ms. Hall \u201cmy own personal Harper Lee,\u201d had been waiting for another book from her for years, and immediately agreed to publish a new version.\u201cKaren never felt like she nailed it, and I didn\u2019t disagree with that,\u201d Mr. Karp said. \u201cThere are so many books as a publisher where you miss the mark a little bit, either commercially or critically, and I\u2019ve often wondered, why wouldn\u2019t a writer want to try it again?\u201dMs. Hall wanted to be a writer for as long as she can remember. Growing up in Chatham, Va., she and her sister, Barbara, entertained themselves by writing stories and novelizations of their favorite TV shows.When she was 23, Ms. Hall moved to Los Angeles to become a TV writer. She was the first woman to join the writing staff of \u201cM*A*S*H\u201d in 1980. She encouraged her sister to join her in Hollywood, and both went on to have successful TV writing careers. Barbara worked on \u201cFamily Ties\u201d and went on to create and produce \u201cJudging Amy,\u201d \u201cJoan of Arcadia\u201d and \u201cMadam Secretary.\u201d Karen wrote for \u201cRoseanne,\u201d \u201cNorthern Exposure\u201d and \u201cThe Good Wife.\u201dWhen it came to writing fiction, their careers diverged dramatically. Barbara has published 11 books, while Karen has spent 25 years working out the kinks in a single novel.\u201cShe completely immerses herself in what she writes,\u201d Barbara said. \u201cIt\u2019s fascinating to watch.\u201dIn \u201cDark Debts,\u201d Ms. Hall took the premise of a demonic curse and spun it into a thriller about a Georgia family tormented by the devil. A Jesuit priest, Michael Kinney, who is in love with a woman and drifting from his faith, intervenes and attempts to save one of the surviving family members, Jack, from the demon. Father Kinney teams up with a reporter named Randa, who has fallen in love with Jack. The resulting novel was a Southern Gothic-flavored existential mystery, with thorny theological debates about good and evil blended with graphic violence and an unlikely romance.The novel wasn\u2019t universally celebrated. Entertainment Weekly gave it a C-, and dismissed it as \u201cblasphemous twaddle.\u201d The Paramount film never got off the ground.But the book changed Ms. Hall\u2019s life in profound ways. She was raised Methodist but had always felt drawn to Catholicism, and while researching the novel and talking to priests, she decided to convert. Two years after \u201cDark Debts\u201d was published, her former high school boyfriend, Chris Walker, who had first introduced her to Catholicism, contacted her through her publisher\u2019s website to say he enjoyed the novel. They have now been married for 16 years and live in Boone, N.C., where they own a small independent store, Black Bear Books.Ms. Hall tried to write a sequel, partly to appease fans but also to atone for what she felt was a flawed ending. (In the earlier version, Father Kinney leaves the priesthood to be with the woman he loves.) But she never made it past the first chapter, despite writing 25 openings.Now satisfied with the ending of \u201cDark Debts,\u201d Ms. Hall said she is finally ready to write something new.\u201cMy problem is I have an idea that could be a novel once every 20 years,\u201d she said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "\u2018Triumph of the Will\u2019: Fascist Rants and the Hollywood Response", "Date": "2016-03-03", "News": "Supported byOn DVDBrilliant, tedious and irredeemably evil, Leni Riefenstahl\u2019s \u201cTriumph of the Will\u201d (1935) is one of the great conundrums of cinema history.A supremely artful feature-length recording of the 1934 Nazi Party Congress, commissioned, according its credits, by order of the F\u00fchrer, \u201cTriumph of the Will\u201d raises a host of moral and aesthetic questions. (The only real equivalent is D. W. Griffith\u2019s white supremacist magnum opus, \u201cThe Birth of a Nation.\u201d) Is \u201cTriumph of the Will\u201d a brilliantly innovative documentary? Is it a propaganda masterpiece? A work of art \u2014 or simply, as Zero Mostel says in \u201cThe Producers\u201d of his calculated Broadway flop, \u201ca love letter to Hitler\u201d?Riefenstahl (1902-2003), who produced, directed and for a time distributed the film (reissued on Blu-ray by Synapse Films), denied political intent, claiming that the film was cinema v\u00e9rit\u00e9. In reality, it was a colossal photo op. The three-day congress and the movie were planned simultaneously. Riefenstahl had a small army of technicians, including 16 uniformed cameramen, at her disposal. The City of Nuremberg contributed constructions, some designed by Albert Speer, to facilitate her film\u2019s dramatic low or overhead angles, strategic dolly shots and dynamic use of scale.Riefenstahl\u2019s mass formations of marching members of the Hitler Youth remind many film historians of the dance numbers choreographed in Hollywood by Busby Berkeley. Like Berkeley, Riefenstahl understood the power of synchronized sound. The music in her film is nearly continuous; shots showing a sea of Nazi banners or a forest of upraised arms are edited to the beat.\u201cTriumph of the Will\u201d is a demonstration of cinematic might \u2014 and guile. The impression of a totally organized and controlled Woodstock-like event was achieved through rehearsals, camera placement, inserted footage and post-dubbing, as with the supposedly spontaneous choral singing and the thunderous cries of \u201cEin Volk, ein Reich, ein F\u00fchrer!\u201dProduction numbers aside, \u201cTriumph of the Will\u201d is devoted largely to speechifying. While Hitler is a star performer, who practiced his histrionic gestures before a mirror, his colleagues are not. So stupefying are their exhortations and oaths of fealty, the movie might have been made as much to lull as to agitate. By the time it ends, after a lugubrious third nighttime rally, with a mass rendition of the Nazi anthem \u201cThe Horst Wessel Song,\u201d you expect to see a giant swastika go into a hypnotic spin.Film Culture magazine put Riefenstahl on the cover of its Spring 1973 issue and paid tribute with a dozen articles. One by Ken Kelman, a member of the Anthology Film Archives selection committee, extolled \u201cTriumph of the Will\u201d as \u201cthe definitive cinematic obliteration of the division between fantasy and \u2018reality.\u2019\u201d For me, it\u2019s impossible not to read that as a warning.Starting with Charlie Chaplin\u2019s \u201cThe Great Dictator,\u201d \u201cTriumph of the Will\u201d provided material for anti-Nazi satire; it also figured as an image of the Nazi new order in Hollywood\u2019s wartime efforts. Two examples, \u201cHitler\u2019s Children\u201d and \u201cHitler\u2019s Madman\u201d (both quickly made low-budget films from 1943), are available on DVD from Warner Archive.\u201cHitler\u2019s Children\u201d is framed by miniature versions of the Nuremberg Congress, with German teenagers clustered around a bonfire consecrating their lives to the F\u00fchrer. Lurid yet turgid, the movie is a tale of doomed puppy love, Nazi eugenics and sexual sadism. Ads featured the image of a freedom-loving American girl (Bonita Granville, Hollywood\u2019s original Nancy Drew) given a ritual flogging by a member of the SS.Like \u201cHangmen Also Die!\u201d (1943), Fritz Lang\u2019s film on the same subject, \u201cHitler\u2019s Madman\u201d involved significant German \u00e9migr\u00e9 talent: It was produced by Seymour Nebenzal, whose credits included Lang\u2019s \u201cM,\u201d and was directed by the recently arrived Douglas Sirk. Eugen Sch\u00fcfftan, who shot \u201cMetropolis,\u201d worked (uncredited) on the cinematography; Edgar G. Ulmer (also uncredited) was responsible for the sets.The Nazis are portrayed as viciously anti-Christian. (Although the screenplay was partly written by the Yiddish-language playwright Peretz Hirschbein, Nazi anti-Semitism is not a factor.) Religious iconography adds to the dark fairy-tale ambience. The most alarming special effect is John Carradine\u2019s performance as Heydrich, gaunt and implacable as a medieval Death.Sirk intended his movie to be \u201calmost like a documentary,\u201d Carradine\u2019s cold, self-dramatizing impersonation not least. The filmmaker had once met Heydrich at a Berlin reception. \u201cCarradine was Heydrich,\u201d he told an interviewer, adding, \u201ca lot of Nazis behaved like Shakespearean actors.\u201dNEWLY RELEASEDAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Con Edison Aims to Revamp Customer Service, Saving Energy Too", "Date": "2016-03-10", "News": "Supported byUnder the effort, about 270,000 New York customers in Brooklyn and Westchester County will start receiving personalized reports about their energy use with recommendations on specific energy-related products \u2014 like a smart thermostat or rooftop solar system \u2014 that they can install to lower their bills.For the effort, Con Ed has embarked on a multiyear agreement with the home energy management company Opower to help better analyze residential energy use and upgrade communications with customers, both online and on paper.\u201cEverything you do online is simple, easy, convenient, and we just need to get there,\u201d said James Brennan, director of demonstration projects in the distributed resource integration department at Con Edison. \u201cWe need to make it as simple and easy and efficient as we can, whether they\u2019re paying their bill, whether they\u2019re buying a thermostat, whether they\u2019re buying a TV.\u201dFacing competition from alternative service providers \u2014 including cable companies offering wireless home energy management systems and upstarts selling rooftop solar \u2014 electric companies across the county are experimenting with ways to engage their customers and strengthen their relationships with them while helping them save energy.Among the most successful is a program at Duke Energy, one of the nation\u2019s largest utilities, with Tendril, an energy management company based in Boulder, Colo. Using home energy reports that explain to customers how their energy use compares with similar homes in their areas and how they might reduce that use, the program has saved more than a terawatt-hour of electricity since it started in 2010. That is enough to light more than one million homes for a year in the Duke Energy service territory, which covers parts of several states including Ohio, Indiana and the Carolinas, the company said.Suggesting behavioral changes like hanging the laundry out to dry once a week and using energy-efficient products and services, as well as sending out email alerts when weather patterns suggest a customer might use more energy than usual, has resulted in about 1 to 3 percent in savings each year, said Adrian Tuck, Tendril\u2019s chief executive.Executives at Duke, who developed and tested an energy savings program internally for two years before seeking an outside company to design and manage a larger-scale program, have been happy with the results.\u201cIf we can get this cumulative effect from all of these customers taking the tips and putting them into action, certainly we\u2019re still going to have to build power plants, but it postpones the effort,\u201d said Kelly Kuehn, senior product and services manager at the utility.In New York, the program includes a demonstration project approved under the Reforming the Energy Vision, known as REV, from Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, who aims to remake the state\u2019s energy system and help utilities find new revenue sources.The demonstration project, called Connected Homes, is intended to increase customer adoption of energy-saving and energy-generating products. For the selected customers, the home energy reports might suggest installing a SunPower solar system or a Nest thermostat, which can be adjusted remotely.By matching customer usage and heating and cooling patterns with data like homeownership status and location, the Opower system can make it easier to promote the products to the households most likely to buy them. The effort, which will also include a website for customers to research and buy energy-efficient appliances, products and services, is expected to expand as Con Edison completes negotiations with other providers and introduces smart meters next year.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Eternal Appeal of the Underdog", "Date": "2016-03-15", "News": "Supported byOp-Ed ContributorsBut come March, we\u2019re suddenly Governors fans. We want the underdog teams to beat the heavyweights like Kansas, Duke and Michigan State. We want the little guys to triumph. At least we think we do.Another study revealed that underdog status doesn\u2019t merely inspire rooting, it also changes our perception of what we see on the court. When told that a team was the underdog, research participants saw a play like a defender getting close to an opponent and knocking the ball away as reflecting hustle and grit. When watching the very same play, but under the impression that it came from the favored team instead, people saw the tough defense as more of a reflection of natural ability, not effort.To those of us who watch sports, the appeal of the underdog may seem utterly normal and even instinctual. But there\u2019s something counterintuitive about it all. So often in life we try to associate ourselves with winning and success. We are quick to name-drop, hop on bandwagons and buy luxury brands that convey status. Why, then, do we hitch our own wagons to teams that, by definition, are more likely than not to fail?A variety of reasons, actually. There\u2019s the idea of emotional payoff. There\u2019s more potential for return on the investment when you root for the underdog than when the expected happens and the favorite wins. We get such a surge from seeing upsets, and cheering for the least likely outcome, that we\u2019re willing to risk the lesser odds.But perhaps most of all, we\u2019re drawn to the message that giants can be toppled, that with a little luck we, too, can overcome.Politicians know this, too. Bill Clinton might be a Rhodes scholar who went to Yale Law School, but on the campaign trail he was always just a modest guy from a small town in Arkansas. This year is no different. Voters can opt for the son of a hard-working immigrant bartender (Marco Rubio) or the son of a humble pastor (Ted Cruz).On the Democratic side, voters can support the potential first female president. Or the first Jewish president. All politicians seem to want us to think they have underdog status and were born in a log cabin, as President Clinton himself once noted. A candidate who presumably would have decorated that log cabin with, say, his own last name and logo in gaudy gold lettering frames his campaign through the lens of outsider cachet.Yet with our fondness for the underdog, we usually say one thing and do the other. We love underdog independent bookstores but still spend more money at Amazon. We love the neighborhood Italian joint but still take the kids to Olive Garden. We say all the right things about supporting local businesses, but convenience and discount prices often win out.Same with sports: When it\u2019s time to fill out those March Madness brackets, we are likely to rely too much on the favorites. Research on N.F.L. betting over two decades indicates that underdogs at home football games cover the point spread more than half of the time and yet they draw only 40 percent of betting money.It\u2019s an intoxicating, yet often fleeting and shallow fling, our romance with the underdog. We\u2019re enthralled by David, but wager more on Goliath. We\u2019ll spend this Thursday and Friday rooting for basketball Cinderella stories, but still festoon our walls with the logos of favorites.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "CrowdSignals Aims to Create a Marketplace for Smartphone Sensor Data", "Date": "2016-03-22", "News": "Supported byWords and pictures, culled from across the web, have been the digital grist for remarkable gains in computing tasks like image recognition and speech translation. But another huge data resource \u2014 sensor data from smartphones \u2014 lags behind as a fuel source for major research advances.CrowdSignals, a new initiative to collect, label and pay for mobile sensor data, seeks to overcome that shortfall. The organization\u2019s approach relies less on innovation in technology than on economics and creating a marketplace for sensor data.\u201cWe haven\u2019t even begun to tap the potential of smartphone data,\u201d said Evan Welbourne, a computer scientist who heads the CrowdSignals project.The promising future of mobile data, experts agree, is that it can point the way to new insights in health care, transportation, urban planning and the social sciences.But such mobile data is typically costly and time-consuming to collect for researchers, and it is difficult to interpret.The big improvement in fields like vision recognition have come from vast data sources and steadily improving software techniques in a branch of artificial intelligence called machine learning.Yet that high-tech wizardry relies on human help. The software is trained on sets of data that have been labeled by humans \u2014 identifying, for example, the pictures of cats, dogs and horses.Building human-labeled data sets is straightforward with pictures and words. Humans can identify images quickly and accurately.The labeling challenge is trickier with mobile sensor data. For example, a person contributing data has to log in when walking, running or biking. If a researcher wants to correlate mood with activity, the contributor might have to answer a question or two on a touch screen.Data from a personal device \u2014 a smartphone or smartwatch \u2014 is also sensitive, raising issues of data use and privacy, which complicates the collection of sensor data.The development of software models using mobile sensor data has been hindered, said Deborah Estrin, a professor of computer science at Cornell Tech, because of \u201cthe absence of labeled data sets. And the reason for that is the lack of a community effort to do that in an ethical, efficient way.\u201dMs. Estrin is one of several computer scientists from universities around the world who are advisers to CrowdSignals, as are researchers at companies like Microsoft and Intel.Most research using mobile data has tracked relatively small numbers of people in a single city or region, often using proprietary data from mobile carriers or device makers. CrowdSignals is intended to overcome those limitations, said Daniel Gatica-Perez, a researcher at Idiap Research Institute in Switzerland, who is an adviser on the project.Both Apple and Samsung have introduced software tools for collecting and sharing mobile data. Samsung\u2019s SAMI is a data exchange platform where developers can place their data and work with others. Apple\u2019s Research Kit allows iPhone users to share their data for use in research projects, often health-related studies.CrowdSignals is trying to build a marketplace for data with financial incentives for people to participate and label their data. All the data will be anonymized, the organization says.CrowdSignals\u2019 long-range goal is to have thousands of participants in studies, but it is starting with a pilot project. It hopes to raise $15,000 in the initial crowdfunding round, Mr. Welbourne said, and then recruit 30 to 50 participants whose smartphone data will be collected for a month.In the pilot, the CrowdSignals software can handle data only from people whose smartphones use Google\u2019s Android operating system. Later, Mr. Welbourne hopes to accommodate users of Apple iPhones as well.The participants, he said, will be paid a flat rate of about $100 for the month. But the compensation can go up or down, depending on how much personal data they choose to share. In addition, they will receive incentive payments of up to a few dollars for labeling their data.Much of crowdsourced funds, Mr. Welbourne said, will go toward selecting and educating participants. The outreach will be by websites and follow-up emails. CrowdSignals will also have videos and individual Skype calls to explain the project. Even the pilot, Mr. Welbourne said, will try to enlist a diverse group by gender, age, geographic location and ethnicity.University and corporate researchers who are crowdfunders will get first access to the data set: Academics will pay a $20 license fee and corporate researchers will pay $50. The licenses last five years, but after one year the data set will be free for academic use.A former researcher at Amazon, Samsung and Nokia, Mr. Welbourne plans to build a business by creating software models for specific industries like health care and mobile device makers, based on the same CrowdSignals data available to all licensees. His Seattle start-up, AlgoSnap, was founded last year.Mr. Welbourne\u2019s business plan is a bet that the CrowdSignals pilot succeeds. If it does, he intends to spin off CrowdSignals as a nonprofit entity. \u201cIt\u2019s a little more appropriate for the data collection and research,\u201d he said.A challenge for the CrowdSignals, assuming it takes off, experts say, will be fostering trust among large numbers of people beyond the early participants.\u201cNavigating the privacy issue may be an uphill battle,\u201d said Jason I. Hong, a computer scientist at Carnegie Mellon University and an adviser. \u201cBut this is a really clever idea over all. If it works, we\u2019ll have larger, richer data sets for researchers in universities and corporations.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Once a Darling, Spanish Solar Company Abengoa Faces Reckoning", "Date": "2016-03-17", "News": "Supported byAnnouncing government support for clean-energy projects, President Obama hailed a Spanish company, saying its new solar technology would supply tens of thousands of American homes with renewable power, while spurring local employment.Since then, the Spanish company, Abengoa, has built two American plants, in Arizona and California, supplying electricity to more than 160,000 homes. It is the world leader in a technology known as solar thermal, with operations from Algeria to Latin America.But Abengoa\u2019s global ambitions are now the source of its troubles.Saddled with debt from its expansion, the company is scrambling to avoid what would be the largest bankruptcy in Spanish corporate history. Creditors and shareholders are taking the company to court as losses mount and crucial financial support disappears.The company\u2019s changing fortunes, from industry darling to financial invalid, are an extreme example of the challenges facing players in the renewable energy business.In Abengoa\u2019s case, its signature American projects still have around $2 billion in outstanding loans guaranteed by the United States government, and the company benefited heavily from subsidies in Spain. But its solar thermal projects have been slow to turn a profit and generate little income in the interim, amplifying its cash squeeze.\u201cI always had the intuition that so much corporate ambition would end up bursting at the seams,\u201d he said.Founded by two engineers in Seville in 1941, Abengoa initially set out to manufacture a type of electricity meter. Though the meter never gained traction, the company began installing auxiliary panels for power stations and electrical systems for buildings.By the 1960s, it began expanding overseas to Central and South America, with projects like erecting transmission lines in Argentina. It made its first foray into renewables in the 1980s.In 2007, the company established the world\u2019s first commercial solar thermal power plant in Sanl\u00facar la Mayor. On the outskirts of Seville, a handful of towers dominate the farming landscape, rising above sunflower and cattle fields like modern obelisks to solar energy.In a solar thermal power plant, mirrors reflect the sun\u2019s rays toward the top of each tower, concentrating the light and generating high enough temperatures to heat up a transfer fluid. That heat creates steam to power a turbine, generating electricity.Abengoa now accounts for more than a quarter of the five gigawatts produced worldwide by solar thermal plants. Unlike conventional solar power, the thermal technology allows energy to be stored, meaning the turbines can generate power for hours after the sun sets.The same year the Sanl\u00facar plant opened, Abengoa\u2019s stock price hit a record high of 7.39 euros a share. By November, when it began insolvency proceedings, it had fallen below 40 euro cents. It now sits at 71 euro cents.Since then, Abengoa has been looking for a lifeline to restructure its $10.3 billion of debt.Spanish law gives the company four months to right the ship. And last week, Abengoa said it had reached an agreement with creditors, a deal that requires final approval.As part of the restructuring, Abengoa\u2019s global activities \u2014 from transmission lines across the Amazon, to water desalination plants in Algeria and Ghana \u2014 could all be up for grabs.\u201cMy expectation is that a lot of Spanish know-how will end up in foreign hands,\u201d said Javier Garc\u00eda Breva, a renewable energy expert who is president of N2E, a consultancy.For now, Abengoa says the deal will not affect its operations in the United States, where the company holds a 42 percent stake in Atlantica Yield, which runs two solar thermal plants in Gila Bend, Ariz., and near Barstow, Calif.The plants, known as Solana and Mojave, have drawn criticism for years over the American government\u2019s backing.Abengoa says that nearly $1 billion of the federally guaranteed loans has been repaid.

{"Headline": "Flinging Emojis, Twitch Chatters Revel as Julia Child Cooks", "Date": "2016-03-20", "News": "Supported byBitsWhen I was a teenager, my friends and I had a blast watching television together \u2014 often really bad television \u2014 and mocking it ceaselessly. We became the entertainment, not whatever clumsy dialogue or plot twist we derided.The Julia Child marathon took place on Twitch, a service owned by Amazon that has developed a gigantic online audience by letting gamers broadcast themselves playing Counter-Strike, League of Legends and other games over the Internet.While there are plenty of other video streaming sites \u2014 notably, the much larger YouTube \u2014 a big part of Twitch\u2019s magic is how audiences interact with each other and broadcasters in real time through a chat room adjacent to whatever video is streaming.With the Julia Child marathon on Twitch, the peanut gallery was everything. If you want to carefully study Mrs. Child\u2019s technique for making roast duck \u00e0 l\u2019orange, there are much better places to find episodes of \u201cThe French Chef\u201d online, including iTunes and YouTube. Nowhere else but Twitch could you see Mrs. Child lionized for her knife skills as though she had disemboweled an enemy in Mortal Kombat.\u201cThis stage is difficult, but Julia is executing this perfectly, top level player,\u201d one Twitch viewer wrote.This was the second time Twitch has turned to a dead public television icon to branch out from its usual game-heavy content. Last year, it surprised a lot of people \u2014 Twitch executives included \u2014 when a weeklong stream of more than 400 episodes of \u201cThe Joy of Painting,\u201d featuring the landscape artist Bob Ross, attracted 5.6 million viewers.After \u201cThe French Chef\u201d marathon concluded Saturday evening, Twitch began showing a batch of other cooking programs on a new food channel, including \u201cJulia and Jacques \u2014 Cooking at Home\u201d featuring Mrs. Child and the chef Jacques P\u00e9pin, and \u201cA Taste of History\u201d with the chef Walter Staib.The Twitch chat rooms around \u201cThe French Chef\u201d and \u201cJoy of Painting\u201d events were a thicket of gamer in-jokes, jargon and emojis (they\u2019re called \u201cemotes\u201d on Twitch). The community generates memes \u2014 popular online jokes and catchphrases \u2014 at a head-spinning pace, a lot of it indecipherable to people who aren\u2019t fluent in the native tongue of Twitch and game culture.At first, I felt as if I was Neo in \u201cThe Matrix,\u201d watching incomprehensible lines of code cascading down the screen in front of me. I caught on with some Googling and consulting with insiders at Twitch. A lot of the chat was sophomoric, some of it was offensive, but enough was so funny and well-timed that I kept coming back for more.In one early episode, Mrs. Child used a wooden mallet to whack a carving knife through the spine of a roasted chicken. It was an amusingly violent scene, one that the Twitch chat room ran with, turning her into a Hannibal Lecter with an apron.\u201cHAMMER TIME ... SAVAGE ... THE HORROR ... THE BUTCHERER,\u201d the messages flew by.The chat room roared with Mrs. Child\u2019s copious use of butter and different forms of alcohol in her recipes. Whenever she dumped salt onto a dish, a flood of salt can emojis followed.When Mrs. Child employed some deft knife work, the Twitch chat room filled with the letters VAC. I later learned that the expression stands for Valve Anti-Cheat, software that detects whether players are cheating in games made by the publisher Valve, such as Counter-Strike. The suggestion seemed to be that Mrs. Child's kitchen skills were so expert as to be suspicious.Ultimately, Mrs. Child did not attract as many viewers as Mr. Ross did on Twitch. At the peak, about 8,000 viewers were watching her at the same time, compared with about 183,000 for Mr. Ross, according to Twitch.Whenever I checked, the size of her audience was sufficient to place her in the top 25 broadcasters on Twitch at those moments. About 1 million viewers total tuned into the show at some point during the marathon \u2014 not bad for a television show that started more than half a century ago.In this case, Mrs. Child\u2019s show was the appetizer. The Twitch community was the main course.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Echo From Amazon Brims With Groundbreaking Promise", "Date": "2016-03-09", "News": "Supported byState of the ArtMany of the world\u2019s largest technology companies have spent the last five years searching in vain for the holy grail, a machine to succeed the smartphone as the next must-have gadget.They have made digital watches and fitness trackers, all manner of computerized glasses and goggles, and more doodads to plug into your TV than there are shows to watch on it.This time it may be different. A bit more than a year after its release, the Echo has morphed from a gimmicky experiment into a device that brims with profound possibility. The longer I use it, the more regularly it inspires the same sense of promise I felt when I used the first iPhone \u2014 a sense this machine is opening up a vast new realm in personal computing, and gently expanding the role that computers will play in our future.What is most interesting about the Echo is that it came out of nowhere. It isn\u2019t much to look at, and even describing its utility is difficult. Here is a small, stationary machine that you set somewhere in your house, which you address as Alexa, which performs a variety of tasks \u2014 playing music, reading the news and weather, keeping a shopping list \u2014 that you can already do on your phone.But the Echo has a way of sneaking into your routines. When Alexa reorders popcorn for you, or calls an Uber car for you, when your children start asking Alexa to add Popsicles to the grocery list, you start to want pretty much everything else in life to be Alexa-enabled, too.In this way, Amazon has found a surreptitious way to bypass Apple and Google \u2014 the reigning monarchs in the smartphone world \u2014 with a gadget that has the potential to become a dominant force in the most intimate of environments: our homes.Scot Wingo, the chairman of ChannelAdvisor, an e-commerce consulting firm, said the early signs suggested that the Echo was on a path to become Amazon\u2019s next $1 billion business.\u201cIt\u2019s one of the most sold-out things that I see on Amazon,\u201d Mr. Wingo said. \u201cIt\u2019s an unusual thing for Amazon to be out of something, but for the Echo, it\u2019s usually in stock just for a couple weeks before it goes out of stock for a few days \u2014 so it feels like they\u2019re having trouble making enough of the devices.\u201d Mr. Wingo noted the Echo, which Amazon sells for $180 only through its own site, was selling for $200 to $300 on eBay.During an interview at a media event last week, Dave Limp, Amazon\u2019s senior vice president for devices, said the company created the Echo because it had seen interesting possibilities arising out of advances in microphone technology, speech recognition and cloud connectivity. Amazon\u2019s engineers spent years perfecting the device\u2019s unusual capabilities. Unlike competing assistants, the Echo can be activated hands-free from far across the room (Siri only works from a couple of feet away), and it can decipher your voice in noisy environments, even when it\u2019s playing music.Amazon also worked to make sure the device responded very quickly. \u201cEarly on in the product, to play music took eight or nine seconds, and it\u2019s just unusable when it\u2019s like that,\u201d Mr. Limp said. \u201cNow it\u2019s often 1,000 milliseconds or 1,200 milliseconds.\u201dThe speed makes a crucial difference. Compared with the trudge of chatting with Siri, speaking to Alexa feels natural, closer to speaking to a human than a machine \u2014 and even when it gets your request wrong, which in your early days with the device will happen often, it doesn\u2019t feel like you have paid a huge penalty for trying.More important, just like the early iPhone, Amazon has managed to turn the Echo into the center of a new ecosystem. Developers are flocking to create voice-controlled apps for the device, or skills, as Amazon calls them. There are now more than 300 skills for the Echo, from the trivial \u2014 there is one to make Alexa produce rude body sounds on command \u2014 to the pretty handy. It can tell you transit schedules, start a seven-minute workout, read recipes, do math and conversions, and walk you through adventure games, among other possibilities.Makers of digital home devices like Nest are also rushing to make their products compatible with the Echo. Alexa can now control your Internet-connected lights, home thermostats and a variety of other devices. Hardware makers can also add Alexa\u2019s brain into their own devices, so soon you won\u2019t need an Echo to consult with Alexa \u2014 you could find it in your toaster, your refrigerator or your car.The Echo also ties in to Amazon\u2019s main business, its retail store. When you tell it to reorder popcorn, it gets your order through Amazon, of course. Still, Mr. Wingo noted that Amazon had so far kept the platform relatively open \u2014 other retailers and product manufacturers are free to build their own apps that will allow for interactions with their stores.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Apple Is Rolling Up Backers in iPhone Privacy Fight Against F.B.I.", "Date": "2016-03-03", "News": "Supported byThe extraordinary show of support for Apple from the tech companies, including many rivals, underscores how high the stakes are for the industry with the case, in which the authorities are demanding Apple\u2019s help to break into an iPhone used by a gunman in a terrorist attack in San Bernardino, Calif., last year.In all, around 40 companies and organizations, along with several dozen individuals, submitted more than a dozen briefs this week to the Federal District Court for the District of Central California, challenging every legal facet of the government\u2019s case, like its free speech implications, the importance of encryption and concerns about government overreach.\u201cThese companies, which are often fierce competitors, have joined together to voice concern about the attempted government overreach in this case, which threatens the integrity and security of their products and privacy rights of consumers in general,\u201d said Neal Katyal, a lawyer at Hogan Lovells for the tech companies and a former acting solicitor general of the United States.Edward J. McAndrew, a lawyer at Ballard Spahr who is not involved in the Apple matter, said it was highly unusual to see a flood of briefs by so many parties this early in a case. He called the outpouring \u201cSupreme Court-level advocacy\u201d and said the campaign was intended to have influence beyond the court with legislators and others.\u201cThis is a show of force,\u201d said Mr. McAndrew, a former federal prosecutor who focused on online crimes. \u201cThis is a battle for public opinion.\u201dBruce Sewell, Apple\u2019s general counsel, said on Wednesday that the company was \u201chumbled by the outpouring of support.\u201dA group of Internet companies submitted this court brief supporting Apple in the case in which the government is seeking Apple\u2019s help to break into an iPhone used by a gunman in the San Bernardino terrorist attack.In the brief on Thursday from Amazon, Microsoft and others, the tech companies said they shared the public\u2019s outrage over the \u201cheinous act of terrorism\u201d in San Bernardino, but said they were united in the view that the government\u2019s case exceeded the boundaries of existing law and would hurt Americans\u2019 security.In the filing from the group that includes Twitter and LinkedIn, the companies said the government \u201cseeks unbounded authority to compel Apple to design software that does not currently exist and that will circumvent and undermine security measures intended to protect its users\u2019 data.\u201d\u201cWe\u2019re facing a very big question as a country, industry and a world about what privacy will look like in the digital era,\u201d said Aaron Levie, the chief executive of the data storage company Box, which signed on to the brief with Amazon, Google and others. \u201cThere is a global impact for these tech companies if we don\u2019t land on the right side of having a strong framework for how companies deal with security and these kinds of requests in the digital age.\u201dApart from the tech companies, seven prominent security experts and 32 law professors signed on to joint briefs on Thursday. Several industry trade organizations and digital rights groups submitted their own filings this week.The technology company has been locked in a major legal battle against law enforcement officials over privacy and security.Some echoed Apple\u2019s slippery slope argument that opening up one iPhone would lead to a domino effect from governments worldwide. The Media Institute, a nonprofit research foundation that focuses on communications policy, warned in its filing that the court\u2019s order could be \u201cbe applied against media companies as government authorities seek to acquire access to confidential information stored on mobile devices used by journalists.\u201dThe support for Apple was a torrent compared with the stream of filings backing the Justice Department in the case. Among the staunchest supporters on the side of government were six people whose family members were killed in the California attack.\u201cBroader questions about the fate of smartphone encryption and data privacy can be saved for another day and another forum,\u201d the families wrote in a brief. \u201cThis case certainly presents the conditions \u2014 a mass murder by terrorists implicating national security interest \u2014 where requiring Apple\u2019s technical assistance is at its apex.\u201dStephen G. Larson, the lawyer representing the victims\u2019 families, said he was frustrated that Apple was drawing a line in the sand \u201cover a phone that didn\u2019t even belong to the terrorist and that they have permission to unlock.\u201d The iPhone of the San Bernardino attacker, Syed Rizwan Farook, was issued by his employer.\u201cSo many of Apple\u2019s arguments are red herrings because this is not about privacy more than any other search in a criminal investigation is about privacy,\u201d Mr. Larson said. \u201cThat is scaremongering and that is false.\u201dA handful of law enforcement groups also filed briefs supporting the government\u2019s position, including a joint one from the Federal Law Enforcement Officers Association, the Association of Prosecuting Attorneys and the National Sheriffs\u2019 Association.Those groups listed several instances when iPhone data was an essential piece of a criminal case, including child pornography and sex trafficking cases. They argued that criminals were moving to iPhones because of Apple\u2019s refusal to help the government and that the company was making data extraction from its products impossible.\u201cIf Apple can refuse lawful court orders to reasonably assist law enforcement, public safety will suffer,\u201d the trade groups wrote.Not all family members of San Bernardino victims sided with the government. This week, Salihin Kondoker, whose wife, Anies, was shot three times but survived the attack, wrote a letter to the court saying he thought there was little valuable information on the iPhone used by the gunman. Mr. Kondoker said Apple\u2019s fight was about something bigger than one phone.\u201cThey are worried that this software the government wants them to use will be used against millions of other innocent people,\u201d he wrote. \u201cI share their fear.\u201dNick Wingfield reported from Seattle, and Katie Benner from San Francisco.

For residents and tourists alike, these vibrant markets have become destinations all their own.The continued influx of high-tech workers and foot traffic has helped pave the way for the urban marketplaces, which are finding success by offering food and goods in one place.Just east of downtown in the cool Capitol Hill neighborhood, preservation-minded developers transformed century-old auto parts buildings with old-meets-new design. These spaces, with their original facades, house restaurants and shops that buzz from morning to night with diners who might grab the kitchen\u2019s signature spice rub or house-made jam on the way out.The variety offered gives customers more options. \u201cPeople can get something to go for dinner or a picnic, or stop in and grab a nice piece of cheese or some nice salami,\u201d Mr. Sundstrom said.Nearby, the highly anticipated Chophouse Row opened last summer. Formerly an auto body shop, the 1924 building later became known as the Chophouse, a rehearsal space for aspiring bands. With housing and office space above, the ground floor is home to a handful of restaurants and tiny shops built around a pedestrian alley that leads to a courtyard. Part of the appeal \u2014 as in cities like London and Paris \u2014 lies in discovering what\u2019s tucked away.\u201cHere each vendor is doing what they do incredibly well,\u201d said Liz Dunn of Dunn & Hobbes, the Chophouse Row developer. \u201cIt\u2019s very specialized, and that provides a lot of value to the customer. People love the individual personalities of the vendors.\u201d\u201cThe developer wanted to create a sense of community and conviviality in the public spaces,\u201d said Pamela Hinckley, chief executive of Tom Douglas Restaurants. \u201cIt has that diversity of what appeals in different parts of the day and different seasons,\u201d she said. \u201cThere are so many options, from grab-and-go to savory sit-down dining.\u201dAll three of these markets offer specialty shops and hyper-local food. It\u2019s no coincidence that they opened in the city that claims the oldest continuously operated public farmers\u2019 markets in the country: Pike Place Market started in 1907 and is still at the heart of Seattle, where locals and tourists eat, shop and connect.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "In \u2018The Path,\u2019 on Hulu, Losing Faith Means Losing Love", "Date": "2016-03-25", "News": "Supported byA religious movement \u2014 some call it a cult \u2014 Meyerism offers adherents the promise of leaving behind all their pain and suffering by climbing the rungs of a metaphorical ladder toward the Light and postapocalyptic immortality. In the spare cabins that dot the property, one can even find pamphlets promising guidance in overcoming domestic abuse, marital infidelities and other ills of modern existence.What kind of spiritual void draws people to such movements? What happens when a staunch believer (Mr. Paul of \u201cBreaking Bad\u201d) begins questioning everything he\u2019s bought into? And when those cracks appear, what are he and the people around him willing to do to uphold their convictions?\u201cEverything is started with this desire for beauty and for a better life and a better world,\u201d Ms. Goldberg said. \u201cBut then it doesn\u2019t work out that way.\u201dThe creative spark for \u201cThe Path\u201d came during one of the darkest times in Ms. Goldberg\u2019s life. Earlier this decade, her father died shortly after learning he had cancer, and her 10-year marriage (to the actor Hamish Linklater) crumbled into divorce.While Ms. Goldberg considers herself a \u201cdoubter\u201d when it comes to matters of religion, she found herself undergoing a crisis of faith. \u201cAnd that sort of emotional storm was really the idea for the show,\u201d she said.She knew she wanted to write about the fallout after one half of a couple stops believing in the marriage. The inspiration for the Meyerist Movement was slightly more mysterious.When she tackled writing the script a few years later during a break from \u201cParenthood,\u201d \u201cthere was a lot of stuff in the zeitgeist about ISIS, of extreme faith\u201d in the news at the time, she said. Informed by her growing up in among the countercultural seekers of Woodstock, N.Y., she sought to place that exploration in a more enticing environment.The Meyerist Movement has its unsavory \u2014 if not downright creepy \u2014 secrets and practices. But \u201cThe Path\u201d strives to show the group\u2019s purer motives and charitable impulses.\u201cWe didn\u2019t want to let the audience have moments where they could just easily dismiss this entire movement as a cult,\u201d said Jason Katims (the showrunner of \u201cFriday Night Lights\u201d and creator of \u201cParenthood\u201d), who quickly agreed to shepherd the project through his production company when Ms. Goldberg showed him the script.(Despite similarities to Scientology \u2014 for example, the believers on \u201cThe Path\u201d use a Meyer Machine to stimulate neurological growth and physical healing, while an E-Meter is used in Scientologists\u2019 spiritual training \u2014 Ms. Goldberg said that the group wasn\u2019t her inspiration.)Ms. Goldberg and Mr. Katims found an eager suitor in Hulu. Beatrice Springborn, head of originals at Hulu, has seen her share of pitches about cults during her career as an indie film and television executive.\u201cIt was always looked at from the outsider perspective or the freak-show perspective or the infiltrator perspective,\u201d she said. \u201cOr how a cult is tearing apart families.\u201dMs. Goldberg\u2019s offering was the first time she\u2019d read a script and understood why people would join.\u201cThe Path\u201d would become Hulu\u2019s first regular, hourlong dramatic series \u2014 \u201c11/22/63,\u201d based on Stephen King\u2019s time-traveling thriller involving the assassination of President Kennedy, is just eight episodes \u2014 joining its stable of comedies like \u201cCasual,\u201d \u201cDifficult People\u201d and \u201cThe Mindy Project.\u201d And Hulu plans to release two, possibly three, more dramas this year.\u201cWe need to establish ourselves as a premium network,\u201d said Ms. Springborn, one for which people will spend at least $7.99 a month and to which brand-name talent will bring ideas. Netflix and Amazon, with shows like \u201cHouse of Cards\u201d and \u201cTransparent,\u201d have quite a head start on Hulu and are rolling out more original programming at a rapid clip. (The competition in this era of peak TV has become so intense that on the one floor Hulu and HBO share in their offices in Santa Monica, Calif., a Do Not Talk About Projects sign is posted in the bathroom.)Hulu executives had a few suggestions, including ditching the helicopters that Ms. Goldberg had provided the Meyerist movement. They would have made for a visually arresting opening scene, as members rescue the survivors of a tornado in New Hampshire that had blown their lives apart. But a less wealthy operation would offer more storytelling possibilities.An integral question \u201cThe Path\u201d explores is how a fledgling religion makes it from a first generation to a second, so that it doesn\u2019t die along with its founder. A scrappier movement, one still relatively unknown and riven by conflict over just how much publicity, growth and money it should seek, would better convey the tensions at play.The crucial role of Sarah \u2014 who grew up in the movement, a member of one of its core families and a true believer \u2014 was cast first. In Ms. Monaghan, the producers and Hulu executives believed they found an actor who could embody the wholesomeness and seeming guilelessness the character needed, to help get viewers to buy into a thematically dark show.The attraction for Ms. Monaghan was a complicated character who finds her core beliefs tested as her marriage to Eddie (Mr. Paul) implodes, questions about the movement arise and her relationship with Cal (Mr. Dancy), the charismatic youngest member of the leadership group, becomes more complicated. How Sarah responds \u201creally intrigued me, because what people do in the name of religion is not necessarily all that holy,\u201d Ms. Monaghan said.\u201cHer family is second to her faith, that\u2019s certainly what we discover,\u201d she added, in contrast to Mr. Paul\u2019s Eddie, who will do almost anything to keep his family intact.The characters on \u201cThe Path\u201d straying from the righteous path may be members of a controversial movement. (The writers and actors refrain from using the word cult, preferring, Ms. Goldberg said, to remain \u201cnonjudgmental.\u201d) But Ms. Goldberg hopes audiences will see parallels to the everyday of more conventional society.After all, she said, \u201ceverything is corruptible by individuals and by individual ambition and people\u2019s wounds.\u201dAdvertisement"}

On Amazon, you can pick up \u201cOne-Minute Mindfulness: 50 Simple Ways to Find Peace, Clarity, and New Possibilities in a Stressed-Out World.\u201d Dubious courses promise to help people \u201cmaster mindfulness\u201d in a few weeks.IBISWorld, a research company, estimates that meditation-related businesses in the United States last year generated $984 million in revenue. With so many mindful goods and services for sale, it can be easy to forget that mindfulness is a quality of being, not a piece of merchandise.\u201cIt\u2019s not enough to purchase the right product to be mindful,\u201d said Dan Harris, an ABC news anchor who chronicled his grudging embrace of meditation in a book, \u201c10 Percent Happier.\u201d \u201cMindfulness is a practice, and it\u2019s worth doing.\u201dThat is, you can\u2019t simply buy mindfulness. In its historical context, mindfulness is just one aspect of a lifelong journey to become more accepting, less judgmental and kinder to oneself and others. Even in its modern incarnation, mindfulness is best understood as a skill, one acquired through hours of sometimes uncomfortable contemplation.Alas, that may be asking too much in an age of crash diets and instant abs.\u201cNo one gets to decide who can sell mindfulness, or use mindfulness to sell a product,\u201d said Ms. Quistgaard.Though this may result in less signal and more noise, it doesn\u2019t mean mindfulness can\u2019t still be beneficial. Yoga may have changed over the years, but plenty of authentic teachers and ashrams can still be found. The same dynamic will most likely play out with mindfulness, too. Strange variations on mindfulness will proliferate, while pockets of traditional teachings endure.Even seemingly superficial interventions can be useful, or at least benign. Joe Burton, chief executive of Whil, which offers a popular meditation app, is adamant that just because mindfulness is streaming online at ever-higher price points, that doesn\u2019t make it ineffective or inauthentic. \u201cNo one can come do our training being a greedy, selfish jerk and expect to become a better greedy, selfish jerk,\u201d he said.More often than not, however, the people I know who take time to meditate \u2014 carefully observing thoughts, emotions and sensations \u2014 are sincere in their aspirations to become less stressed, more accepting and at least a little happier.I paid for both and headed for the exit. There\u2019s nothing wrong with buying products labeled mindful. We live in a consumerist culture, and I\u2019d rather spend my money on health food and self-help guides than junk food and gossip rags.But when I got home, I resolved to do more than simply support mindfulness with my wallet. I found a quiet moment, put away my iPhone, and closed my eyes to meditate. It\u2019s not enough to buy into mindfulness. You have to practice it, too.A news analysis on March 20 about mindfulness misstated the rate for a meditation class at Mndfl, aNew York studio. It is $20 for a 45-minute class, not for a 30-minute class.David Gelles is a reporter for The New York Times and the author of \u201cMindful Work: How Meditation Is Changing Business from the Inside Out.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Amazon Leans on Government in Its Quest to Be a Delivery Powerhouse", "Date": "2016-03-20", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Ever since Jeff Bezos started the website Amazon to sell books, he has wrestled with how to deliver its products as quickly and cheaply as possible. Today, Amazon, now a retail giant, remains obsessed with this issue, building its own fleet of drones, buying trailers for trucks and signing up drivers for on-demand deliveries.And nowhere is the company\u2019s push to become a logistics and delivery powerhouse more evident than here in the nation\u2019s capital. Amazon has emerged as one of the tech industry\u2019s most outspoken players in Washington, spending millions on this effort and meeting regularly with lawmakers and regulators.Amazon has pushed officials to allow new uses for commercial drones, to extend the maximum length of trucks, to improve roads and bridges and to prop up a delivery partner, the United States Postal Service.The efforts are mostly in the early stages, but Amazon already has detractors, particularly for its drone efforts. Some drone makers argue that Amazon is pushing too hard, too fast. And airline and pilots groups have said opening the skies to more commercial drones, which are remote-controlled flying machines, could create safety risks.\u201cAmazon is disrupting huge industries; retail was a start, then the enterprise market with its cloud platform and now transportation logistics,\u201d said Colin Sebastian, a senior analyst at Robert W. Baird. \u201cThis is Jeff Bezos\u2019s playbook, and achieving it by influencing legislation would be consistent with that plan.\u201dThe money Amazon spent on lobbying in 2015 nearly doubled, to $9.4 million, compared with the year before, which helped to pay a bigger lobbying staff and pay for a new office to house them. The tally, compiled from public records by the Center for Responsive Politics, includes only the spending that Amazon must legally disclose.Amazon\u2019s figure still lags those of some companies that made camp in Washington long ago, like Boeing, which spent about $21 million in 2015. And it trails the leading tech lobbyist, Alphabet, Google\u2019s parent, by several million. But Amazon\u2019s spending grew at a faster pace than any other big tech company\u2019s.Amazon and Mr. Bezos, its chief executive, have other interests in Washington, too. Amazon is now a major government contractor with a $600 million cloud computing partnership with the C.I.A. And Mr. Bezos\u2019s ownership of The Washington Post, which he bought in 2013, gives him a foothold in the political and media circles of Washington.Amazon declined requests to comment for this article. But on a recent earnings call, Amazon\u2019s chief financial officer, Brian Olsavsky, explained why Amazon wanted to move more aggressively into delivery.\u201cTo properly serve our customers at peak, we\u2019ve needed to add more of our own logistics to supplement our existing partners,\u201d Mr. Olsavsky said. \u201cThat\u2019s not meant to replace them.\u201dIn addition, the company\u2019s shipping costs rose 19 percent, to $5 billion, in 2015. The millions of members of its Prime annual subscription service, Amazon\u2019s most frequent customers, have helped feed the surge. Those customers receive free shipping for many products.Some analysts expect Amazon eventually to take over its entire logistics chain \u2014 in some cases, from factory to doorstep. Just this month, Amazon signed a deal to lease 20 Boeing cargo planes.A few analysts got excited when Amazon referred to itself as a \u201ctransportation service provider\u201d in a recent regulatory filing. The company, they suggested, could even become a competitor to UPS and FedEx.Mr. Olsavsky insisted on the call that UPS and FedEx would continue to be important partners. FedEx\u2019s chief executive, Fred Smith, also played down the possibility of Amazon becoming a rival. In a call with analysts and investors last week, he criticized \u201cfantastical\u201d reports about Amazon\u2019s challenge to logistics companies.Satish Jindel, founder of the SJ Consulting Group, which advises transportation and logistics firms, said, \u201cIf my package doesn\u2019t get delivered to my expectations, most people don\u2019t think of FedEx or UPS.\u201d He added, \u201cThey think of the retailer, so Amazon is getting into drones and delivery to enhance the customer experience and have a bigger influence over the customer.\u201dAmazon has also urged Congress to adopt rules that would allow the retailer to fly drones beyond a pilot\u2019s line of sight, a crucial hurdle to Amazon\u2019s goal of operating drones from its warehouses. This effort is expected to face an important test soon. This month, the Senate Transportation Committee drafted a bill that would ensure rules for delivery drones within two years.Airline and pilot groups have resisted many of Amazon\u2019s proposed changes.\u201cThe chances of a collision will go way up when you have more unmanned aircraft up,\u201d said Chris Dancy, a spokesman for the Helicopter Association International, a trade group.Some drone makers said in interviews that Amazon\u2019s bold statements may be generating too much public angst, helping the safety advocates.He also urged the approval of legislation that aims to improve roads, bridges and railways. The bill was passed by Congress and signed into law in December.\u201cThe private sector cannot make all the necessary improvements\u201d in transportation, Mr. Misener said in July during a Senate hearing, a message that he has repeated to members of Congress. \u201cGovernment needs to keep up.\u201dAmazon has backed a proposal for 33-foot twin-trailer trucks, vehicles that would extend the current legal length of trucks by several feet; opponents say longer trucks could make roads more dangerous for other drivers.\u201cThe 33-foot trucks are going to be safer,\u201d Mr. Misener said last July, \u201cbecause there will be fewer of them on the road, driving fewer miles.\u201dThe proposal has been met with resistance from Ralph Nader, a longtime consumer advocate. He said he wrote Mr. Bezos, asking Amazon to stop its support of these trucks for safety reasons. He said Mr. Bezos never responded. The proposal was rejected last year as part of a broader transportation bill.\u201cDrones and longer trucks, what are all these efforts for?\u201d Mr. Nader said in an interview. \u201cTo get you your toothpaste faster?\u201dDoris Burke contributed research.Advertisement"}

I don\u2019t know how much of this is about principles and how much is just about the pursuit of profit. The efforts do seem pretty effective, though, and I think we should expect only more of this. The industry has long had disdain for Washington; now, with business booming and the companies as powerful as ever, it seems to have learned how to express the disdain for political ends. Where do you think this could manifest itself next?For instance, techies have been pushing for immigration reform for years; Mark Zuckerberg made it a signature issue earlier this decade. What happened? Nothing.And of course, what Mr. Carter and the F.B.I. consider a back door is not exactly what the tech industry does.

{"Headline": "Pandora Replaces Chief, Aiming to Reinvent Itself Midstream", "Date": "2016-03-28", "News": "Supported byPandora Media became a powerhouse in online music primarily by doing one thing: tailoring song after song to the tastes of its listeners, along with the occasional ad. For a decade, it worked well, as Pandora came to dominate Internet radio.But with its stock price suffering, and as competitors like Spotify and Apple Music transform the streaming music market around it, Pandora has come under increasing pressure to adapt. In recent months Pandora has unveiled ambitious changes to its service, and also weighed whether to sell itself.On Monday Pandora threw Wall Street another curveball by replacing its chief executive, who had held the job for less than three years, with one of the company\u2019s founders.Brian P. McAndrews, an online advertising executive who joined Pandora in September 2013 as chairman and chief executive, has left the company, and is being replaced as chief executive by Tim Westergren, a co-founder of Pandora and its former chief strategy officer.The return of Mr. Westergren, who has been serving in a board position, signals that this is a critical juncture for Pandora as it tries to restore the growth of its early years. After climbing rapidly, its number of monthly users fell to 81.1 million at the end of 2015, from 81.5 million a year before. Its stock has fallen by about 75 percent since its peak in early 2014.But Mr. Westergren\u2019s appointment as chief executive struck some analysts as a positive development for a company that is trying to regain its footing and change its image on Wall Street and within the music industry.\u201cThis is front and center about a company that wants to change its mojo,\u201d said Barton Crockett, an analyst with FBR Capital Markets. \u201cThey have an inspirational founder who has been very prominent within Pandora, and representing Pandora to artists, and is now stepping up to take over the whole operation.\u201dTo revitalize itself, Pandora plans to move toward an on-demand streaming model that would put it in direct competition with Spotify, Apple, Google, Amazon and others in an increasingly crowded online music market. Pandora views the scale it has already built as a big advantage in this field, calling itself \u201cthe world\u2019s most powerful music discovery platform.\u201dOn Monday the company said it remained committed to that plan, which took shape under Mr. McAndrews, who is also a director of The New York Times Company.\u201cWe are pursuing a once-in-a-generation opportunity to create a massive, vibrant music marketplace,\u201d Mr. Westergren said in a statement. \u201cWe have the audience, the technology infrastructure, the monetization engine and, most importantly, the right team with the passion and commitment to do it.\u201dPandora\u2019s stock price fell 12 percent on Monday in response to the news, closing at $9.60.It was unclear what effect the executive change might have on the company\u2019s explorations of a sale. Last month, it emerged that Pandora had retained Morgan Stanley to advise it on strategic plans for its business. The company has not commented on those plans, but last week its stock rose briefly on the news that it had appointed to its board Anthony J. Vinciquerra, a senior adviser to the Texas Pacific Group, the private investment firm, and a former chief executive of the Fox Networks Group. Given Mr. Vinciquerra\u2019s experience, some analysts viewed his arrival as a sign that a sale or merger might be close.Another critical question for Pandora is how quickly it can complete new music licensing deals. For its radio service, Pandora licenses recordings through a government-backed system that sets standard rates. But last year it paid $75 million for the assets of Rdio, a struggling Spotify competitor, and to restart that service it would need special deals negotiated directly with record companies.Mr. Westergren may be able to improve those talks, which began under Mr. McAndrews late last year and so far have not been fruitful, according to music executives who have been involved with them.Pandora\u2019s competition in moving into the on-demand streaming world is formidable. Spotify has been operating in this area since 2008, and now has 30 million paying customers around the world. Apple, which entered the subscription streaming business last year, has 11 million. A majority of Pandora\u2019s customers listen free, with ads, but the company also has about four million subscribers who pay $5 a month to eliminate ads and get higher-quality audio.Along with Pandora\u2019s $450 million purchase of Ticketfly, an online ticketing company, its move into on-demand streaming is part of its new business plan, which it hopes will nearly quadruple its revenue in the next four years, to $4 billion. In 2015, Pandora had $1.16 billion in revenue, up 26.4 percent from the year before, but its net loss also grew to $169.7 million, from $30.4 million in 2014.Mr. Westergren, a former musician who helped develop the company\u2019s \u201cmusic genome project\u201d \u2014 a system for categorizing songs and the basis for how Pandora chooses what songs to play for its customers \u2014 was chief executive from 2002 to 2004, in the days when the company was known as Savage Beast Technologies. Pandora was introduced in 2005, and the company went public in 2011.Along with Mr. McAndrews\u2019s departure, the company announced that Michael S. Herring, its chief financial officer, would also take on Mr. McAndrews\u2019s role as president; Sara Clemens was named chief operating officer; and Christopher Phillips would be chief product officer. James Feuille, an independent board member, took over as chairman.Advertisement"}

The company was at the end of a process of privatization that had begun in 1997, though the government retained a stake in the company.Under Mr. Agnelli, Vale grew into one of Latin America\u2019s biggest companies: the second-largest mining company in the world at the time, and the largest producer of iron ore.Known by some as the \u201cIron Man,\u201d Mr. Agnelli was a tough negotiator and a bold executive who expanded the company\u2019s reach into markets in Asia, particularly China.In 2006, he presided over the company\u2019s $18 billion purchase of Inco, a Canadian nickel producer, the largest acquisition that had ever been made by a Latin American company, Vale said.In 2013, Mr. Agnelli was named to the No. 4 spot on Harvard Business Review\u2019s list of the best performing chief executives in the world, behind Steve Jobs of Apple, Jeff Bezos of Amazon and Yun Jong-yong of Samsung.According to Ms. Casanova, Mr. Agnelli \u201cchallenged the traditional notion that mines are best run in enclaves separate from the local community,\u201d citing the construction of a model mine in 2004 in the Brazilian state of Paran\u00e1.\u201cWe brought in water and sewage treatment, a school, a police station and technical training,\u201d Mr. Agnelli said in an interview quoted in the book. \u201cAs modern miners we can\u2019t just be technicians.

{"Headline": "Tech Companies, New and Old, Clamor to Entice Cloud Computing Experts", "Date": "2016-03-06", "News": "Supported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Amazon Web Services, a globe-spanning cloud computing network that is part of the online retailing giant Amazon, has rapidly become one of the most powerful forces in technology. It has also become a target for poachers.Last October, at a conference in Las Vegas with thousands of corporate executives and software developers in attendance, A.W.S.\u2019s chief, Andy Jassy, strode before an intentionally poorly disguised image of Lawrence J. Ellison, founder and chairman of the Oracle Corporation. Foot-tall words like \u201cbullies,\u201d \u201cextorted\u201d and \u201cstrong arm\u201d appeared next to Mr. Jassy and the image of Ellision. The logo of Oracle, one of the biggest companies in Silicon Valley, was barely crossed out.\u201cOur marketing team needs work on redaction,\u201d Mr. Jassy joked.Better cloaked was the reason for his enmity: Oracle had been slow to get into the cloud business, but recently made multiple hiring raids on A.W.S. Both Oracle and Amazon declined to comment on Mr. Jassy\u2019s dig.The hunt for the hard-to-find talent that can build and run the massive data centers behind cloud computing is pitting three generations of companies against one another. Old-guard companies like Oracle, tech\u2019s current giants like Amazon and its peers, as well as Bay Area start-ups are offering big salaries and big perks for cloud computing experts.On the social media site LinkedIn, for example, there are over 130 engineering positions available at Oracle Seattle. Many of them are the kind of jobs that now pay $300,000 to $1 million a year, according to Shannon Anderson, who has been recruiting engineers in Seattle and the Bay Area for 25 years.Seattle and its surrounding towns are a hot spot for this kind of tech talent because they are home to A.W.S., which runs the biggest cloud computing service, and Microsoft, which has a large cloud business called Azure. Google also has a cloud computing office in the area. So does Facebook.\u201cSomeone working deep inside Amazon is getting five to 20 recruiting offers a day,\u201d Ms. Anderson said. \u201cCompensation has doubled in five years.\u201d For a recruiter, who is typically paid a percentage of a star engineer\u2019s compensation, \u201cthis is a very good time,\u201d she said.Cloud computing, which powers an increasing number of our devices and services, allows a vast collection of computers \u2014 often spread around the world \u2014 to operate like one giant machine.These computing clouds are being filled with once unimaginable amounts of data from apps, websites and sensors on all sorts of things. Fast-growing online services like Snapchat run on cloud systems. Apple has its own cloud, as does Facebook. Cloud systems even offer the computing muscle needed for things like artificial intelligence.As other tech sectors show signs of slowing, cloud services have created unprecedented demand for highly educated engineers and mathematicians who can build and operate these flywheels of data. Instead of asking about the latest computer coding languages or how to make a web page load faster, the most important question in tech hiring has become: Can you handle petabytes? That is the data in about 13 billion images, or roughly the amount of printed information that would fit in 20 million file cabinets.In the Bay Area, $125,000 a year is not an uncommon salary for someone newly out of graduate school with the expertise to do cloud computing work. With five years of experience, $300,000 along with a range of stock or job opportunities that greatly inflate the value of those paychecks have become the norm.\u201cIt\u2019s an aggressive market,\u201d said Corey Sanders, director of program management at Microsoft Azure. \u201cWe are all data engineers now, and we can convince people that this is the best place to learn that.\u201dThe ability to deal with so much data has also become important to industrial companies like General Electric in figuring out things like jet engine maintenance schedules. G.E.\u2019s pitch to cloud computing experts: We offer a chance to rebuild the industrial world.In the last three years, G.E. has hired 1,500 software developers and systems engineers, and trained a similar number of existing employees to work on cloud systems connected to everything from smartphones to wind turbines and jet engines.\u201cWe\u2019ve hired from every large company, places like Amazon and Google, as well as start-ups, or out of schools,\u201d said William Ruh, the head of G.E.\u2019s cloud business. \u201cWe pay well, with attractive benefits, a life and a chance to work on the mission to remake American industry.\u201dStill, he said, \u201cI\u2019m totally shocked at how fast compensation is moving up.\u201dFor smaller companies, the gold rush is more complicated. In San Francisco\u2019s South Park neighborhood, Tom Chavez runs a company called Krux that scans data from more than three billion devices, creating a trove of seven petabytes of information retrieved by several hundred companies. Many of his 160 or so employees are just the kind of people the giants, along with other start-ups, are looking for.\u201cLinkedIn or Facebook can offer an engineer with a few years\u2019 experience a package close to $1 million,\u201d said Mr. Chavez, who co-founded Krux and is its chief executive. \u201cWe wanted someone out of Stanford for an internship, and Google offered her an annualized $180,000 for the summer,\u201d or about $45,000 for three months.Facebook also wants employees like the people Mr. Chavez has hired. In fact, Vivek Vaidya, a Krux co-founder, calls the steep salaries Krux is compelled to pay \u201cour Facebook tax.\u201dKrux takes up several floors of a brick building at the base of South Park, a onetime place of sweatshops that has filled with start-ups and venture capitalists.On the ground floor, development engineers get daily calls asking if they want to jump ship. A nearby team of data scientists gets 20 or more unsolicited emails a week via LinkedIn. Upstairs, Krux\u2019s recruiter strives to keep people, even as he looks to take from others.\u201cI can\u2019t compete with a $50,000 signing bonus from Google, so I focus on the person, what really motivates them,\u201d said Cade Garrett, who has recruited about 100 people to Krux.Besides offering stock options that could be valuable if the company has initial public offering, a fast-growing start-up can offer younger engineers a crash course in technology \u2014 the kind of training that could one day allow them to start their own companies.\u201cI tell them this isn\u2019t the best-paying job, but they have to think about where things are going: Everything they do here is mission critical,\u201d Mr. Garrett said. \u201cYou go to Google, you can\u2019t be sure that in a couple of years you\u2019ll have a product to show.\u201dMr. Chavez thinks industry titans like Larry Page, the chief executive of the Alphabet holding company that includes Google, are intentionally driving up salaries. \u201cIf I was Larry, I\u2019d do the same thing: throw a few more million at people and cut off everyone else\u2019s oxygen.\u201dEven so, Mr. Garrett tries to keep engineers\u2019 contact information off the Krux websites to foil recruiters. And he is more than happy to do his own poaching. Zenefits, a fast-growing online employee-benefits company currently reeling from the departure of its founding chief and a round of layoffs, is a target.\u201cAbsolutely, I\u2019ll call into any company that is in trouble,\u201d he said.An earlier version of this article misstated the amount Google offered someone out of Stanford for a summer internship. It was $45,000 for three months, not $60,000.Advertisement"}

It\u2019s a glimpse at a lively mind at full boil.\u201cNothing says individuality,\u201d Mr. Kobek comments about a generation\u2019s laptops and cellphones, \u201clike 500 million consumer electronics built by slaves. Welcome to hell.\u201d He\u2019s just getting tuned up.His new novel is ostensibly the story of a middle-aged comic-book writer named Adeline.

The city\u2019s misfits, of whom she is one, are being pushed out.The story begins as Adeline commits \u201cthe only unforgivable sin of the 21st century.\u201d That is, invited to give a lecture, she neglects to notice that someone is recording her. Adeline has other problems, Mr. Kobek suggests: \u201c(1) She was a woman in a culture that hated women. (2) She\u2019d become kind of famous. (3) She\u2019d expressed unpopular opinions.\u201dSome of these opinions, which become infamous on YouTube, are on why women should be leery of working for tech companies. \u201cAll these crazy young ones are lining up to burn in their very own Shirtwaist Factories, screaming that they\u2019re empowered by the very technology that\u2019s set them aflame,\u201d Adeline says, in her goofy trans-Atlantic accent, which makes her sound like \u201ca drugged out Diana Vreeland.\u201dSome of these opinions are complaints about the fantasies of fame and power in the songs, videos and social media of today\u2019s pop stars. \u201cA wide range of humanity believed that Beyonc\u00e9 and Rihanna were inspirations rather than vultures,\u201d we read. \u201cAdeline had spit on their gods.\u201d Adeline barely knows what Twitter is. Attack Bey and RiRi? She\u2019s about to find out about its self-righteous side.Adeline\u2019s story sits alongside that of a younger woman, Ellen, whose life is destroyed after an old boyfriend\u2019s pictures of her, taken during sex, are splashed across the web. Each of these women, in Mr. Kobek\u2019s hands, is interesting and sympathetic. But \u201cI Hate the Internet\u201d is fundamentally a platform for the author\u2019s slashing social criticism.New definitions?

{"Headline": "Farhad and Mike Discuss the Apple Case and a Go-Playing Computer Program", "Date": "2016-03-12", "News": "Supported byAs you probably don\u2019t know, computers have been beating human chess players for years, but Go has long been something of a holy grail for machines. After years of work, though, DeepMind, a Google subsidiary based in London, showed that a computer program could play Go at a level that was deemed \u201cperfect\u201d by Lee Se-dol, the poor human Go champion who embarrassed humankind by losing to a mere machine.Mike, from what I know, you can barely play checkers. So I thought for this week we\u2019d bring in an expert \u2014 our colleague John Markoff, who covers machine intelligence.Also, just for the record, I\u2019m pretty sure I can take AlphaGo in Candyland.What appears to be happening is the timetable for computing dominance of Go has been moved up roughly a decade from when it had been expected. That\u2019s largely because the new ability to blend pattern recognition algorithms and vast data sets has been yielding spectacular results in the last half-decade. It\u2019s like computer scientists have found a powerful new hammer, and they\u2019re using it to pound lots of different nails.I have no idea how this game works, except from what I see of the guys playing against each other in, like, Washington Square Park.One would think that Mr. Lee has a similar advantage. But I imagine a computer program \u2014 even a fancy one from Google \u2014 would lack this certain set of skills. Is there something here I\u2019m not getting?A second type of algorithm can also see the consequences of particular moves far, far in advance of the game by playing millions and millions or perhaps even billions of combinations of moves. In contrast, human Go experts have their experience to rely on, but it is fuzzy by comparison. Think of this as an intellectual version of John Henry and the jackhammer. And remember, right now the only thing the program can do is play Go.Thanks for the guest spot, John! I love learning new things.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Silicon Valley Looks to Artificial Intelligence for the Next Big Thing", "Date": "2016-03-27", "News": "Supported byBitsSAN FRANCISCO \u2014 As the oracles of Silicon Valley debate whether the latest tech boom is sliding toward bust, there is already talk about what will drive the industry\u2019s next growth spurt.The way we use computing is changing, toward a boom (and, if history is any guide, a bubble) in collecting oceans of data in so-called cloud computing centers, then analyzing the information to build new businesses.The terms most often associated with this are \u201cmachine learning\u201d and \u201cartificial intelligence,\u201d or \u201cA.I.\u201d And the creations spawned by this market could affect things ranging from globe-spanning computer systems to how you pay at the cafeteria.\u201cThere is going to be a boom for design companies, because there\u2019s going to be so much information people have to work through quickly,\u201d said Diane B. Greene, the head of Google Compute Engine, one of the companies hoping to steer an A.I. boom. \u201cJust teaching companies how to use A.I. will be a big business.\u201dThis kind of change is what keeps Silicon Valley going. When personal computers displaced mainframe computers, it opened the door not just for Apple, but for companies making PC software for business, games and publishing. In the networking and Internet revolutions, venture capitalists invested in these new computing styles, and another generation of companies was born.Over the last decade, smartphones, social networks and cloud computing have moved from feeding the growth of companies like Facebook and Twitter, leapfrogging to Uber, Airbnb and others that have used the phones, personal rating systems and powerful remote computers in the cloud to create their own new businesses.Believe it or not, that stuff may be heading for the rearview mirror already. The tech industry\u2019s new architecture is based not just on the giant public computing clouds of Google, Microsoft and Amazon, but also on their A.I. capabilities. These clouds create more efficient and supple use of computing resources, available for rent. Smaller clouds used in corporate systems are designed to connect to them.The A.I. resources Ms. Greene is opening up at Google are remarkable. Google\u2019s autocomplete feature that most of us use when doing a search can instantaneously touch 500 computers in several locations as it guesses what we are looking for. Services like Maps and Photos have over a billion users, sorting places and faces by computer. Gmail sifts through 1.4 petabytes of data, or roughly two billion books\u2019 worth of information, every day.Handling all that, plus tasks like language translation and speech recognition, Google has amassed a wealth of analysis technology that it can offer to customers. Urs H\u00f6lzle, Ms. Greene\u2019s chief of technical infrastructure, predicts that the business of renting out machines and software will eventually surpass Google advertising. In 2015, ad profits were $16.4 billion.\u201cIn the \u201980s, it was spreadsheets,\u201d said Andreas Bechtolsheim, a noted computer design expert who was Google\u2019s first investor. \u201cNow it\u2019s what you can do with machine learning.\u201dHe added: \u201cBetter maps and photos is just the start. It\u2019s going to be in life sciences, automobiles, everything.\u201dA number of start-ups are already aimed at the new architecture. A Mountain View, Calif., outfit called Mashgin uses \u201ccomputer vision\u201d to automate retail checkout. Up Highway 101 in San Mateo, a company called Alluxio is creating ways to make cloud-based A.I. work better. Last week, a San Francisco company called Mesosphere, which makes a way to operate among various corporate and public clouds, raised $73.5 million.Microsoft and Amazon are racing Google to dominate the new architecture.This week, Microsoft will kick off a conference in San Francisco that is expected to focus on ways machine-based intelligence can be used to analyze, among other things, \u201cthe Microsoft graph,\u201d or all the data companies already have in the Microsoft products they\u2019ve owned for decades.Amazon last year announced its own machine-learning services, and it is amassing its own large repository of corporate data.Hewlett Packard Enterprise, an older company struggling to find its way in the new landscape, was one of the investors in Mesosphere.\u201cWhen you are building predictive data, you don\u2019t know what you are going to need next,\u201d said William Hilf, a senior vice president at H.P.E. \u201cIf someone makes a bet in machine learning on Microsoft or Google, they may need to come down to their old data systems, too. We are building platforms to bridge among all of them.\u201dTo Ms. Greene, all of the activity so far, along with the size and sophistication of computing, is small compared to what will happen when the world\u2019s biggest businesses start leaning on the new A.I. technology.\u201cWe may build an A.I. system to figure out all the ways businesses can use this,\u201d she joked. \u201cThe relationship between big companies and deep machine intelligence is just starting.\u201dAdvertisement"}

She fell in love with the book (cover blurb: \u201ca novel of the alienation of personality and the mystery of being\u201d) and soon realized she had stumbled across a philosophy called existentialism. It redefined concepts like being, existence and freedom. While still at entry level to this thinking, she went to a park in Reading, England, and stared protractedly at a tree, hoping to understand it more deeply.The year was 1979. Although Sartre\u2019s huge public funeral would not occur until the next year, his philosophy was already outr\u00e9. But Ms. Bakewell delved into his and other existentialists\u2019 work as an increasingly serious scholar, branching out to the point of trying to complete a Ph.D. on Martin Heidegger, whose writings on phenomenology led to the birth of existentialism, but hardly left him well disposed to it.Anyway, Ms. Bakewell\u2019s timing was terrible. Structuralists, poststructuralists, deconstructionists and postmodernists dominated academia by the 1980s. In that light, the dizziness and anguish of existentialism were out of fashion. Ms. Bakewell put aside the ideas she had once loved and let decades go by. And now that they\u2019ve achieved the Nothingness of \u201cExistentialism for Dummies\u201d (from the Amazon blurb: \u201cHave you ever wondered what the phrase \u2018God is Dead\u2019 means?\u201d), she has brought them back.\u201cAt the Existentialist Caf\u00e9\u201d is a bracingly fresh look at once-antiquated ideas and the milieu in which they flourished. Ms. Bakewell\u2019s approach is enticing and unusual: She is not an omniscient author acting as critic, biographer or tour guide. As someone who came back to this material by rereading it later in life, she has made her responses part of the story.And which of them put their lives where their principles were? That, to Ms. Bakewell, is a hugely important question. She allows the figures of Sartre and de Beauvoir to tower over this book, not for reasons of charisma but because she thinks their ideas about defining oneself by the decisions one makes have new relevance today. Just as the existentialists came to prominence in postwar Europe by holding out the possibility of \u201cfiendishly difficult\u201d freedom through choice, an unending but authentic struggle, so might their thinking have a place among people who feel overwhelmed by choice and bereft of authenticity in their lives. Who are these people? We are, she says.The most enduring thinker in the book is Heidegger. He is also the one whose story is most damning. Ms. Bakewell spends a lot of time on Heidegger\u2019s rivalry with his mentor and fellow phenomenologist, Edmund Husserl. He would eventually call Husserl ludicrous; Husserl, upon reading a Heidegger manuscript multiple times, would wind up with marginalia like \u201c?\u201d \u201c!\u201d and \u201c?!\u201d\u201cWhen reading Sartre on freedom, Beauvoir on the subtle mechanisms of oppression, Kierkegaard on anxiety, Camus on rebellion, Heidegger on technology or Merleau-Ponty on cognitive science,\u201d Ms. Bakewell writes, \u201cone sometimes feels one is reading the latest news.\u201dAt the Existentialist Caf\u00e9Freedom, Being, and Apricot CocktailsBy Sarah BakewellIllustrated. 439 pages.

They had even moved into California, a neighborhood of strivers who had left the big, impoverished city nearby.\u201cIt was that magical moment when everything seemed possible,\u201d said Germana Soares, 24.The doctors peppered her with questions about the Zika virus, which she had contracted early in her pregnancy. Her husband, Glecion Amorim, 27, quickly spiraled into worry. Ms. Soares put on a brave face and prayed, trying to stay positive.\u201cI thought Hawaii would be wonderful to see,\u201d Ms. Soares said, rattling off a list of dreams the couple had sketched out, until recently. \u201cAll those big plans are in the past. My priority has to be caring for my special boy.\u201dTheir struggle offers a small glimpse into the thousands of Brazilian families now faced with the prospect of raising a disabled child in poverty in the wake of the Zika epidemic.Once called a mystery disease, everyone in Brazil is aware of the Zika virus, which appears to cause microcephaly, or abnormally small heads, in babies.Newfound SecurityMs. Soares and Mr. Amorim thought they had finally escaped the hardships of life in nearby Recife when they moved into California around the start of the decade. Those were the boom years, when tens of thousands of workers swarmed the Port of Suape, a sprawling industrial site built to help propel Brazil into the elite ranks of the world\u2019s oil-producing nations.Demand for workers was so intense that Mr. Amorim\u2019s employers offered him a two-bedroom house, one of nearly 800 designed almost identically in this company town.\u201cAt one point, there were a thousand buses a day here transporting workers,\u201d said Aldo Amaral, 44, the president of the union representing laborers at the port complex. \u201cIt was a boom that was supposed to last decades.\u201dMs. Soares and Mr. Amorim embraced it fully. When Brazil\u2019s currency surged, their combined income reached the equivalent of almost $40,000 a year. They installed a large flat-screen television in their living room, joined an evangelical Christian congregation, hired a photographer for their wedding, traveled by motorcycle to idyllic beaches and even flew on vacation to Fernando de Noronha, a Brazilian archipelago in the Atlantic that few people in the world ever get to see.A Sudden BlowEbullient when Ms. Soares became pregnant, the couple hosted a \u201cch\u00e1 de revela\u00e7\u00e3o,\u201d a party to reveal the baby\u2019s sex, and announced to friends and relatives that they were expecting a son. They tried to remain hopeful even after doctors raised the possibility during Ms. Soares\u2019s pregnancy that their son might have microcephaly. They thought about opening a store selling baby clothes with the modest severance package Mr. Amorim had received after losing his job at the shipyard.Then, on Nov. 27, Guilherme was born. At first, doctors said the baby seemed fine. The news elicited cries of joy among relatives in the waiting room, and a celebration of hugs and impromptu dancing that resembled \u201ca Carnival street party,\u201d Ms. Soares said.But a nurse returned with an update. Something appeared to be wrong when they measured Guilherme\u2019s head. The circumference was 32 centimeters, the threshold for microcephaly classification at that time. A hush set over the hospital room as family members carefully tapped the word \u201cmicrocephaly\u201d into the search engines of their smartphones.\u201cI heard the number 32, and I began to cry,\u201d Mr. Amorim said.Doctors kept Ms. Soares and Guilherme hospitalized for a week as they carried out tests. Scans confirmed that Guilherme had brain damage associated with microcephaly.The blow led the couple to rethink everything. Ms. Soares had been so buoyant after learning she was pregnant that she left her job as a real estate agent, planning to dedicate herself instead to raising their child on her husband\u2019s salary. But after he lost his job, the two found themselves in the whirlwind of Brazil\u2019s economic crisis. More than six million Brazilians have slipped from the middle class into poverty since 2014, according to economists at Bradesco, one of Brazil\u2019s largest banks.Instead of opening a clothing store, as they had envisioned, Mr. Amorim invested in something more affordable: a dune buggy. Each day, he drives to Porto de Galinhas, a nearby area of resorts where he tries to lure vacationers to take beach tours. In a good month, he makes about $625. Altogether, he said, the family will be lucky if their annual income reaches $7,000.\u201cI have to keep a smile on my face and be friendly despite all the thoughts swirling in my mind,\u201d Mr. Amorim said. \u201cI\u2019m the only one now earning money, and it\u2019s my responsibility to put food on our table every day.\u201dMs. Soares said she was slowly realizing that she might never be able to hold a regular job again, given the time needed to care for many children with microcephaly, who often develop problems like speech impediments, hearing loss and learning delays. Guilherme, she said, has already started having muscle spasms, which doctors say are a predictor of convulsions later in life.\u201cHe cries so much and needs so much love that I can\u2019t just leave him with someone,\u201d she said.\u201cI used to think of myself as an independent woman,\u201d she added, pausing to look out the window. \u201cBut that phase in my life is finished. I can\u2019t go back to work.\u201dA Daily GrindMs. Soares leaves home a couple of times each week for appointments with doctors in Recife, awaking with Guilherme at 5 a.m. to board a van provided by municipal officials to transport patients. Driving their car is out of the question, since each trip to Recife and back consumes about $25 in gasoline, an expense far beyond their reach.Cruelly, their move into California, which once seemed to trumpet their ambitions for independence, now feels isolating. While Mr. Amorim scours the beaches for clients, a family member from Recife occasionally visits Ms. Soares and Guilherme. Still, relatives have their own jobs and families, so she spends many of her days alone with her son. On a recent Saturday afternoon, their flat-screen TV was tuned in to a skateboarding event in Rio de Janeiro featuring cheerful competitors from around Brazil.\u201cI don\u2019t know if my son will ever be able to do anything like that,\u201d she said.Ms. Soares tries to maintain a semblance of normalcy. Embroidered elephants, hippos and lions adorn the walls of her son\u2019s room under the words \u201cGuilherme\u2019s Safari.\u201d A mosquito net envelops his crib, reflecting the couple\u2019s newfound awareness of viruses like Zika, dengue and chikungunya.Here is a look at the most prominent rumors and theories about Zika virus, along with responses from scientists.With so many other mothers who have recently given birth to babies with microcephaly, Ms. Soares keeps informed about the condition on WhatsApp, the Internet messaging service that is a sensation around Brazil. They trade updates about Zika\u2019s spread, information about microcephaly, reports that the authorities may provide subsidies of about $220 a month to poor families with microcephalic babies, and even the occasional joke to lighten up the mood.One of the mothers in Salvador, 420 miles south of Recife, has begun composing poems about microcephaly that she distributes among the WhatsApp group. One of her writings, \u201cMicrocephaly Is Not the End,\u201d resonated so much with Ms. Soares that she recites it when the mood in her house starts to darken: Do you know what prejudice is?It\u2019s something that won\u2019t affect usBecause we are hereTo fight for our angels Trudging ForwardMr. Amorim says he is too busy trying to make ends meet to dwell on their misfortune. When he gets home from work, he surfs the web for welding jobs, wondering whether it makes sense to apply for openings in distant Mozambique, a Portuguese-speaking country in southern Africa.Despite the findings of dozens of medical tests, he said he still held out hope that Guilherme does not have microcephaly, pointing out that his head circumference is at the upper limit of the range for the condition.\u201cIt\u2019s not that I don\u2019t accept him,\u201d he said. \u201cBut in my mind, he is normal.\u201dWhile adapting to the challenges and costs of raising Guilherme, the couple are also trying to stave off eviction. The shipyard is trying to repossess their house on the grounds that Mr. Amorim did not work long enough to take full ownership of the property. The couple have joined dozens of other families in a lawsuit, claiming that Brazil\u2019s real estate laws allow them to stay in their homes.Built in less than a decade, their subdivision and surrounding areas of Ipojuca already exhibit the strains of age.Some in the California subdivision have put up towering walls around their homes to protect against break-ins. Motorists navigate through potholes on streets buckling under the equatorial sun. Graffiti tags on some homes speak to the fraying of the neighborhood\u2019s aspirations.\u201cIt\u2019s like we\u2019re stranded here now,\u201d Mr. Amorim said, cradling his son in his arms. \u201cI never dreamed that this is the life Guilherme would be born into.\u201dAdvertisement"}

It tumbles in from the ocean and travels up the Amazon on a path of destruction. While the region\u2019s residents accept the river\u2019s wrath and start moving their boats and animals, daredevils called bore riders grab their surfboards.Local legend has it that three mischievous children travel up the Amazon playing practical jokes. But the scientific harbinger of this curse \u2014 or gift if you\u2019re a surfer \u2014 is that familiar force we call gravity.During new and full moons, when the river is relatively shallow and the ocean tide is high, water flows in from the Atlantic, rather than the other way around.

{"Headline": "Water Is Broken. Data Can Fix It.", "Date": "2016-03-17", "News": "Supported byOp-Ed ContributorAS a nation, we have become disciples of data. We interview 60,000 families a month to determine the unemployment rate, we monitor how much energy we use every seven days, Amazon ranks sales of every book it sells every hour.Then there is water.Water may be the most important item in our lives, our economy and our landscape about which we know the least. We not only don\u2019t tabulate our water use every hour or every day, we don\u2019t do it every month, or even every year.The 2010 report runs 64 pages of small type, reporting water use in each state by quality and quantity, by source, and by whether it\u2019s used on farms, in factories or in homes.It doesn\u2019t take four years to get five years of data. All we get every five years is one year of data.The data system is ridiculously primitive. It was an embarrassment even two decades ago. The vast gaps \u2014 we start out missing 80 percent of the picture \u2014 mean that from one side of the continent to the other, we\u2019re making decisions blindly.In the time it took to compile the 2010 report, Texas endured a four-year drought. California settled into what has become a five-year drought. The most authoritative water-use data from across the West couldn\u2019t be less helpful: It\u2019s from the year before the droughts began.In the last year of the Obama presidency, the administration has decided to grab hold of this country\u2019s water problems, water policy and water innovation. Next Tuesday, the White House is hosting a Water Summit, where it promises to unveil new ideas to galvanize the sleepy world of water.The question White House officials are asking is simple: What could the federal government do that wouldn\u2019t cost much but that would change how we think about water?The best and simplest answer: Fix water data.More than any other single step, modernizing water data would unleash an era of water innovation unlike anything in a century.That\u2019s exactly the state of water \u2014 we\u2019ve got crises percolating all over, but lack the data necessary to make smart policy decisions.Congress and President Obama should pass updated legislation creating inside the United States Geological Survey a vigorous water data agency with the explicit charge to gather and quickly release water data of every kind \u2014 what utilities provide, what fracking companies and strawberry growers use, what comes from rivers and reservoirs, the state of aquifers.Good information does three things.First, it creates the demand for more good information. Once you know what you can know, you want to know more.Second, good data changes behavior. The real-time miles-per-gallon gauges in our cars are a great example. Who doesn\u2019t want to edge the M.P.G. number a little higher? Any company, community or family that starts measuring how much water it uses immediately sees ways to use less.Finally, data ignites innovation. Who imagined that when most everyone started carrying a smartphone, we\u2019d have instant, nationwide traffic data? The phones make the traffic data possible, and they also deliver it to us.The truth is, we don\u2019t have any idea what detailed water use data for the United States will reveal. But we can be certain it will create an era of water transformation. If we had monthly data on three big water users \u2014 power plants, farmers and water utilities \u2014 we\u2019d instantly see which communities use water well, and which ones don\u2019t.We\u2019d see whether tomato farmers in California or Florida do a better job. We\u2019d have the information to make smart decisions about conservation, about innovation and about investing in new kinds of water systems.Water\u2019s biggest problem, in this country and around the world, is its invisibility. You don\u2019t tackle problems that are out of sight. We need a new relationship with water, and that has to start with understanding it.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "George Osborne Warns of Brexit Risks and Cuts Growth Forecasts", "Date": "2016-03-16", "News": "Supported byLONDON \u2014 In a budget meant to appeal to voters before a looming referendum, Britain\u2019s chancellor of the Exchequer, George Osborne, on Wednesday mainly offered tax breaks, while warning the public against the risks of opting to quit the European Union.Despite a worsening economic outlook and a downward revision of growth forecasts, Mr. Osborne postponed billions of pounds of further reductions in public spending that he would need to keep his budget plans on track, while offering some significant tax cuts for individuals and businesses.The most controversial item was a new tax on sugary soft drinks, a measure meant to combat childhood obesity. The leader of a soft-drink industry trade group dismissed the tax as \u201cabsurd.\u201dOver all, though, Mr. Osborne\u2019s budget statement seemed intended to avoid antagonizing key groups of voters before the June 23 referendum on whether Britain should remain in the 28-nation European Union or leave it in a so-called Brexit.Mr. Osborne, who like Prime Minister David Cameron, favors staying in the European Union, warned of economic instability if Britain votes for Brexit.\u201cBritain will be stronger, safer and better off inside a reformed European Union,\u201d Mr. Osborne said in Parliament, adding that \u201cwe should not put at risk all the hard work that the British people have done to make our country strong again.\u201dHe added that turbulent financial markets, low productivity in Western nations and a weak outlook for the global economy made for \u201ca dangerous cocktail of risks.\u201dThe budget is expected to be approved by Parliament, coming as it does from the treasury chief of the controlling Conservative Party.The most unexpected initiative was the sugar tax on the soft-drink industry. This would apply, starting in April 2018, to drinks with a total sugar content above 5 grams per 100 milliliters, with a higher rate for beverages with more than 8 grams per 100 milliliters. Milk-based drinks and fruit juices would be exempt.\u201cFive-year-old children are consuming their body weight in sugar every year,\u201d Mr. Osborne told lawmakers, adding that \u201cone of the biggest contributors to childhood obesity is sugary drinks.\u201dThe plan to target soft drinks, but not other products with a high sugar content, was derided as \u201csimply absurd\u201d by Gavin Partington, director general of the British Soft Drinks Association, which says it represents a range of British manufacturers, importers and suppliers.\u201cWe are extremely disappointed by the government\u2019s decision to hit the only category in the food and drink sector which has consistently reduced sugar intake in recent years \u2014 down 13.6 percent since 2012,\u201d Mr. Partington said in a statement.Mr. Osborne\u2019s budget also announced moves to close tax loopholes, including one in which foreign suppliers use sites like eBay and Amazon to sell goods without paying Britain\u2019s sales tax, known as the value added tax.Britain\u2019s economic picture has worsened in recent months. Official growth forecasts for 2016 were revised downward on Wednesday, to 2 percent, compared with the 2.4 percent predicted earlier.The revised projections are based on the assumption that Britain stays in the European Union. The Office for Budget Responsibility, whose job it is to provide an independent analysis of public finances, had warned of \u201can extended period of uncertainty\u201d about Britain\u2019s relationship with the bloc if there was a vote to leave, Mr. Osborne said. That comment prompted protests from opponents of European Union membership that Mr. Osborne had quoted selectively from the report.Despite slower than expected growth, corporate tax rates will be cut to 17 percent by 2020.The amount that people can earn without paying taxes will rise, as will the earnings threshold that they need to cross before moving into a higher tax bracket.There were also tax concessions for the struggling North Sea oil and gas industry and a freeze on taxes on fuel and many types of alcohol. The capital gains tax would be cut to 20 percent, from 28 percent.Mr. Osborne missed one objective by failing to ensure that government debt would fall this year as a proportion of the country\u2019s gross domestic product.Jeremy Corbyn, leader of the opposition Labour Party, said on Wednesday that the budget had \u201cunfairness at its very core\u201d and that Mr. Osborne had \u201cfailed on the budget deficit, failed on debt, failed on investment, failed on productivity, failed on the trade deficit.\u201dPostponing further public spending cuts of 3.5 billion pounds, or $4.9 billion, until the fiscal period 2019-2020, Mr. Osborne remains on track to hit his target of a surplus by the end of the decade.But in aiming to meet this objective \u201cwithout squeezing the economy harder now, Mr. Osborne has backloaded the fiscal pain,\u201d Ian Stewart, chief economist at Deloitte, the business advisory firm, said in a statement. As a result, Mr. Stewart said, the government would need to find spending cuts of \u00a38 billion in 2019-20.\u201cMr. Osborne is hoping that, in the run-up to the next general election, the U.K. will be better placed to cope with the squeeze needed to wipe out the deficit,\u2019\u2019 Mr. Stewart said.\u201cHitting the government\u2019s most important and most cherished fiscal target,\u201d he added, \u201cwill need hard slog and luck.\u201dAn earlier version of the headline for this article misspelled the surname of Britain\u2019s chancellor of the Exchequer.

{"Headline": "Samsung\u2019s Smartphones Aren\u2019t the Problem (Just Prune the Bad Apps)", "Date": "2016-03-16", "News": "Supported byTech FixPITY the poor Samsung smartphone.But try as Samsung might, its smartphones always run into the same criticisms. The gadgets are inferior to Apple\u2019s iPhones, which work seamlessly with the iOS mobile software, some critics say. And while the hardware design of the Galaxy phones \u2014 featuring large, vivid screens and high-quality cameras \u2014 wins plaudits, the devices keep getting thumbs down for some of their junky software.\u201cWe know that one thing that our users want is a little bit less software, and we\u2019ve made a serious effort with this device to include less,\u201d said Philip Berne, a Samsung marketing manager.I tested the new devices to come up with a few rules of thumb for how to get the most out of Samsung\u2019s smartphones. In my tests, I still found the software on the S7 phones to be a negative to what is otherwise superb hardware.Probably the most annoying aspect of Samsung devices is their inclusion of inferior apps made by mobile carriers like Verizon Wireless and AT&T, known in tech industry parlance as carrier bloatware. These include apps like mapping or music services provided by the carriers, which are generally unpopular.Fortunately, most of the carrier-installed apps on Samsung phones can be disabled. The apps included will differ from carrier to carrier, but generally bloatware can be turned off and better alternatives downloaded.Using the Verizon version of the S7 as an example, open the Apps folder and then open the Verizon folder. Verizon apps one may want to disable include the football app NFL Mobile, the music app Slacker Radio, the mapping app Verizon Navigator and the messaging app Message+. Just press and hold down on these apps and drag them to the button labeled \u201cTurn off.\u201dMs. Ion said carrier-installed software was what annoyed her the most on the Samsung phones, because it detracts from the appeal of Android, an operating system made for customization.\u201cIt\u2019s all about the ability to have the choice to do whatever the heck you want with your phone,\u201d she said of the Android system. \u201cThat\u2019s why I get so angry about carrier bloat.\u201dOn Android, the aesthetic of the interface \u2014 or the way the home screen, folders and apps look \u2014 is called a launcher. Samsung\u2019s version is named TouchWiz, and while the S7\u2019s version of TouchWiz looks a bit better than previous ones, there are plenty of more attractive launchers.In my testing, I preferred the Google Now launcher. It makes the app icons look clean and vibrant, and swiping to the left of the main screen displays a list of cards containing Google account information, including calendar, recent Amazon purchases and the weather. It\u2019s a convenient way to take a quick peek at useful personalized data.Apart from apps included by carriers on the Galaxy phones, Samsung also loads some of its custom-made software, like its calendar, voice assistant and email app, on the devices. It also includes some software from partners like Amazon and Google. (Believe it or not, the Verizon version of the S7 includes four music apps, one each from Samsung, Google, Verizon and Amazon.)The Samsung apps aren\u2019t terrible, but because most Android users are tied to Google services, consumers would benefit from installing the superior Google-made alternatives for those apps: Google Calendar, Gmail and Google\u2019s voice assistant.To use it, first disable Samsung\u2019s voice assistant. Inside the Samsung apps folder, press and hold on the S Voice app, then select \u201cturn off.\u201d Inside the Google app, tap the rectangular tab in the upper-left corner, then Settings, then \u201cO.K. Google\u201d detection and swipe right on the option for \u201cFrom any screen.\u201d From here, users can say \u201cO.K. Google\u201d and speak a command, like \u201ccreate a calendar event,\u201d and the voice assistant will react.For the email and calendar apps, simply download Google\u2019s versions through its Play app store. They are far better designed and more tightly integrated with Google services than Samsung\u2019s apps.In my testing, I found Samsung\u2019s digital keyboard to be imprecise and awkward for typing. There are plenty of better alternatives to download through the Google Play app store.Here again I would recommend Google\u2019s keyboard, which has auto-prediction, or the ability to quickly predict intended words after a few keystrokes. It also allows typing by swiping around the keyboard.There\u2019s a downside to de-Samsungifying the Samsung phones. While most of the included software from both Samsung and mobile carriers can be deactivated, some apps cannot be removed without taking extreme measures to wipe out all the software on the phone and replace it with a fresh install of Android, a method called rooting or flashing. That process is complicated, so it\u2019s not for the faint of heart.That means a lot of apps included on the Samsung phones will linger inside folders even after alternatives have been installed. Duplicates of some apps will probably remain.But the Samsung software is easy enough to ignore by creating shortcuts to the ones you actually want. In the main apps folder, just drag and drop desired apps onto the home screen.In the end, you will have a great Samsung phone with excellent software.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "CBS Considers Selling Its U.S. Radio Business", "Date": "2016-03-16", "News": "Supported byBreakingviewsThe exit of CBS from the radio business looks in tune with the times. CBS, a $24 billion broadcaster, is considering a sale of its 117 stations in the United States, just as the Internet streaming service Pandora may be on the block. Both moves could make sense, given stiff competition from the likes of Spotify, waning advertising and other industry disruption. The trick will be to find buyers.The company\u2019s chief executive, Leslie Moonves, said on Tuesday that CBS was exploring \u201cstrategic options\u201d for its clutch of AM/FM stations. A sale or other separation could generate up to $1.9 billion in gross proceeds, according to Jefferies, the investment bank.The urge to deal is understandable. Industry revenue has declined as advertisers have embraced other media to reach customers. Last year, radio ad sales dropped 2 percent, while revenue in the struggling newspaper business actually rose 7 percent, according to Standard Media Index.Streaming services are capturing more listeners, too. Spotify and Apple allow people to pick songs and listen to them commercial-free. That\u2019s a double whammy for terrestrial radio stations.Not everything is upbeat in the digital-streaming world, however. Pandora cannot grow overseas, because it lacks licenses to play music outside the United States. That seems to be driving its possible sale. Spotify is raising money and could be interested in Pandora\u2019s more than 80 million listeners and powerful sales force. Long-shot buyers could include the likes of Google or Amazon.A sale is not the only option for CBS. It could split off the division, much as Time Warner did with AOL, Time Warner Cable and Time Inc. CBS itself put its outdoor business into a separately traded real estate investment trust in 2014.Possible buyers for the radio arm include iHeartMedia and Cumulus Media, although both are mired in debt. Alternatively, the division could, as a separate business, buy assets of those two troubled companies. Either way, the broadcaster seems to have a playlist to choose from.Advertisement"}

Most of the dozen main interview participants, including the former models China Machado, Bethann Hardison and Pat Cleveland, were also in the 2012 documentary.Imagine if the art department of a glossy magazine were hired to redesign your child\u2019s history textbook, and you\u2019ll get the picture.Handling narration duties is Stanley Tucci (not coincidentally, a WME voice-over client; how is that for synergy?), who tells the story of how Eleanor Lambert, the fashion world doyenne, organized the battle not just to raise money for the restoration of the dilapidated palace, but also to bring international renown to a group of designers who previously had little exposure outside of New York.Aside from the models, those recounting the Americans\u2019 triumphing over their more experienced European rivals include the publicist James LaForce and the former F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Fran\u00e7aise de la Couture chairman Didier Grumbach. Donna Karan, Anne Klein\u2019s assistant at the time of the battle, was such a last-minute addition to the film that the team interviewed her last Tuesday morning, and finished editing Thursday afternoon \u2014 at which point she flew to Paris to attend the Rick Owens show.The documentary also features old footage of Liza Minnelli, fresh off her 1973 Oscar win for \u201cCabaret,\u201d who joined the American caravan with her friend Halston and performed for the crowd. Halston had a tantrum during rehearsals, reminiscent of Kanye West at \u201cSaturday Night Live,\u201d and walked out of the proceedings.Unfortunately, the documentary is so focused on ticking off boxes (interviews with every major model, snapshot bios of Ms. Lambert and each of the designers) that it never settles on any of its characters long enough to give their stories emotional heft.It may have made sense to focus on Mr. Burrows, the last living designer among the Americans and a man whose ups and downs in the industry raise myriad questions about the nature of creativity and what it is like to be black in a largely white business.At the after-party, held at the Plaza Hotel Rose Club, Fern Mallis, the former executive director of the Council of Fashion Designers of America, argued that even without fleshing out Mr. Burrows\u2019s narrative, there was still resonance to a story in which a group of models, many of them African-American, helped lead Mr. Burrows and the Americans to victory.\u201cIt was a little long,\u201d he said (the film was 61 minutes). \u201cOh, don\u2019t write that down.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Hachette Reaches New Deal With Perseus Books", "Date": "2016-03-01", "News": "Supported byThe Hachette Book Group has reached an agreement to buy the Perseus Books Group\u2019s publishing business, 18 months after its previous attempt to acquire the company fell through.The new agreement, which was announced on Tuesday, comes six months after Perseus, a large independent publisher, began looking for a buyer again after the first deal with Hachette collapsed.The financial terms of the deal were not disclosed.The acquisition will strengthen Hachette\u2019s position in a publishing landscape where the biggest companies often dominate. It is the latest in a wave of consolidations that has swept the industry in recent years, including the 2013 merger of Penguin and Random House, which created a publishing behemoth with about 250 imprints, and the News Corporation\u2019s acquisition of the romance publisher Harlequin for $415 million in 2014.By buying Perseus\u2019s publishing program, Hachette will fulfill the long-term goal of its parent company, Hachette Livre, which is owned by the French media conglomerate Lagard\u00e8re, to expand its publishing footprint in the United States. In recent years, Hachette has acquired Black Dog & Leventhal Publishers and Hyperion\u2019s adult books list. The Perseus deal is Hachette\u2019s largest acquisition to date.For Hachette, which publishes about 1,200 books a year through imprints like Grand Central and Little, Brown, the addition of nine imprints from Perseus will help fill out and balance its publishing program in areas like nonfiction and travel. Hachette has cultivated a stable of best-selling authors, including James Patterson, Michael Connelly and Donna Tartt, and like most of the big five publishing houses, it remains in many ways dependent on blockbuster hits to drive revenue.Perseus, on the other hand, has built its business on reliable backlist sales of perennial best sellers \u2014 it has 6,000 backlist titles \u2014 and niche nonfiction titles that appeal to specific audiences. Its imprints, which publish around 500 books a year, will give Hachette a stronger toehold in the nonfiction market and add to its overall market share. Last year, Perseus\u2019s publishing program generated nearly $100 million in revenue, through imprints like Basic Books, Avalon Travel, Da Capo, Nation Books and PublicAffairs.\u201cIt\u2019s a great publishing program with a lot of diversity within it, and we\u2019re very happy to have all this excellence to add to what we already bring forth,\u201d Michael Pietsch, the chief executive of the Hachette Book Group, said in an interview. \u201cEvery publisher likes the idea of selling books for every kind of reader, and the Perseus lists are rich in areas where Hachette books in some cases doesn\u2019t publish at all, like travel, and in other cases where we\u2019d like to publish more, like public affairs, health and wellness, pop culture, illustrated books.\u201dAdding heft will probably help Hachette in a cutthroat media landscape where publishers are increasingly being squeezed by major retailers like Amazon and Barnes & Noble. It will also make the company less dependent on best sellers. \u201cIt expands our overall profile and gives us more areas of publishing,\u201d Mr. Pietsch said.The acquisition could be a sign of more consolidation to come as the top five publishing houses compete for market share in a shrinking retail environment.\u201cThey all want more volume, and Perseus is one of the largest trophies out there,\u201d said Mike Shatzkin, the founder and chief executive of the Idea Logical Company, which analyzes the book industry. \u201cIf you take the long view, I\u2019d be so bold as to say we\u2019ll have two big trade publishers 10 years from now, and no more.\u201dHachette\u2019s earlier attempt to buy Perseus faltered because of the complexity of the arrangement, which included a sale of Perseus\u2019s books distribution business to the Ingram Content Group, a major book printer and distributor. Perseus\u2019s distribution arm, which is separate from its publishing division, distributes books for about 600 independent publishers and brings in $300 million annually to Perseus.When Hachette first tried to acquire Perseus in June 2014, it agreed to buy the entire company, then sell the distribution business to Ingram. At the time, Hachette was engulfed in a brutal fight with Amazon over e-book pricing, and the retailer had removed the buy button from some Hachette titles and delayed shipping on others. The deal between Hachette and Perseus collapsed less than two months later.Last fall, Perseus\u2019s board decided to explore a sale again. It hired an investment banking firm, Greenhill & Company, to advise it. The board decided to solicit offers for the entire company, but also to entertain bids from buyers who wanted just the publishing or distribution arm.About a half-dozen serious offers came in, and Hachette immediately expressed interest in the publishing program. Perseus is also close to signing a deal on its distribution services, said David Steinberger, the president and chief executive of the Perseus Books Group.Perseus has been rumored to be for sale ever since the death of its founder, Frank Pearl, in 2012. The company is owned by Centre Lane Partners, a private investment firm. Mr. Steinberger said that after several potential buyers expressed interest, the company\u2019s board decided to sell to provide a return to its investors.Mr. Steinberger, who has led the company since 2004, said he would leave the company after the sale of the distribution services was complete.Hachette plans to make Perseus a publishing division, which will be led by Susan Weinberg, the senior vice president and group publisher for Perseus.\u201cHachette is a great long-term home for Perseus,\u201d Mr. Steinberger said. \u201cIt\u2019s a company with a great longstanding commitment to authors and the written word.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Souq, Online Retailer in Middle East, Gets a $275 Million Boost", "Date": "2016-02-29", "News": "Supported byDUBAI, United Arab Emirates \u2014 Souq.com, an online retailer based in the United Arab Emirates, said on Monday that it had raised $275 million from international investors. It was a vote of confidence for digital commerce in the Middle East, which has made little headway compared with elsewhere.Souq, the largest e-commerce company in the Middle East, was founded in 2005 on an eBay-like online auction model, but it subsequently evolved into more of an Amazon-style set-price retailer. It has been a rare success story in a region where online businesses face logistical problems, political challenges, stifling bureaucracy and regulations that vary greatly from country to country.Souq\u2019s latest round of funding included money from the New York-based investment firm Tiger Global Management, as well as from Standard Chartered Private Equity and the International Finance Corporation, which is an arm of the World Bank.Souq, which means market in Arabic, did not provide details on what the funding round meant for its overall valuation, and it has not released details on its annual sales or profit. The $275 million funding round was, however, the largest ever disclosed by a technology start-up in the Middle East and North Africa, according to Wamda, a research firm based in Dubai, the United Arab Emirates.Even after multiple fund-raising rounds, the Jabbar Internet Group \u2014 which sold Maktoob, a news site, to Yahoo for more than $150 million in 2009 \u2014 still holds a majority stake.\u201cThe start-up scene has changed so much since Souq launched over 10 years ago,\u201d Ronaldo Mouchawar, the chief executive of Souq, said in an interview, \u201cand the size and scope of this kind of funding is encouraging for entrepreneurs.\u201dMr. Mouchawar said the company would use the funds to bolster its technology, such as payment processing, and to help increase the scale of its operations by improving logistics. Souq also hopes to introduce new product categories, particularly related to beauty and fashion, and to recruit employees, he said.In particular, it will look to improve its mobile application; Mr. Mouchawar noted that 70 percent of purchases from Souq in Saudi Arabia, the Middle East\u2019s second-biggest market, were made on phones.Souq, now the largest online retailer in the Arab world, ships hundreds of thousands of products across the six countries of the Gulf Cooperation Council: Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. It also has operations in Egypt.\u201cMost local retailers \u2014 whether they will openly admit it or not \u2014 are fully aware that customers can find products cheaper online, whether locally or on global sites,\u201d said Alexandra Tohme, an independent e-commerce analyst with more than a decade of marketing experience in the region. \u201cIn some cases, even heavy items with shipping charges still generate savings of up to 50 percent compared to brick-and-mortar stores.\u201dMs. Tohme said Souq\u2019s particular success was driven by competitive prices compared with other retailers in the region, and by its reputation for reliable delivery.Several other online retailers have tried, and failed, to overcome the myriad difficulties of e-commerce in the Middle East.Barriers to trade across the region remain high and include tariffs, varying national laws and different currencies. Political instability can also be an obstacle in countries like Egypt, whose population of nearly 90 million has endured heightened levels of violence since an uprising in 2011. The high costs associated with online retail can also discourage start-ups.As a result, several major online retailers have struggled: Joob, an online travel website started by the Jabbar Internet Group, folded with little explanation a year after its introduction in 2011; the German start-up fund Rocket Internet closed Mizado, an Amazon copycat, in 2012, after just five months of operation, to concentrate on the online shoe retailer Namshi, it said. That same year, the online daily deals website LivingSocial abruptly exited the Middle East.The market\u2019s potential remains attractive, however.\u201cBy the end of the decade, two-thirds of the region will have smart devices \u2014 supercomputers in their pockets \u2014 which means increased innovation, problem-solving and purchasing power,\u201d said Christopher M. Schroeder, an American venture capitalist.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "A Red Carpet for Amazon in Fall River, Mass., and Hopes for More", "Date": "2016-03-29", "News": "Supported bySquare FeetFALL RIVER, Mass. \u2014 For this former mill town, the deal to secure a large Amazon distribution center means much more than the $3.78 million coming from the land sale and the successful culmination of three years\u2019 worth of negotiations.\u201cAny time you have a corporate giant making a commitment to a city, that speaks volumes,\u201d said Kenneth Fiola Jr., executive vice president of the Fall River Office of Economic Development, which worked closely with state officials and the broker NAI Hunneman to bring in the online retailer. \u201cIt gave us enhanced credibility.\u201dCredibility to attract other large companies, for one thing. And the deal for an over one-million-square-foot distribution center also gives Fall River, a southeastern Massachusetts city of about 89,000 people, cash to tackle a long list of improvements planned for its downtown business district. It is the latest step in a strategy that Mr. Fiola and other civic leaders are pursuing to encourage urban investment and redevelopment.Like other former mill towns throughout the Northeast, Fall River necessarily refocused its economic base after the textile industry began departing in the 1990s. The city negotiated with the state and federal government for tax incentives to lure biomedical manufacturers and others into the area.\u201cYou\u2019re seeing a city reinvent itself,\u201d said Robert A. Mellion, president and chief executive of the Fall River Area Chamber of Commerce. \u201cIt didn\u2019t happen by accident. It\u2019s an effort to design and implement an economy that\u2019s sustainable for the long haul.\u201dLocal businesses, many in the health care sector, have also been growing, which is good news for James J. Karam, president and chief executive of the property firm First Bristol, which owns three buildings downtown.\u201cI have two 50,000-square-foot buildings that are 100 percent occupied by local firms,\u201d Mr. Karam said. He bought his third building, which is 100,000 square feet, from Travelers Insurance, which reduced its footprint and now leases 40,000 square feet from First Bristol. \u201cWe\u2019re at 75 percent occupancy in the remaining space, up from 40 percent in just one year. It\u2019s been going quite well,\u201d he said.For its part, Amazon, which did not respond to requests for comment, is expected to hire 500 people when its $36 million warehouse opens this fall. The Trammell Crow Company is developing the project on 77 acres in the SouthCoast Life Science & Technology Park, one of three municipally owned industrial zones. It is a 10-minute drive north from Fall River\u2019s downtown. The city worked with the state to make the zones as attractive as possible: expediting development approvals, for instance, and improving site access by securing federal funds to build a new highway interchange off Route 24, which opened in 2012.\u201cThe only permits that Amazon had to get were building permits,\u201d said Michael DiGiano, an executive vice president with NAI Hunneman. Cathy Minnerly, another NAI executive vice president who is also a principal, added: \u201cThe fact it was shovel-ready was a very large point.\u201dShortly after the deal was announced in November, Fall River\u2019s redevelopment agency moved forward with rehabilitating Old Second Street, a 1960s-era pedestrian mall in the heart of downtown, by hiring an architectural firm based in Boston, Brown, Richardson & Rowe.The revival of this corridor fits neatly with the agenda of Fall River\u2019s newly elected mayor, Jasiel Correia II. Since taking office in January, Mr. Correia has reinitiated a matching grant program for downtown building owners who want to improve their facades. He also has hired the marketing firm Penrose Commercial, based in Boston and Providence, R.I., to plan a new strategy for selling vacant city-owned properties.Mr. Correia, who turned 24 shortly before taking office, aims to create a live-work-play environment downtown. His goal is to attract young professionals who might be priced out of Providence, another former mill city nearby that has successfully reinvented itself.\u201cI understand the challenges people my age are facing, the desires and opportunities that they have and want,\u201d he said. \u201cFall River, a community with a lot of growth potential, is really prime for someone to take it by the horns and really start to develop it.\u201dDevelopers are already doing just that. Construction began last fall on apartments within the mixed-use complex Commonwealth Landing. For the investors Anthony Cordeiro, Larry Couto and Alan Macomber, this $18 million project represents the third and final phase of redeveloping a 228,000-square-foot waterfront mill building originally occupied by Quaker Fabric.Mr. Cordeiro, Mr. Couto and Mr. Macomber bought the property at a bankruptcy sale in 2010. A combination of state and federal tax credits allowed them to construct offices, two restaurants and a training center for Bristol Community College within Commonwealth Landing\u2019s bottom two floors. The new 103 apartments within the building\u2019s top three stories will be the first exclusively market-rate multifamily housing built in Fall River for a generation.Mr. Cordeiro hopes that the units\u2019 high-end finishes like granite countertops and amenities like an adjacent river walkway will attract millennials and empty-nesters once the project is complete early next year.\u201cWe\u2019ll retain as much of the original flooring, ceiling and brick walls as possible,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to raise the standards and get people who want to live and play all in the same area.\u201dWork to remove an unsightly tangle of ramps that blocks downtown waterfront views should also finish in 2017. The $197 million project aims to reconstruct the interchange between Interstate 195 and State Route 79. The city also hopes to receive state approval this spring for $80 million for design and construction to reconfigure Route 79 just north of downtown, which would further improve harbor access and open 10 acres for mixed-use development.\u201cIf you lived in the city before, you always dreamed about it,\u201d Mr. Cordeiro said of this redevelopment activity and the potential for more, \u201cbut now we\u2019re living it.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Europe\u2019s Antitrust Enforcer on Google, Apple and the Year Ahead", "Date": "2016-03-06", "News": "Supported byBitsBRUSSELS \u2014 Margrethe Vestager is already having a busy 2016.Her aggressive positions have made the 47-year-old Danish politician \u2014 said to be among the inspirations behind \u201cBorgen,\u201d a critically acclaimed TV show described as Denmark\u2019s answer to \u201cThe West Wing\u201d \u2014 a poster child for Europe\u2019s somewhat combative relationship with United States tech giants.Ms. Vestager sat down with The New York Times last week to discuss her priorities for the year, the issues underpinning her competition investigations and whether she unfairly targets American companies. The interview has been condensed and edited for clarity.What\u2019s obvious is that it\u2019s not just important to open cases, but important to close cases, too. But as some of the antitrust cases we have ongoing are huge, that\u2019s not necessarily going to happen in 2016. I expect in the merger field we will keep busy, and we\u2019ll keep our focus on antitrust and state aid issues.Since we aren\u2019t done yet, we can\u2019t yet go through the different elements of the statement of objections. But Google gave us a very substantial answer, and what we need to do is ask them for more data to have a comprehensive picture so they aren\u2019t just giving us data that solely substantiates their position.It\u2019s a huge task. We\u2019re doing our best with the analysis, but it\u2019s also interesting to see how legitimate third parties [that have filed complaints in the case] also look at it.I have learned that to do antitrust at this volume takes the patience of steel. Speed is itself a quality because we have big companies whose names are being mentioned over and over again, so you have to think about that.But speed isn\u2019t a quality unto itself. You can\u2019t substitute justice with speed. You need to be able to say this will hold up in court. Then, speed is a secondary issue.That depends. Other complaints related to online mapping or local search are similar, as they say Google uses its position to promote itself in neighboring markets. That is very similar to the current statement of objections.The biggest American tech companies face intensifying scrutiny by European regulators, with \u2014 pressure that could potentially curb their sizable profits in the region and affect how they operate around the world.Then we have issues that are different in nature. One is scraping [allegations that Google copies content from other sites]; another is the question of advertising [claims that Google abuses its dominance in advertising contracts]; and then we have Android, which is almost another planet. We will become much wiser as we go in-depth in these areas.It\u2019s not black or white. The questions people have been asking are whether data can be duplicated, and can a competitor establish itself in the same way or buy a copy of another\u2019s data?So far, the analysis shows that data can be copied or newly created without any detrimental effects to competitors. That\u2019s why I have approached this area with a very open mind.That doesn\u2019t necessarily have to be a problem.But I still think Adam Smith was right when he said there\u2019s no such thing as a free lunch. Eventually, you will pay in one form or the other. And it\u2019s that \u201cother\u201d that is still hard to grasp because we are just in the process of truly appreciating the value of our own data.National tax legislation and European state aid rules need to be fulfilled at the same time. For me, it\u2019s a simple question of fair competition.Companies compete door to door with similar products, prices and services. If one company has higher costs and another company has lower costs solely because of aggressive tax arrangements, then you have a problem.There\u2019s a lot of convenience in that argument. I\u2019ve been asking my people to give me the statistics to find a bias, and I can find no bias. Not in the mergers, not in the fines being paid out, there\u2019s no U.S. bias. It also ignores the fact that we often react to complaints from U.S. companies.These are huge companies that play a very strong role in the market. But you still have many, many, many more companies that are on their way, that want to make it into the market, and that need open markets for the incentive to innovate.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "For Hedge Funds, Start of 2016 Offers Little Relief From 2015", "Date": "2016-03-10", "News": "Supported byBut he keeps on losing money.Over the first two months of this year, his $9.2 billion Glenview Capital Management\u2019s flagship portfolio lost 15 percent. The new fund \u2014 called GCM Equity Partners \u2014 is down 5.2 percent. Even worse, the Glenview Capital Opportunity fund, a $1.7 billion portfolio that uses leverage or borrowed money to enhance its bets, has lost 22.4 percent through the end of February.Mr. Robbins is not the only one. William A. Ackman, another big-name investor, is also nursing double-digit losses this year.If last year was a tough one for the swing-for-the-fences hedge fund managers who became synonymous with moneymaking in years past, the first few months of 2016 are looking just as bad.These losses have become harder for impatient investors to stomach following big losses last year.The University of California\u2019s endowment fund, for example, said on Thursday that it would cut the number of hedge funds it invests in to about 10 from 32, as part of an effort to simplify its hedge fund investments.Now some brand-name managers who have recorded big losses for many months are facing pressure from investors to redeem their money \u2014 something that could lead them to sell their holdings in stocks in order to come up with the necessary cash.But the continued underperformance from the industry has also raised a broader question from investors like pension funds: What are they getting in return for the hefty fees they pay?In the first three months of this year, investors are expected to withdraw $25 billion from hedge funds, according to a Goldman Sachs Prime Brokerage Services survey of hedge fund investors representing about $425 billion in investments. Of those investors who planned to redeem money, however, more than three-quarters said they would reinvest the money in other hedge funds.\u201cI think they are getting the benefit of the doubt,\u201d Dean Backer, global head of sales and capital introduction at Goldman Sachs, said of many of the biggest hedge fund managers, owing to their historical performance. \u201cI\u2019m not sure people know \u2014 if they took money out of hedge funds\u2014 where they would put it,\u201d he added.Some well-known firms that bucked the negative trend in 2015 are getting punished this year. The Marcato International Fund, run by Mick McGuire, a former prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of Mr. Ackman, was down 12.8 percent as of the end of February. Citadel\u2019s Kensington fund, run by the billionaire Kenneth C. Griffin, had lost 6.2 percent as of the end of February. SkyBridge Capital, a fund of hedge funds run by Anthony Scaramucci, pulled $1 billion in the fourth quarter from hedge funds that focus on event-driven strategies led by John A. Paulson, Daniel Loeb and Barry Rosenstein, taking action ahead of turbulent performance from all three firms this year.Solomon Kumin\u2019s Folger Hill Asset Management is still struggling to gain traction some two years after it opened for business. The firm is down about 10 percent for the year. Mr. Kumin, who was the chief operating officer for Steven A. Cohen\u2019s former multibillion-dollar hedge fund, SAC Capital Advisors, lost 3 percent last year.Maybe one of the biggest surprise losers is Blackstone\u2019s Senfina Advisors, a $2 billion fund the private equity firm started in 2014 that allocates money to several equity trading teams. The fund is down about 15 percent for the year after posting a 20 percent gain in 2015.Some of the declines can be attributed to the underwhelming performance of a basket of 50 stocks that Goldman Sachs says hedge funds like most. The basket \u2014 which includes Allergan, Amazon, Apple, Citigroup, Valeant and Teva \u2014 was down 5.6 percent for the year as of March 4.Meanwhile, the broadest measure of hedge fund performance, the HFRI Fund Weighted Composite Index, was down about 2.6 percent for the year at the end of February, matching the 2.6 percent decline in the S.&P. 500-stock index as of the close of trading on Thursday.Both Mr. Robbins and Mr. Ackman then are consistently faring worse than their peers when it comes to placing bets on stocks.For Mr. Robbins, positions in Monsanto, Cigna, the Laboratory Corporation of America and Teva Pharmaceutical Industries have caused investors a headache. For Mr. Ackman, big bets on Valeant, Platform Specialty Products and the Howard Hughes Corporation have driven losses.And Mr. Ackman\u2019s firm continues to be bedeviled by its longstanding bearish bet against the shares of Herbalife, which have risen a little more than 3 percent this year.It\u2019s not all red ink in the nearly $3 trillion hedge fund universe.David Einhorn\u2019s Greenlight Capital is up 3.3 percent after losing 20.4 percent last year. Horseman Capital Management, a firm based in London and run by John Horseman, is up 9.7 percent this year, after posting gains of 20.4 percent in 2015.One of this year\u2019s early big winners is Boaz Weinstein and his Saba Capital Management. Mr. Weinstein, a one-time star credit trader at Deutsche Bank, has seen his share of ups and downs \u2014 assets at his fund fell to $1.9 billion from a peak of nearly $6 billion in 2012. But the firm now appears to be on the upswing.Saba Capital, which focuses mostly on investments in credit, reported a 3.4 percent gain in its main fund last year.

{"Headline": null, "Date": null, "News": "\n                    COLINVAUX--Paul Alfred. Among the last generation of \"explorer\" scientists, Paul Alfred Colinvaux, 85, died February 28, 2016 on Cape Cod, MA, where he had lived and worked at the Marine Biological Laboratories after retiring, in 1998, from the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute in Balboa, Panama. Colinvaux was Professor Emeritus at The Ohio State University, where he was a professor of Zoology from 1964 until 1991. In 2008, a National Public Radio host aptly described Colinvaux as \"Linnaeus meets Indiana Jones.\" Over a fifty-year career, Colinvaux explored the Alaskan and Siberian Arctic, the Galapagos Islands, and the Amazonian jungle in Brazil, Ecuador, and Peru on a mission to discover the history of the climate. Trained as a paleoecologist, with a Ph.D. from Duke (1962) and post-doctoral training at Yale, Colinvaux extracted fossilized pollen from the bottom of ancient lakes as a tool to investigate climate conditions at the end of the last glacial maximum (20,000 years before present). Using little more than rubber boats, and a sediment \"coring rig\" he designed with OSU engineer Vincent Vohnout, Colinvaux and his team of scientists removed tubes of lake mud that had lain undisturbed for thousands of years. The pollen buried in the mud could then be dated and used to identify pre-historic climate conditions. In a pre-Google Earth era, without benefit of GPS technology, Colinvaux explored in the old ways, quizzing tribal fishermen and local traders, and poring over aerial maps to identify sectors of jungle to search for tiny, unmapped lakes undisturbed by human activity. At times, Colinvaux and his team were able to travel by helicopter or bush plane. More often, their targets were accessible only by foot or canoe, and so they marched through dense, uncharted jungle, for weeks at a time, with machetes in their hands, food and equipment on their backs. Colinvaux&aposs early work in Alaska developed a 130,000 year-long data set that is still used to study the climate prevailing during the great Ice Age migrations across the \"Bering Land Bridge.\" Colinvaux continued this work in Siberia in the last days of the Soviet Union, and his leadership role in early Reagan-Gorbachev-era \"glasnost\" helped establish an academic Edtente. At the equator, in the tradition of Darwin, Colinvaux was fascinated by the extraordinary, and to this day unexplained, vastness of equatorial species diversity. Ultimately, Colinvaux published evidence that he argued disproved the long- reigning \"refugia\" hypothesis, which posited that pockets of warm, wet flora might have survived the Ice Age, spurring localized speciation. Although the question remains unresolved, his research was instrumental in laying the foundation for modern thinking and research on Amazonian species diversity. When not in the Arctic, the Amazon or his laboratories, Colinvaux pursued other passions. At Ohio State, he was privileged to win every teaching prize then offered. His skill as an orator was renowned. During the Vietnam-era student uprising and occupation of Ohio State in May 1970, Colinvaux addressed, impromptu, a throng of demonstrating students, using the power of his voice and words to disperse the crowd. His oratory so influenced legendary football coach, Woody Hayes, that generations of OSU football players were urged to take Colinvaux&aposs introductory ecology course. In 1973, Colinvaux authored the first undergraduate textbook in Ecology, which was used, in various editions, to educate generations of students in the United States and abroad. A lifelong oarsman who had rowed in Henley Royal Regatta, Colinvaux also was an original faculty advisor for the Ohio State University crew. In addition to extensive scientific writings and a memoir of his Amazon explorations (\"Amazon Expeditions: My Quest for the Ice-Age Equator\" (2008), Colinvaux was the author of two, widely read \"popular\" explorations of the intersection between science and such modern political issues such as global climate change and crowding due to over-population: \"Why Big Fierce Animals Are Rare: An Ecologist&aposs Perspective\" (1978) and \"The Fates of Nations: A Biological Theory of History\" (1980). Both books were translated into numerous languages and published throughout the world. Paul Colinvaux was born in St. Albans, England in 1930. He grew up in London during the Battle of Britain, studying, even as a boy, the ecology of plant regrowth in the craters left by German bombs. A graduate of Jesus College, Cambridge University (1956), Colinvaux served in the British Army of the Rhine in occupied Germany as a Second Lieutenant, Royal Artillery, 42nd Regiment. In 1966, he discovered a new species of flower in the Galapagos, which was subsequently named for him (\"Passiflora colinvauxii\"), as was the Galapagos diatom, \"Amphora paulii.\" In 1971, he was awarded a Guggenheim fellowship. In 2013, he received a lifetime achievement award from the American Quaternary Association. In addition to his beloved wife of fifty-four years, fellow scientist Llewellya Hillis, Colinvaux leaves a sister (Margaret Robinson of Norfolk, England), two children (Catherine Colinvaux of Northborough, MA and Roger Colinvaux of Washington, DC), four grandchildren, generations of students, and thousands of books. 1/3        "}
{"Headline": "Parrots Are a Lot More Than \u2018Pretty Bird\u2019", "Date": "2016-03-21", "News": "BasicsOut of the cage, they speak their own language, make tools, and wreak havoc on plants and researchers\u2019 efforts alike.Supported byJuan F. Masello never intended to study wild parrots. Twenty years ago, as a graduate student visiting the northernmost province of Patagonia in Argentina, he planned to write his dissertation on colony formation among seabirds.But when he asked around for flocks of, say, cormorants or storm petrels, a park warden told him he was out of luck.\u201cHe said, \u2018This is the only part of Patagonia with no seabird colonies,\u2019\u201d recalled Dr. Masello, a principal investigator in animal ecology and systematics at Justus Liebig University in Germany. Might the young scientist be interested in seeing a large colony of parrots instead?The sight that greeted Dr. Masello was \u201camazing\u201d and \u201cincredible,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was almost beyond words.\u201dOn a 160-foot-high sandstone cliff that stretched some seven miles along the Atlantic coast, tens of thousands of pairs of burrowing parrots had used their powerful bills to dig holes \u2014 their nests \u2014 deep into the rock face.And when breeding season began not long afterward, the sky around the cliffs erupted into a raucous carnival of parrot: 150,000 crow-size, polychromed aeronauts with olive backsides, turquoise wings, white epaulets and bright red belly patches ringed in gold. Dr. Masello was hooked.Today, Dr. Masello\u2019s hands are covered with bite scars. He has had four operations to repair a broken knee, a broken nose \u2014 \u201cthe little accidents you get from working with parrots,\u201d he said. Still, he has no regrets.\u201cTheir astonishing beauty and intelligence,\u201d Dr. Masello said, \u201care inspirational.\u201dDr. Masello is one of a small but unabashedly enthusiastic circle of researchers who study Psittaciformes, the avian order that includes parrots, parakeets, macaws and cockatoos. For all their visual splash and cartoon familiarity, parrots have long been given scientific short shrift in favor of more amenable subjects like, say, zebra finches or blue tits.But through a mix of rugged and sometimes risky field work, laboratory studies and a willingness to shrug off the frequent loss of expensive tracking equipment, researchers are gaining insights into the lives, minds and startling appetites of parrots.No, Polly doesn\u2019t want your Triscuits. Got any fig trees to savage?Parrot partisans say the birds easily rival the great apes and dolphins in all-around braininess and resourcefulness, and may be the only animals apart from humans capable of dancing to the beat.\u201cWe call them feathered primates,\u201d said Irene Pepperberg, who studies animal cognition at Harvard and is renowned for her research with Alex and other African grey parrots.\u201cThey\u2019re very good colleagues,\u201d said Alice Auersperg of the University of Vienna, who studies the Goffin\u2019s cockatoo of Indonesia.Many of the recent discoveries are described in a new book, \u201cParrots of the Wild: A Natural History of the World\u2019s Most Captivating Birds,\u201d by Catherine A. Toft and Timothy F. Wright. Others have been reported in journals or demonstrated through online videos, which have gone viral or deserve to.Dr. Auersperg and her colleagues have found that Goffin\u2019s cockatoos are among the most spontaneously inventive toolmakers ever described, and that the birds can learn how to fashion the latest food-fetching device after just a single viewing of a master cockatoo at work.Studying the yellow-naped Amazon of Costa Rica, Dr. Wright and his colleagues have discovered that different populations of the parrot communicate with one another in distinct dialects that remain stable over decades, like human languages. Just as with people, young parrots can easily master multiple dialects while their elders can\u2019t or won\u2019t bother to do likewise.A recent DNA analysis showed that parrots were closely related to falcons, a finding that dovetails with field studies of parrots\u2019 often merciless dietary habits.While falcons are predators in the conventional sense, hunting and devouring other animals, parrots turn out to be no less bloodthirsty in their approach to feasting on plants. Forget about symbiosis or some happy tit-for-tat between flora and this particular fauna.Parrots pooh-pooh the fruit pulp and home in on the seeds, crushing the casings to extract the plant embryos and the cache of fats and proteins intended to help those embryos germinate. \u201cA parrot is a plant carnivore,\u201d Dr. Wright said. \u201cIt destroys the seed. It goes right in through the fruit and eats the plant baby.\u201dOr the entire herbaceous brood. Researchers have found that when a flock of parrots alights on a fruiting tree, a veritable seed massacre can ensue.In one study of canary-winged parakeets foraging on the seeds of shaving-brush trees in the Cerrado tropical savanna of central Brazil, scientists determined that the birds destroyed 66 percent to 100 percent of each tree\u2019s fruit in a matter of days. Not a single whole seed could be found on the ground.The psittacines are a midsize club of about 360 species, ranging in size from the pygmy parrots of New Guinea, which are smaller than house sparrows, to the bulky, flightless kakapos of New Zealand, which can weigh up to nine pounds.Most parrots live in the tropics or subtropics, where a mix of habitat loss and the depredations of the international pet trade now threaten a third of all species with extinction, Dr. Masello said.At the same time, some parrot species are proving flexible to the point of invasiveness.\u201cMonk parakeets from South America are doing nicely in New York City,\u201d said Leo Joseph, a parrot expert and director of the Australian National Wildlife Collection in Canberra. \u201cPeach-faced lovebirds from Africa are well-established in Arizona.\u201dResidents of Los Angeles County may spot enclaves of more than a dozen different feral parrots, including lilac-crowned Amazons, rose-ringed parakeets, macaws and cockatiels. Why some parrots thrive in anthropocentric landscapes while others are on the cusp of oblivion has yet to be determined.The parrot\u2019s muscular jaw and huge bill \u2014 specially hinged to allow top and bottom to move independently, up and down and from side to side \u2014 can crack open even the toughest and woodiest shells. The curved points of the bill act rather like lobster picks, ideal for scooping out seed meat.Parrots can similarly clip apart leg bands, satellite holsters and other animal-tracking devices, which is one reason most researchers have avoided them.Another demand of granivory, or seed predation, is the power to withstand the many defensive chemicals that plants pack into their genetic hope chests. Researchers have lately gathered evidence that a drive to detoxify could explain why parrots often converge on clay flats and start nibbling at the ground.Paradoxically, scientists said, the pursuit of toxic prey may be linked to the parrot\u2019s exceptional longevity. The difficult diet probably selected for a tough constitution, with top-flight immune and DNA repair systems, and tough things tend to last.In addition, the ingested toxins may well have an antimicrobial, anti-parasitic effect, helping parrots to fend off disease.However they manage, parrots can live a half century or longer: the record-holder among Moluccan cockatoos, for example, is 92, and a very lucky kakapo might make it to 120.Yet seed hunting\u2019s greatest evolutionary effect on parrothood may well have been psychosocial, transforming the birds into brainy schmoozers.Fruiting trees are a patchy and unpredictable resource, and parrots often fly many miles a day in quest of food. Under such circumstances, searching in groups turns out to be more efficient than solitary hunting, especially when group members can trade tips on promising leads.\u201cThat can mean the development of a social system, as well as the neurological capacity to share information,\u201d Dr. Joseph said. The vocal capacity, too: parrots call to one another continually, squawkishly, over long distances and short.\u201cThey are communicating to each other all the time,\u201d Dr. Masello said. \u201cEvery day, after working in the colony and climbing up the cliffs, I\u2019m much more tired from the noise than from the climbing.\u201dThe calls may be as much about asserting group identity as exchanging hunting tips. Seeking to understand why the yellow-naped Amazons in northern Costa Rica had a different call from those living 18 miles to the south, Dr. Wright\u2019s team tried moving several parrots from one site to the other.The youngest parrot quickly mastered the dialect of its new home and began flocking with the locals. The older transplants, however, failed to become adept bilingualists and never quite fit in. Instead, they associated with each other.\u201cThey formed a little immigrant enclave,\u201d Dr. Wright said, adding, \u201cVocal similarity is very important for maintaining social relationships,\u201d in parrots as in humans.Dr. Wright said that captive parrots\u2019 renowned talent for promiscuous vocal mimicry \u2014 of human speech, a multipart car alarm, a cat\u2019s meow \u2014 is probably a byproduct of an innate desire to parrot its own kind.\u201cIt\u2019s extremely rare to find mimicry of other species in wild parrots,\u201d he said. He also suggested that the ability of some parrots in captivity to move to a musical beat may be an offshoot of vocal mimicry, a generalized motor pattern geared toward synchrony playing out in body or voice.Researchers are still getting a bead on parrot intelligence, and they are repeatedly surprised by each new display of it.And in an act of ingenuity that Dr. Auersperg called \u201csensational\u201d for an animal not known to use tools in the wild, a cockatoo named Figaro one day started carefully chipping at the edge of a larch wood frame until he had formed a long, slender pole, which he then wielded in his bill like a hockey stick to knock out pebbles and nuts hidden under boxes.\u201cIt took him 20 minutes to make his first tool,\u201d Dr. Auersperg said. \u201cAfter that, he could do it in less than five minutes.\u201dFigaro didn\u2019t stop there. Soon he was using sticks to draw patterns in the sand, Dr. Auersperg said.Yes, a cockatoo can doodle, too.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "In \u2018Half Earth,\u2019 E.O. Wilson Calls for a Grand Retreat", "Date": "2016-02-29", "News": "Supported byA Conversation WithThis week, the biologist Edward O. Wilson, professor emeritus at Harvard University and recipient of two Pulitzer Prizes, will publish his 32nd book, a personal exhortation to conserve biodiversity titled \u201cHalf Earth: Our Planet\u2019s Fight for Life.\u201dThe book offers an improbable prescription for the environment: Dr. Wilson suggests that humans set aside roughly 50 percent of the planet as a sort of permanent preserve, undisturbed by man.We spoke for three hours in the cafeteria of the assisted-living facility in Lexington, Mass., where Dr. Wilson and his wife, Irene, have lived the past 14 years. Our conversation has been edited and condensed for space and clarity.Q. Why publish this book now?Reading your book, one senses you felt a great urgency to write it?The urgency was twofold. First, it\u2019s only been within the last decade that a full picture of the crisis in biodiversity has emerged. The second factor was my age. I\u2019m 86. I had a mild stroke a couple of years ago. I thought, \u201cSay this now or never.\u201dAnd what I say is that to save biodiversity, we need to set aside about half the earth\u2019s surface as a natural reserve. I\u2019m not suggesting we have one hemisphere for humans and the other for the rest of life. I\u2019m talking about allocating up to one half of the surface of the land and the sea as a preserve for remaining flora and fauna.In a rapidly developing world, where would such a reserve be?Large parts of nature are still intact \u2014 the Amazon region, the Congo Basin, New Guinea. There are also patches of the industrialized world where nature could be restored and strung together to create corridors for wildlife. In the oceans, we need to stop fishing in the open sea and let life there recover. If we halted those fisheries, marine life would increase rapidly. The oceans are part of that 50 percent.Now, this proposal does not mean moving anybody out. It means creating something equivalent to the U.N.\u2019s World Heritage sites that could be regarded as the priceless assets of humanity. That\u2019s why I\u2019ve made so bold a step as to offer this maxim: Do no further harm to the rest of life. If we can agree on that, everything else will follow. It\u2019s actually going to be a lot easier than people think.Why?Because many problems of human occupancy that we once thought of as insoluble are taking care of themselves. Demographers tell us that the human population could stabilize at about 10 or 11 billion by the end of the century.High tech is producing new products and ways of living that are congenial to setting side more space for the rest of life. Instrumentation is getting smaller, using less material and energy.Moreover, the international discourse is changing. I\u2019m very encouraged by the Paris Climate Accords. I was excited to see at the time of the Paris meeting that a consortium of influential business leaders concluded that the world should go for net zero carbon emissions. Towards that end, they recommended we protect the forests we have and restore the damaged ones. That\u2019s consistent with the \u201cHalf Earth\u201d idea.Do you worry that you are risking the reputation of a lifetime with such a controversial proposal?Controversy doesn\u2019t bother me. In 1975, when I published about sociobiology, I was attacked in many ways. There were mobs in Harvard Square when I was to give a lecture. I had to be escorted to the back of the hall by police! I had classes interrupted. At Harvard! And then the idea won out. Today, there\u2019s widespread agreement: Yes, there is a human instinct and a lot of human behavior is genetic. So, I don\u2019t think I\u2019m risking my reputation with \u201cHalf Earth.\u201d All I\u2019m doing is reporting good science and the experiences of researchers who\u2019ve described a biodiversity crisis.Do you see yourself as a naturally optimistic person?Yes, I think I am optimistic. I had a rough childhood: family breakup in the depths of the Depression. I don\u2019t know why I\u2019m an optimist. No, that\u2019s not true \u2014 I do know. Contrary to my childhood, I married a very wonderful person. That solved a lot. But you know, I had a lot of good breaks as a young person. At 29, I was a tenured professor at Harvard.What would you say have been the happiest moments in your life?That\u2019s easy. Exploring natural environments, especially in the tropical forests around the world, places like Vanuatu, New Caledonia, the Caribbean. I did a lot of exploring when I was in my 20s. Even then, you could see the ravages visited upon the natural world, and I was conscious of extinctions. At that time, I didn\u2019t see it as serious enough globally to require immediate action. Maybe I saw the flora and fauna of the world as immortal.Do you think connecting to your own mortality sensitized you to the fragility of nature?I would think a vivid sense of one\u2019s personal mortality is part of the wisdom of old age, which is not overrated. You know so much more. In my case, the older I got, the more audacious I got. Now, I\u2019m ready to speak out and gamble a bit.The \u201cConversation With\u201d column on March 1, an interview with the biologist Edward O. Wilson, who is publishing his 32nd book, \u201cHalf Earth: Our Planet\u2019s Fight for Life,\u201d misstated the extent to which marine life has decreased as a result of fishing. The population of harvested fish is estimated to have declined to between two-thirds and one-half of what it once was; it is not the case that the \u201copen sea is fished down to 2 percent of what it once was.\u201d (That figure referred to one cod population in Canada, as reported in 2004.)Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Jeff Bezos Lifts Veil on His Rocket Company, Blue Origin", "Date": "2016-03-08", "News": "Supported byKENT, Wash. \u2014 The headquarters of Blue Origin, the secretive rocket company in an industrial park here, is anonymous, with not even a sign at the road to announce the occupants.On Tuesday, for the first time, Blue Origin, started by Jeff Bezos, the billionaire founder of Amazon, opened its doors to reporters.\u201cWelcome to Blue,\u201d Mr. Bezos said. \u201cThank you for coming.\u201dBlue Origin is part of a shift of the space business from NASA and aerospace behemoths like Lockheed Martin toward private industry, especially smaller entrepreneurial companies. Space Exploration Technologies, or SpaceX, founded by another Internet entrepreneur, Elon Musk, has been the most visible and most successful of the new generation of rocket companies. Last Friday, it launched another satellite to orbit, but an attempt to land the booster on a floating platform again ended in an explosion.Much more quietly, Blue Origin has also had big space dreams, but until now did not give outsiders a look at what it was doing.For almost four hours, Mr. Bezos, who only occasionally talks to the press, led 11 reporters on a tour of the factory and answered a litany of questions over lunch. He talked garrulously, his speech punctured by loud laughs. \u201cIt\u2019s my total pleasure. I hope you can sense that I like this,\u201d he said.He described an image on a wall in the company\u2019s central area, which showed two tortoises holding an hourglass and gazing upward at a stylized image of the planets and cosmos. Below is Blue Origin\u2019s motto: \u201cGradatim ferociter,\u201d Latin for \u201cstep by step, ferociously\u201d \u2014 no cutting of corners, but no dillydallying, either. \u201cYou can do the steps quickly, but you can\u2019t skip any steps,\u201d Mr. Bezos said.He also offered updates on progress for his space tourism plans. The reusable New Shepard spacecraft that launched to the outskirts of space in November and then made a return trip in January will launch again soon. Depending on how well the testing goes, paying tourists, six at a time, might start making the short trips, experiencing a few minutes of weightlessness in space as soon as 2018, he said.At times, he told himself to stop talking, and let his engineers make their presentations about a new engine, the BE-4, which is under development with tests of a full version beginning by the end of the year.Mr. Bezos started Blue Origin in 2000, although few people knew about it then. For the next few years, about half a dozen people explored whether there might be a better way to get to space than rockets powered by loud, inefficient chemical combustion. The conclusion: there is not.Mr. Bezos said he had studied and thought about rockets since he was 5 years old. \u201cI never expected to have the resources to start a space company,\u201d he said. \u201cI won a lottery ticket called Amazon.com.\u201dMr. Bezos declined to say how much money he had poured into his dream. \u201cLet\u2019s just say it\u2019s a lot,\u201d he said.Around 2005, Mr. Bezos said he began rocket development in earnest. Still, almost no one knew what he was doing. For years, what went on here was mysterious and unknown, like Willy Wonka\u2019s chocolate factory in Roald Dahl\u2019s children\u2019s book.Occasionally news would be tossed out to the outside world \u2014 an award by NASA, a blog post by Mr. Bezos, a video of a successful launch. Last year, the company made a splashy public announcement at Cape Canaveral, Fla., when Blue Origin announced it would launch rockets into orbit from there.Like Mr. Musk, Mr. Bezos talks about Blue Origin less as a business than as part of a glorious future for humanity, with millions of people living and working off the planet. It is also a path, he asserted, that humanity must pursue if it is to continue to prosper.His argument was simple: Energy consumption has been rising at 2 or 3 percent a year. Even at that modest rate, within a few centuries, the energy usage would be equal to the energy produced by high-efficiency solar cells covering the entire surface of the planet. \u201cWe\u2019ll be using all of the solar energy that impacts the Earth,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s an actual limit.\u201dBut there is much energy and raw materials to use elsewhere in the solar system, and eventually, he prophesies, there will be the \u201cgreat inversion.\u201d Instead of factories on Earth manufacturing sophisticated components that go into tiny machines that go into space, the heavy manufacturing will all be done elsewhere, and Earth, he joked, would be zoned for residential and light industrial use, allowing much of Earth to return to a more natural state. \u201cIt\u2019ll be universities and houses and so on,\u201d he said.That is still far in the future. For now, Blue Origin\u2019s business plans fall in three categories. The first is space tourism, with short hops launching from West Texas on the New Shepard, a competitor to Virgin Galactic, Richard Branson\u2019s space start-up. Space tourism is not just a frivolity for the rich, but a necessary steppingstone to develop the expertise in a new technology, Mr. Bezos said, much like the early days of airplanes or how video games spurred the development of more powerful computer chips.Currently, most rocket companies launch, at most, about a dozen times a year. \u201cYou never get really great at something you do 10, 12 times a year,\u201d Mr. Bezos said. With a small fleet of reusable New Shepard rockets, Blue Origin could be launching dozens of times a year.The other business plans are for selling its rocket engines to other companies like United Launch Alliance, which is planning to use them for the Vulcan, a next-generation rocket to replace the Atlas 5 and Delta 4, and for its own larger rocket to lift payloads to orbit.Mr. Bezos said Blue Origin was quiet not necessarily to be secretive, but to avoid overpromising itself. \u201cSpace is really easy to overhype,\u201d he said.The tour would not be the last time the doors are open.Later this year, Blue Origin will give more details about its designs for the larger rocket that will launch from Cape Canaveral, and Mr. Bezos said there would be an opportunity to watch a test flight of New Shepard in Texas.\u201cWe will not be strangers,\u201d Mr. Bezos said at the end.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "If Jack Dorsey Has a Problem Child Among His 2 Companies, It Isn\u2019t Square", "Date": "2016-03-09", "News": "Supported byFor months, a prime question facing Jack Dorsey has been how he will juggle being the chief executive of two complicated companies he helped found \u2014 Square, the recently public mobile-payments company, and Twitter, the ailing social network in search of new users.It looks as if leading Square may be giving Mr. Dorsey a bit less difficulty than rejuvenating Twitter.\u201cAs long as the business is growing and the numbers are like what we saw today, his two jobs are not going to be a concern,\u201d Gil Luria, managing director at Wedbush Securities, said of Mr. Dorsey and Square. \u201cIt might be an issue for Twitter investors, but not for Square investors.\u201dMr. Dorsey has repeatedly said that he splits his time between his companies, meeting with executives from Square and Twitter every Monday. He said he maintained a strict schedule thereafter, with checkpoints on Wednesday and Friday to keep him on track throughout the week.\u201cI can split my time and be present at both companies every single day,\u201d Mr. Dorsey said in an interview on Wednesday, noting that Square and Twitter are across the street from each other. \u201cIt\u2019s not something I stress out about.\u201dIn 2016, seven I.P.O.s have been made from across all industries, the least since 2009, according to data compiled by Dealogic. The dearth is largely because of volatile markets that make pricing and selling new shares more difficult. In the meantime, investor attitudes have grown more conservative.\u201cIf you look over the past few years at a lot of recent tech I.P.O.s, there was an almost myopic focus on growth,\u201d said Josh Beck, a research analyst for Pacific Crest Securities. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen a correction and a different focus in the last year. Now everyone is really looking for a path to profitability.\u201dSquare executives said on Wednesday that they were also looking for it to become profitable and that they expect to reach that goal this year. While the company\u2019s net loss in the fourth quarter widened to $80.5 million from $37.1 million a year earlier, that was largely because of a one-time charge.And there were high points. Square processed $10.2 billion in global payments, up 47 percent from a year ago. Its software and services businesses \u2014 like Caviar, Payroll and Appointments, which are offered to small businesses with Square\u2019s core payments processing \u2014 are also growing at a healthy clip, generating $22 million in fourth-quarter revenue, more than triple from a year earlier.Square is also bullish on Square Capital, its cash-advance program for small businesses, which is another high growth area. Square said it made $150 million in cash advances in the fourth quarter through Square Capital; the company earns a fixed fee on each advance.Perhaps what investors appreciate most about Mr. Dorsey\u2019s leadership at Square are his choices in executive staff. He has brought in former Facebook, Amazon and Google executives. Wall Street particularly praises Square\u2019s chief financial officer, Sarah Friar, a former Goldman Sachs technology analyst.\u201cIt\u2019s very important given this arrangement to have someone like that that provides another important layer of leadership,\u201d Mark Palmer, a financial analyst at BTIG LLC, said of Ms. Friar. \u201cFrankly Square is wise to highlight her role.

{"Headline": "Donald Trump and the Fall of the Republican Campaign Guru", "Date": "2016-03-15", "News": "Supported byNotebookAs hapless as the news media and the Washington establishment have at times appeared as they flail about in the political tempest wrought by Donald Trump, there is another group in the 2016 election cycle that has come off looking at least as bewildered: the campaign gurus of Trump\u2019s Republican opponents.Since Watergate, each new president has been ushered in by his own personal Rasputin. Jimmy Carter had Hamilton Jordan, whose 80-page memorandum laid out the electoral pathway for the obscure Georgia governor. Ronald Reagan had Michael Deaver, whose acute understanding of campaign atmospherics would cause Reagan to be viewed as the father of the photo-op. George Bush had his alley-fighting operative, Lee Atwater; Bill Clinton had James Carville, the jut-jawed Cajun campaign veteran; George W. Bush had the ingenious and sharp-elbowed adviser, Karl Rove; Barack Obama had his digitally savvy campaign manager, David Plouffe. The Beltway has come to expect such savants and to confer on them a princely status.The same could be said for the 2016 roster of errant strategists. Todd Harris, who helped Rubio win election to the Senate in 2010 and is now one of his chief advisers, also ran Joni Ernst\u2019s successful Senate race in Iowa in 2014. Cruz\u2019s campaign manager, Jeff Roe, was previously the senior strategist for David Dewhurst, the establishment Republican candidate whom Cruz beat in the 2012 Senate race in Texas. Roe and Harris understand better than most what it takes to appeal to conservative voters. Understanding how Trump could so radically rewrite the campaign playbook is another matter.\u201cWhen you work for a serious person, you can\u2019t go out and say things that are just untrue,\u201d said Danny Diaz, Jeb Bush\u2019s campaign manager. \u201cYou can\u2019t go out and say things that completely contradict your body of work and record. And Trump feels completely uninhibited making arguments with no foundation in truth. And if you\u2019re a serious candidate, you offer policy proposals. He is operating under different rules, through sheer force of his persona and the celebrity culture he\u2019s taken advantage of. And look, from the perspective of marketing and branding, he deserves a lot of credit.\u201dThe single biggest strategic failure of the 2016 campaign so far has been the failure of Trump\u2019s opponents to attack him until the die was already cast. Partly this is because of the preoccupation that Bush, Rubio, Christie and John Kasich had with one another \u2014 the antiquated obsession with \u201cwinning the Establishment Lane\u201d \u2014 and the need to define what they themselves stood for. But the one candidate who did go after Trump, Bush, came off worse for the experience, which no doubt caused the other candidates to think twice before doing so. (That Bush\u2019s \u201csuper PAC,\u201d Right to Rise, spent more money on negative ads against Rubio than against Trump will remain one of 2016\u2019s crowning perplexities.)The hesitancy to attack Trump can also be explained by the fact that much of the resources for doing so remained on the sidelines until very recently. \u201cA lot of the so-called establishment donors didn\u2019t want to commit to anyone, out of fear of offending everyone else,\u201d DuHaime said. \u201cIf you\u2019re a friend of Chris Christie, you\u2019re probably also a friend of the Bushes. They all wanted to wait. And waiting ended up hurting all of us.\u201dBut several of Trump\u2019s opponents \u2014 most notably Cruz \u2014 clearly demurred from attacking the front-runner in hopes of eventually inheriting Trump\u2019s voters. \u201cThe calculus was, I\u2019m not going to engage Trump, because tactically it will disadvantage me down the road,\u201d said Steve Schmidt, who was a senior adviser to George W. Bush\u2019s 2004 campaign before becoming John McCain\u2019s senior campaign strategist in 2008. \u201cBut they misunderstood the nature of the Trump candidacy and the need to be as big as Trump, in an oppositional sense. None of them rose to the bigness of a moment that has seen a total collapse in institutions \u2014 an era of systemic fraud, combined with flat wage growth over a generation, and with no solutions offered. It\u2019s the job of a leader to contextualize all of that and to explain both the struggles today and the possibility of triumph tomorrow. How many speeches of great American leaders like F.D.R. or Eisenhower do you think these candidates read before they ran for president? I think not too many.\u201dThe hour for Trump\u2019s three remaining opponents to be revising their campaign narratives \u2014 so as to appear not simply new or anti-establishment or authentically conservative, but presidential \u2014 is growing late. Among them, Schmidt said, \u201cKasich is the candidate nearest to that space.\u201d Then again, until tonight \u2014 when the Ohio governor may win his home state \u2014 Kasich has never come close to beating Trump. His senior strategist, John Weaver, now says that Trump can be defeated through a contested convention. That arm-twisting delegates is the only option the anti-Trump forces are down to is proof that an entire Republican consulting class has already been defeated.Robert Draper is a contributing writer for the magazine.Advertisement"}

After some hesitation, many of the technology industry\u2019s biggest names, including Amazon, Facebook, Google, Microsoft, Snapchat and Yahoo, have filed court briefs supporting Apple and challenging the legal foundations of the government\u2019s case.The high commissioner, who usually avoids taking positions aligned with commercial interests, said he felt strongly that American officials needed to weigh the uncertain benefits of gaining access to one phone against the broader effects of breaching personal security.\u201cIn essence, what we have here is an issue of proportionality: In order to possibly \u2014 but by no means certainly \u2014 gain extra information about the dreadful crime committed by Syed Rizwan Farook and his wife in San Bernardino, we may end up enabling a multitude of other crimes all across the world, including in the United States,\u201d he said.The F.B.I. deserves full support in its investigation into the San Bernardino killings, Mr. al-Hussein said, but \u201cthis case is not about a company and its supporters \u2014 seeking to protect criminals and terrorists \u2014 it is about where a key red line necessary to safeguard all of us from criminals and repression should be set.\u201dThe encryption debate was \u201ctoo focused on one side of the security coin, in particular its potential use for criminal purposes in times of terrorism,\u201d Mr. al-Hussein said. \u201cThe other side of the security coin is that weakening encryption protections may bring even bigger dangers to national and international security.\u201dThe high commissioner\u2019s intervention builds on growing awareness and concern among human rights experts about the crucial role of encryption for safeguarding freedom of speech and of opinion.\u201cEncryption and anonymity, separately or together, create a zone of privacy to protect opinion and belief,\u201d David Kaye, a United Nations expert on freedom of expression, said in a report to the United Nations Human Rights Council last year, addressing ways to shield individuals from scrutiny in hostile political, social, religious and legal environments.Advertisement"}

Publishers frustrated with Amazon\u2019s low prices welcomed the new retailer, its iPad device and its willingness to let them set their own prices, with Apple taking a cut of each sale.In urging the Supreme Court to hear the case, Apple Inc. v. United States, No. 15-565, the company said its actions had promoted competition.\u201cIf a new firm\u2019s entry disrupts a monopoly and creates long-term competition, that is to be lauded, whether the previous prices were artificially high or artificially low,\u201d the brief said.The Supreme Court\u2019s refusal to hear the case is a victory for Amazon, which maintains a dominant position in e-book sales. The online retailer helped precipitate the case by complaining to the Justice Department about the actions of Apple and the publishers.Amazon issued a brief statement on Monday, saying, \u201cWe are ready to distribute the court-mandated settlement funds to Kindle customers as soon as we\u2019re instructed to move forward.\u201dHe said that he and his wife each received a couple of hundred dollars from the settlements paid earlier by book publishers in the case, and Apple\u2019s payment to e-book buyers, expected later this year, will be roughly double that amount.Apple declined to comment beyond the briefs it had filed in the case.The case began in 2012, when the Justice Department accused Apple and five publishers of conspiring to raise e-book prices above Amazon\u2019s standard of $9.99 for new titles. With encouragement from Apple, the publishers introduced an agency model of pricing, in which they set the sale price of e-books rather than allowing the seller to charge what it wished.The five publishers settled the antitrust case, but Apple went to trial.Judge Cote relied in part on the words of Steven P. Jobs, the company\u2019s co-founder, who died in 2011.\u201cI can live with this, as long as they move Amazon to the agent model too for new releases,\u201d Mr. Jobs, who was then Apple\u2019s chief executive, wrote to Eddy Cue, Apple\u2019s senior vice president for Internet software and services. \u201cIf they don\u2019t, I\u2019m not sure we can be competitive.\u201dJudge Cote said that the company had no good explanation for that and other communications. \u201cApple has struggled mightily to reinterpret Jobs\u2019s statements in a way that will eliminate their bite,\u201d she wrote. \u201cIts efforts have proven fruitless.\u201dMike Shatzkin, chief executive of The Idea Logical Company, a consultancy to book publishers, predicted the resolution of the case would have little impact on the book publishing industry. While the move to agency pricing first helped smaller players like Barnes & Noble and its Nook e-readers, subsequent changes in book pricing contracts have once again bolstered Amazon.\u201cThere are still real hard times ahead for the publishers because Amazon\u2019s market share is so large that they are bound to take more and more margin from publishers,\u201d he said.Adam Liptak reported from Washington and Vindu Goel from San Francisco.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Facebook, in Accounting Change, Could Pay Millions More in British Taxes", "Date": "2016-03-04", "News": "Supported byFacebook moved to change its relationship status with the British tax authorities on Friday.The company announced that it would soon alter how it paid tax in Britain, potentially leading to the company paying millions of dollars more on its operations in the country.The move comes in the face of growing anger across Europe about American technology giants\u2019 aggressive accounting practices.As part of Facebook\u2019s new tax structure, the company said it would report sales linked to its British operations, primarily from digital advertising, through its local subsidiary, instead of booking its British revenues through its Irish unit. Facebook\u2019s international headquarters are in Dublin.The change means the company will pay taxes in Britain on its local sales, as opposed to the current structure, in which Facebook primarily pays taxes through its Irish operation. The new structure will take effect in early April, according to the company.\u201cU.K. sales made directly by our U.K. team will be booked in the U.K., not Ireland,\u201d Lena Pietsch, a Facebook spokeswoman, said in a statement on Friday. \u201cFacebook U.K. will then record the revenue from these sales.\u201dWhile Facebook did not disclose how much more British tax it would pay, it is likely the company will pay significantly more than it currently does on its operations in Britain.In 2014, the latest year for which records are available, Facebook paid a mere $6,100 in British corporation tax, or slightly less than the average British worker paid in income tax.From 2008 to 2014, it paid a combined $1.2 million in taxes to the British government, while recording a $76.5 million loss over the same period, according to DueDil, a data research company.That compares with $16.2 million in taxes that Facebook paid to Ireland\u2019s tax authorities from 2008 to 2014, according to company filings analyzed by DueDil. Facebook had $3.6 million in pretax profit on its Irish operations over the period.The biggest American tech companies face intensifying scrutiny by European regulators, with \u2014 pressure that could potentially curb their sizable profits in the region and affect how they operate around the world.Facebook\u2019s efforts to revamp its accounting structure in Britain follow changes in the country\u2019s tax laws aimed at forcing companies to pay more tax on revenue generated there.The so-called Google tax \u2014 officially called the diverted profits tax \u2014 charges companies a 25 percent tax rate on profits on British revenue that the country\u2019s tax authorities consider to be artificially moved overseas to avoid the British system.For many American tech companies, many of which use complicated tax structures through the likes of Ireland and Luxembourg to reduce their global tax burdens, Europe\u2019s more aggressive stance is starting to bite.Along with its continuing negotiations with French and Italian tax authorities over potential back taxes, Google also recently agreed to pay an extra $183 million in taxes to the British government to cover the 10-year period through 2015.Advertisement"}

We are also hearing a lot of awkward conversations. What are we supposed to ... call everyone? A recent scene on HBO\u2019s \u201cGirls\u201d riffed on this problem, drawing a linguistic fault line down a Brooklyn street. On one side is a no-frills coffee joint run by Ray Ploshansky, the show\u2019s resident grumpy old man. (He\u2019s, like, 38.) Across the street, a hip new cafe springs up and instantly hoovers up Ray\u2019s clientele.When Ray crosses the road to eyeball the competition, he encounters a barista he can\u2019t quite size up. First he calls the barista \u201csir,\u201d and the barista balks, \u201cWhy\u2019d you feel the need to call me \u2018sir\u2019?\u201d So Ray tries \u201cfemale?\u201d and the barista says: \u201cOh, \u2018female\u2019? You a biologist? You a biological essentialist? Are you a detective?\u201d So Ray asks, \u201cWhat\u2019s going on here?\u201d and a second barista steps in to explain: \u201cWhat\u2019s going on here is that you offended they, and you offended me, so I think it\u2019s best that you leave.\u201d He does. The baristas embrace.The cafe clash took the language debate of the moment and personified its most extreme positions. On one side are people like Ray, who come off as clueless and offensive for failing to recalibrate their language to accommodate people who don\u2019t identify as \u201che\u201d or \u201cshe.\u201d On the other side are \u201ctheys\u201d like the barista, who can sound unreasonable and absurd when they try to police new rules of language that are still in flux. But in the subtext of the scene, a third figure emerged. The barista character was played by the younger sibling of Lena Dunham, the creator of \u201cGirls\u201d: Grace Dunham, a young queer writer and performer who identifies as a \u201ctrans person with a vagina\u201d and recently wrote on Twitter, \u201cI hate, fear and am allergic to binaries\u201d \u2014 and is also game for joking about how hard it can be to get everybody on the same page.This registers as a modern problem, but gender-neutral pronouns have been proposed for centuries. In 1808, Samuel Taylor Coleridge suggested repurposing \u201cit\u201d and \u201cwhich\u201d \u201cin order to avoid particularizing man or woman, or in order to express either sex indifferently.\u201d But only recently has mainstream pop culture entertained the idea of a neutral pronoun for referring to trans, genderqueer and even some feminist folks who either don\u2019t identify as \u201che\u201d or \u201cshe\u201d or are interested in demolishing that binary in speech. A flurry of totally new constructions has emerged to bridge the gap. On Tumblr, it\u2019s now typical for young people to pin their preferred pronouns to their pages: The writer behind a blog called \u201cThe Gayest Seabass\u201d identifies as \u201cDanny, xe/xim/xir or he/him/his or they/them/their, taken-ish, 20.\u201dThe media guide for \u201ctransgender issues\u201d by Glaad, a lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender advocacy group, advises reporters to use whatever pronoun their subjects prefer. If they don\u2019t prefer \u201cthey,\u201d using it anyway feels like an erasure of their own identity in favor of society\u2019s new standardized label. In a very real way, accepting the fluidity of gender requires rejecting standards in general. It means opening our \u201cclosed class\u201d of pronouns. In \u201cThe Argonauts,\u201d Maggie Nelson\u2019s memoir of gender and language, she acknowl\u00adedges \u201cthe Aristotelian, perhaps evolutionary need to put everything into categories,\u201d but embraces another need \u201cto pay homage to the transitive, the flight, the great soup of being in which we actually live.\u201d It\u2019s hard to sum it all up in a word.Amanda Hess is a David Carr Fellow at The New York Times.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "It\u2019s Discounted, but Is It a Deal? How List Prices Lost Their Meaning", "Date": "2016-03-06", "News": "Supported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 As traditional retailing falters, shutting stores and shedding workers, online merchants are reaping the rewards. People like the convenience of e-commerce, and they love the feeling that they are getting a deal.The perception of a bargain is fostered by online retailers\u2019 use of something variously labeled list price, suggested price, reference price or manufacturer\u2019s suggested retail price. Whatever its name, the implication is that people are paying much more somewhere else.But with many products online, you could not pay the list price even if you wanted to. That is because hardly anyone is actually charging it. It is a sales tactic that is drawing legal scrutiny, as well as prompting questions about the integrity of e-commerce. If everyone is getting a deal, is anyone really getting a deal?Here is one recent example of how retailers use list prices to motivate online buyers: Le Creuset\u2019s iron-handle skillet, 11 \u00be inches wide and cherry in color.The use of list prices online is at the heart of a case in a California Court of Appeal. Overstock.com, a popular online merchant, was found liable in a lower court for using misleading reference prices to exaggerate potential customer savings. It was fined $6.8 million, twice the size of the next-largest penalty for false advertising in California.In its appeal, Overstock said it followed \u201cstandard industry practices\u201d to come up with its reference prices. Internet retailers including Wayfair, Walmart, Rakuten (formerly Buy.com), Crate & Barrel and Williams-Sonoma employ list prices to varying degrees. Amazon, the biggest e-commerce player, uses them extensively and prominently.If some Internet retailers have an expansive definition of list price, the Federal Trade Commission does not.\u201cIf you\u2019re selling $15 pens for $7.50, but just about everybody else is also selling the pens for $7.50, then saying the list price is $15 is a lie,\u201d said David C. Vladeck, the former director of the F.T.C.\u2019s Bureau of Consumer Protection. \u201cAnd if you\u2019re doing this frequently, it\u2019s a serious problem.\u201d\u201cThe list price has become a meaningless piece of information,\u201d said Mr. Compeau, who was an expert witness for the California district attorneys who brought the case against Overstock.Meaningless, but useful. Even as the importance of a fixed list price has waned in the physical world, it has become more deeply embedded online.Retailers, as Amazon indicated, often are supplied with list prices by the manufacturer or the brand. \u201cThe manufacturer uses list price in an aspirational way \u2014 it\u2019s what they wish they could charge,\u201d said Victor Rosenman, the chief executive of Feedvisor, a start-up that helps e-commerce companies price competitively.\u201cThen the retailer says to his customer, \u2018The manufacturer recommended X, but I\u2019m selling it at Y. It\u2019s a better deal,\u2019 \u201d Mr. Rosenman said. \u201cAs to how that price compares to anyone else, it\u2019s your job as a consumer to figure out.\u201dThe Overstock case went to trial in late 2013. In one example cited by the district attorneys, a man bought a patio set from the retailer. It cost him $450, a discount of 55 percent from the list price of $999. The buyer was somewhat alarmed to find a Walmart price tag on his purchase for $247, a price he confirmed was the going retail price.Overstock said that was a simple error, but among the evidence presented during the trial were internal documents indicating that deals were not as good as they seemed. \u201cOh I think it\u2019s been established that the \u2018List Price\u2019 is egregiously overstated,\u201d one Overstock memo said. \u201cThis place has some balls.\u201dIn another email, Overstock asked a supplier to increase its list price, presumably so the Overstock price would appear even cheaper by contrast. An internal Overstock survey revealed during the trial found that its reference prices were on average 15 percent higher than the highest price that could be found online.Overstock maintained to the appeals court that \u201cinjury to consumers was minimal\u201d and said the $6.8 million in penalties was \u201cgrossly disproportionate.\u201d A spokesman declined to comment.In an earlier era, list prices were intended to prevent retailers from gouging customers \u2014 if $40 was printed on the box, a customer might flee if charged $60. Manufacturers also wanted to signal quality by discouraging deep discounting. They hoped retailers would stick to the printed price.But online, list prices are even more important.After the Overstock suit, online pricing policies are coming under greater scrutiny.Last month, a proposed class-action suit was filed against Wayfair in California asserting that the retailer falsely advertised discounts for items that it had never sold at a higher price. \u201cThe referenced former retail prices were fabricated,\u201d the plaintiffs claimed. Wayfair declined to comment.Mary Rodgers, a spokeswoman for Cuisinart, said the $75 list price was \u201cthe highest price you could actually see the product being sold for.\u201d She said as far as she knew, no one was selling the processor for that price.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Europe\u2019s Border Checks Become Economic Choke Points", "Date": "2016-03-01", "News": "Supported byFREILASSING, Germany \u2014 Traffic along one of Europe\u2019s busiest highways, which used to flow unimpeded, now often backs up for miles at a newly installed checkpoint, where a phalanx of German police officers screens trucks and cars for hidden migrants.At this border crossing, as a result, Austrians who work in Germany have trouble getting to their jobs. Many companies in Germany must wait days longer for deliveries of food, machine parts and other goods. Shoppers who made quick weekend jaunts to Freilassing\u2019s stores now mostly stay away.\u201cIt\u2019s really bad,\u201d said Karl Pichler, the owner of a large gardening center here in Freilassing, whose sales of tulips, rose bushes and other plants has slumped as longtime customers from Austria have stopped coming.But as the bloc now grapples with the biggest migration crisis since World War II, the revival of checkpoints on some of the region\u2019s most important transport routes is crimping commerce and threatening to cost billions of euros in lost business just as Europe is recovering from a six-year economic slump.With no end to the migrant crisis in sight, some national governments are pushing to expand the number of checkpoints around Europe and extend their use for up to two years. The shift is not only straining political and social cohesion, but also threatening the region\u2019s postwar principle of peace through prosperity.While some calls for suspending Schengen might be political posturing, critics worry that border controls will become a fact of life.\u201cOne after another, we close the borders, and once they are all closed, we will see that the economic cost is huge,\u201d Jean-Claude Juncker, the president of the European Commission, warned the European Parliament in January.Of the 28 countries in the European Union, 22 have passport-free arrangements, with Britain as one of the notable exceptions. But the lines are quickly being redrawn across Europe.Since autumn, Austria, Denmark, France, Norway and Sweden have joined Germany in imposing and extending temporary border checks. Belgium last week temporarily shut its border with France. Fences have gone up on various other borders including ones in Hungary, Serbia and Croatia, and along the Austrian-Slovenian frontier.European governments and research institutions have started tallying the potential damage.Open borders drive growth, economic efficiency and jobs, said Vincent Aussilloux, the director of France Strat\u00e9gie, the French government\u2019s economic planning agency. \u201cThat\u2019s what we\u2019d put in danger,\u201d Mr. Aussilloux said, \u201cif we abandoned Schengen indefinitely.\u201dFor Doruk Tumer, a truck driver for a Turkish delivery company, the trip to Germany has become a roadblock-riddled odyssey.Previously, his route from Turkey and Greece through the west Balkans \u2014 a path similar to the one used by nearly one million migrants last year \u2014 took about five days. Now, Mr. Tumer said, it can last up to 12 days, while the former two-hour drive through Austria sometimes takes more than a day.\u201cTime is money,\u201d he said, noting that costs have risen 30 percent because of longer delivery times, higher refrigeration charges for perishable goods and the occasional use of a second driver to overcome delays.It is not clear that the European Union is ready to shelve Schengen just yet. Officials are seeking ways to secure Europe\u2019s outer boundaries, so that countries within the bloc do not have to seal theirs.In particular, European officials are pressing Greece, which constitutes Europe\u2019s southern frontier, to sharply strengthen its refugee controls by mid-May. Should Greece fail to comply, border controls like the one at Freilassing could be imposed through 2018 or beyond.For big companies operating through Europe, the impact has been manageable thus far.Ikea, the Sweden-based furniture group, said border controls had, so far, not disrupted its European commerce because it has worked closely with transport companies to ensure deliveries.Amazon, which has 29 hubs in the European Union, is ready to make sure its operations continue \u201cregardless of external factors,\u201d said Roy Perticucci, vice president of the company\u2019s European business.But in many corners of Europe, border checks are already having a costly impact. At the Oresund bridge, an eight-mile span that carries truck, car and train traffic between Sweden and Denmark, more than 15,000 commuters now contend with two identification checks daily, because both countries are requiring frontier inspections.The delays are costing the Danish Rail Company, or DSB, \u20ac1.2 million a month in lost business as trains are canceled and commuters opt to drive, said Tony Bispeskov, a spokesman for DSB.This month, the Copenhagen offices of Ferring Pharmaceuticals started providing buses to take employees home to Sweden so they would not have to endure train delays. Weekend shoppers heading from Copenhagen to Malmo, Sweden, \u201chave been scared away,\u201d Mr. Bispeskov added.The Netherlands, home to some of Europe\u2019s biggest exporters and importers, is also feeling vulnerable. While the Dutch have not yet ordered border checks, companies warn that costs would surge if Germany blocked their common border or if roadblocks continued elsewhere.The Dutch company FleuraMetz, which delivers roses, tulips and orchids to shops elsewhere in Europe and in North America, has already faced backups of at least 12 hours at Calais, France, near the road entrance to the Eurotunnel that links the Continent to Britain.The company, based in Aalsmeer, sends trucks through the tunnel to reach Heathrow Airport near London for shipments to the United States. At one point, the bottlenecks were so bad that FleuraMetz decided to fly flowers to Heathrow to catch connecting flights, raising costs on deliveries to New York by around 25 percent.In Germany, at the border near Freilassing, the police said they were working to limit the damage.\u201cIt\u2019s not in our interest to cause huge delays,\u201d said Rainer Scharf, a police spokesman. At the single-line checkpoint, police waved through trucks that bore inspection stickers from Austria, but stopped vehicles containing \u201cpeople who look Arabic,\u201d Mr. Scharf said.Today, the temporary border facility looks permanent, with offices and computer terminals, and a soaring white tent sheltering dozens of police officers. So many officers have been sent here that every local hotel is fully booked.Other local merchants are not faring so well. \u201cMost business in town has dropped tremendously,\u201d said Mr. Pichler, the florist, who worries he may soon have to lay off employees.Still, Mr. Pichler said, given the influx of migrants to Germany, the border controls are necessary.\u201cIt\u2019s the right thing to do, even if we take a hit,\u201d he said. \u201cWe need to get this migrant situation under control.\u201dLiz Alderman reported from Freilassing, Germany, and James Kanter from Aalsmeer, the Netherlands.

{"Headline": "James Patterson Has a Big Plan for Small Books", "Date": "2016-03-21", "News": "Supported byBut Mr. Patterson is after an even bigger audience. He wants to sell books to people who have abandoned reading for television, video games, movies and social media.So how do you sell books to somebody who doesn\u2019t normally read?Mr. Patterson\u2019s plan: make them shorter, cheaper, more plot-driven and more widely available.In June, Mr. Patterson will test that idea with BookShots, a new line of short and propulsive novels that cost less than $5 and can be read in a single sitting. Mr. Patterson will write some of the books himself, write some with others, and hand pick the rest. He aims to release two to four books a month through Little, Brown, his publisher. All of the titles will be shorter than 150 pages, the length of a novella.\u201cYou can race through these \u2014 they\u2019re like reading movies,\u201d he said during a recent interview in New York. \u201cIt gives people some alternative ways to read.\u201dIt could also open up new avenues for selling books, something that publishers have struggled with as big bookstore chains have closed down stores. At first, BookShots will appear in the usual venues for commercial fiction \u2014 Barnes & Noble, Amazon, big-box stores and independent bookstores \u2014 and will be available in digital and audio versions.But eventually, Mr. Patterson and his publisher want to colonize retail chains that don\u2019t normally sell books, like drugstores, grocery stores and other outlets. They envision having BookShots next to magazines in grocery store checkout lanes, or dangling from clip strips like a bag of gummy bears.\u201cThose venues are very inhospitable to traditional publishing, but we think this is a type of book that could work very well there,\u201d said Michael Pietsch, the chief executive of Hachette Book Group, which publishes Mr. Patterson\u2019s books in the United States through its Little, Brown imprint. \u201cHe has enough recognition that his name can make it work.\u201dIn some ways, Mr. Patterson\u2019s effort is a throwback to the dime novels and pulp fiction magazines that were popular in the late 19th and early 20th century, when commercial fiction was widely available in drugstores.The category seems ripe for a modern-day revival. Many readers have already developed a taste for shorter digital works. BookShots is like an analog version of digital publishing programs like Amazon\u2019s Kindle Singles, Byliner, The Atavist or Nook Snaps, Barnes & Noble\u2019s experiment with shorter digital content. Publishers and writers have tried to engage fickle readers with bite-size digital fiction in various ways, from unbundling short stories and selling them for 99 cents apiece, to serializing novels as short, plot driven e-books.Still, no one has tried to apply the same bite-size commercial fiction model to print, at least not in a sustained way. It is tough to sell a single short story in print. And while some of the most beloved American literary classics are novella-length works \u2014 John Steinbeck\u2019s \u201cOf Mice and Men,\u201d F. Scott Fitzgerald\u2019s \u201cThe Great Gatsby\u201d and Truman Capote\u2019s \u201cBreakfast at Tiffany\u2019s\u201d \u2014 the format has largely fallen out of favor with publishers, who make much of their money from hardcover books, which have higher profit margins and tend to get better store placement.\u201cLittle tiny books don\u2019t stand out in the store,\u201d Mr. Pietsch said. \u201cThey\u2019re hard to see, and they\u2019re hard to get media attention for. They\u2019re economically difficult.\u201dHachette is betting that Mr. Patterson is famous enough to overcome those obstacles. The company is planning to publish 21 BookShots in 2016, including thrillers, science fiction, mysteries and romances. The first two, out in June, are \u201cCross Kill,\u201d a book by Mr. Patterson starring his popular recurring character Alex Cross, and \u201cZoo II,\u201d a science-fiction thriller written by Mr. Patterson and Max DiLallo. All the books will be written or partially written by Mr. Patterson, except the romances, which will be labeled \u201cJames Patterson Presents.\u201dLater this year, Mr. Patterson plans to expand BookShots to include nonfiction, with a focus on short, newsy books that play off current events. As an example, he mentioned a book pegged to the presidential election. He wouldn\u2019t elaborate on the content or reveal the author\u2019s name, but the working title makes the subject matter pretty obvious: \u201cTrump vs. Clinton.\u201dvideoAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Moneyball for Book Publishers: A Detailed Look at How We Read", "Date": "2016-03-14", "News": "Supported byAndrew Rhomberg wants to be the Billy Beane of the book world.Mr. Beane used analytics to transform baseball, famously recounted in \u201cMoneyball,\u201d a book by Michael Lewis. Now Mr. Rhomberg wants to use data about people\u2019s reading habits to radically reshape how publishers acquire, edit and market books.While e-books retailers like Amazon, Apple and Barnes & Noble can collect troves of data on their customers\u2019 reading behavior, publishers and writers are still in the dark about what actually happens when readers pick up a book. Do most people devour it in a single sitting, or do half of readers give up after Chapter 2? Are women over 50 more likely to finish the book than young men? Which passages do they highlight, and which do they skip?Mr. Rhomberg\u2019s company is offering publishers the tantalizing prospect of peering over readers\u2019 shoulders. Jellybooks tracks reading behavior the same way Netflix knows what shows you binge-watch and Spotify knows what songs you skip.Here is how it works: the company gives free e-books to a group of readers, often before publication. Rather than asking readers to write a review, it tells them to click on a link embedded in the e-book that will upload all the information that the device has recorded. The information shows Jellybooks when people read and for how long, how far they get in a book and how quickly they read, among other details. It resembles how Amazon and Apple, by looking at data stored in e-reading devices and apps, can see how often books are opened and how far into a book readers get.Jellybooks has run tests on nearly 200 books for seven publishers, one major American publisher, three British publishers and three German houses. Most of the publishers did not want to be identified, to avoid alarming their authors. The company typically gathers reading data from groups of 200 to 600 readers.Mr. Rhomberg recently gave a workshop at Digital Book World, a publishing conference in New York, and some of his findings confirmed the worst fears of publishers and authors.On average, fewer than half of the books tested were finished by a majority of readers. Most readers typically give up on a book in the early chapters. Women tend to quit after 50 to 100 pages, men after 30 to 50. Only 5 percent of the books Jellybooks tested were completed by more than 75 percent of readers. Sixty percent of books fell into a range where 25 percent to 50 percent of test readers finished them. Business books have surprisingly low completion rates.How Will Publishers Use the Data?For the most part, the publishers who are working with Jellybooks are not using the data to radically reshape books to make them more enticing, though they might do that eventually. But some are using the findings to shape their marketing plans. For example, one European publisher reduced its marketing budget for a book it had paid a lot of money to acquire after learning that 90 percent of readers gave up after only five chapters. A German publisher decided to increase advertising and marketing on a debut crime novel after data showed that nearly 70 percent of readers finished it.Publishers might also use the data to learn what type of reader a book appeals to, and market it accordingly. One of the novels that Jellybooks tested was written for teenagers but proved surprisingly popular with adults.Why This Is Scary for AuthorsAuthors are understandably nervous about how new insights into reading behavior might shape publishers\u2019 editorial decisions. Suppose you are writing a crime series, and readers gave up halfway through the latest installment. Publishers might not want to buy the next one. Or what if readers skip around in your nonfiction book, a common way to read nonfiction? An editor might want to cut the chapters people are skipping, potentially erasing useful context.And, of course, people who sign up for a free e-book service might not represent the kinds of readers who would seek and pay for a crime novel, or a nonfiction book on a subject that interests them. The sample sizes are relatively small. So the reader data might not represent the reactions of a general audience.Why This Might Be Troubling for ReadersJellybooks users consent to having their data tracked in exchange for free books, and must click on a link to send that data to Jellybooks. \u201cIt\u2019s absolutely critical to have the user in control, or we face a backlash,\u201d Mr. Rhomberg said at the conference.But as the book industry gets more sophisticated about how to measure reading behavior and the practice becomes more widespread, real privacy concerns could emerge. Some big academic publishers already track how students read their e-books, and some e-book subscription services have developed the capacity to measure reader engagement. Regular e-book readers might not realize that digital retailers are recording and storing the data. A few years ago, California instituted the \u201creader privacy act,\u201d which made it harder for law enforcement agencies to collect information on consumers\u2019 digital reading records from e-book retailers. But most other states have not taken such steps.But Having Companies Reading Over Your Shoulder Is Probably InevitableAnalytics are transforming every corner of the media world. Digital publishing cannot be far behind in measuring consumer behavior. As Mr. Rhomberg put it bluntly at Digital Book World, sales figures are not enough to gauge a book\u2019s success. \u201cAsk yourself,\u201d he said to the audience. \u201cAre you in the business of selling paper?\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "\u2018Death by Hanging\u2019 and \u2018I Want to Live!\u2019 on DVD", "Date": "2016-03-24", "News": "Supported byOn DVDThe Japanese director Nagisa Oshima (1932-2013) was not known for action films, but he was, as his colleague Shohei Imamura called him, a \u201csamurai\u201d \u2014 a militant modernist with a taste for razor-sharp social critiques.The unsuccessful execution deprives the prisoner of his memory, thus placing the authorities in an awkward position: Their prisoner has become inconveniently \u201cinnocent.\u201d The law mandates that he understand why he is to die, so the need to educate him provides \u201cDeath by Hanging\u201d the opportunity to interrogate the state\u2019s motives in prosecuting R\u2019s crime.The Japanese critic Tadao Sato compared Mr. Oshima\u2019s strategy to 1960s social unrest. The movie \u201cresembled the dialectical cross-examination by students of their professors on responsibility.\u201d To jog R\u2019s memory, various authority figures \u2014 a cynical doctor, an opportunistic prison warden, a hysterical Catholic priest, a crazy education officer and several clownish prison guards \u2014 prod him to re-enact his crime.The death chamber becomes a stage on which R is meant to perform before an impassive magistrate, flanked by imperial soldiers and the Japanese flag. Since R is Korean, the patriotic trappings are additionally significant: He is a former colonial subject and for Japanese extremists, a member of another race. But R no longer remembers that he is Korean, nor does he even understand what \u201cKorean\u201d means. In the movie\u2019s most sardonic sequence, the prison authorities dramatize R\u2019s childhood in an urban slum, yelling suggestions (\u201cAct more Korean \u2014 more over the top!\u201d) as he is taken to the scene of the crime.After the education officer gets so carried away that he commits R\u2019s crime for him, the film takes another leap into abstraction. The murdered schoolgirl turns into R\u2019s nonexistent sister, a militant leftist who, after she explains that his crime is a product of Japanese imperialism, herself becomes an accomplice and candidate for execution.Ultimately devolving into a sodden drinking party, \u201cDeath by Hanging\u201d is by no means perfect. The movie\u2019s first half has a conceptual lucidity that is later clouded over with ambivalence. Nevertheless, it is difficult to imagine a comparable American movie \u2014 Mr. Oshima\u2019s essay on race and crime would not only be provocative but also topical.Rather than didactic farce, the mode is high-powered melodrama \u2014 the samurai warrior here is Susan Hayward, who became one of Hollywood\u2019s top female stars by embodying sassy determination in the face of extreme hardship. Announcing itself as a \u201cfactual story,\u201d \u201cI Want to Live!\u201d \u2014 directed by Robert Wise \u2014 plunges into a wildly expressionistic vision of a San Francisco jazz club. Gerry Mulligan wails on sax, hipsters smoke reefer in the alley, and party girls dance solo mambos to a mad bongo beat. The scene shifts to a sleazy hotel room, where Barbara Graham (Ms. Hayward) pops suddenly into the frame, rising from the bed where she spent the night in the company of a man who is definitely not her husband.After a half-hour of raucous freedom and petty crime, Barbara is busted and seemingly framed for a murder committed by her lowlife pals. Packed off to prison, betrayed by a fellow inmate, tortured by the press and put on trial (with a showstopping turn on the stand), she is railroaded toward the gas chamber.The movie spends the better part of an hour on death row (where, her taste for jazz undiminished, Barbara listens to Mr. Mulligan in her cell). Nothing if not effective in its existential angst, \u201cI Want to Live!\u201d was endorsed in France by Albert Camus. Barbara is battered by a series of last-minute stays of execution but is valiantly glamorous to the end, going to the gas chamber in a cocktail dress and high heels. (\u201cAre my seams straight?\u201d she asks a sympathetic prison guard.)\u201cI Want to Live!\u201d ends where \u201cDeath by Hanging\u201d begins, with an analysis of the execution process. It also won Ms. Hayward an Academy Award, after four previous nominations. After the actress accepted her prize, she was, according to Mason Wiley and Damien Bona\u2019s book \u201cInside Oscar,\u201d called back out onstage to make a curtain call \u2014 a tribute, perhaps, to her character\u2019s will to live.NEWLY RELEASEDAdvertisement"}

It was a season of transition and self-examination, as designers posed questions about the point of the shows themselves, but certain trends stood out, both in style and substance, across the gender continuum. Vanessa Friedman, the women\u2019s fashion critic of The New York Times, and Guy Trebay, the men\u2019s wear critic, discuss the most notable of those trends and debate their significance.Conversely, the trend to mix sexes in current collections doesn\u2019t give me the jitters. It may be designers are trying to make sense of the breakdown in traditional binaries. Equally, it could also be that brands are pressuring them to build collections reflective of the gender-agnostic way a lot of young people already dress.Personally, I liked the opera cape-cum-puffer Demna Gvasalia, who is a member of the Vetements collective, did in his debut as creative director of Balenciaga best, as it was both elegant and had less pretensions to \u201cbasic.\u201d So here\u2019s my question for you: cape or puffer?If the trans moment has underscored anything it\u2019s that traditional understandings about the human body are not fixed: Anatomy is as much in flux as climate seems to be.

New digital technology and new customers with new attitudes in new places, along with new competition from deft and nimble upstarts eager to cater to them, have forced the dominant companies, Sotheby\u2019s and Christie\u2019s, to develop new ways to do business.They are responding to the challenge by throwing their money and names around, buying or forming looser affiliations with rivals that understand the shifting realities of the marketplace, including a collector base increasingly inclined to buy art online and on the go, better than they do because the arrivistes helped create those realities. \u201cBusinesses need to evolve, and although the auction process has been around close to forever, the technology changes things; the way the market works changes things, and so does the global nature of the market,\u201d said Suzanne Gyorgy, global head of art advisory and finance at Citi Private Bank, a subsidiary of Citigroup. As with many businesses, the Internet presents the greatest threat to the established order in the art market and the greatest opportunity, too. Online art sales in 2014 reached 3.3 billion euros, or about $3.6 billion, according to the latest edition of the European Fine Art Foundation annual report.

That was 48 percent of the market, but it marked just a 9.3 percent gain on the year before and was barely over the \u20ac24 billion recorded in 2007, the previous high-water mark. Tefaf and other organizations that monitor the market, such as Hiscox, an insurance company that specializes in art, among other niches, foresee growth of about 25 percent a year in online sales for the rest of the decade. To grab a piece of the action, the auction industry leaders have expanded vigorously online. Christie\u2019s, in 2011, set up an online-only auction platform that held 79 sales in 2015, said Jennifer Ferguson, a company spokeswoman. Last year Christie\u2019s bought Collectrium, a digital art collection management service. \u201cWe have made important hires to support a new marketing and content strategy in both print and digital across all our platforms, as well as strategic digital acquisitions,\u201d Ms. Ferguson said. \u201cNone of this happened in just the last 12 months, but has been happening over the last five years.\u201d Sotheby\u2019s raised its profile online last year when it began streaming its auctions live on eBay, the all-purpose auction website. \u201cWe want to create more channels and more ways for our collectors to be able to engage in and buy things that they love,\u201d said David Goodman, Sotheby\u2019s executive vice president for digital development and marketing.Perhaps more important, arrangements such as this give the company access to customers they might not have had otherwise. \u201cWe\u2019re able to see a different group of people from what we would normally have in the consignment auction process,\u201d Mr. Goodman said. \u201cIt\u2019s a way to expand our distribution and our brand and introduce new people to the world of collecting. We\u2019re excited about the momentum we\u2019re seeing in the online space.\u201d The marketplace is expanding in the real world, too, and auction firms are taking varied steps to cater to new buyers. Sotheby\u2019s recently bought Art Agency Partners, which provides collectors with advice on art, legal and investment matters. The acquisition is expected to help Sotheby\u2019s expand and enhance its private sales, an activity that the industry sees as a more lucrative way to sell art than the traditional auction business. Among the moves that Ms. Ferguson highlighted at Christie\u2019s is the opening of offices in Shanghai and in Mumbai, India, part of an effort that \u201chas helped nurture new growth across both the emerging collector and established collector sectors.\u201d The collectors that have emerged from places like China and India have become a critical segment of the global art market. They have been sources of tremendous growth for auction houses, but also sources of volatility and consternation. China accounted for 27.3 percent of global art transactions in 2014, according to a Citigroup report, compared with just 0.2 percent in 2000. But after years of surging growth, the Chinese art market, like its economy and stock market, has been slumping lately. Auction sales of Chinese contemporary art dropped 41 percent last year, according to a report by ArtTactic, a London firm that analyzes the art market. The report noted that sales in other Asian markets took up some of the slack, rising 14 percent in India, for instance, and 28 percent in Southeast Asia. In a survey of industry experts by ArtTactic, 19 percent more respondents said they expected the Chinese art market to shrink this year than to expand, worse than for any market except Russia. India was considered to have the best prospects, with a net 48 percent positive on the market. The American and European markets combined had a 16 percent net favorable assessment. The possibility that Chinese art sales may be leveling off leads Benjamin R. Mandel, global strategist for multi-asset solutions at J.P. Morgan Asset Management, to warn that the next 15 years for the global art market may not be as fruitful as the last 15. He is also concerned that the trend toward ever more extravagant prices for a handful of works amid so-so growth elsewhere is bound to reverse. \u201cChina\u2019s extraordinary period of catch-up growth has largely played out, while the inequality in auction prices may reach some natural limit,\u201d Mr. Mandel wrote in a recent report. \u201cAs a result, the slowing of these factors could subtract up to a third from the annual growth of the global market; that is, global growth would be on the order of 9 percent, rather than 13 percent.\u201d Whether or not the auction houses are taking such forecasts to heart, they are easing back on the splashy evening sales that they\u2019re best known for by combining different genres of art, such as Impressionism and Postwar Contemporary, and bunching sales together on the calendar. They present the moves as a means of catering to clients with eclectic tastes, but they also may reduce costs. The more traditional competition that auction houses face comes from brick-and-mortar galleries, and they are adapting and contributing to the evolution of the market, too. Alessia Zorloni, adjunct professor in art markets at Libera Universit\u00e0 di Lingue e Comunicazione IULM, in Milan, observed a trend among galleries to abandon the middle ground. \u201cThere are two choices for dealers today, either to run a lightweight, cost-effective operation that supports young artists or adopt the mega-gallery model,\u201d she said. \u201cThe high-end art market is controlled by a few dozen operators and characterized by a small number of large and powerful galleries, often organized as real commercial companies with a wide network of connections with other galleries, and in the most important cases, with branches in other cities.\u201d These galleries trade on the value of their brands and reputations, Ms. Zorloni said, just as the auction houses do. These are important aspects of any business but especially in one like art where the value of the main product is hard to calculate and based on subjective criteria. That\u2019s why the auction industry faces little threat at the top end from online entities, in her view. \u201cIf you think about this feature of the art market, there will never be competition with websites, even mainstream ones like Amazon and eBay,\u201d she said. \u201cThey are simply different market segments appealing to different customers. The power of auction house brands will remain strong. Not only do auction houses have access to first-class works, but obviously they also have access to the clientele that no one dealer can compete with.\u201d As time goes on, auction companies may embrace the distinctions between market segments even further: providing a premium service for high-end collectors centered on a few evening sales while using extensive online abilities to grant greater access to the market, with fewer frills, to a growing number of customers with thinner wallets. \u201cThe number of buyers in the art market has increased so dramatically in the last five years,\u201d said Ms. Gyorgy, of Citi Private Bank. \u201cDeveloping an online presence is really smart.\u201d As for the marquee sales, \u201cpeople really like the auction experience,\u201d she said, adding, \u201cIt\u2019s some of the best theater in town, but it\u2019s expensive theater to put on.\u201dAdvertisement"}

In a way, the movie is a grimly unwhimsical version of \u201cAlice\u2019s Adventures in Wonderland,\u201d with Ms. Schneider\u2019s character wending her way through a series of abortive rehearsals, shabby hotel rooms and glum soir\u00e9es (one including a 16-millimeter projection of Fritz Lang\u2019s \u201cMetropolis\u201d), trying to comprehend what the adults around her are up to.Promoted as an \u201cenigmatic thriller,\u201d \u201cParis Belongs to Us\u201d opened in New York a few weeks after the 1962 Cuban missile crisis. Although the movie suited the prevailing anxious mood, few reviewers were impressed. Writing in The Village Voice, Jonas Mekas \u2014 who doubtless saw a connection to underground films like his own \u201cGuns of the Trees\u201d \u2014 was a rare exception: \u201cIf one knows how, one can read from this film more about the mind and heart of Europe 1962 than from any other movie.\u201dSlow to cast its spell, \u201cOut 1\u201d begins as an endurance test. The first two episodes are devoted mainly to lengthy rehearsals. The narrative begins to emerge toward the end of the third episode, which introduces the idea of a secret society along with the subtly spacey Bulle Ogier\u2019s bookstore cum head shop, a bit of Haight-Ashbury in what looks like an ungentrified alley in the Marais. By the fifth episode, apparent chaos has coalesced in what a character played by Jean-Pierre L\u00e9aud calls a \u201cmagical, mystical world.\u201dShot on 16 millimeter and suffused with aesthetic pleasure \u2014 what the French term \u201cjouissance\u201d \u2014 \u201cOut 1\u201d is also an amalgam of fiction and documentary. It\u2019s a recording of both Paris and its suburbs (with a few side trips to a haunted house on a Normandy beach), and of actors engaged in theater games. The dramatic scenes, as well as the rehearsals, are almost entirely improvised: Mr. Rivette\u2019s actors developed their characters before shooting began.The genial Michel Lonsdale guides one theater group through endless preparation for an avant-garde production of Aeschylus\u2019s \u201cPrometheus Bound\u201d as the more tightly wound Mich\u00e8le Moretti rehearses a dance-oriented production of another Aeschylus drama, \u201cSeven Against Thebes.\u201d For most of the movie, the two groups exist in parallel worlds, while a pair of outsiders played by two of the New Wave\u2019s most intense performers, Juliet Berto and Mr. L\u00e9aud, separately undertake a series of enigmatic tasks, mixing it up with the passers-by and cafe patrons in Paris as well as a host of other characters.In lieu of a script, Mr. Rivette used a chronological grid to chart the spontaneous meetings among the cast members. \u201cIt became like a game, like a crossword,\u201d he explained to La Nouvelle Critique in 1973. Narrative grew out of these interactions, which Mr. Rivette edited, often with awkward mistakes left in. As with Andy Warhol\u2019s unscripted films, which also made use of long takes, every scene generates its own existential drama.I\u2019ve seen \u201cOut 1\u201d both as a marathon projection and at my own pace at Blu-ray. The movie is surprisingly well suited to home viewing: Mr. Rivette shot \u201cOut 1\u201d for French television, which diplomatically rejected it as too good for TV, and said that \u201cthe ideal form for viewing the film would be for it to be distributed like a book on records.\u201dThe Carlotta box, which includes a booklet of essays; Mr. Rivette\u2019s four-and-a-half-hour distillation, \u201cOut 1: Spectre\u201d; and a further shadow version of the movie in the form of a revelatory production documentary, makes that possible. Along with Criterion\u2019s Jacques Tati box and the complete set of \u201cThe Wire,\u201d it\u2019s something I would take to a desert island.NEWLY RELEASEDAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Race Is On to Control Artificial Intelligence, and Tech\u2019s Future", "Date": "2016-03-25", "News": "Supported byMany of the tech industry\u2019s biggest companies, like Amazon, Google, IBM and Microsoft, are jockeying to become the go-to company for A.I. In the industry\u2019s lingo, the companies are engaged in a \u201cplatform war.\u201dA platform, in technology, is essentially a piece of software that other companies build on and that consumers cannot do without. Become the platform and huge profits will follow. Microsoft dominated personal computers because its Windows software became the center of the consumer software world. Google has come to dominate the Internet through its ubiquitous search bar.If true believers in A.I. are correct that this long-promised technology is ready for the mainstream, the company that controls A.I. could steer the tech industry for years to come.\u201cWhoever wins this race will dominate the next stage of the information age,\u201d said Pedro Domingos, a machine learning specialist and the author of \u201cThe Master Algorithm,\u201d a 2015 book that contends that A.I. and big-data technology will remake the world.In this fight \u2014 no doubt in its early stages \u2014 the big tech companies are engaged in tit-for-tat publicity stunts, circling the same start-ups that could provide the technology pieces they are missing and, perhaps most important, trying to hire the same brains.At the University of Toronto, IBM pursued a start-up called Ross Intelligence that makes a smart legal assistant, and extended a free offer to use its A.I. software, called Watson. For IBM, the financial payoff would come if start-ups like Ross generated sales, followed by a revenue-sharing arrangement. \u201cNo upfront costs at all,\u201d said Andrew Arruda, chief executive of the start-up, which moved last year to Silicon Valley.Now, Google\u2019s A.I. program is drawing additional attention and pointing to a consolidation among tech\u2019s biggest companies.By 2020, the market for machine learning applications will reach $40 billion, IDC, a market research firm, estimates. And 60 percent of those applications, the firm predicts, will run on the platform software of four companies \u2014 Amazon, Google, IBM and Microsoft.IBM is making the broadest entry into A.I. Its Watson unit, set up as a separate division in early 2014, is both a software and a services business, with technology tailored to specific industries. More than 80,000 developers have downloaded and tried out the software, and the Watson division has 500 industry partners, including big companies and start-ups.\u201cIt\u2019s early days, but the long-term goal is to have hundreds of millions of people use Watson as self-service A.I.,\u201d said David Kenny, general manager of the Watson division.In 2015, Amazon and Microsoft both added machine learning capabilities to their cloud software platforms, Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Azure. The companies are using machine learning software to help customers spot patterns and make predictions in vast amounts of data.Microsoft offers 18 machine learning services, including face recognition, text analysis and product recommendations. More A.I. capabilities, analysts say, should be announced at the end of the month, when Microsoft hosts a large conference for software developers in San Francisco.This week at a conference in San Francisco, Google showed off a new speech-to-text transcription service. The company also said its recently introduced vision software for identifying images would be broadly available soon, and it introduced new tools and training aids to help developers build machine-learning applications more easily.Intelligent software applications will become commonplace, said Jeff Dean, a computer scientist who oversees Google\u2019s A.I. development. \u201cAnd machine learning will touch every industry.\u201dAt Facebook, the A.I. vision is, at least for now, limited to its products.Mike Schroepfer, the chief technology officer, noted that Facebook\u2019s image-recognition software was now used to select what pictures or videos to show in a user\u2019s news feed, based on a person\u2019s friend network and interests.\u201cBefore, the photo was a black box to us,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s the most likely form this takes \u2014 a lot of things that add up to make the service steadily better on Facebook.\u201dIf products come first, a platform strategy typically takes shape later for the big consumer web companies. There are millions of Facebook app developers worldwide. Today, only about 1 percent of all software apps have A.I. features, IDC estimates. By 2018, IDC predicts, at least 50 percent of developers will include A.I. features in what they create.\u201cIt\u2019s where the market is headed,\u201d said David Schubmehl, an IDC analyst.The company, which was founded by Mike Tung, a Stanford computer science graduate student, in 2008, recently raised $10 million to compete directly with Google. Even though Diffbot is still being run out of a home near the Stanford campus, Mr. Tung is thinking big.\u201cOur goal is to capture all human knowledge,\u201d he said. \u201cI would like for Diffbot to build an iconic company around data. There are companies focusing on computing, but there is no Amazon of data.\u201dJohn Markoff reported from San Francisco and Steve Lohr from New York.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Carrier Workers See Costs, Not Benefits, of Global Trade", "Date": "2016-03-19", "News": "Supported byINDIANAPOLIS \u2014 The fuzzy video, shot by a worker on the floor of a Carrier factory here in the American heartland last month, captured the raging national debate over trade and the future of the working class in 3 minutes 32 seconds.\u201cThis is strictly a business decision,\u201d a Carrier executive tells employees, describing how their 1,400 jobs making furnaces and heating equipment will be sent to Mexico. Workers there typically earn about $19 a day \u2014 less than what many on the assembly line here make in an hour. As boos and curses erupt from the crowd, the executive says, \u201cPlease quiet down.\u201dWhat came next was nothing of the kind.Within hours of being posted on Facebook, the video went viral. Three days after Carrier\u2019s Feb. 10 announcement, Donald J. Trump seized on the video in a Republican presidential debate and made Carrier\u2019s move to Mexico a centerpiece of his stump speeches attacking free trade.Jennifer Shanklin-Hawkins is one of those Carrier workers who listened to the announcement on the factory floor. After 14 years on the assembly line, she earns $21.22 an hour, enough to put her oldest son through college while raising two other children with her husband, a truck driver.And when she saw Mr. Trump talking about Carrier on the news, all she could do was shout \u201cYessss!\u201d at the TV. \u201cI loved it,\u201d she said. \u201cI was so happy Trump noticed us.\u201dIn living rooms and barrooms across Indianapolis, conversations with Carrier workers like Ms. Shanklin-Hawkins crystallize what has become an extraordinary moment in the American political and economic debate. As both political parties belatedly recognize the anxiety and deep-seated anger of blue-collar workers nationwide, the more-trade-is-good bipartisan consensus that has long held sway in Washington is being sundered.What isn\u2019t evident in the video \u2014 or in the furious debate it has spawned \u2014 is that both the company and its soon-to-be former employees are reacting to the same transformative quarter-century of American economic policy aimed at lowering trade barriers and staying globally competitive.\u201cWe have to look around the corner and see how this market will change in order to invest and stay in business for another 100 years,\u201d said Robert McDonough, a senior executive at Carrier\u2019s parent company, United Technologies. \u201cYou can blink and see your market position erode.\u201dThe rub is that the costs and benefits aren\u2019t distributed equally. Global trade has produced big gains for Americans, like more affordable goods \u2014 clothes, computers, even air-conditioners \u2014 and led to a more advanced economy.At the same time, a chronic trade deficit and an overvalued dollar have caused factory jobs to dry up, contributing to a deep divide between the political and economic elite and the rest of the nation. Perhaps a clash was inevitable.Consider the case of Ms. Shanklin-Hawkins. While she says she won\u2019t be voting for Mr. Trump and considers him a racist, she applauds his message on trade. She says she plans to vote for Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, who similarly blasts free trade, but from the left. The two populist candidates may be political opposites, but when it comes to the downside of globalization, Mr. Sanders and Mr. Trump are speaking to her with one voice.In fact, many Carrier workers here say that it was not so much Mr. Trump\u2019s nativist talk on illegal immigrants or his anti-Muslim statements that has fired them up. Instead, it was hearing a leading presidential candidate acknowledging just how much economic ground they\u2019ve lost \u2014 and promising to do something about it.Mr. Trump has repudiated decades of G.O.P. support for free trade, calling for heavy tariffs on Mexican-made goods from the likes of Carrier. This has helped put him within arm\u2019s reach of the Republican nomination.Opposition to trade deals has also galvanized supporters of Mr. Sanders, helping him unexpectedly win the Michigan Democratic primary this month. At the same time, it has forced his rival Hillary Clinton to distance herself from trade agreements she once supported, like the proposed 12-nation Trans-Pacific Partnership and the North American Free Trade Agreement, the 1994 deal with Mexico that is an important part of President Bill Clinton\u2019s political legacy.Exit polls after the Michigan primary , for example, showed that a clear majority of both Republican and Democratic voters believe international trade costs the American economy more jobs than it creates.Nicole Hargrove, a 14-year Carrier worker, said she was an undecided voter and was uncomfortable with Mr. Trump\u2019s attacks on immigrants, particularly Mexicans. \u201cBut I\u2019d like to turn him loose on the financial world,\u201d she said. \u201cMaybe if Carrier had to pay more to bring stuff in, they\u2019d think twice about moving jobs out.\u201dMark Weddle, 55, started work at Carrier 24 years ago and earns $21 an hour running a machine that makes heat exchangers. \u201cI have two brothers-in-law from Mexico,\u201d he said, explaining why he disagrees with Mr. Trump\u2019s anti-immigrant stance.But when it comes to Carrier, \u201cwe\u2019ve all worked our butts off,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd now they\u2019re going to throw us under the bus? If Trump will kick Carrier\u2019s ass, then I\u2019ll vote for him.\u201dThat\u2019s pretty much what Mr. Trump has threatened to do. At rally after rally, to rapturous crowds, he vows to impose a 35 percent tax on Carrier products from Mexico. Then, the laugh line: \u201cI want to do this myself, but it is so unpresidential to call up Carrier.\u201dAnd Mr. Trump vows not to take Carrier\u2019s calls until it agrees to change course. \u201cAs sure as you\u2019re here, they will call me up within 24 hours,\u201d he promises, and say to him, \u201c\u2018Sir, we\u2019ve decided to stay in the United States.\u2019\u201dIt is powerful talk.The relentless loss of American manufacturing jobs, however, goes back nearly half a century, driven largely by forces beyond the control of any president. The advances of technology, the diffusion of industrial expertise around the world, the availability of cheap labor and the rise of China as a manufacturing powerhouse would have disrupted the nation\u2019s industrial heartland even without new trade deals.Nor are tariffs likely to bring many of these jobs back, said David Autor, a professor of economics at M.I.T., who is one of the country\u2019s foremost specialists on the pluses and minuses of free trade. \u201cWe don\u2019t have silver bullets,\u201d he said.\u201cWhen I learned about the impact of trade agreements, the theory was that workers would be \u2018released\u2019 into the labor market and hired back at slightly lower salaries,\u201d Mr. Autor said. \u201cThat\u2019s not what happened. And no amount of cheaper air-conditioners will make these workers whole.\u201dOn a rainy Thursday afternoon this month, after their 6 a.m.-to-4:30 p.m. shift, a dozen Carrier workers gathered at Sully\u2019s Bar & Grill to talk about the decades they had spent at the low-slung, beige-and-white factory across the street.The group was diverse: black and white, male and female, old and young. And until the announcement of the eventual shutdown, most of them said they had loved working for Carrier, assembling furnaces and fan coils, hard as the work could be.The workers in the Indianapolis factory are represented by the United Steelworkers union. As has been the case in the auto industry, the union agreed in 2011 to a two-tier wage system in which new hires were paid less than veteran employees.\u201cI\u2019m more skilled with my hands than I am with my brain,\u201d said Robin Maynard, half joking. He holds two associate degrees, oversees a team of 15 and has worked at Carrier almost 24 years. \u201cBut I like working with my hands.\u201dMs. Shanklin-Hawkins emphasized that she, too, enjoyed her work, despite having little flexibility when it came to setting hours. \u201cI missed football games, graduations, you name it,\u201d she said.Her shifts can run 10 hours a day, six days in a row during summer and fall, when her line is busy, and mandatory overtime can total 20 hours a week. The pay, benefits and pension plan are all good, but it wasn\u2019t just the money that kept her on the assembly line, Ms. Shanklin-Hawkins said.\u201cIt\u2019s pretty cool working there,\u201d she said, describing how she carefully puts together \u201ctubular mixers,\u201d batches of rods that control the air flow in Carrier furnaces. \u201cAnd when you do it for 60 hours a week, people are like family.\u201dIt is painstaking work: Bend the rods, or force them into place, and the line can come to a halt, prompting a tongue-lashing from a supervisor. Despite that, like many of the 12 million American factory workers, Ms. Shanklin-Hawkins says the nation\u2019s leaders have simply lost respect for people who make things.\u201cThey didn\u2019t even thank us for our work,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was wrong.\u201dIndianapolis is far better off than many other cities in and around the Rust Belt. For the most part, it has successfully made the transition to an economy powered by services like health care, logistics and banking. The city\u2019s unemployment rate is 4.6 percent, below the national average of 4.9 percent.But many of the new jobs don\u2019t pay nearly as well as Carrier does. Next to the 49-year-old Carrier plant is an Amazon warehouse that opened in 2011, but with salaries there averaging just over $15 an hour, that\u2019s a lot less than the $20 or more an hour Carrier workers typically earn.Indiana politicians, who granted Carrier tax breaks and other incentives, are furious at the company and want their money back. They are also angry because Carrier\u2019s parent, United Technologies, is a major military contractor that receives $5.6 billion annually from the federal government.\u201cThat\u2019s financed by the taxpayers they just fired,\u201d said Senator Joe Donnelly, Democrat of Indiana. \u201cThey are trying to be the ultimate free rider.\u201dCarrier has said it will return public money in cases where the company has not kept its commitments to invest. But that\u2019s small change for United Technologies, a company with sales of $56 billion annually, more than Walt Disney, Coca-Cola or Goldman Sachs. And, in any case, it won\u2019t bring the jobs back.Carol Bigbee, 59, has worked at Carrier for 13 years. Her 32-year-old daughter has a college degree and the kind of job that many economists say is the future in postindustrial America \u2014 she works in a medical lab. The only problem, Ms. Bigbee said, is that her daughter\u2019s hourly pay is one-third less than her own pay at Carrier.\u201cI think it will be extremely hard to find a job that pays $22 an hour,\u201d Ms. Bigbee said. \u201cYou have to be really blessed to find a job that pays that kind of money.\u201d The few manufacturing jobs left require math tests, something she says she worries she could not pass.The first layoffs won\u2019t begin until 2017, and the final shuttering of the factory isn\u2019t expected to happen until 2019, giving employees time to prepare. In addition, United Technologies has offered to cover the cost of at least four years of additional schooling for Carrier workers. But that\u2019s cold comfort to people who can\u2019t afford not to work or those, like Ms. Bigbee, who are near retirement.She will be 60 in May, making retraining impractical. \u201cIf I were in my 40s, I\u2019d go back to school,\u201d she said.As Ms. Bigbee and her co-workers were talking over beers and Tequila Sunrises at Sully\u2019s in Indianapolis, executives from United Technologies were hosting a gathering of their own in New York City \u2014 at the Plaza Hotel, a property that was once owned, as it happens, by Donald Trump.That meeting was part of \u201cinvestor day,\u201d an annual ritual for many Fortune 500 companies in which management sits down with analysts and shareholders and tells them why their company\u2019s stock is a good buy. Carrier\u2019s message: Moving jobs south of the border is a major part of the company\u2019s strategy to increase profits.Manufacturing products in lower-cost locales isn\u2019t new for Carrier, which has had operations in Monterrey, Mexico, since 1969, decades before Nafta\u2019s passage.But Akhil Johri, the chief financial officer, noted that recent factory consolidation was among the reasons Carrier\u2019s management is eyeing a list of targets for future cuts. \u201cThey are painful\u201d but are necessary \u201cfor the long-term, competitive nature of the business and shareholder value creation,\u201d he said. \u201cWe feel good about being able to execute on that.\u201dUnited Technologies faces pressure from investors hungry for earnings growth in an economy that\u2019s only modestly growing at home, and falling in important overseas markets like China and the Middle East. Although the company\u2019s stock has vastly outperformed benchmarks in the last few decades, the shares have badly trailed the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index over the most recent five years.Wall Street is looking for United Technologies to post a 17 percent increase in earnings per share over the next two years, even though sales are expected to rise only 8 percent. Bridging that gap means cutting costs wherever savings can be found, as Mr. McDonough suggested at the meeting with analysts.Still he rejected the notion that pressure from Wall Street, or corporate greed, or even trade policy, had prompted the factory move to Monterrey. \u201cThis was a really tough decision,\u201d he said. \u201cThis will have a real impact on folks we care about and this community. We\u2019re an American company, but we compete globally.\u201dStaying competitive, raising profits and investing are among the reasons 400 white-collar jobs in areas like engineering and marketing will remain in Indiana.\u201cOur company, with American workers,\u201d he added, \u201cbuilds a heck of a lot of stuff in the U.S.\u201dLess than a three-hour drive south of Laredo, Tex., where the mountains meet the desert scrub near Monterrey, lies one industrial park after another. That\u2019s where Carrier and many other American manufacturers have built gleaming factories.Outside Carrier\u2019s plant on Hermenegildo Galeana Street in the suburb of Santa Catarina, a worker named Antonio Arroyo has nothing but positive things to say about his job, much like his colleagues in Indianapolis until last month. \u201cThe atmosphere is relaxed, a healthy environment,\u201d he said. \u201cEven the temporary workers are constantly trained.\u201dAs in the United States, the day shift starts around 6 a.m. and finishes about 4 p.m., with a break for lunch. Temporary workers, who have contracts lasting from three to six months, earn 163 pesos a day, or $9.40. Permanent workers make 330 pesos for a day\u2019s work, or $19.Hourly salaries in Indianapolis range from $15 to $26 an hour, as they do up the road in Huntington, Ind., where an additional 700 United Technologies jobs will be transferred to Mexico as well.United Technologies is not hurting like the American automakers or steel giants who lost billions when they were caught short by up-and-coming Japanese and South Korean competitors in the 1970s and 1980s. But the company says it fears it could end up in a similar situation if it doesn\u2019t make sure it is among the most efficient manufacturers in the world.Over all, United Technologies earned nearly $7.6 billion last year, and $2.9 billion of that came from the climate, controls and security division that includes Carrier. Those profits aren\u2019t under pressure; in fact, margins in the unit have steadily expanded in recent years.But that\u2019s not good enough, said Howard Rubel, a senior analyst at Jefferies, who notes that United Technologies has vowed to cut at least a half-billion dollars in costs annually for the next few years. \u201cThe stock hasn\u2019t done well,\u201d Mr. Rubel pointed out.United Technologies\u2019 board cut the bonus of its chief executive, Gregory J. Hayes, by nearly half for 2015. Still, with a total compensation package of $5.7 million, he made more last year than Carrier\u2019s factory workers could earn in several lifetimes. But in corporate boardrooms and country clubs, that\u2019s not the point.\u201cIt\u2019s embarrassing,\u201d said Mr. Rubel. \u201cThe stock didn\u2019t do well, and he got dinged. And whether it\u2019s the board or personal pride, no one wants that.\u201dBack in Indiana, smaller bonuses for top executives are the last thing state Representative Karlee Macer wants to hear about these days. Her district includes the Carrier plant, and for all their grit and noise and physical strain, manufacturing jobs aren\u2019t like many other positions available to Americans who lack a college degree, she said. For one thing, they pay more, giving the children of factory workers other options if they so choose.\u201cMy family has all been factory workers, including my grandmother, who came home with burn marks from welding,\u201d she said over breakfast across the street from the Indiana Statehouse. \u201cIs everybody who is not a white-collar worker supposed to earn $12 an hour?\u201dJuan Zertuche contributed reporting from Monterrey, Mexico.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Who Gets the Blame for the Slowing Economy?", "Date": "2016-03-10", "News": "Supported byECONOMIC alarm bells are ringing: Financial markets have wilted. Forecasters have been slicing their projections for future growth. And some leading wise men \u2014 including the megabillionaire George Soros \u2014 are predicting a return to disastrous 2008 conditions. That\u2019s almost certainly an overly pessimistic view. But without a doubt, the leading global economies are in a major slowdown.Not evident is whether another recession looms. While current data suggests that modest growth continues in the United States, economists are notoriously bad at forecasting downturns. As The Economist noted, between 1999 and 2014, the International Monetary Fund, in its April forecasts, failed to predict every one of the 220 instances in which one of its members suffered negative annual growth in the next year. Even the Federal Reserve uncharacteristically recently described the outlook as \u201cunclear.\u201dWhat\u2019s unusual about today\u2019s raft of challenges is the extent to which governments around the world have added to the problems, rather than ameliorating them. Poor policy choices, like misguided spending priorities and too much austerity, have added to the drag on growth. Notably, failing to act at all has cut deeply into business and investor confidence, an important support mechanism for markets and consumers alike.Governments alone are not to blame; the reasons for the sagging economies are multifarious and jumbled, more de Kooning than Mondrian.For a start, global competition and weak productivity growth have held down wages in developed countries. That has depressed consumer spending, as have increased saving and growing income inequality, which has pushed more money into the hands of the rich, who are less likely to spend it.Lacking confidence and seeing weak demand, many businesses have held back on investing, and in the challenged energy sector, cuts are rampant. Meanwhile, the rise of capital-efficient businesses \u2014 from Amazon to Uber \u2014 means less spending on machinery and buildings.Well-intentioned efforts to avoid another financial crisis have put the banking system in a straitjacket, discouraging lending and reducing liquidity on trading desks, which has contributed mightily to market gyrations.In turn, weakening credit markets stir fears of corporate bankruptcies. While falling prices of oil and other commodities help industrialized countries, they signal not just rising supply but also disappointing demand.All that said, governments haven\u2019t done enough to help the situation \u2014 and have done a lot to exacerbate it. Closest to home, of course, is gridlock in Washington. Anti-deficit fervor has led to a meat-ax approach to spending cuts, under which nondefense discretionary outlays (which include key pro-growth areas like research and development and infrastructure) have fallen in real terms by nearly 20 percent over the past five years, at a time when they should be growing substantially.Meanwhile, Congress has not passed a comprehensive tax reform package in three decades, which has given clever experts room to develop loophole after loophole, particularly for multinational companies eager to cut their tax bills by sequestering profits overseas.Fueling still more fear among consumers and businessmen alike is the looming presidential election and the surprising strength of contenders like Donald J. Trump and Bernie Sanders, who promise unconventional, and potentially disruptive, changes if elected.Europe is in far worse shape. Bedeviled by a poorly constructed single currency system, the Continent has lurched from crisis to crisis as weaker countries like Greece fail to keep up with the German juggernaut.And while reforming our regulatory apparatus would be a welcome economic positive, that should be urgent business for Europe. Sclerotic labor laws in countries like France result in unyielding double-digit unemployment. In many European countries, regulatory red tape impedes new business start-ups. Germany\u2019s aggressive tilt toward renewable energy has raised costs enormously for its industrial sector.Meanwhile, key private sector actors are particularly fearful that central banks, which have kept growth alive by keeping interest rates near zero, have run out of ammunition, making the need for more robust fiscal policy even more urgent.Then there\u2019s China. Unlike their counterparts in developed countries, Chinese leaders aren\u2019t afraid to act; their problem is that they often don\u2019t seem to know what to do, particularly when it comes to managing financial markets.When Chinese stocks sagged, the authorities exhorted the citizenry to buy them up. As shares soared, they curtailed the ability to purchase shares on margin, causing prices to plummet. Similarly, beginning last August, China made a muddle of its effort to unpeg its currency from the strong dollar, leading to huge capital flight from the country ($159 billion in December alone).Most scary to China watchers is the country\u2019s fast rising debt. All these worries are exacerbated by the country\u2019s opacity; for example, almost no expert believes that China is growing at the nearly 7 percent rate that it claims.The past two recessions were caused largely by private actors: the risky lending of the mid-2000s and the dot-com bubble at the turn of the century.This time, if we fail to break out of the current stagnation \u2014 or worse, fall into global recession \u2014 the fault will lie with our leaders.Steven Rattner is a Wall Street executive and a contributing opinion writer.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Google Showcases Its Cloud Efforts, Determined to Catch Up to Rivals", "Date": "2016-03-23", "News": "Supported byIn the cloud computing business, Google\u2019s technology prowess is rarely questioned. Its commitment, however, has been doubted.Google, which trails Amazon and Microsoft in the fast-growing market, hopes to change the industry perception that it is halfhearted about its cloud computing service with product announcements, technology demonstrations and strategy briefings at a two-day conference in San Francisco that began on Wednesday.The company is showcasing its cloud software for machine learning, a branch of artificial intelligence. It has a new speech service: Feed in audio, and the software issues a transcript. Its recently introduced vision service for identifying images also will be more broadly available soon, Google said. And new tools and training aids are available to help developers build machine-learning applications more easily.These are the first significant steps since Diane B. Greene, a respected Silicon Valley technologist, became senior vice president in charge of Google\u2019s cloud business in November. Ms. Greene is a co-founder and former chief executive of VMware, whose software is widely used in corporate data centers. She knows the enterprise computing business, which has not been Google\u2019s strength.The new cloud offerings after Ms. Greene\u2019s appointment signal the company\u2019s intent, analysts say. \u201cGoogle finally wants to compete in the cloud for enterprise business,\u201d said Mike Gualtieri, an analyst at Forrester Research.Having technology is only one ingredient in the corporate marketplace, analysts note. Marketing, training and customer service are also important to win businesses.\u201cWe\u2019ve got to get really good at communications and training,\u201d Ms. Greene said in an interview.In the corporate cloud business, Google must address a wide range of customers and requirements, she said. For many, a purely online relationship will be fine, she said, while others want hands-on assistance.For labor-intensive projects, Google will work through partners, she said. The company has no intention of building its own consulting arm. \u201cThat\u2019s not what Google does,\u201d said Ms. Greene, who, since 2012, has been a board member of Google and then its parent company, Alphabet, which was established last year.But Google plans to step up training and certification programs, again working through industry partners to expand that effort. \u201cWe\u2019ll train the trainers,\u201d she explained.Traditionally, technology companies have hired armies of sales representatives who have sold corporations expensive software that resided in their data centers. That business still exists, but it is eroding rapidly as cloud software, with its pay-for-use model, becomes mainstream.Cloud software, Ms. Greene said, is redefining the relationship corporate customers have with technology companies. \u201cNobody has figured it out yet,\u201d she said. \u201cBut it has to span the spectrum from self-service to high touch.\u201dThe essence of Google\u2019s appeal to customers and industry partners, is that \u201cyou sign up for keeping pace with Google\u2019s technology development,\u201d Ms. Greene said.Wix, an online service for building websites, has been using Google\u2019s vision service recently. It lets users search the many thousands of images Wix has in its database. Creating an online jewelry commerce site? Search the Wix digital library of unlabeled, stock photos for \u201cpearls\u201d and \u201cdiamond rings,\u201d and Google software finds those images.\u201cIt\u2019s pretty amazing,\u201d said David Zuckerman, head of the developer experience at Wix. \u201cThe neat thing is that the users never know they are using artificial intelligence.\u201dWix runs its sizable business on the cloud, and it uses the cloud services of Google, Amazon and Microsoft. Mr. Zuckerman welcomes vigorous competition among the three, which should insure lower prices and better deal terms.Recognizing it is the underdog, Google is starting to try harder with better support and terms, Mr. Zuckerman said. \u201cI feel a closer relationship with Google, probably because it is not the king in this space,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Convoy Sees Itself as the Uber of Local Trucking", "Date": "2016-03-23", "News": "Supported byBut the expression has not become so overused as to have frightened away a prominent group of investors from the next big industry they are eager to Uberize: trucking.Convoy, a start-up in Seattle founded by former Amazon employees that has created an on-demand service for local truckers, plans to announce on Wednesday that it has raised $16 million in a new investment round led by Greylock Partners. New investors also include Jeff Wilke, a top Amazon executive, and Kevin Systrom, the co-founder and chief executive of Instagram.Reid Hoffman and Simon Rothman from Greylock and Hadi Partovi, a serial entrepreneur who now runs the nonprofit Code.org and who previously invested in Convoy, have joined the company\u2019s board of directors. Last year, Convoy raised $2.5 million from a group of investors including Jeff Bezos, the chief executive of Amazon, and Marc Benioff, the chief executive of Salesforce.Convoy began its service last year with the goal of giving local truckers \u2014 who specialized in jobs that could be completed in a day \u2014 a more efficient way to connect with clients who needed goods shipped.Local trucking is a heavily fragmented industry, populated by small operators, many of them with 10 or fewer trucks. Matching truckers with clients is typically handled by brokers, who do much of their work by phone, said Dan Lewis, the chief executive of Convoy, who has worked at Amazon.Convoy gives truckers a smartphone app that they can use to accept a job from shippers. An Uber-like interface allows their clients to see the truck on a map as it heads to its destination. Mr. Lewis said Convoy charged truckers a fee that was less than the roughly 25 percent of the value of a job that a broker typically received.\u201cWe\u2019re going to help you keep your truck full,\u201d Mr. Lewis said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to get you more work. People are always looking for their next load.\u201dMr. Lewis said the company was operating in Oregon and Washington, and had thousands of truckers active in its network. He said companies that had used its service to ship goods included Scotts Miracle-Gro and a division of Nucor Steel. He said Convoy\u2019s revenue had been doubling every month since the company began.Investors were drawn to the company by the prospect that Convoy could collect a toll on a large industry. Local trucking, including transport of hazardous material, gravel and other specialized loads, is an $80 billion-a-year industry, by some estimates.\u201cConvoy has one of those unique chances to disrupt a big, old industry that hasn\u2019t really changed much since it started,\u201d said Mr. Rothman of Greylock, a venture capital firm that has invested in LinkedIn, Airbnb and other companies.The challenge with any on-demand business, though, is getting buyers and sellers of services to use the system early on, when there is not much volume in the marketplace. And in the case of Convoy, it was not the first company to come up with an Uber-like idea for trucking.A start-up called Cargomatic, founded several years ago, operates an on-demand trucking service in the San Francisco, Los Angeles and New York areas. Jonathan Kessler, the chief executive and co-founder of Cargomatic, which is based in Venice Beach, Calif., said the company had been used by thousands of drivers and shippers. Cargomatic has raised $17 million from investors.Mr. Partovi, who was an early investor in Facebook, said Convoy had the potential to be a large business because of the size of its market.\u201cLocal trucking alone is a big enough market to build a Facebook-sized business,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "25 Songs That Tell Us Where Music Is Going", "Date": "2016-03-10", "News": "By Nitsuh AbebeBy then, though, the song had become such an intense focus of discussion at the digital water cooler \u2014 to the point where it felt difficult to turn on a computer without someone\u2019s views about \u201cFormation\u201d and its various sociopolitical valences reaching out and grasping for your throat \u2014 that my not having heard it acquired some kind of political dimension. A decision had to be made. Either I needed to dutifully consume this object of conversation and develop an opinion about it or I needed to develop a defense of why I hadn\u2019t yet done so.The point being: Here, for a moment, was music that actively dragooned me into paying attention to it, based not primarily on sound, performance or composition, but on the rolling snowball of perspectives, close readings and ideological disputes accreting around it.It\u2019s songs that do this now; individual songs and mass opinion, working in tandem. This wasn\u2019t always the case. We\u2019ve spent the past century or so trying, in creaky and convulsive ways, to figure out what music is even for, and how we intend to use it. When and where will we listen to it? Will other people be there? Should people own music? Who should write it \u2014 the performers? What\u2019s a normal amount to release at once? How will we find out about it? Will there be pictures? Are you absolutely, definitely sure we have to pay money for it? For the moment, there\u2019s only one answer to these questions that seems to connect strangers in a truly monocultural way: We shall gather in huge, fawning riots around towering pop singles to trade politicized takes on them.It\u2019s not the worst thing. One of the great tricks of pop music is that no matter how much we like to imagine it\u2019s about musicians expressing themselves, it tends to be more useful as a way for listeners to figure out their own identities: Each song lets us try on a new way of being in the world. For a long while, the idea was that young people could use music to shape their style \u2014 their clothes, their haircuts, their sense of cool. Then came high-speed Internet and a touching enthusiasm for the idea of playlists: With so much of the world\u2019s music at our fingertips, we\u2019d express our intelligence and taste by playing D.J. and curator, sorting through songs to assemble our own reflections. That didn\u2019t last, either. Showing off your eclectic, handpicked treasures? This has become such a common online performance that there\u2019s no one left in the audience.So these days it\u2019s the song, and the scale of the event surrounding it. One song, one digestible thing, with millions of people standing in a circle around it, pointing and shouting and writing about it, conducting one gigantic online undergraduate seminar about it, metabolizing it on roughly the same level that cable-news debate shows metabolize a political speech. This is an ever-greater share of the public life of music. A song like \u201cFormation\u201d isn\u2019t set up as a story, or an interior monologue \u2014 it\u2019s set up as Beyonc\u00e9, the public celebrity whose biography you already know, addressing the world, like an op-ed with drums. Thus can we argue not about what the song says to us, but about what we think the rest of the world needs to be told, and whether Beyonc\u00e9 is telling it right. What do we make of her dancers\u2019 Black Panther styling? Is she \u201callowed\u201d to work with beloved artists from New Orleans or use references to the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina? How does the song sound through a feminist lens, through a queer lens, through an anticapitalist one? Can we have a conversation about her daughter\u2019s hair, and also about police violence? People talked about these things until, three days in, I\u2019d been quoted every last line of a song I still hadn\u2019t heard.How the pop star won us back with a disappearing act.By Mary H.K. ChoiThe second single from \u201cPurpose,\u201d Justin Bieber\u2019s fourth studio album, \u201cSorry\u201d is an infectious confection \u2014 a Dorito for your ears. There are two official videos for it: a dance video that stars a diverse cast of young women who seem to have been dressed by magpies let loose in a Delia\u2019s catalog; and a lyric video, which is sort of like that footage they use in karaoke bars, but slightly more polished. Between the two, there have been well over 1 billion views. At no point in either does the Canadian heartthrob appear. He simply doesn\u2019t need to.In previous years, by contrast, he was everywhere. He had transformed in the public eye from a teen-star brat to a grown-up brat, with the D.U.I. arrest to prove it. He had become a hollow hashtag of a person. When he visited the Anne Frank house, he wrote in the guest book that he sincerely hoped Frank would have been a \u201cBelieber.\u201d Not only did he come off like Joffrey Baratheon with a Hitler-youth haircut, his callow bad-boy affectation reeked of a keening need to be cool \u2014 anathema, as any teenager can tell you, to actually being cool. But the backlash to the backlash is here, and much like both videos, it has less to do with Bieber \u2014 the actual Bieber \u2014 than you\u2019d expect.Because get this: The most inspired part of Justin Bieber\u2019s reinvention is its erasure of all previously identifiable Bieberish elements. \u201cSorry\u201d is unlike anything Bieber has made in the past. It has been classified as \u201ctropical house\u201d and \u201cdancehall,\u201d but everyone seems to agree on one thing: It\u2019s a banger. The song is about a relationship Bieber has screwed up, and in the lead-in to the hook, he asks, \u201cIs it too late now to say sorry?/\u2019Cause I\u2019m missing more than just your body.\u201d But by the time the actual chorus arrives, Bieber lets the production take over: All you hear is a cooing arpeggio that feels like a gentle breeze on your brain. It\u2019s the best part of the song, and Bieber seems to appear in it only as a sample.This song is a triumph of music over narrative in the hellscape that is the pop music-industrial complex. Consider, for example, the confusing, protracted drama of Kanye West\u2019s latest album release, which involved a huge fashion show, several tweet storms and title changes all leading up to \u201cThe Life of Pablo,\u201d a record that\u2019s being finished in real time on a platform no one wants to pay for.So what is it, exactly, that we want from Bieber? Likability? Yes, Justin Bieber is a contrivance. Yes, Justin Bieber\u2019s lyrics are insipid \u2014 worse still, disingenuous. Yes, his tattoos stink. Yes, he\u2019s lousy at skateboarding. But what does any of this actually matter? In case you missed it, Bieber won. You used to hate him, and now it\u2019s pointless. So who\u2019s sorry now? \u2666Even if you can\u2019t score tickets, the cast album is its own transcendent experience.By Wesley MorrisThere\u2019s being locked out of heaven. Then there\u2019s being locked out of \u201cHamilton.\u201d And with all due respect to Bruno Mars (and God), being locked out of \u201cHamilton\u201d is crueller \u2014 as farce, but still. The musical is sold out \u2014 for, like, ever. And the resale market has achieved spit-take-level hilarity. To wit, this Craigslist ad: \u201cI bought tickets for the wrong night. These are legitimate \u2018Hamilton\u2019 tickets for Friday March 11, 8 p.m., purchased though Ticketmaster. I just want to get back what I paid for them. Great seats! $933.80 per ticket.\u201dBack on Earth, there\u2019s the cast album: a 46-number souvenir for an experience most of us won\u2019t be experiencing. At less than $20 on iTunes, however, where it has been in and out of the Top 10 for months, and Amazon, this is a more-than-adequate substitute for the budget-conscious. It\u2019s a gateway to obsession. To know someone who has this album is to know someone who needs a restraining order.This is to say that the cast recording is its own experience. In an age in which the album is notional \u2014 musical Tupperware \u2014 this one works as a complete concept and doubles as its own playlist, crammed with jams. There are King George\u2019s long-distance interludes, in which, under the mostly brown circumstances, white power sings the same, out-of-style song over and over and over. Meanwhile, the first five numbers alone \u2014 \u201cAlexander Hamilton\u201d; \u201cAaron Burr, Sir\u201d; \u201cMy Shot\u201d; \u201cThe Story of Tonight\u201d; and \u201cThe Schuyler Sisters\u201d \u2014 get halfway to a greatest-hits collection. Pilfered dabs of R.&B., show tunes, rock and rap recombine until identifying whatever you think you\u2019re hearing becomes its own sport.The rapping that Hamilton, played by Lin-Manuel Miranda, the show\u2019s creator, does at the start of the song sounds like some sweaty couplet from LL Cool J\u2019s \u201cI Need Love\u201d from 1987. The \u201cnos\u201d from the ensemble echo the \u201cwhoas\u201d and \u201cheys\u201d from Naughty by Nature\u2019s \u201cHip-Hop Hooray,\u201d from 1993. When Miranda gets to the chorus (\u201cLord, show me how to/Say no to this/I don\u2019t know how to/Say no to this/But my God, she looks so helpless/And her body\u2019s saying, \u2018hell, yes\u2019\u201d) handclaps and guitar licks gently join the percussion and bass line. And suddenly all I can hear is Champaign\u2019s 1981 love jam, \u201cHow \u2019Bout Us.\u201d Pairing those Greek-chorus \u201cnos\u201d with the ecstatic sounds of a harp as Hamilton and Mrs. Reynolds (presumably) do it generates moral tension. The bass line is where \u201cSay No to This\u201d gets both its erogenous nerve and antique heat. Your head spins as the song proceeds to combine sounds from a half-dozen old-school districts.The Karl Ove Knausgaard of grumpy independent musicians.By Sam Hockley-SmithMark Kozelek, who used to front an epically moody band called Red House Painters, is known as something of a jerk. Onstage, when not singing in a voice like crumbling granite, he says things that usually end up offending somebody: hipsters, women, journalists, the band on the next stage. But on the records he now releases as Sun Kil Moon, he examines his life with plain-spoken brutality, saving the most cutting remarks for himself.\u201cI Watched the Film the Song Remains the Same\u201d occupies more than 10 minutes of \u201cBenji,\u201d the album he released in 2014. It begins as the story of the first time Kozelek saw the Led Zeppelin concert film \u201cThe Song Remains the Same\u201d as a child; it ends as a song about nostalgia, chronic sadness and the way people drop in and out of your life. One moment Kozelek\u2019s admiring the electric piano on \u201cNo Quarter\u201d; the next, he\u2019s sharing memories of being a \u201cvery melancholic kid,\u201d or apologizing for the time he punched a classmate in school. The way he writes isn\u2019t so different from Karl Ove Knausgaard, also in his late 40s; both men spent long careers skirting the spotlight, then found new renown when they started excavating their own biographies for details.So on \u201cBenji,\u201d Kozelek sings about his relationship with his parents, about buying lampshades, about death. A second cousin\u2019s death sets him thinking about family; James Gandolfini\u2019s sets him thinking about his prostate troubles. He approaches each topic as if flipping through a disorganized photo album, and the more insular and lived-in the details, the more enthralling they seem. At the end of \u201cI Watched the Film ... ,\u201d he says he\u2019s headed to Santa Fe to visit a friend he hasn\u2019t seen in 15 years. Close Googlers can deduce that friend must be Ivo Watts-Russell, who signed Red House Painters to his 4AD label back in 1992; Kozelek, grave and grateful, says he\u2019s going to New Mexico just to say thank you. \u2666How to chart your own path in a post-label music industry.By Jenna WorthamWatch the virtual-reality film that accompanies this article by downloading NYT VR.The women in attendance seemed especially mesmerized by Sydney Bennett \u2014 better known as Syd tha Kyd \u2014 the frontwoman, whose Tiger Beat sex appeal gave her performance a depth charge. Bennett, 23, brown-skinned with a blond-tinged Mohawk, has the swayback stance of an adolescent skater and dresses like one too: On the \u201cKimmel\u201d set, she wore black vans, a black T-shirt and black jeans low on her hips. As she sang, she roamed across each quadrant of the small stage, staring deep into the throng, as if to find out whether her crush had bothered to make an appearance at the show. To create her stage presence, Bennett studied the R.&B. singer D\u2019Angelo, whose 2000 video for \u201cUntitled (How Does It Feel)\u201d features nothing but his extremely defined and extremely nude upper body dripping with sweat for four and a half minutes. It showed. Bennett flirted with the crowd, peeking at them through her heavily lashed eyes, shooting sly smiles at fans and gently lifting her chin to acknowledge those she knew \u2014 among them, her mom, Janel, and her godmother, Sheryl.The TV appearance was a rarity for the members of the Internet, who, as their name suggests, live online and work from home. Two of the band\u2019s three albums were created and recorded almost entirely at the house where Bennett lives with her parents in L.A.\u2019s Mid-City neighborhood. But their most recent record, last year\u2019s \u201cEgo Death,\u201d caught the attention of the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences, and it was nominated for a Grammy in the Best Urban Contemporary Album category. (Past nominees in the category include Frank Ocean, Rihanna and Beyonc\u00e9.) The \u201cKimmel\u201d performance was a dip into mainstream media that the Internet has largely succeeded without.The band\u2019s name itself hints at an irreversible and inevitable shift in the way music works. For decades, the music industry fancied itself an apparatus for tastemaking, but as technology has made labels\u2019 role less relevant, that has ceased to be the case. Listeners decide what\u2019s popular now, and record labels have to find a way to attach themselves to it. Aside from a few big-name acts, most artists are doomed to languish in relative obscurity with middling profits. This is usually seen as a tragedy \u2014 the death of a musical middle class \u2014 but it has also presented an opportunity for artists to avoid the suffocating effects of the label machine. And so the Internet has carved out an entirely new corner of R.&B., thanks mostly to Bennett: an androgyne who sings seductive incantations about falling in and out of love with women.After the performance, a small constellation of cousins, little sisters and girlfriends milled about, snacking on doughnuts in the greenroom and helping the band pack up. After the equipment was loaded into a caravan of modest sedans and S.U.V.s, the band stood in a circle behind the studio, and someone produced a celebratory blunt. As the smoke drifted overhead, the conversation turned to the next day.The group needed to practice for the first stop on their upcoming tour, which would start a few days later in Japan. Jameel Bruner, who plays the keyboard, wouldn\u2019t be able to come until he was done with his shift at Amoeba Music, where he works as a clerk. There was drama to discuss, too. The 17-year-old guitar player, Steve Lacy, had been photographed smoking weed, and someone had texted the picture to his mother, who was not happy. Despite the chilly El Ni\u00f1o air, the band lingered, seeming reluctant to leave and break the spell of the evening. They eventually agreed to regroup at their home base, Bennett\u2019s house, to make sandwiches, catch their performance on \u201cKimmel,\u201d smoke again and, eventually, crash.The new virtual-reality film from NYT VR takes you inside Sydney Bennett\u2019s home studio as the Internet prepares for a world tour. You\u2019ll experience the rehearsal process as Bennett teaches her band a new song, then get onstage with the band as they perform it for the first time.Turner may have been reacting to the banality of the question, but his answer also illuminated a changing dynamic for rap, which has historically been categorized by regional sounds. People Turner and Bennett\u2019s age are defined by a completely different geography, the social networks and websites they spend their time on. Odd Future was the epitome of this new statelessness: They were neither engineered by a label nor hometown heroes, but something wildly different.Odd Future dominated many conversations about pop culture and the future of music by the end of 2010. They had released all of their early work \u2014 a barrage of clever mixtapes, striking artwork and bizarro music videos \u2014 for free on Tumblr and YouTube. Their sound was prodigious. And not only was their music different but they also looked different too, a bunch of black weirdos who skated in their free time and moshed onstage.The frenzy surrounding Odd Future reached its peak in 2011: Cartoon Network gave the group their own television show; plans for an Odd Future retail shop were in the works. Labels were desperate to sign deals with the group, and Sony Music Entertainment succeeded. The crew had the upper hand and persuaded the label to give them their own imprint, and to award each member a cushy solo record deal. Bennett, the D.J., got one, too.Music came naturally to Bennett. Though her parents are 9-to-5 people \u2014 Janel is a city clerk and her father, Howard, owns a manufacturing company based in China \u2014 her uncle, Mikey Bennett, is a producer in Jamaica. (He co-wrote Shabba Ranks\u2019s 1993 hit \u201cMr. Loverman.\u201d) When she was young, the family took vacations to the island, and Bennett hung out in the studio and watched her uncle work. \u201cAt some point, I started listening to music a little differently,\u201d Bennett said. \u201cRather than being like, Yo, this is dope \u2014 who made this? it started being like, I wish I made this.\u201dWhen she was 16, her parents let her transform their guesthouse into a studio, where she worked on her own songs and recorded local musicians. In high school, she took music-technology classes and piano lessons; at night, she devoured beat-making tutorials and messed around with music software. She downloaded tracks from LimeWire (a file-sharing network like Napster) and remixed them using Pro Tools and GarageBand. She didn\u2019t need much capital to be a producer, just good Google skills and a wealth of persistence and patience.Bennett gravitated toward artists who had pioneered brand-new sounds: The sonic spaciness of Missy Elliott, the stanky soul of Erykah Badu and the acid jazz of Jamiroquai. Pharrell Williams, the original black skater weirdo, is her patron saint. And like most kids interested in music and living in Los Angeles in the mid-2000s, Bennett knew about a teenager named Tyler Okonma who called himself Tyler, the Creator. He had a sizable following on MySpace, where he released his music. \u201cHis production drew me in,\u201d she told me. \u201cIt didn\u2019t sound like what everyone was making \u2014 it was different and hot.\u201d Bennett noticed that one of the people at the top of his friend list was a kid named Matt Martin (who goes by Matt Martians). She browsed through his page, listening to the songs he posted, too. She admired his ability to create deeply complex soundscapes, and she eventually messaged him, seeking advice on ways to advance her own style.The two became friends, trading feedback on songs, which put her into Okonma\u2019s orbit. And when Okonma needed a place to record the early Odd Future mixtapes, Bennett offered up her home studio. She produced some of their early tracks and eventually became the group\u2019s D.J. In old footage of early Odd Future shows, Bennett plays songs from a laptop on a table at the back of the stage. Tomboyish, in a muscle tee and a short haircut, she crackles with the manic energy that Odd Future shows were famous for. She was generally indistinguishable from the boys in the group.From the beginning, Odd Future was meant to be a galaxy of loosely knit projects; the whole point was for the members to collaborate and spin off solo efforts. Christian Clancy, one of the group\u2019s managers, had also been a marketing executive at Interscope Records, and around 2011 he took notice of Bennett and Martin\u2019s tight friendship and encouraged them to start recording together. After all, they liked the same sounds: jazz, old-school slow jams, neo-soul. So they began experimenting, and these experiments would eventually lead to the formation of the Internet.Odd Future was a rare example of a viral sensation with lasting power; the music industry is rife with the ghosts of web talents who couldn\u2019t be repackaged as megastars. The terms of the Internet\u2019s deal with Sony \u201callowed us to shape ourselves,\u201d Bennett says. The band is artistically cocooned, trying to create, as she sees it, an entirely new style of R.&B., one that includes all types of desire. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t a conscious thing,\u201d she emphasizes. \u201cI just like women.\u201dBennett personally related to the themes that lent Okonma\u2019s music its emotional gravity: alienation, isolation, loneliness. She felt they shared a connection, one born of \u201cnot being a typical black kid or even a popular kid.\u201d But eventually the hypermasculinity and caustic sense of humor wore on Bennett, who is naturally low-key. She made tearful calls to her mother from the road, wondering aloud whether she should quit. Bennett also struggled with depression, worsened by the stress of touring and feeling disconnected from her family and her girlfriend at the time. She says that no one in the group \u2014 other than Martin \u2014 seemed to care. \u201cI couldn\u2019t talk to any of them about it,\u201d she says. \u201cWe weren\u2019t all that close, and they never seemed to want to hear it.\u201dNot long after, Bennett began training her little brother, Travis \u2014 who goes by Taco \u2014 to take her place as Odd Future\u2019s D.J. Her musical experiments with Martin had begun to congeal into the core of their first album, \u201cPurple Naked Ladies,\u201d an amorphous but promising collection of experimental jam sessions and fuzzed-out, vibey tracks. One morning while Odd Future was on tour, when the group was watching the sun crest over a beach in Australia, Bennett broke the news that she was leaving. She says it was not well received. It felt like a divorce, like a family \u2014 however dysfunctional \u2014 falling apart.\u201cThey weren\u2019t happy about it,\u201d she says. \u201cI was their get-out-of-jail-free card. It\u2019s easy to say they aren\u2019t homophobic because Syd is there.\u201dBennett\u2019s exit came at a time when gender norms were blurring. Artists now feel more emboldened to hint at sexual fluidity; it\u2019s edgy, if not outright trendy. Musicians like Wiz Khalifa and Jaden Smith have been photographed wearing skirts and dresses. Angel Haze and Shamir have said they\u2019re genderqueer. But being openly gay can still feel especially difficult in the world of hip-hop and R.&B., where artists who are suspected of being closeted can face harsher scrutiny. Lesbianism is often fetishized, made into a hypersexualized performance. While Young Thug can get away with wearing nail polish, female artists who give off an even slightly masculine air, like the rapper Dej Loaf, are hounded about their orientation.Minya Oh, the hip-hop journalist who goes by Miss Info, thinks Bennett has benefited from upheaval in the industry. \u201cI\u2019m sure that on some level of the major-label and old-establishment industry, there are execs and agents who think homosexuality is a liability,\u201d she says. On the other hand, she adds, \u201cthere are more and more handlers and mentors and facilitators who will see a new artist who is gay as either an opportunity to tap into a new market or, at worst, just a talking point.\u201d But even more important than all that, Oh says, is that artists like Bennett may not even have to pander to the mainstream anymore: \u201cAs fragmented as music audiences are these days, it would be difficult to alienate fans who are already bunched into nomad tribes.\u201dBennett\u2019s outward manner is so nonchalant and mellow it can start to seem like an affectation, but as soon as the words left my mouth, Bennett put down her forkful of pancake and slid me a sideways look, the kind you give someone when your patience is wearing thin but you still feel obligated to be polite.The Internet \u2014 the network \u2014 has a way of normalizing fringe ideas, marginalized identities and emerging artists that old media tends to ignore. It has done such a good job, you could argue, that people like Bennett \u2014 black, queer and weird \u2014 can exist without the burden of having to represent something larger. Bennett will never be something she\u2019s not. She\u2019s not looking for validation from record labels, or even really from audiences. Later that night, as thousands of Mexican teenagers rushed the stage, singing along in English and screaming her name, Bennett looked completely at home, and completely herself. \u2666A song as salve in an age of rancor.By George SaundersHow does a song work? What does it actually do? It doesn\u2019t instruct, exactly, or teach, necessarily. A song, I\u2019d say, causes the listener to assume a certain stance. Through some intersection of melody/lyrics/arrangement, it causes a shadow-being within us to get a certain expression on its face and fall into a certain posture. (Argent\u2019s \u201cHold Your Head Up,\u201d for example, would cause my 1970s teenage self to assume a, well, Thor-like posture: stoic, windswept, capable of enduring any hardship while, you know, holding my head up.)How does the song accomplish this? Was that the intention? I\u2019m not sure. Like much of Wilco\u2019s work, it\u2019s fundamentally a damned good popular song (simple chords, compelling melody), rendered symphonic by a process by which the song, seemingly rebelling against its own simplicity, seems to be seeking higher levels of emotionality via sonic complexity. This led me to assume the song had to be a result of weeks of arranging. But reportedly the band recorded it in one take, learning it from the songwriter Jeff Tweedy as the tape rolled. The song starts with a catchy eight-note guitar riff, to which it keeps returning, like a well-intentioned guy steering back to his mantra. Via inventive instrumental fills and a false ending (from which it rejuvenates with renewed purpose), it manages the strange task of seeming contemplative while escalating like crazy. It puts me in mind of a group of lifelong pals on a front porch, trying to musically solve some existential problem they can\u2019t quite articulate.The effect of all of this on the listener \u2014 this listener anyway \u2014 is transformative. Listening to \u201cOne Sunday Morning\u201d (every time) fixes me \u2014 like some sort of aural medicine. I feel a positive alteration in my body and mind: a renewed sense of humility at the sadness of the world, and a corresponding resolve to keep trying to be better; freshly reminded of the stakes of being alive, and of the fact that there are, at my disposal, more positive resources than I am currently employing. In this, \u201cOne Sunday Morning\u201d serves, for me, as a reliable 12-minute prayer. \u2666The radical act of ending an album in midsentence.By Jace ClaytonAt first, I thought my MP3 must have been corrupted. There\u2019s a springy, up-tempo beat that kicks off \u201c\u201906,\u201d the last track on Vince Staples\u2019s 2015 debut double album, \u201cSummertime \u201906,\u201d whose 20 songs are stark portrayals of a childhood caught between gangs and the police in Southern California. A lengthy instrumental stretch in \u201c\u201906\u201d gives the listener a break. When Staples appears with a fulsome \u201cGood mornin\u2019! Hope you had a good time last night\u201d and starts rapping, it\u2019s one of the most optimistic-sounding moments on the album. He\u2019s midway through the first verse (\u201cI\u2019m finna bring the gang in the buil\u2014\u201d) when the song cuts to a blast of loud static, followed by silence. The effect is so jarring that it can easily be mistaken for an error, a glitch in the stream.When I learned that this tear into white noise was intentional, I was shocked. This went beyond breaking the rules. \u201c\u201906\u201d plays an entirely different game than most music. Its words and sounds don\u2019t matter. What matters here is the rupture. The track uses white noise to depict a kind of death, yet it\u2019s also the sound of a channel being changed or a TV or radio shutting off: Someone is controlling this switch. A young man has been unexpectedly silenced. When it\u2019s over for him, it\u2019s over for the listener, too.His compressed rhymes sparkle with aphoristic detail. The opening lines of \u201cSummertime \u201906\u201d are \u201cHey, I\u2019m just a nigga until I fill my pockets/And then I\u2019m Mr. Nigga, they follow me while shoppin\u2019/I feel like Mick and Richards, they feel like Muddy Waters/So tell me what\u2019s the difference, so tell me what\u2019s the difference?/My momma was a Christian, Crip walkin\u2019 on blue-waters.\u201d The references multiply into serious depth. Yet before we have time to consider the Rolling Stones\u2019 relationship to the blues or how churches and gangs may offer similar types of belonging or anything else, Staples has raced ahead to end the verse with a punch: \u201cUber driver in the cockpit look like Jeffrey Dahmer/But he lookin\u2019 at me crazy when we pull up to the projects.\u201dThere are no radio-friendly singles here. Staples likes to call out things as they are, but he is not a stern moralist; if he were, he probably wouldn\u2019t have landed his gig as a brand ambassador for Sprite. (\u201cDifferent \u2019cause I\u2019m just like you\u201d he says in a recent national TV ad for the soft drink.) The preternaturally gifted rapper dresses in unflashy T-shirts and jeans. He\u2019s straight edge (no alcohol or drugs), a shrewd experimentalist with a complex politics.The song that precedes \u201d\u201906,\u201d \u201cLike It Is,\u201d clues us in to what the shocking signal crash might mean. Over a lurching, industrial beat, Staples explains: \u201cYou looking at a person, telling them that they story don\u2019t matter really no better than me/walkin\u2019 down the streets tryna shoot at somebody.\u201d To deny the validity of another person\u2019s story, he says, is to deny them life. And even when one can voice his or her mind freely, to be a successful black rapper is to perform your persona before a predominantly white audience, whose aggregate opinion determines your worth. This is a problem Staples continually addresses, whether discussing how one of his ambitions is to leave the rap game (and move on to more reliable ways of earning a living) during interviews, or in songs like \u201cLift Me Up\u201d: \u201cAll these white folks chanting when I asked \u2019em \u2018Where my niggas at?\u2019/Goin\u2019 crazy, got me goin\u2019 crazy, I can\u2019t get with that.\u201d Rapping about it only aggravates the paradox; those lines have been among the most quoted in reviews of his album, used to praise his self-awareness.Then comes the static.Staples knows that possibilities for mainstream black visibility are few and fraught. Black entertainers in the celebrity spotlight mark one extreme, the grainy videoclips of African-Americans dying at the hands of the police, whose name-recognition is always posthumous, another. How to speak against that? You can\u2019t. You can only unplug.\u201c\u201906\u201d adds to a growing body of work by black artists who flirt with disappearance in order to trouble the idea of representation itself. In \u201cConcerto in Black and Blue,\u201d David Hammons\u2019s 2002 piece for a series of pitch-black rooms in a large SoHo gallery, visitors were invited to explore with tiny blue flashlights. Their looking was the only thing to see. When the dancer-choreographer Storyboard P performs for video, he exploits the camera\u2019s two-dimensional limitations to create on-screen moves that appear simultaneously awkward and impossibly fluid. He dances as if he doesn\u2019t want to be captured, in gravity-defying bends and evasions \u2014 all escape, no center. The poet Claudia Rankine, in her 2004 book \u201cDon\u2019t Let Me Be Lonely,\u201d opens each section with an image of a TV showing static. \u201cThe years went by and people only died on television,\u201d she writes. \u201cIf they weren\u2019t Black, they were wearing black or were terminally ill.\u201dThe jagged conclusion of \u201c\u201906\u201d asks what it might mean to turn away from self-representation in sound. White noise is a spray of pitches and volumes that contains all audible frequencies. It is constant and patternless. Quite literally, it\u2019s the sound of undifferentiated possibility. One can think of Staples\u2019s provocative noise as the opposite of a stereotype, or freedom in sonic form. His signal fritzes into static with a snarl of hope: Noise and silence mark the edges of what can be considered music. To end an album like this points to a world beyond the song and to hands manipulating the transmission. What can be said outside the culture\u2019s limiting expectations, and who might we become if we learn to listen to it? \u2666A singular voice, aching with desperation and resolve.By Carlo Rotella Price usually drops down in pitch when she sings the second syllable of \u201cbottle,\u201d but sometimes she takes it up a bluesy interval instead, turning a honky-tonk lament into a call to arms. The two deliveries of the line play up countervailing qualities of desperation and resolve in her voice. Together they make it sound as if she\u2019s exerting considerable strength of character to keep despair and bad luck from carrying her song off the road and headlong into a telephone pole. This instantly detectable tension in her voice causes listeners to become alert, even alarmed, the moment she starts singing.\u201cHurtin\u2019 \u201c is the first single from Price\u2019s album \u201cMidwest Farmer\u2019s Daughter,\u201d which will be released by Jack White\u2019s Third Man Records on March 25. She\u2019s being rolled out with the fanfare appropriate to the next big thing out of Nashville, as the appearance on Colbert suggests, but she\u2019s not on country\u2019s standard ing\u00e9nue track. At 32, having weathered lean times and near misses, she\u2019s more of a hard-bitten classicist. Her album title evokes Loretta Lynn\u2019s \u201cCoal Miner\u2019s Daughter,\u201d and her diction, especially the way she chews on the word \u201cpain,\u201d raises echoes of Tammy Wynette; her mask of barroom bravado over tender vulnerability recalls Merle Haggard; and her band, the Price Tags, favors old-school arrangements, with Luke Schneider\u2019s pedal-steel guitar weaving prominently around her voice.As attention has built around Price, she has sometimes found herself placed in a cohort with Chris Stapleton, Sturgill Simpson and other scruffy dissenters who have recently made inroads into the dominion of the bro acts currently ruling Nashville\u2019s major labels and country radio. As the underground rocker-turned-\u201dcountry/garage\u201d producer Jonathan Bright has suggested, if current Nashville stars like Luke Bryan and Florida Georgia Line are the equivalent of M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce and other such glam-pop acts who dominated rock in the late 1980s, Price and company could be part of country\u2019s long-awaited back-to-basics riposte. Roots-music boosters are always announcing that the inevitable cyclical swing back to hard-country twang has begun, but listening to Price \u2014 or watching the growly, uncute Stapleton clean up at the Country Music Association Awards last November \u2014 you can begin to believe that maybe it\u2019s really happening.The songs on \u201cMidwest Farmer\u2019s Daughter\u201d mine the experience of further hard knocks. Her parents lost the family\u2019s corn-and-soybean farm in Buffalo Prairie, Ill., and her father went to work as a prison guard. Price endured a run of professional disappointment and personal sorrow after arriving in Nashville in 2003. With her husband, Jeremy Ivey, who plays bass in the Price Tags and writes songs with her, she tried her hand at rock and soul and made a brief, unhappy foray into writing commercial country music. Serially turned away, ripped off and let down by operators in the music industry, she grew used to selling her meager possessions to pick up and start over, waitressing, hoping for some luck. \u201cI can\u2019t count all the times I\u2019ve been had,\u201d she sings in \u201cThis Town Gets Around,\u201d her ode to the lecherous manager, fraudulent publicist and other Music Row animals who preyed upon her.Five years ago she gave birth to twin sons, one of whom died of a rare heart ailment two weeks later. She sank low after that and couldn\u2019t pull herself out of it. Drinking didn\u2019t help. \u201cIt just snowballed,\u201d she says. \u201cI felt as if I was cursed, some kind of running cosmic joke.\u201d A long weekend in the Davidson County jail after a drunken-driving incident persuaded her to get help and break the downward momentum. \u201cWeekender,\u201d a jail song on the album, is a good girl\u2019s rueful acknowledgment that the women in lockup are tougher and less fortunate than she is. \u201cThey were hard, and I was really scared,\u201d she says. \u201cThey could tell by your shoes that you were just a weekender.\u201dShe and Ivey sold their car to finance the recording of \u201cMidwest Farmer\u2019s Daughter\u201d at Sun Studio in Memphis. The album was rejected all over Nashville and eventually picked up by a label they didn\u2019t even consider approaching. Despite having a Nashville office, Third Man Records isn\u2019t widely known for producing country music (though Jack White produced a comeback album for Loretta Lynn in 2004). But Price\u2019s habit of putting vocal soul shadings into even the most straight-ahead country songs makes her an impure traditionalist, and therefore a surprisingly good fit for Third Man. Ben Swank, who runs the company with White and Ben Blackwell, says, \u201cWe\u2019re coming from a punk-rock, indie-rock background that discovered blues and American music in reverse,\u201d an aesthetic that tends to value emotional power over stylistic orthodoxy.Swank believes that Price\u2019s career travails might have fortuitously delayed her album just long enough to allow Third Man to take advantage of a new openness to \u201ca classical sound\u201d in country music. Another name for that sound is Americana: high-gloss corporate country\u2019s earthier foil and partner, which embraces not only folk traditions but also vintage commercial styles drawn magpie-fashion from bygone eras. Pointing in particular to the career of Stapleton \u2014 who went from writing pop-flavored radio fare for established stars to become a major-label juggernaut singing spare, bluesy songs in the outlaw country mold \u2014 Swank says: \u201cNow there are others who have knocked on the door. If she had come along two years earlier, maybe it\u201d \u2014 the next-big-thing buzz \u2014 \u201cwouldn\u2019t have happened.\u201dPrice\u2019s son, Judah, climbed on and off her lap as a stylist enlarged her blond hair. Friends and family were temporarily shooed away as she put on something tight and fringed. Foot traffic milled in and out of other dressing rooms along the hall, and from one came a furious burst of picking as a bluegrass band warmed up.Out on the main stage, Price sang her allotted two songs, ending with \u201cHurtin.\u2019 \u201c The band came to a full stop for her honky-tonk cadenza: \u201cThat don\u2019t touch . . . the paiiiinnnnn . . . you put . . . on . . . meeeeee,\u201d with a slow-rising two-note flourish on the final word. Robust applause followed, and then Mike Snider, the banjo player who serves as one of the Opry\u2019s chief traditionalist voices, said: \u201cGood job, Margo, you sweet little old thing. Good to have somebody come out here and sing country again.\u201d There was laughter, some knowing and some a little too hearty, in the crowd and among the house musicians onstage and the insiders thronging the wings. \u201cBy golly,\u201d Snider said, \u201cthat was stronger than new rope.\u201d \u2666The world\u2019s greatest session drummer confronts the machine age.By Jeff HimmelmanChamberlain, 48, is a session player paid by the project, a below-the-radar rock star who often shows up only in the liner notes. If you watched MTV in the \u201990s, you heard him drumming with Pearl Jam in their \u201cAlive\u201d video or with Fiona Apple or Tori Amos or the Wallflowers. He has appeared on records by everyone from Bruce Springsteen and David Bowie to Frank Ocean and Kanye West, toured with the Indigo Girls and Soundgarden, spent a season as the drummer for the \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d band. He played drums on the \u201cFrozen\u201d soundtrack for Disney. In a world of dwindling recording budgets and increased automation, he could well be the last one drumming before software takes over completely.At Blackbird Studio in Nashville, Urban told Chamberlain that he had \u201cJohn Cougar\u201d down on his acoustic guitar, but it felt too formulaic. He\u2019d been listening to the rapper Kendrick Lamar and wanted a groove that could not only propel the song but inspire an altogether new sound for it. Chamberlain assembled a drum loop \u2014 a small-scale mechanical repetition born more of hip-hop than country \u2014 and then played live drums over the loop, deepening the timbre and also providing accents and fills when the movement of the verses seemed to require it. Urban pronounced the whole package \u201csexy\u201d; in the sought-for moment of inspiration, he would put down his acoustic guitar in favor of an electric bass. Within a couple of hours, the drums-bass-and-voice opening and the entire vibe of the song were effectively complete. The catchy arrangement and on-the-nose country twang of the title and chorus eventually sent \u201cJohn Cougar\u201d to the second spot on Billboard\u2019s U.S. Country Airplay chart.This is the work of the modern session drummer, and it is why, when a major-label project needs drums, Chamberlain is often the first person producers call. When we met in Los Angeles in February, he posed his value proposition as a question: \u201cWhat can you add to a situation that\u2019s totally out of context but works?\u201d Chamberlain is good enough at playing his instruments \u2014 and at reading what producers and artists want \u2014 that they\u2019re willing to pay him well to make that kind of determination for them. And so he lives at an odd intersection, or perhaps a vanishing point; part virtuoso whose skills have never been more relevant, part John Henry figure, hammering away as music is increasingly composed and performed by machines.\u201cI do more and more work out of my studio because nobody has a budget anymore,\u201d he told me. \u201cThe Keith Urbans of the world can fly me to the studio because people still go to Walmart and buy country records.\u201d For the people who can\u2019t afford to fly him out, Chamberlain offers his services remotely from Van Nuys. He has a full recording studio set up: a control room stocked with vintage gear and a large soundproof tracking room where two drum kits sit miked and ready to go. There are drums everywhere, more than anybody should rightly own, stacked on top of each other and hanging from racks: multiple rock kits, a Brazilian pandeiro, Tibetan bells, a 40-gallon oil can rigged with a spring that Chamberlain pounded with evident joy and a built-in cupboard with 20 slots for different snares, each of which is filled. He has a vintage Ludwig Supraphonic (\u201cWhat John Bonham would have played\u201d), a 1930s Slingerland Radio King (\u201cFat and dead\u201d), a 1900s snare with a calfskin head. As he finished giving me a tour, he said: \u201cYou know sample libraries? These are the physical versions of the samples.\u201dWhen I stopped by, Chamberlain was tracking drums for a British singer named Hattie Webb. The first track had some programmed electronic drums already attached as a guide; Webb\u2019s producer had asked Chamberlain, via email, to \u201cbuild it, make it electronic-y with some acoustic elements.\u201d Chamberlain listened to the song twice, charting out its structure on a legal pad, and then he went into the tracking room, where he had a little setup that he called his \u201celectronic/analog kit\u201d \u2014 a small kick drum, a tiny snare that he had purpose-made for work like this and a cymbal with holes in it to sharpen the sound.He cued up the track and then, without any practice, played along with it, sounding so much like the programming that it was almost hard to believe it could be a live performance. And yet his playing also ebbed and flowed in ways that the programmed drums didn\u2019t, or couldn\u2019t. After that single immaculate take, Chamberlain returned to the control room, listened for about 30 seconds and said, \u201cThat sounds cool.\u201d He then set about making a drum loop to go along with the part he had just played. Within an hour or two, the track acquired shaker, tambourine and four flourish-filled runs on a full drum kit, just to give the production team some different options.Chamberlain is an elegant player; no movement is wasted. He plays with a traditional underhand grip, which is more often associated with jazz than rock. Sometimes, looking at him, you can\u2019t believe the range and sheer volume of sound he\u2019s producing. By 6:30 p.m., Chamberlain finished the second of the tracks Webb had sent to him and uploaded both to his Dropbox account to be accessed by the producers in England. Then he went home to make pasta with his wife.North Texas State (now the University of North Texas) accepted him into its music program on a scholarship, but he lasted less than a year. One of the percussion teachers threw a plastic piece of excrement at him while he was performing; another banged a gong in the middle of a piece and yelled, \u201cGo practice!\u201d It wasn\u2019t exactly the atmosphere he had imagined. \u201cI just wanted to play drums,\u201d he says. He didn\u2019t help matters by getting himself thrown out of his dorm for smoking pot. For a while he slept in his practice room with his head on the pillow in his kick drum.After he left school, Chamberlain moved to the Deep Ellum neighborhood of Dallas, about 40 miles away, where he played in several bands, often just for food or enough cash to put gas in his car. He eventually found himself living next door to Brad Houser, the bass player for Edie Brickell & New Bohemians, and after some problems with their original drummer during the recording of their first album, the band hired Chamberlain to tour with them. \u201cWhat I Am,\u201d the first single off \u201cShooting Rubberbands at the Stars,\u201d blew up so fast that his first major gig with the band outside Dallas was on \u201cSaturday Night Live.\u201d Chamberlain had just turned 21. He toured with Brickell for a couple of years and recorded a second record, \u201cGhost of a Dog,\u201d with the band, which broke up around the time Brickell married Paul Simon. (The band, without Chamberlain, has since reunited.)Chamberlain spent a summer touring with Pearl Jam, then returned to \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d as drummer for the house band \u2014 a job that for many musicians would be a career capper. TV gigs in general, and the \u201cS.N.L.\u201d gig in particular, offer the kind of steady, high-paying work that is pretty much impossible for musicians to find anywhere else. After a year, though, Chamberlain decided to move to Seattle. \u201cI had a whole house with a buddy of mine in a decent part of town, we could play music in it all day long and we each paid $250 rent,\u201d he told me, laughing. \u201cHow do you beat that?\u201dIn 1994, Chamberlain got a call from a little-known band called the Wallflowers, fronted by Bob Dylan\u2019s son Jakob. The band liked Chamberlain\u2019s drumming on \u201cGhost of a Dog\u201d and wondered if he\u2019d help them out in the studio. That work resulted in a single called \u201cOne Headlight\u201d that helped the band sell several million records. The Wallflowers\u2019 manager also represented a new and promising artist named Fiona Apple, and he asked if Chamberlain would play the drums for her too. Both albums \u201cdid really well,\u201d he told me, in characteristically understated fashion. \u201cSo that\u2019s kind of how you end up being a session musician. If you\u2019re not in a band, you\u2019re the guy who played on those records.\u201dChamberlain\u2019s network of producers and friends has continued to expand, and that\u2019s mostly how he gets his work. Over the last 15 years, he has played hundreds of sessions with some of music\u2019s biggest names, put out several side-project records and toured with Tori Amos and others whenever he could. A high-level studio musician in Los Angeles like Chamberlain can pull in as much as $2,000 for a day of work, though Chamberlain\u2019s rates fluctuate widely, depending on whom he\u2019s working with. He acknowledged that, with changes in the music business brought on by streaming and other technological innovations, \u201cthe herd is getting thinned\u201d in terms of the number of artists with sizable recording budgets. But demand for his services remains strong. In a poll to be published later this year, the readers of Modern Drummer have named him the best studio player in the business.Ryan Gruss, the Loop Loft\u2019s chief executive, showed me the sheet he had prepared for a previous session with the legendary drummer Omar Hakim, who has played for the likes of Michael Jackson, Madonna and Miles Davis. For Hakim, Gruss had typed out descriptions of beats and suggested tempos to go along with them, but there was no such list for Chamberlain. As an engineer got the kit sounding right in the control room, Chamberlain roamed over the drums and settled into a rhythm that Gruss liked. They set up a click track \u2014 a metronome that plays in Chamberlain\u2019s headphones \u2014 at the same tempo, then Chamberlain let loose for about five minutes, cycling through grooves, chorus feels, different patterns of the same basic beat.Over the next four hours, Chamberlain would roll through nine other grooves and five different setups, swapping out drums and cymbals in search of new sounds and textures. For one set of beats, he moved to the small \u201celectronic/analog kit\u201d and played it with Brazilian shakers instead of sticks. The 1900s snare with the calfskin head made an appearance and, somehow, sounded almost entirely synthetic and computerized, which Chamberlain hadn\u2019t anticipated. The Loop Loft team was happy just to sit back and watch, one of them muttering \u201cJesus\u201d under his breath whenever Chamberlain really let fly.\u201cI\u2019m a working musician,\u201d Chamberlain said to me at one point, with an emphasis on \u201cworking.\u201d Because he\u2019s not a songwriter or a member of a band, he doesn\u2019t get many residual checks or royalty payments \u2014 what musicians refer to as \u201cmailbox money.\u201d Even when times are good, he has to hustle. Sometimes he\u2019s in the studio with the Loop Loft; sometimes he\u2019s the guy Adele\u2019s producers call when she\u2019s writing in Los Angeles (for a track that didn\u2019t make her latest record); sometimes he\u2019s the guy the billionaire Paul Allen hires for a vanity rock project featuring, among other top-tier musicians, the Eagles guitarist Joe Walsh. (Sample song title: \u201cSix Strings From Hell.\u201d) Even on days off, Chamberlain goes into his studio and practices for a couple of hours.When the Loop Loft session was over, Chamberlain wandered in and out of the control room, packing up his gear for another recording stint with Keith Urban. This time the sessions would include the Welsh bassist Pino Palladino, one of the most respected players around. Instead of adding drums to a previously recorded track, Chamberlain would be playing live with Palladino in the studio. Chamberlain loves playing live above all else, for those moments when the music takes an inexplicable turn but somehow everybody stays together. No machine could match it. \u201cWith great musicians,\u201d he said, \u201cyou feel like you can\u2019t do anything wrong.\u201d \u2666A pop star claims a little time for herself.By Doreen St. F\u00e9lixMusical duets are usually ordered by heterosexual difference and its various dramas. As in: She gives, he takes. He pleads, she refuses. They may reconcile, but the performers always observe the classic sex distinction \u2014 making the circumstances of the female vocalist a good barometer for the circumstances of female speech in general.But Rihanna, pop\u2019s great maven of self-gratification, is a known loner, and she flouts that kind of reciprocal identity all the time. So it follows that even on her latest album\u2019s true duet, she would choose a vocal mirror, not a vocal foil. On \u201cConsideration,\u201d the first track on \u201cAnti,\u201d Rihanna and the genre-fluid singer SZA are two branches of the same river, braiding in and out. The women put on their respective versions of a placid attitude \u2014 Rihanna sings with cheek, SZA cheerlessly. Each is calm but, you suspect, coursing toward some possible furor. They sing into each other; their vocal registers match so closely that on first listen, you might even miss that Rihanna isn\u2019t singing by herself. The closeness approaches uncanny, suggests an erotics of the self. Rihanna\u2019s voice sinks into SZA\u2019s, which rises back into Rihanna\u2019s, the voices first crossing on these: \u201cWhy you ain\u2019t ever let me grow?/When I look outside my window/I can\u2019t get no peace of mind.\u201d If \u201dAnti\u201d has a thesis, it\u2019s this declaration of insolence.I almost used the usual expression \u2014 a \u201cdeclaration of independence.\u201d Then I remembered how secretive the two women sound, the complete disinterest the lyrics communicate. The way Rihanna likens herself to our most uncivil cultural child, Peter Pan: \u201cI came fluttering in from Neverland/Time can never stop me.\u201d I hear her indignation; I hear a clear defection from the typical girl-power conceit. \u201cConsideration\u201d could not care less about sounding like a feminist anthem in the proper way, one that telegraphs passive misandry in the service of forcing female communion. It\u2019s an anti-anthem, a song for the individual in a world full of cheap calls to solidarity \u2014 a misanthrope\u2019s chorus, built for people who would rather be alone, unseen and isolated from the work of being a girl. (\u201cWould you mind giving my reflection a break/from the pain it\u2019s feeling now?\u201d) Michael Jackson, long reviled for his identification with the boy Peter Pan, might have originated this kind of audacity, refusing to relate to society as much as society wanted to relate to him.Rihanna often returns to Barbados, the landmass that bore her. Like that island country, \u201cConsideration\u201d connects to nothing outside itself; it\u2019s a salve for those of us seeking mental and political quiet, an adult lullaby castigating the spectacle of public life. The song is haughtily against the \u201coutside\u201d; it invokes the private air of an enclosed room. I\u2019d like to stay inside, too, looking out the window, listening to the echo of my own voice. \u2666Riding a lo-fi sound to semifame.By John Wray\u201cI\u2019ll see discussions sometimes, on message boards online, about the sound I get from my guitar,\u201d Mac DeMarco said one overcast February afternoon as we drove around Far Rockaway, Queens. \u201cIt\u2019s kids, mostly, trying to figure it out: \u2018How does he get that freaky tone? What kind of pedals? What amp?\u2019\u201d He turned to me and grinned, showing the gap between his teeth. \u201cWhat they don\u2019t realize is that the guitar I\u2019ve played since I was 16 is a no-name piece of garbage that I bought at a pawnshop for about 30 bucks. It\u2019s got a loose neck, its pickup magnet is broken into tiny pieces and the pick guard is a piece of siding that I got from my Hasidic neighbor\u2019s house in Montreal.\u201d He laughed. \u201cFor a while there were bugs living in it. Actual bugs. It was cute.\u201dWe were driving along Rockaway Beach Boulevard in a borrowed car, because DeMarco\u2019s station wagon wouldn\u2019t start. At the owner\u2019s request, DeMarco was grading the CDs in the glove compartment with a pen: B+ for Morrissey, C- for Belle and Sebastian, an enthusiastic A+ for the Grateful Dead. \u201cMy life is stupid right now,\u201d he told me. \u201cI put a pair of my sneakers on eBay a while ago \u2014 partly to raise money for this girls\u2019 rock camp in Brooklyn, but mostly just as a joke \u2014 and some dude pushed the bidding up to 21 grand.\u201d He grinned again. \u201cIt turned out he didn\u2019t have the money, because he was, like, 13 years old. But that\u2019s still pretty sick.\u201dGiven the turn DeMarco\u2019s career has taken, his attitude of giddy disbelief makes perfect sense. In the course of four albums in as many years \u2014 \u201cRock and Roll Night Club,\u201d \u201c2,\u201d \u201cSalad Days\u201d and \u201cAnother One,\u201d all released by the pint-size Brooklyn label Captured Tracks \u2014 DeMarco has progressed from quasi squatter to bona fide indie-rock star, playing sold-out shows from New York to Los Angeles and basking in a degree of Internet fame that he finds hard to comprehend. In \u201cBacker,\u201d a bleakly hilarious clip, featuring none of his music whatsoever, DeMarco impersonates a depressed loser from Edmonton who guides cars into parking spots for a living. It has received around 400,000 views on YouTube. \u201cSalad Days,\u201d his 2014 breakout album, has been played more than five million times on YouTube, more than the Wu-Tang Clan album \u201cA Better Tomorrow,\u201d released the same year. DeMarco\u2019s brand of fame, however, is far from the rarefied, untouchable variety that stars like the RZA or Jack White enjoy: The more famous DeMarco gets, the more accessible he seems to become. \u201cKids think of me as a guy who\u2019d hang out with them and actually enjoy myself,\u201d he told me. \u201cAnd they\u2019re basically right.\u201dThe house he rents in Arverne, Queens, is an unprepossessing four-bedroom cottage in a lower-middle-class neighborhood, with cigarette butts peppering the lawn. When I rang his bell, he came to the door in boxers and a rumpled Hugo Boss T-shirt, greeted me with slightly bleary-eyed politeness, then led me past guitar cases and piles of laundry and a cluster of half-inflated party balloons to the kitchen, where Kiera McNally, his girlfriend of five years, was baking gluten-free banana bread. Over a cup of diner-style coffee \u2014 from an industrial steady-drip machine that DeMarco pointed out to me with pride \u2014 I asked what the repercussions of inviting hundreds of thousands of fans to his house had been.\u201cIt\u2019s cold outside now, so it isn\u2019t too bad,\u201d DeMarco said. \u201cRight after the EP came out, in August, we were averaging maybe 50 kids a day.\u201d He glanced toward McNally, who was diplomatically focusing on the banana bread. \u201cThe only thing that bugged me about it, personally, was the feeling I got that some of them hadn\u2019t even heard my music. I\u2019m basically a meme to a lot of these kids. It can get a bit weird.\u201dThe music DeMarco makes has been enthusiastically received by critics, but reviews of his albums can be frustrating to read: They tend to lean heavily on labels like \u201cslacker rock,\u201d \u201cchill wave\u201d and \u201cblue wave,\u201d to name only a few. \u201cWhat the hell does \u2018blue wave\u2019 even mean?\u201d DeMarco said. \u201cI have no idea.\u201dThe first song of his that I heard, \u201cBlue Boy,\u201d from \u201cSalad Days,\u201d is a bright, airy trifle, almost a lullaby, in which heartfelt advice to an insecure friend \u2014 \u201cNo use acting so tough/come down, sweetheart, and grow up\u201d \u2014 is subtly undercut by the ever-so-slightly camp vocals and even more so by the lead guitar, which seems to drift woozily in and out of tune. King Sunny Ade came to mind as I listened, as did Jerry Garcia, an acknowledged influence, but I found it nearly impossible to pin down the music I was hearing, or even to date it. Like many of DeMarco\u2019s best songs, \u201cBlue Boy\u201d sounds like the work of someone who spent his formative years combing through record-store bargain bins, carefully discarding anything that might conceivably be characterized as tasteful. It\u2019s an approach that has yielded dividends for musicians in the Internet age before \u2014 Washed Out comes to mind, as does Ariel Pink \u2014 but none of those artists\u2019 albums can claim five million YouTube plays.The family has musicians on both sides: a lyric soprano, a jazz saxophonist, an uncle who lives in London and sings standards. Agnes herself had a stint, as a teenager, singing at parties and weddings around Edmonton.At 16, Mac started recording songs in his room, by himself \u2014 the way he still records all his music \u2014 and playing in a band called Belgium with two friends from high school, Alec Meen and Peter Sagar. \u201cWe were trying to sound melodic and indie, like Pavement or Dinosaur Jr., even though all I knew how to play were Jeff Beck-style blues riffs,\u201d he told me. \u201cThey kept the band going after I moved to Vancouver, which was fine with me; it was pretty much their thing, anyway. I always hated the name Belgium.\u201dIn Vancouver, where he lived for a time in the boiler room of a printmaking studio for 200 Canadian dollars a month, DeMarco continued recording songs, posting them on Myspace under the name Makeout Videotape. \u201cThe first time you\u2019re out somewhere and some guy comes up to you and says: \u2018I heard that song you put up online. Pretty cool,\u2019 it\u2019s the weirdest thing,\u201d he told me, shaking his head. \u201cI got to be part of a scene that had started around this club called the Emergency Room, with bands who were already touring in the U.S. They were all these great, noisy, lo-fi bands, and I halfway fit in, mainly because I had no idea how to record. But I was trying to write Beatles songs the whole time.\u201dWhile performing at a music festival in Calgary, DeMarco reconnected with McNally, whom he knew in high school, and within the year they moved to Montreal together. \u201cWe had a hard time in Montreal,\u201d he told me. \u201cI worked the night shift at this cheap grocery store called Segal\u2019s, a 50-cents-for-a-wheel-of-brie kind of place.\u201d The job at Segal\u2019s, joyless though it was, provided a pivotal ingredient in his evolving aesthetic: a daily dose of schmaltzy classic rock. \u201cHearing that kind of music all the time \u2014 Dire Straits, Toto, Van Halen \u2014 it affected me,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can either embrace that stuff or let it drive you insane.\u201d He paused for a moment. \u201cTo tell you the truth, I\u2019m not a big Dire Straits fan, even now. But I found something in those songs that I could use.\u201dAfter a barely perceptible hesitation, he played the songs gently, sincerely and with a devotion and skill that were never entirely obscured by the grin on his face or the jokes he cracked. (\u201cA D.U.I.? I don\u2019t think so. I take a helicopter to work. I\u2019m Billy Joel!\u201d) Before his third and final song \u2014 \u201cStill Together,\u201d the closing track on \u201c2\u201d \u2014 he brought McNally out onstage to join him, beaming like a schoolboy, and kissed her lovingly but chastely on the cheek. I was reminded, watching them together, of something DeMarco told me on our drive. \u201cGrowing up in Edmonton, the horizon is so far away, you don\u2019t even realize it\u2019s there,\u201d he said. \u201cThis might all be over in six months, but there\u2019s nothing wrong with my life now. Not a thing.\u201d He nodded to himself for a moment. \u201cThe only thing I\u2019ve got to do is fix my car.\u201d \u2666Let\u2019s get it on. Or not.By Jia TolentinoCharlie Puth\u2019s brand is blandness: he\u2019s a pop star for the age of sponsored content. A fresh-faced, vanilla-flavored, Berklee-trained 24-year-old, Puth landed three singles on Top 40 radio in the year before he released his 2016 debut album, \u201cNine Track Mind.\u201d His style is marked by retro aesthetics and an almost haunting level of glibness, as encapsulated by his first single, the recent radio smash \u201cMarvin Gaye.\u201dYou may think you\u2019ve never heard \u201cMarvin Gaye,\u201d but it\u2019s possible you just haven\u2019t listened to it. It\u2019s a song that tends to register via alternate senses, a clamminess on the nape of your neck or a cloying taste, like children\u2019s cough syrup, in the back of your mouth. The platinum-selling doo-wop duet features the artist Meghan Trainor (who, like Puth, has thus far used her considerable songwriting talent to create songs so depthless they feel like waxworks).It\u2019s a song about sex that induces not lust but a feeling of desolation. \u201cLet\u2019s Marvin Gaye and get it on,\u201d sing Puth and Trainor brightly. \u201cYou got that healing that I want. Just like they say it in the song: until the dawn, let\u2019s Marvin Gaye and get it on.\u201dThe chorus feels like a bouncy castle inflated with hot air and ghosts, but in a technical sense, it\u2019s perfect. Its phrasing follows the classic AABA doo-wop format, and its four-chord progression (I, vi, IV, V) is emblematic of the genre: These are the ice-cream chords of \u201cHeart and Soul,\u201d \u201cBlue Moon\u201d and \u201cPlease Mr. Postman.\u201d Tweaked, the same progression can take on depth and winsomeness \u2014 with a 7th thrown in, you get \u201cUnchained Melody\u201d and with a 9th, \u201cEvery Breath You Take.\u201d But with the exception of a verse that has Trainor singing over a beat Puth describes (inaccurately) as a \u201chard-ass distorted 808\u201d drum machine, the track replicates the late \u201950s with unimaginative servility. Sonically, it lives a decade and a half before the song it\u2019s referencing; Marvin Gaye released \u201cLet\u2019s Get It On\u201d in 1973.In 1965, Gaye recalled to his biographer, he was listening to one of his songs playing on the radio when it was interrupted by a news bulletin about the riots in Watts. \u201cWith the world exploding around me, how am I supposed to keep singing love songs?\u201d No such scruples trouble Puth, who wrote his track as a \u201cmusical icebreaker,\u201d he told Billboard. \u201cIf you hear it on the radio or at a bar, it\u2019s a way to say: \u2018Hey! Let\u2019s Marvin Gaye and get it on.\u2019\u201d And so \u201cMarvin Gaye\u201d got its new use and meaning as a pickup line, dreamed up by an artist whose means is glibness and end is comfort, who can\u2019t imagine the fight that Gaye\u2019s love was built on, who sings about sex as if it\u2019s his due rather than a port of call in a storm. \u2666Who gets to say how black people see themselves?By Marlon James \u201cButterfly\u201d arrived at an unprecedented moment in pop. Black artists, as they conquered the mainstream, were getting even blacker. Kanye might have gotten there first (at least he probably thinks so) with \u201cNew Slaves\u201d and \u201cBlack Skinhead,\u201d and now even Beyonc\u00e9 is place-checking New Orleans and image-checking the Black Panthers. But Kanye was still speaking to the white gaze, the hatred and desire in it, and taking revenge by getting all black-sex-machine on somebody\u2019s white wife. \u201cButterfly\u201d is instead Toni Morrison circa \u201cSula\u201d: not looking outside for either validation or opposition. Black love, black empowerment, black history and black wisdom are explored so deeply and intelligently that you assume that conservative media fetish, black-on-black crime, will never show up. But then, in the third verse of \u201cThe Blacker the Berry,\u201d when Kendrick is waxing lyrical on Trayvon Martin\u2019s death, it does. All of a sudden \u201cBlacker\u201d becomes a song about black accountability while black men are being murdered and the implausible logic of slamming two ideas into the same thought. I was right there with him until that third verse.You can\u2019t be a hip-hop head and not be hit by \u201cThe Blacker the Berry.\u201d It brings the boom-bap from the get-go, dropping funk on the one, like an update of the drum break that opens NWA\u2019s album \u201cStraight Outta Compton.\u201d And even though I was tired of people\u2019s mapping anger onto blackness, Lamar\u2019s detonation of rage and wit was (and is) unmatched in hip-hop. He grabs at stereotypes as if they\u2019re slipping out of his fingers (\u201cMy hair is nappy,\u201d he says. \u201cMy nose is round and wide\u201d) and throws them right back at whoever would deploy them. He\u2019s not even rapping so much as spitting fire, jumping on a line, retracing it, firing it back at you, like the boxer Jack Johnson when he said: \u201cI\u2019m black, they never let me forget it. I\u2019m black, all right, I\u2019ll never let them forget it.\u201d Kendrick fuels his \u201cI\u2019m black\u201d with the knowledge that ain\u2019t a damn thing changed. He leaves it to the Jamaican DJ Assassin to bring backup in the chorus, drawing the line from plantation to street corner and the switch in who controls black self-determination, from the \u201cwhips left scars \u2019pon me back\u201d to the \u201cthe big whip parked \u2019pon the block.\u201dThe last couplet on the second verse echoes the first, with a crucial change: \u201cYou sabotage my community, makin\u2019 a killin\u2019/you made me a killer,\u201d turns into, \u201cHow can I tell you I\u2019m making a killin\u2019?/You made me a killer\u201d \u2014 and the different spin on \u201ckilling\u201d weighs a ton. In the first instance, exploitation and indifference make him a killer. In the second, his success comes from America\u2019s obsession with his assuming he looks like one. It was almost unbearable to anticipate what this prophet of rage was going to drop next.And then he dropped it.I could feel the verse pulling away from me as soon as he got halfway into it. It turned into call-and-response, me and this third verse, which went a little something like this:\u201cIt\u2019s funny how Zulu and Xhosa might go to war. ...Remind me of these Compton Crip gangs that live next door.\u201dMe: Hold up, K-dot, what is this you\u2019re dropping? No, dude, those are two nations going to war. And fine, war is hell, but if Britain and France aren\u2019t called thugs for Waterloo, if Lancaster and York aren\u2019t called bangers despite literally being family killing family, then why do Zulu vs. Xhosa get compared to gang warfare? Because it weakened them both in the face of the real enemy? Either all war is hell, or all war is thuggery. I\u2019m fine with either, but not with a special distinction when Africans do it.Kendrick continues:\u201cSo don\u2019t matter how much I say I like to preach with the PanthersOr tell Georgia State \u2018Marcus Garvey got all the answers\u2019Or try to celebrate February like it\u2019s my B-DayOr eat watermelon, chicken and Kool-Aid on weekdaysOr jump high enough to get Michael Jordan endorsementsOr watch BET cause urban support is importantSo why did I weep when Trayvon Martin was in the streetWhen gangbanging make me kill a nigga blacker than me?Hypocrite!\u201dMe: No, brother, no! Here was a black man invoking the detestable slogan of black-on-black crime to prevent himself from mourning the unjustifiable homicide of a black boy by a Neighborhood Watch vigilante. All I could think was: Where the hell was Kendrick going?\u201cWhat happened to [Michael Brown] should\u2019ve never happened,\u201d he said. \u201cNever. But when we don\u2019t have respect for ourselves, how do we expect them to respect us? It starts from within. Don\u2019t start with just a rally, don\u2019t start from looting. It starts from within.\u201dKendrick wasn\u2019t the first, and he won\u2019t be the last, to make the statement that black deaths are in some way blacks\u2019 fault and that black lives might be a matter of personal responsibility, right down to clothing choice. The idea that a sudden dose of self-respect is part of what is needed to stop the police from killing us is not only ludicrous \u2014 Amadou Diallo wasn\u2019t a gangbanger, but he was shot at 41 times anyway; I think we can assume that the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. had it all right within, but that didn\u2019t protect him from being brutalized by all sorts of authority, nor did his dressing impeccably prevent him from arrest \u2014 it is also old. It\u2019s a belief that the black person has a role to play in the erasure of hate toward herself. That kind of thinking almost suggests that racism makes sense.But racism makes no sense. It is perverse and aberrant yet such a constituent part of the American make up, so normalized in all its forms, that it\u2019s no surprise that the black person would scramble for answers as to why it exists. And in scrambling for answers, you look everywhere, even within: Did I do something to bring this on? Was a part of this outcome in even the slightest way my fault?Fact is, black people have always believed in respectability politics. It\u2019s also at the core of the non-American black\u2019s perspective on race, and I should know, because as a non-American black, I\u2019ve traded in that belief for years. It\u2019s particularly acute with us Jamaicans. Our stories are everywhere: How despite racism, or rather the black American\u2019s self-destructive perception of it, we worked hard to excel and gain respect. We achieved. Everybody knows how hard we Jamaicans work. That\u2019s why I have that job and you, black American, do not. Maybe you should stop whining about your troubles and own up to your laziness. Maybe if you do what I did, you would be manager of that Chase branch on the corner, just like me.Bootstrappism is the chocolate echo of white racism. You can find it in black self-help and how-I-became-a-millionaire books. Prince with \u201cAmerica,\u201d Ice Cube with \u201cLook Who\u2019s Burning.\u201d Lauryn Hill berating black girls who get hair weaves to look like Europeans. Nearly every time Steve Harvey addresses black people. President Barack Obama telling Morehouse College students at their 2013 commencement that there\u2019s \u201cno time for excuses,\u201d a lesson that the fact of their existence proved they didn\u2019t need. It\u2019s a road that leads to the granddaddy of the bootstrap, Bill Cosby, who declared in a 2004 speech that black kids were being shot because they were going around stealing Coca-Cola and poundcake.But Kendrick\u2019s conclusion is far more sophisticated than anything Cosby has ever said. In fact, it\u2019s not a conclusion at all. It was Kendrick doing what he does better than anybody else: complicating a discussion at exactly the point where everybody, including me, tries to simplify it. And this is what he was aiming for all along, questioning what even many black people would never dare question, arguing that yes, every argument, even this one, has two sides. More sides. Adding layers we might need but don\u2019t want. And that\u2019s what he did next, not on wax, but on MTV.\u201cKnow who I am first,\u201d he said. And then he said more than that:\u201cWhen I say, \u2018Gangbanging made me kill a nigga blacker than me,\u2019 this is my life that I\u2019m talking about. I\u2019m not saying you; you might not even be from the streets. I\u2019m not speaking to the community, I\u2019m not speaking of the community,\u201d he continued. \u201cI am the community.\u201dFast-forward to near the end of 2015, and I\u2019m on a flight to New York. Thirty thousand feet above everything, I put on \u201cButterfly,\u201d and something that never happened before happens. This incredible clarity, as if I\u2019d been listening to the soul brother all year but only now was finally hearing him. And then I got to that song, No. 13, the sticking point, the one reason I hadn\u2019t been able to join the best-of-the-year showering of praise, and I realized something that felt sudden yet inevitable. That this song, with its booming beat, the loudest on the record, that seemed to herald it as some global political statement, was in fact Kendrick\u2019s most deeply personal. Almost implosive. That the moment wasn\u2019t about we at all, it just sounded that way. It\u2019s his most \u201cI\u201d moment, reflecting a reality that I couldn\u2019t possibly connect to, only witness and try to understand. It\u2019s as personal as Ice Cube\u2019s \u201cDead Homiez.\u201d He\u2019s not speaking to the community or for the community. He\u2019s speaking for himself or, rather, a version of himself. The smarter me looked in the mirror and asked: \u201cWell, who\u2019s the one playing representational politics here? Who is the one expecting the black man to be Everyman, black man to reflect the universal good will, or at the very least a carefully curated black rage directed at a carefully identified target?\u201dHip-hop has always been about spinning clever fictions, doing what great narratives do: inventing stories that tell the real truth. But post-Biggie and Tupac, it\u2019s so easy to fall hard for hip-hop\u2019s insistence on keeping it real that I\u2019m surprised how easily I still fall for it, thinking that \u201cButterfly\u201d is either confessional or reportage, when it\u2019s neither. We do this over and over, judging artists of color based on a warped idea that legitimacy can come only from experience. You would think I would know better, given that as a novelist, I deal with the same assumption in nearly every interview. One journalist even congratulated me for escaping the ghetto through \u201cthe power of the pen and not the gun.\u201dMy last novel was about Jamaican gang members manipulated by politicians into an attempt on Bob Marley\u2019s life. Young men, murderers before 15, murdered before 18. Nearly everybody assumed that I had experienced some of this. In fact, the first time I heard a live gunshot was watching Martin McDonagh\u2019s play \u201cA Behanding in Spokane.\u201d And once each interviewer was convinced that there was no blood on my hands, then came the skepticism, the disbelief, the doubting: By what authority was I telling these stories? As if knowledge, talent and imagination weren\u2019t enough for a writer of color to make art; as if a work of art can\u2019t be personal and fictitious at the same time, invented and meaningful.And here I was doing the same thing to Kendrick. He was just a man wondering how someone gets to be part of the Black Lives Matter conversation when black lives don\u2019t matter to him. How someone can feel rage at murder while being fine with suicide. He was exploring these themes as concepts \u2014 you know, that thing that artists do. He was posing tricky, difficult questions, for which there were no answers, getting into the middle of his song, feeling it, breathing it, but still inventing. I wonder how much of what I thought my problem was with \u201cThe Blacker the Berry\u201d stemmed from me doing what is still being done to me: Questioning the black gaze, assuming that it must have sprung from something other than the storyteller\u2019s gift. That it must be autobiography or documentary. I\u2019ve never listened to Radiohead\u2019s \u201cA Wolf at the Door\u201d and wondered if Thom Yorke ever paid ransom money for his kidnapped children. Or thought Johnny Cash ever murdered anybody or knew anyone who did. Just like those songs, \u201cThe Blacker the Berry\u201d is several things at once, but mostly, at its essence, it\u2019s just that thing we call art. \u2666Rap and politics, inseparable as ever.By Bijan StephenRap is rooted as much in place and time as it is in rhythm and bass; it\u2019s hyperlocal and organic, if not always cage-free. (Free Max B!) You can tell a song\u2019s provenance from its sound; you can hear what was happening when the record was pressed. A cultural ferment, frozen in amber.Killer Mike & El-P, a.k.a. Run the Jewels, continue to push boundaries with their latest music video. Watch it in virtual reality. Download our NYT VR app.Earlier on the album, on \u201cClose Your Eyes,\u201d Killer Mike, El-P and Zack de la Rocha \u2014 former frontman of Rage Against the Machine \u2014 rap about a prison riot. Listening makes the blood rush to your cheeks, your heartbeat pulse behind your eyes. The value of the album is held between those two songs: It captures the variegated sides of black life in America and its specific feeling, a dizzying mix of frustrated helplessness and joyous survival.Perhaps it\u2019s not surprising that the group\u2019s aesthetic choices are very Public Enemy, which is to say, pretty \u201cretro.\u201d Public Enemy was among the first acts to grasp that for all its durability as an art form, rap is inescapably tied to the black experience. It\u2019s always political, because to live as a black person in America is to be politicized. Run the Jewels gets this. If you listen closely, through their artful grandstanding, you can hear a radical politics. Which is another way of saying the truth; listen, and hear the world change. \u2666A sound like the music on a holistic-medicine website \u2014 but cool.By Max ReadIt used to be, if you wanted to vibrate at the same frequency as the Mayan spacemen, you needed to move to a Southwestern city that specialized in horse art. It used to be, if you wanted your aura photographed, you had to go to a cramped Chinatown crystal shop. These days, there\u2019s a boutique around the corner from my apartment in Brooklyn with a pop-up aura-photography tepee. On a whim, I went to have my aura\u2019s picture taken, only to learn the photographer was fully booked days in advance. New Age is back, and turning up where you wouldn\u2019t have expected it a few years ago \u2014 in places where the young and culturally sophisticated congregate. Places that are, for lack of a better word, hip.It used to be, if you bought an album from a small Vancouver electronic-music label, you could expect some kind of weird minimal techno. These days? You get CFCF\u2019s \u201cThe Colours of Life,\u201d a 40-minute instrumental suite that layers airy synths, noodling guitars, marimbas and, God help us, panpipes over simple, propulsive rhythms. You could talk about it in terms of record-nerd touchstones \u2014 \u201cThe Colours of Life\u201d sounds a bit like the minimalist composer Steve Reich in places, or the Krautrock god Manuel G\u00f6ttsching in others \u2014 but really, it sounds as if it should be advertised on basic cable with stock footage of candles. Or like a cassette tape you would buy from a bookstore with an entire section devoted to \u201cAngels.\u201d Or like seduction music played by a barefoot European man with a soul patch. Do you catch my drift? It\u2019s cool, but it sounds as if it were recorded using a dreamcatcher as a pop filter. It sounds like the music for a 40-minute director\u2019s cut of an airline commercial. It sounds like a poster of a wolf. It sounds like a hologram sticker of a dolphin. It sounds like a tattoo of an open eye. It sounds like the font Papyrus. It\u2019s also really, really good.The assumption always seems to be that the New Age revival is weird, if not insincere in some unspecified, \u201cironic\u201d way. Why would urban-dwelling gentrified-Brooklyn types embrace the atavistic philosophies of conspiracy theorists and mononymous zither players? One answer is that this is how cool works: Things that used to be uncool become cool, and vice versa.But I think maybe it\u2019s the wrong question in the first place. We live in an age of aggressive positivism, a world overtaken by metrics and markets. To accuse New Age revivalism of insincerity \u2014 reducing the possibilities of belief to a binary \u2014 is to miss the point. The gentle woo-woo spirituality of New Age is attractive because it refuses the grinding realities of life spent in the shadow of Wall Street and Hollywood and Silicon Valley. Why wouldn\u2019t people overwhelmed by a slick and well-capitalized culture machine seek their pleasure in something defiantly corny? You can lie, and you can cook the books, but you can\u2019t fake a vibe. If a 40-minute New Age symphony can make you feel good \u2014 instead of harried or judged or pandered to \u2014 why should you care that it sounds like the soundtrack to a 1980s nature documentary? \u2666Is Coldplay bland? The future won\u2019t care.By Jeremy GordonA band that signs up to play the Super Bowl halftime show is making a declaration of immense confidence in its ability to hold a spotlight. It would seem contradictory for that band to then immediately cede that spotlight, but that\u2019s just what Coldplay did. They were contracted as the headliners at this year\u2019s game, but they wisely let Beyonc\u00e9 and Bruno Mars \u2014 both infinitely more charismatic \u2014 take control. As those two stars hit the stage, ready to trade hits and dance moves, the band\u2019s singer, Chris Martin, clung to the background, as if worried he might burst into flames if everyone appeared in the same frame.Coldplay\u2019s deference masks a steady success: For nearly two decades, they\u2019ve written a great many memorable songs, combining earnest Hallmark sentiments with anthemic melodies, worming their way into impressionable hearts and onto the charts. They\u2019re successors to U2, another band that crystallized the ineffable grandeur of the human experience into countless four-minute, radio-ready rock songs. Millions of Super Bowl viewers knew what it meant when Martin sat down at his piano, preparing to bang out the opening chords to \u201cClocks.\u201d As the rapper Future put it in a widely circulated tweet: \u201c#Coldplay legendary forever.\u201dThis brand of wide-screen pop attracts easy put-downs: edgeless, corny, white. But music has never lacked anodyne cornballs who didn\u2019t get their props until years later. Phil Collins used to symbolize the worst of slick \u201980s excess, but over time he has been recognized for his pop craftsmanship and technical innovations (especially the big drum sounds \u2014 you know, that fill in the middle of \u201cIn the Air Tonight\u201d \u2014 that blew a million rappers\u2019 minds). Jokes about how mawkish he seemed in the \u201980s are increasingly irrelevant to young people, who can care only so much about what anything seemed like before they were born.This is likely to be Coldplay\u2019s trajectory, too. Like Phil Collins, Michael McDonald, Abba or any number of desperately unhip artists, their \u201cimage\u201d will evaporate, while their songs will weather the years. In 2009, the Brooklyn band Grizzly Bear conscripted McDonald to sing a version of one of their singles, \u201cWhile You Wait for the Others,\u201d at the peak of their own rarified cool. Chris Martin might be asked to fill a similar role for tomorrow\u2019s Grizzly Bear. Imagine it: Sincerity will once again be on its way out of music, only for a familiar and tender voice to ring throughout the future blogosphere. Because when it\u2019s no longer certain what\u2019s cool, what will be more comforting than an elder statesman who never worried about it to begin with?A few weeks before the Super Bowl, Coldplay and Beyonc\u00e9 released a music video for \u201cHymn for the Weekend,\u201d a collaboration from the band\u2019s most recent and potentially final album. High-profile pop songs like this are conceived as nothing less than events, ready to be performed at mega-happenings like the Super Bowl halftime show. The actual Super Bowl halftime show featured both Coldplay and Beyonc\u00e9 but not the song. Martin said \u201cHymn\u201d was too new and wouldn\u2019t have been \u201cquite right.\u201dWhat his audience wanted was the warmth of familiarity. They wanted \u201cClocks.\u201d The live performance would have been an event, but Martin knows there will be plenty of opportunities in the future. The band is built to endure. \u2666Jeremy Gordon is deputy news editor for Pitchfork.Yes, darling, but is it feminist?By Jamie Lauren KeilesAs good-and-evil Christian morality falls out of fashion among the women in my social universe, a new binary has arisen to organize our outlook. In the heavens, there is all that is feminist: Beyonc\u00e9 singles, the selfie, menstruation ads on the subway and the dream of a woman in the White House. In hell, there is everything else. There are no nonbelievers, and there is no limbo. As new things come into being, we sort them accordingly by asking ourselves, \u201cIs this feminist?\u201dBy June 2015, Fetty Wap\u2019s \u201cTrap Queen\u201d had already claimed its place as the hot song of the summer. Beyond just the pleasures of a classic party anthem \u2014 an infectious hook, synth chords to ramp up your heart rate \u2014 the song offers an American love story for the ages. Fetty is a drug dealer weak-kneed for the girl who can match his hustle. When he cooks crack, she cooks crack with him. When he dreams of Lamborghinis, he dreams in matching pairs. Fetty\u2019s queen doesn\u2019t ride in the passenger seat. The couple make money together, and they spend it together too \u2014 at strip clubs, on weed, on gifts for each other. It\u2019s a vision of a love we can believe in, even outside the dreamland bubble of a rom-com plot. What could be more romantic than two equals teaming up to build their fantasy in a difficult and unjust world?For a summer, \u201cTrap Queen\u201d was everywhere. It would ultimately spend 25 weeks in Billboard\u2019s Top 3. We sang about cooking crack with our babies in the aisles of Duane Reade and on the dance floors of bat mitzvahs. Like Fetty himself, we landed seasonal crushes with \u201cHey, what\u2019s up? Hello!\u201d as our deceptively simple opening line. Rattling trap snares drowned out the sound of ice-cream-truck jingles, and summertime was better for it. But eventually it came time to ask the inevitable: Is \u201cTrap Queen\u201d feminist?I wonder about the purpose of this exercise. Why, in order for \u201cTrap Queen\u201d to be good, must we find a way to wedge it inside the narrow boundaries of white women\u2019s feminism? Is it not good enough on its own? Feminism and \u201cTrap Queen\u201d both spent the last year exploding ever further into the mainstream, and in both cases, we\u2019re still struggling to nail down exactly what they mean. Is the gutted, feel-good pop feminism of that Bustle post the same one that moves a panel of black women to declare Fetty Wap a feminist? Or perhaps the more important question is this: If \u201cTrap Queen\u201d is declared feminist in one system, does it suddenly belong to all feminists, regardless of race, of class or of circumstance?In the year that conversations about identity finally entered the small-talk realm of white folks, we seem to have lost sight of the fact that not everything is created for us \u2014 not even all feminist things. Identity politics is not always about identifying. \u201cTrap Queen\u201d is an immaculate song \u2014 a compelling love story and a true club banger. Perhaps, in the future, we can find a way to say so without needing to claim it for ourselves. \u2666A magnificently cheesy ballad that we\u2019ll never stop listening to.By Jody RosenLionel Richie\u2019s \u201cHello\u201d begins discreetly, almost sneakily, floating a sour little synthesizer melody over tiptoeing piano chords. The song crept into the collective consciousness in similarly stealthy fashion. It arrived in late 1983, buried on Richie\u2019s \u201cCan\u2019t Slow Down,\u201d the second solo album by the former Commodores singer. Reviewers took little notice of \u201dHello\u201d; Richie was ambivalent, cutting the song from \u201cCan\u2019t Slow Down\u201d at one point during the recording sessions before reinstating it. But when \u201cHello\u201d was released as a single in February 1984, it shot to No.1 on Billboard\u2019s Hot 100 and topped charts across the globe.In the decades since, \u201cHello\u201d has never said goodbye. It\u2019s one of those adult-contemporary ballads that has taken up residency in the ether, seeping from the walls of dentists\u2019 offices and tinkling on the phone line while you await a customer-service representative. It\u2019s a song, in other words, that has been judged soothing and innocuous enough to serve as Muzak \u2014 not necessarily an insult, but definitely a misapprehension of the fearsome beast that \u201cHello\u201d is. The song\u2019s narrator is a lovelorn weirdo who is both hapless \u2014 \u201cTell me how to win your heart/For I haven\u2019t got a clue/But let me start by saying/\u2018I love you\u2019\u201d \u2014 and vaguely sinister. The refrain, \u201cHello? Is it me you\u2019re looking for?\u201d sounds benign, but in the video, a dazed-looking Richie stalks the halls of an art school, mooning over a blind sculptor at least 15 years his junior.The revival of \u201dHello\u201d is a curiosity \u2014 a piece of pop flotsam borne back into the mainstream by the Internet\u2019s swirling surf. But it\u2019s also a testament to the magnetism of Lionel Richie, 66, a more durable presence, and a finer musician, than many have cared to admit. The meme-ing of \u201dHello\u201d has coincided with a wider Richie resurgence. \u201cTuskegee\u201d (2012), Richie\u2019s 10th studio album, was a surprise hit that paired the singer with country stars in new renditions of \u201dEasy,\u201d \u201cSay You, Say Me\u201d and other chestnuts. Richie has spent several years barnstorming arenas, quietly re-emerging as a top-grossing touring act. Last June, he played the Glastonbury music festival in England, drawing raves and a crowd of nearly 200,000, the festival\u2019s largest.Back in the \u201980s, I had mixed feelings about Richie: affection for his inescapable hits and regard for his craftsmanship, tinged with disdain I had absorbed from rock critics. He had been the Commodores\u2019 resident softy, the maudlin voice of \u201cThree Times a Lady,\u201d almost too genteel for the band\u2019s tame brand of funk-soul. Critics offered respect, but scorn leaked through: \u201cunctuous,\u201d \u201cmilquetoast,\u201d \u201cwhite-bread.\u201d The bottom line: Richie was talented, but too slight and sappy to be taken seriously.Today he stands as the biggest \u201980s pop star who is not quite canonized. He has sold tens of millions of records worldwide, most of them in the \u201980s, when he strode lofty heights alongside Michael Jackson, Madonna and Prince. But Richie couldn\u2019t match the charisma of those dynamos, and unlike all of them, he has gotten nowhere near the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. The industry celebrates his hit-making: There was an all-star Richie tribute at last month\u2019s Grammys. Still, the highest sort of esteem is denied him.A reappraisal may be in order. What hits me hardest is the robust beauty of Richie\u2019s voice \u2014 a smooth baritone roughened by hints of grit \u2014 and the casual virtuosity with which he puts it to use. Listen to the 1981 Diana Ross duet \u201cEndless Love,\u201d in which Richie enfolds his partner\u2019s rather colorless singing in plush, precise harmony vocals, airlifting the song to its rightful place: the honeymoon suite of a very posh hotel. That mix of understated and overwrought is pure Richie. He deploys one of pop\u2019s subtlest skill sets in the service of ferociously corny songs.The miracle is that Richie makes such sentiments stick. Credit his melodic gift and his knack for arrangements that wash over listeners in cresting, tumbling waves. \u201cHello\u201d is typical, with stately verses that open into a wind-whipped chorus. When the song rears up into its final refrain (\u201c\u2019Cause I wonder where you are ... \u201c), the effect is that of a unicorn rising on its hind legs, mane flashing, to meet the purple dawn.In short, Richie is a great singer-songwriter and a world-historical cheeseball. A century-plus of pop history has not erased the squeamishness we feel when faced with ballads like Richie\u2019s. Today\u2019s music critics have largely abandoned old snobberies, embracing commercial pop in all its gaudy splendor. Yet songs like \u201cHello\u201d remain for many a bridge too far, a musical pleasure we still take with a side helping of guilt.But pop culture has evolved a nifty system, allowing us to luxuriate in music we pretend to hold at arm\u2019s length. The campy karaoke performance, the TV comedy sketch, the \u201cRickroll\u201d \u2014 these bring songs back to us under the cover of irony. It\u2019s canon-making, 2016 style: We mock-venerate old records as kitsch and, lo and behold, they get inscribed in the Celestial Songbook.Richie knows how this game is played \u2014 how to laugh at himself, politely, and all the way to the bank. Last fall, he appeared on \u201cThe Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon,\u201d or rather, his disembodied head did: Richie played the role of the Lionel Richie bust, duetting with Fallon in a \u201cHello\u201d spoof. When Richie performs, though, the irony melts away.That\u2019s what happened at Glastonbury, where a crowd of mostly white rock fans greeted Richie in high tongue-in-cheek mode, waving banners with slogans lifted from memes. But when the opening strains of \u201dHello\u201d sounded, the throng erupted, joining Richie in a singalong as joyously cathartic as any you will hear. Suddenly, \u201cHello\u201d wasn\u2019t a tacky \u201980s artifact \u2014 the song was a communal hearth fire, casting a rosy glow over 200,000 souls. It was an example of pop\u2019s mysterious sorcery, the way that certain alchemical blends of music and words strike us right in the gut, circumnavigating our high-minded aesthetic ideals and studied postures. It was a reminder that some of the most powerful songs are the most gauche, scrambling together beauty and vulgarity, exquisite craftsmanship and appalling taste, exalted chivalric love-oaths and the queasy come-ons of a dork with a mullet. As for that Clay Head From the Lionel Richie \u201cHello\u201d Video: It works equally well as a platter for your cream-cheese dip and a bust on pop\u2019s Mount Rushmore. \u2666The master producer opens up his workshop.Photographs by JRA \u2018classical\u2019 musician with legions of unclassical admirers \u2014 including Kanye West.By Mark LevineA few years ago, Shaw, then 30, shocked the classical-music world by becoming the youngest-ever winner of a Pulitzer Prize in music. Shaw won for a piece she wrote for the cultish vocal group Roomful of Teeth, which specializes in otherworldly sounds that hardly suggest the word \u201cclassical,\u201d and which she is a member of. In swift fashion, Shaw emerged as the face of a flourishing scene of young composers \u2014 people like Nico Muhly, Gabriel Kahane and Missy Mazzoli \u2014 who were blurring the lines between classical and indie music. For the previous month or two, raw video footage from a fund-raiser held by the Democratic National Committee in San Francisco, and attended by President Obama, had been circulating online, showing Shaw singing a long, hypnotic, wordless introduction to Kanye West\u2019s performance of his song \u201cPower.\u201dIn Iowa, Shaw came onstage and sat cross-legged on her chair among the string players. Small and pixieish, she could easily have passed for a college student. She prefaced her work \u201cBy & By,\u201d a setting of three gospel songs, by saying that she was hoping to restore some authenticity to commercialized old-time music, and then began singing in an unadorned, incantatory alto shaded with both sorrow and fervor. Her slow, ribbonlike phrases, hovering just this side of harmonic resolution, might have risen from the Middle Ages as much as from the middle of Appalachia. The players plucked their instruments with picks, banjo-style, and occasionally broke into odd, agitated strumming or sawed away at their strings with the wooden part of the bow. Shaw and JACK could seem to be drifting into different songs, Shaw\u2019s vocals lost in plaintiveness while the quartet fought through bouts of improvisatory chaos. But the strewn-out pieces of sound kept finding their way back to one another. For all the hints of disruptiveness in the music, this was crowd-pleasing stuff, and the young members of the audience responded with shouts.Not long after the concert, Shaw and I struck up a phone and email correspondence. She grew up in Greenville, N.C., where her mother, a violin teacher, started her on the instrument at 2. \u201cI was a straight-up suburban Suzuki kid,\u201d she told me, reared on a strict diet of classical music. \u201cI lived under a rock for many years.\u201d She went to Rice University to study violin, then moved on to Yale for a master\u2019s in performance. While there, she sang in church choirs for $15 an hour to help pay the bills and got a job as an accompanist for dance classes, work that required her to improvise music on demand for a variety of rhythms, tempos and styles of movement. \u201cIf you\u2019re a good accompanist,\u201d she says, \u201cno one notices you. It\u2019s a way of making music to serve something that\u2019s larger than you, but something that\u2019s very human and simple, which is dance.\u201dAfter Yale, she moved to New York and gravitated toward the edges of the classical-music scene. She played a lot of thorny contemporary music, which often left her yearning for the full-bodied pleasures of traditional harmony, and which set her to wondering what she might have done differently had she written the score herself. She had also developed into a specialist in Baroque violin and sang early music in the choir of Trinity Church in Lower Manhattan. In 2009, she heard about an a cappella group that was being put together to explore vocal practices rarely found in standard classical music. \u201cIt was a gig, yes, but what a crazy adventure to learn things like throat singing and yodeling,\u201d she says.That summer, the group, Roomful of Teeth, met for the first time in a three-week residency at Mass MoCA, the contemporary art museum in North Adams, Mass. The eight young members settled in to study with a master throat singer from Tuva, a region of southern Siberia. The group\u2019s director, Brad Wells, invited them to write music for their first performance. Shaw worked late into the night after each day\u2019s rehearsal, \u201ctrying out these chords,\u201d as she puts it, \u201cand moving things around. I had it in my mind that I wanted to hear a mass of people talking, saying things that didn\u2019t have any particular content. Then I wanted to hear the talk break down into a guttural sound, \u2018vocal fry,\u2019 with no words, just vowels \u2014 the kind of thing kids do, just play with sound. And then I wanted to hear that strange sound turn into a big, beautiful chord, sung by all eight of us, a split second later.\u201dAfter 10 days, Shaw had a draft of a piece, \u201cPassacaglia,\u201d to take to rehearsal. It gave the group a chance to practice some of the effects they had been working on, like the lawnmowerish textures of throat singing and the sudden transition between head and chest voice that characterizes yodeling. There was a spoken text \u2014 from \u201cWall Drawing 305,\u201d by Sol LeWitt, on display at Mass MoCA \u2014 which, torn from context, came across as surreal and vaguely menacing. The work\u2019s opening harmonies, though, were straight from classical tradition. The audience at the first concert cheered and applauded when the swarming, crackling sounds of the vocal meltdown in \u201cPassacaglia\u201d resolved, suddenly and triumphantly, by returning to the piece\u2019s opening D-major chord.The following two summers, Roomful of Teeth returned to Mass MoCA, and Shaw wrote three more pieces, which she put together as a four-movement work called \u201cPartita for Eight Voices.\u201d The range of vocalizations expanded to include whispers, sighs, grunts, gasps, murmurs, whoops, heavy breathing. For a work written by a relative novice, \u201cPartita\u201d bristled with assurance. On a lark, Shaw wrote a check for $50 and submitted \u201cPartita\u201d to the Pulitzer committee, thinking it a useful way to get the high-profile judges to listen to Roomful of Teeth. She was walking along the Hudson on a spring afternoon when a friend called to tell her she had won the prize. Nine months later, Roomful of Teeth, which had mounted a Kickstarter campaign to help finance its first recording, which included \u201cPartita,\u201d won a Grammy. The group now has bookings for close to 75 performances this year.Last May, Kanye West heard Roomful of Teeth perform \u201cPartita for Eight Voices\u201d at Walt Disney Concert Hall in Los Angeles and came backstage afterward to meet the group. \u201cHe just seemed like someone who is honestly curious and interested in finding something new,\u201d Shaw recalls. \u201cWe exchanged phone numbers and started talking.\u201d West asked Shaw to produce a new version of his song \u201cSay You Will,\u201d a track from his 2008 album \u201c808s & Heartbreak.\u201d \u201cThere was no assignment given,\u201d Shaw says. \u201cI just did what I wanted to, and he really liked it.\u201d West released the remix on SoundCloud and added Shaw to the legion of collaborators on his new project, \u201cThe Life of Pablo,\u201d bringing her to Los Angeles for three weeks of studio work. She ended up co-writing, co-producing or contributing vocals to several songs.\u201cI\u2019m not really allowed to talk about it,\u201d Shaw told me. But she went on: \u201cThe work was really fun. It was like being given an amazing coloring book and being told to use all your crayons, use your paint and scissors, anything at all.\u201d At first, Shaw had little familiarity with West\u2019s music. She recognized an affinity, though. \u201cEverything is tightly, tightly controlled, held back, held onto. And then the moment comes and it just breaks out, everything explodes.\u201d Shaw paused seriously for a moment, then laughed. \u201cI kinda love that.\u201d \u2666\u2018Mr. Worldwide\u2019 speaks in pan-Caribbean code.By Julianne Escobedo ShepherdThere\u2019s a reason Pitbull christened himself \u201cMr. Worldwide\u201d: The bombastic party rapper is a global phenomenon. He also tends to be served a global helping of ire. In February, he closed out the Grammy Awards with his reggaeton single \u201cEl Taxi,\u201d in a slot normally reserved for rock music (and, occasionally, rock-rap hybrids); by the song\u2019s end, several Twitter users, including the \u201cBroad City\u201d comedy writer Chris Kelly, had likened the performance to the Zika virus.Jamaica and Cuba have enjoyed a friendly relationship since the early 1970s, when the former lobbied the Organization of American States in support of the latter. More important, though, there\u2019s Miami, the spiritual home of the \u201cEl Taxi\u201d sensibilities \u2014 where Caribbean immigrants have for decades melded and commingled culture and influence, with itinerant communities cross-pollinating and building off one another. Chaka Demus certainly approved of \u201cEl Taxi\u201d building on his original, \u201cthe biggest dancehall song of all time,\u201d as he told The Jamaica Star. (Besides, he said, \u201cI have lost track of the amount of persons who have copied the song already.\u201d)Diasporas live and thrive in these sonic interchanges, which work almost like a code among the communities that create them \u2014 a point of conversation among very different peoples whom the mainstream holds equally at arm\u2019s length. Pitbull described himself, in a 2015 Billboard interview, as \u201cthe epitome of the American dream, the underdog, the fighter, the forever hungry, forever appreciative.\u201d Some may be reasonably allergic to the strobe-light pulse of his Miami party zone. But every beat clearly illustrates the way immigrants have learned to flip that disdain to their advantage. \u2666The return of perfectly imperfect soul.By Amanda PetrusichThe R.&B. singer D\u2019Angelo once took a 14-year retreat from his public. After a tour for the 2000 platinum-selling \u201cVoodoo\u201d \u2014 during which grown women were reportedly shrieking, nightly, for D\u2019Angelo to reveal his carved abdomen, then so acutely defined that it seemed unreal, phantasmagoric \u2014 he split, using booze, drugs and solitude to numb his disappointment with a business that seemed to have everything backward. \u201cI\u2019m going to go in the woods, drink some hooch, grow a beard and get fat,\u201d is how he put it to his friend and collaborator Questlove.The decade-plus of pop music that D\u2019Angelo sat out was driven, in large part, by neurotic precision. Some of this is surely attributable to the Swedish superproducer Max Martin, who favors a punchy, airless, symmetrical approach to rhythm. You hit the beat and hit it squarely. Martin\u2019s aesthetic is ubiquitous \u2014 he has worked with Taylor Swift, Katy Perry, Adele, Maroon 5 and dozens of others \u2014 and doesn\u2019t allow for much creative meandering. In the Martin era, so much pop music has been violent in its fastidiousness: no stumbling, no retreat, no lackadaisical exhalations.It\u2019s not that \u201cReally Love\u201d is muddy or inexact \u2014 although by Martin\u2019s yardstick, it probably is \u2014 but that it\u2019s gentle, unstressed, forgiving of itself. This is not so unusual in R.&B. and soul, formative genres for D\u2019Angelo, but it has become anomalous within pop. While a listener might find it easier, at first, to holler along with a more fastidious singer like Taylor Swift (It is extraordinarily satisfying! Shouting each fixed syllable! Participating in the one! And only! Way! The song! Allows for!), D\u2019Angelo\u2019s vocal performance encourages something softer and less preordained. Even the few seconds of gritty crackle included at the end \u2014 a turntable\u2019s needle jerking into a run-out groove \u2014 suggest a way to quiet the mind, let the edges blur a little, like when you accidentally fall asleep in a poolside chaise, drink still in hand. It is hard, now, not to read D\u2019Angelo\u2019s departure as a reiteration of a creative ethos, writ larger; slowness, here, is not ignoble or archaic. It feels, instead, like a subversive act: a revolution of patience. \u2666From a jailed star, a soundtrack for Jamaica\u2019s cynical politics.By Miriam MarkowitzThat is, the party\u2019s political opposition, the Jamaica Labour Party, was too weak to have committed the crime. Riffing on another line from \u201cWeh Dem Feel Like,\u201d Vaz exhorted his listeners to \u201cload up the guns,\u201d before a D.J. played a few bars of the song. In newspapers for days afterward, politicians and private citizens denounced Vaz for his carelessness: On the eve of an election, a time when Jamaica\u2019s fragile political peace has historically been rived by violence, Vaz had channeled the menace of Vybz Kartel.Jailed on suspicion of murder in 2011 and convicted in 2014, Kartel is Jamaica\u2019s pre-eminent entertainer and a quandary for the political class, which has long defined itself in opposition to the nation\u2019s popular music \u2014 first reggae and now dancehall, its rude, raucous up-tempo successor. Jamaican artists like Buju Banton, Bounty Killer and Beenie Man popularized dancehall abroad in the \u201990s, and later crossover stars like Sean Paul and Shaggy scored stateside hits with \u201cGimme the Light\u201d and \u201cBoombastic.\u201d But dancehall\u2019s influence is even more profound, having grown from an indigenous genre into the ghost in the pop-music machine. It seeded the evolution of rap, drum and bass and electronic dance music, and has infiltrated American pop from Justin Bieber to Beyonc\u00e9. \u201cWork,\u201d the newest single from the Barbadian superstar Rihanna, is effectively dancehall, as was her first hit, \u201cPon de Replay\u201d in 2005.Here in Jamaica \u2014 where dancehall is the soundtrack to life, blasting every day and late into the night from car stereos and jury-rigged home speakers, in rum bars and barbershops \u2014 Kartel remains the genre\u2019s reigning monarch, despite having spent the last five years in prison. Born Adidja Palmer, Kartel built his reputation with graphic songs about guns, sex and unapologetic social transgressions, like bleaching his skin. His empire has extended beyond music to products, including a line of cake soap and \u201cdaggering\u201d condoms, named after a dance move in which a couple simulates rough sex on the dance floor. In 2014, he was convicted of murdering an associate, Clyde (Lizard) Williams, who disappeared in 2011 and whose body was never recovered. Kartel, who maintains his innocence, has continued to dominate the airwaves and awards circuit and somehow seems to be recording music in prison; a new album, \u201cViking (Vybz Is King),\u201d appeared last year.As the two political parties fought to form the next government, Vaz was not the only politician to take his cues from Kartel and dancehall. In November, Andrew Holness, the Jamaica Labour Party leader, toured Montego Bay wearing Clarks, Jamaica\u2019s most fashionable footwear, whose prices doubled on the island in 2010 after Kartel penned an ode to the British brand. Holness tweeted a picture of himself dusting off a brown shoe in Kartel\u2019s preferred style, the \u201cdesert boot,\u201d and Twitter went wild. \u201cA weh yuh get dah new Clarks deh daadi?\u201d Holness wrote, echoing the question posed to Kartel by Popcaan, another dancehall superstar and Kartel\u2019s now-estranged prot\u00e9g\u00e9.The People\u2019s National Party, meanwhile, has its own house D.J., Foota Hype. In January, Lisa Hanna, the party\u2019s minister for youth and culture and a former Miss Jamaica, posted lyrics on Instagram from \u201cSchool,\u201d one of Kartel\u2019s newer songs, in which he implores students to study hard and to refrain from bleaching their skin. Hanna might have been returning a compliment paid to her by Kartel, who late last year released a song, \u201cBoss Lady,\u201d that praised Hanna and also Portia Simpson Miller, then the prime minister.In their appeals to dancehall fandom, these politicians hoped to inspire an electorate exhausted by empty promises. Since 1989, when the previously socialist-leaning People\u2019s National Party embraced economic neoliberalism, the ideological gap between the two parties has collapsed. Jamaica\u2019s debt-to-G.D.P. ratio has reached 125 percent, making it one of the world\u2019s premier debtor states; I.M.F.-imposed austerity measures have yielded high unemployment rates and a declining standard of living. For young people \u2014 almost half of whom would, according to a recent poll, relinquish their Jamaican citizenship to live abroad \u2014 party politics is increasingly dispiriting. Dancehall is the perfect accompaniment to their mood: a jaded and bacchanalian lament for the Jamaican future as envisioned by its young.In \u201cWeh Dem Feel Like,\u201d Kartel asks about his enemies, \u201cDem skin too tough fi bleed?\u201d \u2014 a fitting question, too, regarding Jamaica\u2019s frequently violent politics. All told, before the voting, at least four people were shot to death at campaign events, and dozens more were injured in a stampede. When the votes were tallied last month, the nation got what it expected: a virtual tie between two nearly identical parties, with the Jamaica Labour Party eking out a slim majority. Vaz, Holness and Hanna won their seats handily. It was considered, by Jamaican standards, a peaceful election. \u2666110 million views and counting.By Jayson GreeneWhere on earth is the monoculture in 2016? It\u2019s clearly not dead. There is a song out right now: It\u2019s called \u201cStressed Out,\u201d and it is by a group called Twenty One Pilots. I discovered it recently, while poking around online during an office lunch break. As I watched the video play in its tiny YouTube window, I was dismayed to discover something. This song, by this group, of whose existence I had not been even dimly aware, had been viewed 110 million times.Bowled over, I consulted the Billboard charts and saw that \u201cStressed Out\u201d by Twenty One Pilots was the No. 3 song in the nation. (And seriously: Twenty One Pilots? Was this name invented by a spambot? Was their Twitter icon an egg?) A sense of the uncanny crept in: What else didn\u2019t I know about? Where was I, in relation to everyone else? Digging around more, I learned that the duo used to loiter outside a Chick-fil-A in their hometown, Columbus, Ohio, hawking tickets to their shows. Now, just a few years later, they\u2019re scheduled to play 75 arenas and counting in 2016. Their success has a certain \u201cAlex from Target\u201d feel to it, in which incomprehensible unseen forces conspire to lift an arbitrary phenomenon up into the national spotlight.In pop culture, \u201cincomprehensible unseen forces\u201d can reliably be shortened to just \u201cteenagers.\u201d And sure enough, dipping into Tumblr and Vine and Twitter \u2014 alone, again, on my office lunch break \u2014 reveals the band has a deep and devoted learner\u2019s-permit fan base. The appeal of \u201cStressed Out\u201d for teenagers is easy enough to grasp: It sounds like a cheery telegram from turn-of-the-century MTV \u2014 a kind of singsong rap that transforms, in the chorus, into emo pop. The backbeat instantly recalls Eminem\u2019s \u201cMy Name Is,\u201d and the verses take you back to Crazy Town\u2019s \u201cButterfly.\u201d Sometimes Tyler Joseph, their singer, picks up a ukulele, in the manner of so many YouTube stars. The whole thing is like a microhistory of the last 20 years of suburban white people.Music can take you to unexpected places.By Jazmine HughesI\u2019ve held onto that idea \u2014 a song as a route \u2014 ever since. The trick to music, though, is that it doesn\u2019t really take you anywhere; you take yourself. The song is just the ticket, the map, the conduit. You arrive at the destination entirely on your own.That sound brings me directly to my grandmother\u2019s church in Roanoke, Va., where I received my first blessing as a human baby (I don\u2019t remember), learned my first proper hymn (I don\u2019t remember) and, as a toddler, stood up on the pew and interrupted the service in which my Mema received special accolades from the pastor (I don\u2019t remember, but I wish I did). Hearing an organ is my own vibrant Sunday morning: slicing the thick air with a paper fan, tightening my stomach muscles to quiet any rumbling until lunch, trying not to sweat out my freshly pressed hair, searching for a lesson within the sermon that I could believe in. The song made me 2 again, then 5, then 12 and then (and now) 24, in the room but ever-so-slightly out of place, seeing love and trying to feel it. \u201cSunday Candy\u201d took me down South, took me back, put me back into my grandmother\u2019s lap for four generous, holy minutes. Church, still, is a strange sort of refuge: I never want to go, but I\u2019m always glad I went. I really go only whenever I visit my grandma.\u201cSunday Candy\u201d ends the way my grandma\u2019s church service always began: with the choir. The superb, slowed-down version Chance performed on \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d in late 2015 is as close to a hip-hop gospel song as I\u2019ve ever heard, due mostly to the outsize presence of that choir with its call-and-response approach to repetition. Chance ends the performance with a breathless, ecclesiastical freestyle not unlike the climax of a sermon, marrying the spiritual transcendence of a Sunday service with his artistic one.In buttoned-up Bulgaria, a viral sensation who plows through every taboo.By Mac McClellandBorn in Bulgaria\u2019s only women\u2019s prison (his mother was arrested for selling imported clothes before the fall of Communism), Azis was, he says, marked since birth \u201cto be different.\u201d He was gay in a culture that rejects homosexuality and Roma in a country \u2014 one of several \u2014 that continues to persecute the group. \u201cBeing gay and being Roma are highly discriminated against in Bulgaria,\u201d Azis continued. \u201cThey\u2019re both words that people here hate. For me, I\u2019m carrying the burden of the two.\u201dNonetheless, Azis\u2019s mother was determined to make her son a star, and after she got out of prison, she dragged him to endless auditions. But \u201cnobody wanted a Gypsy kid,\u201d Azis went on. \u201cThey just didn\u2019t want a Gypsy in their choir, a Gypsy standing in front, on TV, anywhere; it was beyond imagination to have somebody like me there.\u201d Eventually, this string of humiliations \u201ccrushed\u201d his mother. They moved to West Germany when Azis was 8. He returned to Bulgaria a few years later, after the wall came down; his mother\u2019s dream became his own the night he sang in a restaurant with live accompaniment. \u201cI felt really intoxicated by performing,\u201d he recalled. In his early 20s, he signed with a music agency in Sofia and a year later won best artist at a Bulgarian music festival. Within two years, he sold out the country\u2019s biggest stadium, where, with Communism more than a decade gone, he took the stage wearing high-heeled red leather boots that went up to his crotch.Now 38, Azis has dropped what he calls his \u201cdiva\u201d look. This is partly because he\u2019s \u201ctired and too old for everything\u201d \u2014 it takes him three hours to get into drag \u2014 but also because he no longer feels the need to make statements. \u201cNowadays, you can see boys in tight jeans holding hands on the street. And there is a street in Sofia where you can have sex with a transsexual.\u201d He laughed, a full throaty chuckle like a glamorous Disney villain. \u201cI\u2019ve done what I could to change people\u2019s perceptions,\u201d he later added. \u201cI showed that you can be Gypsy and you can be intelligent, you could be gay and you can be cool. That\u2019s it. I cannot do the very same thing for 20 years.\u201d\u201cHabibi\u201d may take its name from an Arabic endearment, but he insists he\u2019s not trying to imply that, in Bulgaria, Arabs may suffer a fate similar to the Roma. (A recent Amnesty International report noted that migrants live in terror of \u201cxenophobic hate crimes\u201d and admonished Bulgaria to address this climate of fear.) Rather, he explains, it\u2019s that Arab barbershops are trendy in Bulgaria. He has seen young people talking about them on Facebook.One day, the diva look will be back, he promises. In the meantime, he\u2019s considering recording a song entirely in English for American audiences, for whom he does have a message, however apolitical. \u201cI want them to know about Bulgaria,\u201d he said. \u201cI want to tell them that it\u2019s a small but very beautiful country, the nature here is amazing, the people are very friendly, especially in the countryside, and we have the most delicious feta cheese.\u201d \u2666On composing music, and your death, while dying.By Will HermesThere\u2019s a tradition of \u201cdeath poems\u201d in some Asian countries, and as a generation of outspoken musicians shuffles off our coil, the farewell album has become a Western equivalent. John Coltrane\u2019s \u201cExpression\u201d might be considered a forerunner. Warren Zevon made \u201cThe Wind\u201d after a diagnosis of inoperable cancer. On the last of Johnny Cash\u2019s \u201cAmerican Recordings\u201d series released during his lifetime, he performed Trent Reznor\u2019s \u201cHurt\u201d as a sort of deathbed confessional, then closed with \u201cWe\u2019ll Meet Again,\u201d a World War II-era send-off that was the smirking existential finale of \u201cDr. Strangelove.\u201dOther late works tilt toward consecrating summary, like Bach\u2019s \u201cMass in B Minor\u201d \u2014 or the new album by Loretta Lynn, still hale at 83, which reprises pointed favorites like \u201cEverybody Wants to Go to Heaven\u201d (\u201cbut nobody wants to die\u201d). Lou Reed\u2019s parting shot was extreme, even for him: a harsh art-metal collaboration with Metallica that reimagines Frank Wedekind\u2019s violently sexual \u201cLulu\u201d plays. But Reed was always a button-pusher. \u201cThe greatest disappointment/Age withered him and changed him,\u201d he snarled on \u201cJunior Dad,\u201d a song as mercilessly cleareyed as Reed\u2019s signature \u201cHeroin.\u201d Bowie is said to have called \u201cLulu\u201d his friend\u2019s \u201cgreatest work,\u201d a judgment colored, perhaps, by his own exit-music plans.In an era when our deaths are generally scripted by a profit-driven medical establishment, these conscious farewells are inspiring. Death is one of life\u2019s main events: Shouldn\u2019t it be our own composition? Reed died at home, surrounded by friends and family, with a posthumous, invite-only tribute at the Apollo Theater. There was no public funeral service for Bowie, only a final photo left on Instagram taken shortly before he died \u2014 the former and eternal Ziggy Stardust looking dapper in a designer suit, rakish hat and no socks, grinning widely, ready for his next act. \u2666Digital Design: Rodrigo de Benito Sanz and Linsey Fields.A picture caption on March 13 with an article about Sydney Bennett, leader of the band the Internet, misspelled the surname of the band\u2019s bassist. He is Patrick Paige II, not Page.An article on March 13 about the rapper Kendrick Lamar and his song \u2018\u2018The Blacker the Berry\u2019\u2019 paraphrased incorrectly the lyrics of a song by Lauryn Hill. She criticized black women who wear hair weaves that look European; she did not say that they got the weaves from Koreans.Advertisement"}

The Nauman, estimated at about $6 million, will anchor the May 8 sale \u2014 at the unusual time of 5 p.m. on a Sunday \u2014 which will include some 29 similarly unlikely auction lots: a crucified-frog sculpture by Martin Kippenberger, a distorted face by Jim Shaw, a butter stick by Robert Gober, potatoes mounted on a wood grid by Sigmar Polke.\u201cIt is trying to showcase art that is not what one would normally expect to see, not only on a catalog cover, but in a sale,\u201d Mr. Gouzer said, \u201cto bring back artists who are important but who perhaps need more brain power or more time or more work to actually understand them.\u201dAdhering to this framework, Mr. Gouzer said, has forced him to ferret out the riskier Mike Kelley pieces or the Neil Jenneys, rather than the reliable Richters and Warhols. \u201cI\u2019ve been approached by a lot of people who want to consign works that we know would do well in terms of numbers, but I\u2019m turning them down,\u201d he said. \u201cI really want to explore the more conceptual \u2014 or visceral \u2014 and difficult parts of what art can be.\u201dMr. Gouzer has had two successful themed sales.

{"Headline": "Microsoft Trumpets Windows 10, and Pushes Into Sci-Fi Tech", "Date": "2016-03-30", "News": "Supported bySEATTLE \u2014 Microsoft continues to bank on its Windows operating system. But the software giant is also increasingly staking out new technology areas, including software that can have natural conversations with people.Those were the twin messages from the company at an event in San Francisco on Wednesday for developers. At the event, Microsoft said Windows 10, the latest version of its operating system, is now running on 270 million active devices, eight months after it was released to the public. That represented the fastest adoption ever for a new version of Windows, outpacing the rate at which Windows 7 was adopted by 145 percent, the company said.Microsoft also revealed new tools for developers to create \u201cbots,\u201d pieces of software that can be used to produce new methods of interacting with computers, such as a chat interface for ordering pizzas online.\u201cWe want to build intelligence that augments human abilities and experiences,\u201d Satya Nadella, Microsoft\u2019s chief executive, said at the event.\u201cWe\u2019re back to the drawing board,\u201d he said.In another area of new technology, Microsoft said it had begun shipping a version of HoloLens, the company\u2019s augmented reality headset that overlays digital images on the wearer\u2019s view of the real world. The $3,000 product is aimed at developers making applications for HoloLens. Microsoft has not said when it will begin selling a version of the product for the public or how much it will cost.The company also emphasized its progress with Windows 10, in a reminder that \u2014 for all of the talk of Microsoft\u2019s fading stature in the technology industry \u2014 Windows is still the software that most of the world uses to run its PCs.Microsoft previously said it intended to get Windows 10 running on one billion devices two to three years after the product shipped last July. In a recent interview, Terry Myerson, the executive vice president of the Windows and devices group at Microsoft, said he was confident the company could still reach that objective.\u201cThe goal was always ambitious, but enterprises are deploying faster than ever before,\u201d Mr. Myerson said.Jan Dawson, an analyst at Jackdaw Research, said developers had little incentive to create software for Windows first when they can reach bigger audiences elsewhere.Windows 10 is supposed to give developers an extra incentive to create apps for Microsoft products by making it easy for them to produce software that can run on any Windows 10 device, including PCs, smartphones and the Xbox One console. Microsoft praises new \u201cuniversal apps\u201d of this nature from the likes of Twitter, Uber, King, Disney, the Wargaming Group, Square Enix and Yahoo.It isn\u2019t clear that the apps being made for Windows 10 will be sufficient to get people to buy phones running the software.\u201cWe obviously have work to do in mobile,\u201d Mr. Myerson said.To keep interest in Windows 10, Microsoft said Wednesday that it would refresh the software with an update that would connect users with Cortana, the virtual assistant in the operating system, without requiring a PC to be unlocked first. People could then use their PCs like Amazon\u2019s Echo device, which can be summoned to answer questions about the weather and trivia from across the room.The Windows 10 update will also enhance a feature called Windows Hello that lets people more securely log into Windows using biometric verification, like facial recognition. The change will allow people to sign into websites and apps with Windows Hello so they don\u2019t have to use passwords.David Smith, an analyst at Gartner, said Windows 10 should be considered a success, especially compared with its predecessor, Windows 8, which many people disliked for too aggressively pushing a striking redesign of the software\u2019s interface. (Microsoft skipped over the Windows 9 name.)Still, he doubts that enough people will see a need to buy PCs to return the market to growth. \u201cI don\u2019t see it creating this massive upgrade cycle,\u201d Mr. Smith said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Marketers Take Second Look at Over-50 Consumers", "Date": "2016-03-04", "News": "Supported bySpecial SectionBrent Bouchez opened Agency Five0 six years ago in New York as an advertising firm specializing in marketing to baby boomers, on the assumption that companies would need to tune their messages differently as the last of the boomers headed into their 50s.But the firm has only just landed its first boomer-targeted marketing effort \u201cwith real spending behind it,\u201d Mr. Bouchez said. Two years ago, he started another agency, Bouchez Page, to capture a wider range of business.\u201cWhat held us back was the very idea of 50,\u201d he said. \u201cWe heard \u2018I can\u2019t go to my boss and say I\u2019m going to an agency that targets 50-plus.\u2019 \u201dMr. Bouchez and other specialists in marketing to baby boomers, the more than 75 million Americans born roughly from 1946 through 1964, said companies recognized the economic value of the group but were hesitant to shift marketing budgets away from the 83 million millennials, those born from 1982 to 2000, who remain the holy grail of advertisers.A result is what marketers call a transitional phase in which millennials and boomers will be increasingly targeted in messages that try to bridge the groups.\u201cCompanies want to reach boomers, but they want to do it with their general advertising message, usually a message created by and for a millennial target,\u201d Mr. Bouchez said. \u201cNo mainstream brand has spent money on a targeted creative campaign for boomers.\u201dThus far, if the aging consumer is the primary target, the pharmaceutical and retirement-related financial sectors are doing the marketing.Consequently, boomers say they feel underserved by marketing.\u201cWe did a survey of boomer perceptions of marketing directed at them, and over 80 percent said they feel advertisers are making mistakes, either with the wrong message or the wrong offer,\u201d said Dave Austin, managing director of Influent50, a marketing agency created by AARP last year to help companies with branding for its members.\u201cWe\u2019re tired of the idea that if you put a Rolling Stones song on a commercial, you\u2019ll reach the over-50s,\u201d he said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t work that way.\u201dSome ads that try to take a more age-inclusive approach have hit the target, marketers said, particularly the fashion industry\u2019s campaigns that include women older than 50, a big change from its well-known obsession with youth.Two examples are Gap\u2019s \u201cDress Normal\u201d campaign, with Anjelica Huston and various other celebrities of different ages, and L\u2019Or\u00e9al\u2019s Paris line, which features women of different ages, including Helen Mirren and Blake Lively.Peter Hubbell, founder of BoomAgers, a New York-based advertising agency and marketing consultancy focused on the aging consumer, said boomers would \u201crespect those brands that represent them faithfully while appealing to their values and ambitions at this stage of their lives.\u201dBrands for whom boomers are obvious targets are also trying to focus on what people over 50 see as the best years of their lives.As part of its recent \u201cMade to Move\u201d campaign about Osteo Bi-Flex, its joint health supplement, NBTY of Ronkonkoma, N.Y., portrayed a 50-something woman doing yoga beside her daughter.After easily rotating her shoulder with a vertical arm stretch, she whispers to the male instructor that her daughter is single, prompting protest from the daughter. \u201cIt also supports wonderfully high levels of humiliation in her daughter,\u201d says the voice-over.While the ad is not without its detractors \u2014 some specialists in marketing to people over 50 said it reinforced the clich\u00e9 that older people say embarrassingly inappropriate things \u2014 it is meant to reflect boomer values, even if it is at the expense of the daughter\u2019s feelings.\u201cThe ad demonstrates that we really know who boomers are and how our product can help them maintain their active lifestyle,\u201d said Andre Branch, the company\u2019s chief marketing officer. \u201cThe humor is there, but it\u2019s not contrived. It\u2019s about the feeling of empowerment, being who they want to be.\u201dThe superior buying power of the boomers compared with the millennials is clearly one factor forcing marketers to recalibrate their messages.According to a four-year-old Nielsen-BoomAger study, by 2017 nearly 50 percent of the United States adult population will be 50 and older and will control 70 percent of the country\u2019s disposable income. Moreover, that group stands to inherit $15 trillion in the next 20 years.In contrast, 75 percent of millennials can afford to buy only what they need, not what they want, according to a 2015 study by BoomAger and the Natural Marketing Institute. In addition, 45 percent of them are not employed and 23 percent have college debt.\u201cMany millennials will not enter their prime earning and spending years until 2020, and most not until 2030,\u201d Mr. Hubbell said. \u201cSobering news if you put all your eggs in this basket.\u201dMedia consumption habits are also working toward increased marketing spending to reach boomers. According to Brian Nguyen, communications strategy director at Droga5, a New York-based advertising agency, use of mobile, tablet, video and social sharing is evening out between the groups.In addition, streaming services like Netflix and Amazon are developing content targeted to boomers.\u201cAs media touch points increase and buying power remains strong, marketers will have more and more compelling reasons to boomerang back to boomers,\u201d Mr. Nguyen said.He predicted that in the next two to three years marketers would work increasingly to blend strategies that address millennials and boomers.\u201cHere at Droga5, we\u2019ve already begun to take a more age-agnostic approach,\u201d he said, \u201cby building campaigns on truths and insights rather than arbitrary assumptions based on generational stereotypes.\u201dAdvertisement"}
