{"Headline": "Where\u2019s My Mercedes? Egypt\u2019s Financial Crisis Hits the Rich", "Date": "2016-03-10", "News": "Supported byCAIRO \u2014 Gucci Corner is the nickname for a bustling plaza at the private American University in Cairo, where well-heeled students hang out between classes and strut their imported fashions.Zeyad Mohamed, 19, a business student, said he was shocked to discover on a recent visit to a Mercedes-Benz showroom that his desired model would not be available for 18 months. \u201cNormally I\u2019m not interested in politics \u2014 if it doesn\u2019t affect me, I don\u2019t care,\u201d Mr. Mohamed said, reflecting a disengagement that is typical among well-to-do youth. \u201cBut this is a problem. And things are getting more expensive.\u201dWealthy Egyptians were among President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi\u2019s most ardent supporters after he seized power in 2013, favoring stability and a harsh crackdown on Islamists, even at the cost of civil liberties. But that loyalty is being tested now, as Egypt\u2019s severe shortage of foreign currency cripples businesses, impedes luxury imports and crimps their lifestyles. And that has prompted a tide of unusually sharp criticism of Mr. Sisi.Mr. Sisi is using what scarce resources he has mainly to help the poor \u2014 and the seven million people on the state\u2019s payroll \u2014 by propping up the value of Egypt\u2019s currency. Politically, that makes sense: Mr. Sisi is mindful of the popular protests that drove President Hosni Mubarak from office in 2011. Even so, the poor have suffered from shortages of some staples, like cooking oil, while the rich are confronted with restrictions that amount to a sharp pinch, if not quite pain.\u201cThat\u2019s what\u2019s new \u2014 the suffering of the rich,\u201d said Ibrahim Eissa, a prominent journalist who was once among Mr. Sisi\u2019s loudest advocates, but who recently published a withering attack on the president\u2019s policies. Mr. Eissa said: \u201cNo class or demographic is happy now, from Alexandria to Upper Egypt. Sisi isn\u2019t satisfying anyone.\u201dStringent new government regulations restrict the use of Egyptian credit cards abroad and limit purchases of foreign currency. Business people seeking American dollars have scrambled to the black market, where the price has jumped 20 percent in recent months. Meanwhile, their families are faced with sharp rises in supermarket prices, long waits for luxury cars and worries about obtaining enough dollars or euros to pay for foreign vacations or for their children to study abroad.Last weekend at U Bistro, a lounge with a buzzing bar filled with local high rollers, the price of the dollar was \u201call people are talking about,\u201d said Dina Alhassani, an education consultant at one of the tables. \u201cPeople are worried,\u201d she said. \u201cThere\u2019s a sense of anxiety about what comes next.\u201dThe worsening currency crisis \u2014 one headline this week spoke of a \u201cdollar fever\u201d \u2014 is one of several woes facing Mr. Sisi, who is also under fire for rights violations by his security forces. The strain appeared to show in a recent speech where he lashed out at critics, urged them to \u201cshut up,\u201d and told the audience, \u201cPlease, do not listen to anyone but me.\u201dThe hectoring, emotional tone of that speech drew derision on the Internet. After Mr. Sisi rhetorically offered to ease the crisis by \u201cselling\u201d himself, one Internet user set up an eBay page with his picture, offering a \u201cslightly used field marshal\u201d for sale. The page attracted bids of over $100,000 before it was shut down.Such mockery can be dangerous to practice inside Egypt, where many Sisi critics languish in jail. But the widespread mirth that the gag inspired seemed to illustrate how the president\u2019s aura has dimmed.In Mr. Sisi\u2019s defense, government officials point to external factors driving the crisis. The country\u2019s already-struggling tourism industry, a crucial earner of foreign exchange, was devastated after a Russian airliner crashed in the Sinai Desert on Oct. 31, probably as a result of a bomb. The country\u2019s tourism minister says that the slump has cost Egypt $1.3 billion in revenue since then, and that the number of visitors to the country was down 44 percent in January.The wealthy make up only a small fraction of Egypt\u2019s 90 million people, while 26 percent of the population lives below the poverty line, according to the United Nations. And they are increasingly living apart, in Palm Beach-style gated communities ringing Cairo, far from the crumbling infrastructure and chronic poverty of the city center.But it is really businesses large and small that have been bearing the brunt of the currency crisis. General Motors has a car plant in Egypt, but it had to temporarily halt production recently because it could not get the parts it needed. Foreign airlines have threatened to curtail flights to Egypt because of rules blocking them from repatriating profits. For a time, British Airways stopped selling tickets in Egyptian currency.At the Gezira Sporting Club in Zamalek, an island in central Cairo, wealthy parents said they were struggling to pay their children\u2019s tuition at private schools that require payment in dollars or euros. \u201cSisi has lost popularity with the upper segment of society,\u201d said a businessman, Ashraf Omran. \u201cHe gave a good story, and people want to believe in it. But you need to follow through. We haven\u2019t seen that.\u201dThe argument has been most heated on influential TV stations that were once staunchly pro-Sisi but have now adopted a more critical tone. \u201cI hated that speech,\u201d Youssef al Hosseiny of ONtv said, referring to Mr. Sisi\u2019s much-derided remarks last week. \u201cHe looked isolated, and he looked angry. He\u2019s been in power for just 20 months. It\u2019s too early to be isolated.\u201dThe president\u2019s popularity has been hurt by more than just the economy, Mr. Hosseiny said. The recent imprisonment of a TV evangelist, a novelist and a poet, all on charges related to religion and public morality, has stoked worries about free speech. Government critics are regularly prevented from leaving the country, including the journalist Hossam Bahgat and the human rights advocate Gamal Eid.And after a policeman shot and killed a taxi driver two weeks ago in an argument over a fare, a furious crowd surged through the streets, defying laws banning public protests.Still, there remain plenty of Egyptians, rich and poor, who continue to see Mr. Sisi as a bulwark against the instability that has roiled other countries in the region.At a sale for imported designer fashions on the banks of the Nile last weekend, Hala Mahmoud defended the president. \u201cPeople are trying to frame Sisi, as if he did something wrong,\u201d she said. \u201cBut he\u2019s a military man, and we face a lot of problems here.\u201dTo older Egyptians, the shortages of luxury goods recall earlier periods of economic belt-tightening in the 1990s and 2000s. \u201cWe understand it,\u201d said Hany Genena, chief economist at Beltone Financial, an investment house in Cairo. Noting that many foreign investors see Egypt as an attractive medium-term bet, he said, \u201cJust forget the next two years.\u201dYoung Egyptians may have less patience. At the American University in Cairo, Nada el Halaswany, a recent graduate, said her family had voted for Mr. Sisi. But the hotel her father manages on the Red Sea is virtually empty now, and she is applying for jobs in Dubai, United Arab Emirates.\u201cI don\u2019t see any positive change on the horizon,\u201d she said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Furniture Designer Max Lamb Is at Home with Honest Materials", "Date": "2016-03-16", "News": "Supported byIn his house \u2014 as in his acclaimed exhibitions \u2014 there\u2019s always a good place to sit.12 Photos\u201cI buy stuff at car boot sales, on eBay, at antique stores, and these items become inspirational artifacts to me,\u2019\u2019 says the London furniture designer Max Lamb. \u2018\u2018I investigate them and turn them upside down.\u2019\u2019 The 35-year-old shows me a copper drinking vessel he picked up in India that served as the inspiration for the Last Stool, a stackable bullet-shaped seat constructed from a single sheet of solid brass. Like much of his work, the shiny object looks more like sculpture than furniture. But for Lamb, form never comes before function. He knocks on the stool to demonstrate how sturdy it is. \u2018\u2018I like to work with simple, honest materials that last,\u2019\u2019 he says. \u2018\u2018Things need to be durable.\u2019\u2019Lamb followed the same practical approach in the renovation of an industrial brick building in North London that now serves as his home and workspace, which he shares with his wife, the English jewelry designer Gemma Holt, known for her minimalist, sculptural designs. The turn-of-the-20th-century two-story structure was once part of the nearby Barber Wilsons & Co, a manufacturer of water fixtures, including those at Buckingham Palace. Before that, it had served as a local mosque. After ripping out layers of carpet and a foot-washing trough, they were left with a crumbling blank canvas.Together, the couple applied their complementary creative approaches to reimagining the house. Holt\u2019s detail-oriented approach and knack for economizing space helped focus Lamb, who added built-in features like sliding doors and hidden storage areas to maximize space. Holt and Lamb were sparing in their use of materials, too, employing African iroko wood (\u2018\u2018the poor man\u2019s teak,\u2019\u2019 Lamb says) for a long swath of cabinets in the kitchen as well as for decking on the second floor terrace. The Portuguese cork that pads the house\u2019s floors was also installed to insulate the open beam ceiling, and what looks like terrazzo in the couple\u2019s master bath is in fact a prototype for a speckled engineered marble that Lamb created for the English design company Dzek.\u2018\u2018We needed a minimalist palette because the objects in our house are so diverse and weird,\u2019\u2019 says Holt, pointing to a cluster of Lamb\u2019s chairs: a triangular pewter stool, a black lacquered mini bench and a perforated copper seat. The humble, handcrafted look of Lamb\u2019s work belies his technically meticulous construction methods. He sculpted the copper chair, for example, from a wax form that he submerged in a tank of copper sulphate. The copper grew on the wax form, which was then melted away. The pewter stool was created with a primitive casting technique that involves pouring liquid metal into a mold dug out in sand. Lamb first experimented with the method on the beaches of the south coast of Cornwall in England \u2014 a spot where he grew up building sand castles and tunnels. Lamb says he sees the world as a \u2018\u2018working landscape\u2019\u2019 where he can exploit raw materials to draw out their natural beauty.This combination of vision and resourcefulness has made his work in demand among those who appreciate his somewhat Brutalist pieces as both furniture and works of art. He\u2019s been commissioned by stores like Acne and Opening Ceremony, and his work is exhibited at blue-chip design galleries like Johnson Trading Gallery in New York and Gallery Fumi in London. At last year\u2019s Milan Furniture Fair, he created \u2018\u2018Exercises in Seating,\u2019\u2019 an installation that became the must-see of the show. In it he arranged 42 of his chair designs in an enormous circle, starting from the first he ever made, in 2004. There was a design manifesto to accompany the exhibit, which included an exposition of his wide-ranging techniques \u2014 from ceramic shelling to spruing \u2014 as well as a nerdish homage to the extensive range of tools and materials he uses, including the 187-year-old ash tree he felled at his grandfather\u2019s farm and later turned into tables and chairs.WHILE LAMB\u2019S HANDS-ON approach has served him well in the design world, it proved a challenge when he was a student at the Royal College of Art in London. \u2018\u2018I was trying to be a designer but I found it stifling,\u2019\u2019 recalls Lamb, who didn\u2019t want to spend his days abstractly sketching prototypes on paper. He wanted to go straight to the source \u2014 whether it was a factory, foundry or quarry \u2014 to test his technique-oriented work. Lamb\u2019s D.I.Y. instinct comes from a childhood spent working his grandfather\u2019s farm in Yorkshire in the summers. By the age of 12, he was driving a tractor, laying bricks and doing electrical work. \u2018\u2018It gave me an understanding of what my hands could really do,\u2019\u2019 he says. After graduation, Lamb\u2019s professor, the industrial designer Tom Dixon, hired him as a special projects designer, which opened up even more creative possibilities. Each of Lamb\u2019s designs became an experiment in technique, whether it was learning how to use a hot wire cutter to saw out shapes from blocks of polystyrene foam or wrestling with Delaware bluestone boulders in an upstate New York quarry. For his recent show at the Johnson Trading Gallery, Lamb packed his tools and headed to a Vermont marble quarry where he chiseled out 26 objects in three weeks. \u2018\u2018I was like a one-man band with my core drill,\u2019\u2019 he says.Like her husband, Holt also has a passion for materials \u2014 every item in the house is prized by these two aesthetes. She opens a kitchen cabinet to reveal shelves of immaculately arranged items: One is devoted to rocks they\u2019ve collected on their travels, another to geometric puzzles; a third stores stacks of British studio pottery in a muted palette of warm browns and beiges. \u2018\u2018It\u2019s bit of an obsession for us,\u2019\u2019 says Holt, who admires the slight irregularities in each of the dishware pieces. \u2018\u2018I love seeing the hand of the maker.\u2019\u2019 She then lifts the panel off a compartment in the dining room table that holds what the couple like to call \u2018\u2018artifacts\u2019\u2019 gathered during several visits to Iceland, where Lamb explored different geological sites with a local scientist. There are salmon skins, chicken feet and chunks of rhyolite, a volcanic ash he tried to use to make building blocks. \u2018\u2018The bricks fell apart during transport,\u2019\u2019 Lamb says, \u2018\u2018but the process was so enlightening.\u2019\u2019Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Review: \u2018The Way West\u2019 Features a Cheerfully Defiant Plunge Into Financial Ruin", "Date": "2016-04-10", "News": "Supported byAs portrayed by the always likable Deirdre O\u2019Connell, Mom, as she is known, lives in a largely abandoned housing tract in Stockton, Calif. Her younger daughter, Michelle, called Meesh (Anna O\u2019Donoghue) seems to have moved in, while Meesh\u2019s older sister, Amanda, called Manda (Nadia Bowers), is visiting from Chicago in an attempt to help Mom get her personal finances in order.Trouble is, Mom doesn\u2019t really have any personal finances anymore. Having lost her job at a tire store, she\u2019s merrily sunken into a state of cheerful denial about her insolvency, preferring to unleash another preposterous tall tale whenever her daughters try to jostle her into facing the situation.Ms. Mansour\u2019s dialogue can be bleakly funny. When Manda discovers, to her horror, that someone has charged $3,500 on an Elizabeth Arden credit card that Mom adamantly denies having acquired, Manda becomes alarmed by the prospect of identity theft. Mom shrugs it off, chortling: \u201cThey can take my identity. Have fun!\u201dIt turns out, however, that the miscreant is in the family. Meesh sheepishly \u2014 well, actually not so sheepishly \u2014 confesses that she charged all those jars of face cream herself, then sold them on eBay. \u201cYou were already doing the bankruptcy thing, anyway,\u201d she tells her mother, by way of defense.But while the dialogue often has a comic crackle, the characters\u2019 fecklessness is less charmingly kooky than exasperating. Even Manda, it turns out, seems to have been infected with the family curse of financial cluelessness. Although she has a decent job in fund-raising at a university, she has also maxed out her credit cards \u2014 paying the monthly minimum balances of $500 (!) and $700 (!!) \u2014 and hoping that, well, her great talents will eventually be discovered, and she\u2019ll rise up the economic ladder.Under the direction of Mimi O\u2019Donnell, Ms. O\u2019Connell, who played the role of Mom in the play\u2019s premiere production at the Steppenwolf Theater in Chicago, displays an earthy good humor that partly makes up for her tedious forays into a fantasyland where no adversity cannot be overcome by spunk. (Her first story involves a woman in a car accident who miraculously survives by fending off a coyote by beating it with her mangled leg.) Ms. O\u2019Connell also brings a funny blitheness to Mom\u2019s unflappability; Mom chooses not just to ignore her financial woes, but her debilitating physical ones, too. And she barely bats an eyelash when fire breaks out in the house.Ms. O\u2019Donoghue and Ms. Bowers create a believable sisterly rapport, which is to say they take frequent passive-aggressive (and sometimes just aggressive) potshots at each other, but also manage to suggest an emotional alliance that runs deeper than their snarky exchanges.As Mom\u2019s friend Tress, who has sunk her savings \u2014 and a big chunk of Mom\u2019s \u2014 into a losing spa business, Portia, an actress who goes by one name, brings a certain sweetness to the proceedings, as does Alfredo Narciso as Luis, Manda\u2019s ex-boyfriend. And while Curran Connor doesn\u2019t seem to have much of a function in his role as Meesh\u2019s friend Robbie, he\u2019s amusingly irritated as a pizza delivery boy who yanks back the pizza when it turns out that the three women cannot muster $16.75 (plus tip) among them.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Escalating the War on Looting", "Date": "2016-03-11", "News": "Supported byArt for TomorrowPARIS \u2014 Like the wars themselves, the looting of antiquities in Syria and other conflict zones in the Middle East is proving virtually impossible to stop, despite the best efforts of a host of international agencies, cultural organizations and dogged independent researchers.As the pillaging continues in a region rich in layers of ancient civilizations, the international community is focusing on the marketplace, doing what it can to scare off demand in hopes that supply will shrink. \u201cThere wouldn\u2019t be any looting if there wasn\u2019t money to be made,\u201d said Kathryn Walker Tubb, a lecturer at the Institute of Archaeology at University College London.In the past few years, the effort to intercept the illicit trade has intensified.In February last year, the United Nations Security Council passed a resolution banning trade in artifacts illegally removed from Syria since 2011 and from Iraq since 1990. The International Council of Museums has issued \u201cred lists\u201d for objects at risk in Iraq, Syria and now Libya. Last August, the State Department in Washington announced a $5 million reward for information that could disrupt the ransacking and looting of cultural sites by the Islamic State, or ISIS.Last month, Unesco followed up its Emergency Safeguarding of the Syrian Heritage Project, introduced in 2014 with the European Union, with a special task force that would deploy experts from Italy\u2019s carabinieri force, with its long experience in tracking down looted art, to help hunt down stolen items.The Asia Society and the Antiquities Coalition recently concluded an international conference on \u201ccultural racketeering\u201d with calls for special training for customs agents and support for local governments in conflict zones to catalogue and safeguard their treasures.\u201cWe believe it is imperative to do what we can,\u201d said Christine Anagnos, the executive director of the Association of Art Museum Directors, which last October issued a set of \u201csafe haven\u201d protocols that offer protection for cultural property put at risk by wars and other disasters, with the guarantee that it will be returned to home countries once its safety can be assured. As of February, however, no offers have been made to deposit endangered objects for safekeeping in foreign museums, Ms. Anagnos said.But investigations rarely produce arrests because of the difficulty in proving the provenance of antiquities, often produced by civilizations that stretched across the ancient world.Traffickers are also masters at coming up with fake documents that purport to show that the disputed object had been long held by mysterious collectors, now conveniently deceased. Such lack of evidence often means that the authorities often choose to avoid pursuing criminal charges in return for reclaiming the objects, which results in shady dealers getting off the hook, experts say.But the publicity surrounding the effort to stem the flow of smuggled artifacts from Syria, Iraq and other war zones in the Middle East has had a dampening effect, said Christopher Marinello, the founder and director of the Art Recovery Group, an organization in London that has developed a database to recover lost and stolen artworks around the world.\u201cThe media coverage has done such an incredible job that any reputable dealer will have taken a huge step backwards,\u201d Mr. Marinello said. \u201cWe see dealers and auction houses coming in with questions about specific objects. We have seen catalogues for antiquities shrink.\u201d Small items periodically appear on e-commerce sites: Two coins from Apamea, a looted archaeological site in Syria, recently showed up on eBay, priced at $84 and $133.But most people agree that the market for larger, more valuable pieces has shrunk under international pressure. This concerns Ms. Tubb who fears that precious artifacts are being stashed in warehouses \u2014 in the Middle East but also in Europe \u2014 where they will remain hidden until the pressure eases.\u201cWho knows where these things are housed,\u201d she said. \u201cThere are all sorts of different routes.\u201dCol. Ludovic Ehrhart, an investigator for France\u2019s cultural theft police unit, told Le Monde that those trading in \u201cblood antiquities\u201d can afford to bide their time. \u201cThese long-standing networks wait three, five, even 10 years before they sell them on the official market, \u2018\u2019 he said.The role played by terrorist groups such as Islamic State in the looting of antiquities from the Middle East has helped put a chill on the market, Mr. Marinello said. \u201cIt didn\u2019t hurt that the F.B.I. has said you could be arrested for aiding international terrorism,\u201d he said. \u201cThat is quite an incentive to not buy something.\u201d Although Islamic State\u2019s vicious attacks and subsequent pillaging of Syrian sites like Palmyra have attracted attention, there are other culprits.\u201cIt is not just the Islamic State that is destroying or looting,\u201d said Sam Hardy, a research associate at University College London\u2019s Institute of Archaeology, \u201calthough they have certainly upped the attention.\u201dThe looting at Apamea, one of the largest and best preserved Roman and Byzantine sites in the world, took place on an industrial scale, as seen on satellite images that show the area pockmarked by a grid of more than 5,000 looting pits, at a time when the area was under the control of the Syrian government.\u201cThat may not indicate looting that was directed by the regime,\u201d said Mr. Hardy, \u201cbut it does suggest looting that benefited the regime.\u201dHard proof of the Islamic State\u2019s involvement in antiquities trafficking came in May, when a United States-led raid on a compound in eastern Syria used by Abu Sayyaf, a commander identified as the director of the terrorist group\u2019s oil smuggling and its trade in antique objects.Abu Sayyaf, who was killed in the operation, was in possession of an odd assortment of artifacts \u2014 including an ivory plaque traced to the museum in Mosul, Iraq \u2014 Islamic State territory \u2014 as well as a collection of coins, bracelets and other easy-to-transport objects and a few obvious fakes. The cache also revealed receipts for the 20 percent tax on precious materials \u2014 antiquities, but also minerals \u2014 collected from civilians by Islamic State. The total sum shown from these \u201ctax\u201d receipts reportedly amounted to $265,000, suggesting that the antiquities trade is just a small part of the group\u2019s financing streams. But it shows the lengths to which the local population is willing to go to survive.\u201cWar is always the worst time for cultural heritage, particularly in a part of the world that was a cradle of civilization,\u201d Mr. Marinello said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Echo From Amazon Brims With Groundbreaking Promise", "Date": "2016-03-09", "News": "Supported byState of the ArtMany of the world\u2019s largest technology companies have spent the last five years searching in vain for the holy grail, a machine to succeed the smartphone as the next must-have gadget.They have made digital watches and fitness trackers, all manner of computerized glasses and goggles, and more doodads to plug into your TV than there are shows to watch on it.This time it may be different. A bit more than a year after its release, the Echo has morphed from a gimmicky experiment into a device that brims with profound possibility. The longer I use it, the more regularly it inspires the same sense of promise I felt when I used the first iPhone \u2014 a sense this machine is opening up a vast new realm in personal computing, and gently expanding the role that computers will play in our future.What is most interesting about the Echo is that it came out of nowhere. It isn\u2019t much to look at, and even describing its utility is difficult. Here is a small, stationary machine that you set somewhere in your house, which you address as Alexa, which performs a variety of tasks \u2014 playing music, reading the news and weather, keeping a shopping list \u2014 that you can already do on your phone.But the Echo has a way of sneaking into your routines. When Alexa reorders popcorn for you, or calls an Uber car for you, when your children start asking Alexa to add Popsicles to the grocery list, you start to want pretty much everything else in life to be Alexa-enabled, too.In this way, Amazon has found a surreptitious way to bypass Apple and Google \u2014 the reigning monarchs in the smartphone world \u2014 with a gadget that has the potential to become a dominant force in the most intimate of environments: our homes.Scot Wingo, the chairman of ChannelAdvisor, an e-commerce consulting firm, said the early signs suggested that the Echo was on a path to become Amazon\u2019s next $1 billion business.\u201cIt\u2019s one of the most sold-out things that I see on Amazon,\u201d Mr. Wingo said. \u201cIt\u2019s an unusual thing for Amazon to be out of something, but for the Echo, it\u2019s usually in stock just for a couple weeks before it goes out of stock for a few days \u2014 so it feels like they\u2019re having trouble making enough of the devices.\u201d Mr. Wingo noted the Echo, which Amazon sells for $180 only through its own site, was selling for $200 to $300 on eBay.During an interview at a media event last week, Dave Limp, Amazon\u2019s senior vice president for devices, said the company created the Echo because it had seen interesting possibilities arising out of advances in microphone technology, speech recognition and cloud connectivity. Amazon\u2019s engineers spent years perfecting the device\u2019s unusual capabilities. Unlike competing assistants, the Echo can be activated hands-free from far across the room (Siri only works from a couple of feet away), and it can decipher your voice in noisy environments, even when it\u2019s playing music.Amazon also worked to make sure the device responded very quickly. \u201cEarly on in the product, to play music took eight or nine seconds, and it\u2019s just unusable when it\u2019s like that,\u201d Mr. Limp said. \u201cNow it\u2019s often 1,000 milliseconds or 1,200 milliseconds.\u201dThe speed makes a crucial difference. Compared with the trudge of chatting with Siri, speaking to Alexa feels natural, closer to speaking to a human than a machine \u2014 and even when it gets your request wrong, which in your early days with the device will happen often, it doesn\u2019t feel like you have paid a huge penalty for trying.More important, just like the early iPhone, Amazon has managed to turn the Echo into the center of a new ecosystem. Developers are flocking to create voice-controlled apps for the device, or skills, as Amazon calls them. There are now more than 300 skills for the Echo, from the trivial \u2014 there is one to make Alexa produce rude body sounds on command \u2014 to the pretty handy. It can tell you transit schedules, start a seven-minute workout, read recipes, do math and conversions, and walk you through adventure games, among other possibilities.Makers of digital home devices like Nest are also rushing to make their products compatible with the Echo. Alexa can now control your Internet-connected lights, home thermostats and a variety of other devices. Hardware makers can also add Alexa\u2019s brain into their own devices, so soon you won\u2019t need an Echo to consult with Alexa \u2014 you could find it in your toaster, your refrigerator or your car.The Echo also ties in to Amazon\u2019s main business, its retail store. When you tell it to reorder popcorn, it gets your order through Amazon, of course. Still, Mr. Wingo noted that Amazon had so far kept the platform relatively open \u2014 other retailers and product manufacturers are free to build their own apps that will allow for interactions with their stores.Advertisement"}

Many of his supporters are from the #middleagewhitemalesmatter movement, for whom the current age of acceleration has not been kind and for whom Trump\u2019s rallies are their way of saying \u201cCan you hear me now?\u201d and of sticking it to all the people who exploited their pain but left them behind, particularly traditional Republican elites. They are not interested in Trump\u2019s details. They like his gut.And no wonder. Those G.O.P. elites sold their own souls and their party so many times to charlatans and plutocrats that you wonder when it\u2019s going to show up on closeout on eBay: \u201cFor sale: The G.O.P. soul. Almost empty. This soul was previously sold to Sarah Palin, the Tea Party anarchists, Rush Limbaugh, Grover Norquist, the gun lobby, the oil industry, the Koch brothers, Sheldon Adelson and Fox News. Will bargain. No offer too low.\u201dNormally smart people, like Mitt Romney, discarded all their best instincts to suck up to this ragtag assortment of self-appointed G.O.P. commissars, each representing a different slice of what came to be Republican orthodoxy \u2014 climate change is a hoax; abortion, even in the case of rape or incest, is impermissible; even common-sense gun laws must be opposed, no matter how many kids get murdered; taxes must always be cut and safety nets shrunk, no matter what the economic context; Obamacare must be destroyed, even though it was based on a Republican idea; and Iraq was a success even though it was a mess.The G.O.P. became an accretion of ideas that ossified over the years without the party ever stopping to ask afresh: What world are we living in now? What are the dominant trends? And how does America best exploit them by applying conservative values and market-based solutions?The cynicism of today\u2019s G.O.P. could not have been more vividly displayed than when Marco Rubio, John Kasich (a decent guy) and Ted Cruz all declared that they would support the party\u2019s nominee, even if it was Trump, right after telling voters he was a con man. No wonder so many Republicans are voting for Trump on the basis of what they think is in his guts. All the other G.O.P. candidates have none.But even if his support is weakening, Democrats take Trump lightly at their peril. He is still sitting with three aces that he hasn\u2019t played yet. They could all come out in the general election.One ace is that if he wins the nomination he will have no problem moving to the center to appeal to independents and minorities. He will have no problem playing the moderate unifier \u2014 and plenty of people will buy it, saying: \u201cWhy not give him a chance? He says he can make us winners.\u201d Sure, Mexico will have to pay for that wall, Trump will say, but it will be in \u201cinstallments.\u201d Deport 11 million illegal immigrants? C\u2019mon, don\u2019t you know an opening bid on an immigration bill when you hear one? Ban all Muslims? Well of course we can\u2019t ban a whole faith community, but Trump will vow to be much harder on visas from certain countries. Have you never read \u201cThe Art of the Deal\u201d?His second ace is that given the position he staked out on terrorism, if, God forbid, there is a major terrorist attack on our soil between now and Election Day, Trump will reap enormous political benefits. Watch out. I\u2019ve seen how one well-timed terrorist attack tilted an Israeli election.His third ace is that he will indeed go after Hillary Clinton in ways you never heard before and that will delight and bring back a lot of disaffected Republicans, whose hatred of Hillary knows no bounds. \u201cDid you hear what Trump said about Hillary last night? That she was \u2018Bill\u2019s enabler!\u2019 Finally! I will vote for him just for that.\u201d Again, beware.But Trump is also holding two jokers with those aces. One of the lessons I learned covering the Middle East is that the only good thing about extremists is that they don\u2019t know when to stop \u2014 and in the end, they often do themselves in. See: Saddam Hussein.Trump has already gone places no candidate ever has, even telling us he has a big penis. One day he may go too far (if he hasn\u2019t already) and sever his gut connection with voters. Trump\u2019s other joker is that among those attracted to his gut are racists and fascists with a taste for violence at his rallies. One day they may go too far and do something so ugly, so brownshirt, it will also turn people off to his gut.In short, only Trump can trump Trump. Don\u2019t count on it, but don\u2019t count it out.Frank Bruni is off today.Advertisement"}

He mentioned that he begins the show wearing only an eye mask and a pair of tighty whities. \u201cO.K.,\u201d she told him. \u201cDo some push-ups.\u201dMr. Walker has. To attain Patrick\u2019s pantherlike physique, his menacing grace, he works out with a personal trainer five mornings a week and on his own the other two. \u201cI feel like he should be attractive but scary, prison-ripped,\u201d Mr. Walker said. He said he had a few more weeks to achieve the look.Hold on to your Cavariccis: we\u2019ve got a quiz all about \u201980s references in the Broadway musical \u201cAmerican Psycho.\u201d\u201cAm I getting there?\u201d he asked a reporter. \u201cI need a woman\u2019s perspective.\u201d This reporter, somewhat flustered, told him that yes, he apparently was. As if to celebrate, Mr. Walker took a sip of his protein shake, another part of his regimen. \u201cIt\u2019s disgusting,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s chalk water.\u201dThis physical transformation is only a small part of the work that Mr. Walker must tackle to become Patrick Bateman. He tried to read the book as a college student but gave up when he found it too unsettling. \u201cIf the first 40 pages are giving me nightmares,\u201d he said, \u201cI think I\u2019d better stop.\u201dHe has since finished the novel, coming to terms with the darkness of the character, the violent sexuality and the obsession with shiny consumer goods.[Read our critic\u2019s assessment of Mr. Ellis\u2019s novel and its place in our culture 25 years after its controversial publication.]His wife, the actress Kaya Scodelario, teases him when he mispronounces the names of fashion designers \u201cover and over again,\u201d he said. If his rehearsal wardrobe \u2014 gray hoodie and gray sweatpants \u2014 is any guide, Patrick\u2019s fashion sense has yet to rub off on him.Yet Mr. Walker said he tries not to judge Patrick, or any character he plays.\u201cI think it is counterproductive to look at someone and go, I would never do that, I would never be like that,\u201d he said. He is fairly sure that everyone has the capacity for horrific acts, given the right circumstances. \u201cThere\u2019s a bit of Patrick Bateman in all of us,\u201d he said.Rupert Goold, the musical\u2019s director, has always considered Mr. Walker a natural fit for Patrick, if only by contrast. \u201cThe sweet guys often play the psychos,\u201d he said before the run-through. He noted that while Mr. Walker\u2019s early approach to the role had emphasized all that was \u201cpsychotic, dangerous, showy, glossy,\u201d he has since delved further into the character. \u201cI think he\u2019s come to something much more about alienation, loneliness, despair,\u201d Mr. Goold said.Mr. Walker does seem to have captured some of that coldness. During the run-through, his eyes seemed chillier, his lips thinner, his charisma seductively remote. \u201cEveryone talks about how psychopaths are incredibly charming,\u201d said Mr. Sheik, the composer. \u201cThat\u2019s part of their makeup. Ben certainly does that really well, but you see the underneath that\u2019s seething inside.\u201dOf course, Broadway requires a certain kind of swagger. And a musical like \u201cAmerican Psycho,\u201d which received mixed reviews in London and is something of a box-office risk, may need even more of it. It took both the novel and the film adaptation many years to achieve their status, a luxury Broadway can\u2019t afford.On one recent Tuesday, we spent an hour each with a dozen upcoming Broadway shows as they worked under looming deadlines. From the costume shop to the first curtain call, here's how the steps and stories, the stitches and salesmanship come together.Fortunately, Mr. Goold said, Mr. Walker exudes a \u201cdevil may care\u201d attitude that allows him \u201cto come out wearing almost nothing and say, \u2018I\u2019m the most important, special person in the world.\u2019\u201dCertainly, it takes fearlessness to begin a Broadway musical emerging nearly nude from a tanning bed. Rob Ashford, who directed him in \u201cCat on a Hot Tin Roof\u201d and costumed him only in a towel for the first act, knows that Mr. Walker has it. \u201cHe\u2019ll give anything a go,\u201d he said in a telephone interview. \u201cHe is open to everything.\u201dMr. Ashford added admiringly, \u201cHow does he do it?\u201dHe also has trouble believing that he is sexy, which to anyone who has seen him onstage will seem very sweet or very delusional. \u201cI guess it hadn\u2019t occurred to me,\u201d he said. Then he shrugged. \u201cI\u2019ve been called worse things.\u201dFor now, playing the role doesn\u2019t feel all that glamorous. There are too many workouts, too many protein shakes, too many dinners of sliced turkey. He is also worried about how the role might stay with him after the curtain falls. \u201cMy wife, she\u2019s such a sanctuary and a refuge that I don\u2019t want to bring that stuff home,\u201d he said.By the time he arrives back at their apartment in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, he is usually too tired to wallow in Patrick\u2019s psychosis. Yet during work hours, he has found unexpected sympathy for his character. \u201cI feel bad for him,\u201d Mr. Walker said, adding almost as an afterthought, \u201cOf course, I feel also bad for the people that he hurts.\u201dCan he really feel sorry for a man who would hack up an office rival or eviscerate a snooty neighbor? Surely, this is extreme. \u201cDoes it seem extreme?\u201d he asked with apparent interest. \u201cI\u2019m in it, I can\u2019t tell.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Ann Patchett\u2019s Nashville Bookstore Hits the Road, With Dogs in Tow", "Date": "2016-03-24", "News": "Supported by7 PhotosNashville\u2019s newest bookstore is an old van.The bright blue bookmobile, which hit the road this week, is a roving offshoot of Parnassus Books, a popular independent bookstore. It will roam around town, stopping at food truck rallies, farmers\u2019 markets and outside restaurants.The arrival of a bookstore on wheels is a fitting evolution for Parnassus, which is co-owned by Karen Hayes and the novelist Ann Patchett. The store\u2019s name comes from Christopher Morley\u2019s 1917 novel \u201cParnassus on Wheels,\u201d about a middle-aged woman who travels around selling books out of a horse-drawn van.Since Parnassus opened in 2011, Ms. Hayes has wanted a traveling bookstore of her own. She looked at taco trucks and ice cream trucks and felt envious of their freedom to take business wherever people gathered, she said.\u201cA bookmobile made so much sense, because food trucks work so well in this town,\u201d Ms. Hayes said by telephone. \u201cIt\u2019s a great way to get our name out there, too. It\u2019s a rolling advertisement.\u201dMs. Hayes found the van on eBay last spring, and bought it for $10,000 from a library in Georgia. The van was already outfitted with angled shelves, which keep the books from flying off, but still needed $20,000 worth of work.It is a logical and efficient way for a small bookstore to expand its footprint, especially as big chains have shuttered locations, leaving a vacuum for enterprising independent stores to fill. A handful of independent stores around the country have taken the trade on the road, in an effort to stir up business and bring books to neighborhoods and suburbs without a bookstore. Little Shop of Stories, an independent store in Decatur, Ga., used a grant from the author James Patterson to turn a used school bus into a mobile bookstore. Fifth Dimension Books, a bookmobile in Austin, Tex., stocks a rotating selection of science fiction and fantasy books from its collection of 100,000 volumes.Bookmobiles are not about to become as prevalent as food trucks. But their arrival in Nashville and other cities offers another encouraging sign that independent stores are thriving again, after years of decline. Sales at bookstores rose 2.5 percent in 2015 over the previous year, to $11.17 billion, for the first annual increase since 2007, according to the United States Census Bureau.Dozens of small bookstores across the country are opening multiple locations, expanding into mini chains. Books Inc., a San Francisco Bay Area independent store, now has 11 locations. Third Place Books in Seattle will soon open a new store, its third. Greenlight Bookstore, a prominent independent store in Fort Greene, Brooklyn, is opening a second Brooklyn store in Prospect-Lefferts Gardens.In 2015, the American Booksellers Association counted 1,712 member stores in 2,227 locations, a big jump from 2009, when the group had 1,401 stores in 1,651 locations.\u201cThe trend is unmistakable, and we see it not only continuing but growing,\u201d said Oren Teicher, the ABA\u2019s chief executive.Parnassus is expanding too. It will double in size, adding 2,500 square feet of retail space, when it takes over a recently vacated storefront next door. Its owners considered looking for a second location, but decided the book van would be a better way to expand the store\u2019s geographic range and customer base.The van packs around 1,000 books, mostly new releases and best sellers \u2014 a small fraction of Parnassus\u2019s stock of 20,000 books. Its owners have managed to make the cramped space bright and inviting: customers can walk the narrow aisles between the shelves, and can linger and sample books on one of the padded blue benches.\u201cOne of my hopes is that we\u2019ll be able go into some of the outlying suburbs and cities that don\u2019t necessarily have a bookstore,\u201d said Grace Wright, a Parnassus bookseller who will manage the bookmobile. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing like a good bookstore.\u201dAnother bonus: the physical bookstore has four resident dogs \u2014 Opie, Belle, Mary Todd Lincoln, and Bear \u2014 who love riding around town, Ms. Wright said.\u201cThey seem to have fun in the bus,\u201d she said.An earlier version of a home page headline about this article misspelled the surname of the author behind the Nashville bookmobile initiative.

{"Headline": "Court Sets Deadline for a Volkswagen Diesel Fix, but Solution Could Prove Elusive", "Date": "2016-03-24", "News": "Supported by\u201cI haven\u2019t heard anything\u201d from the automaker about a solution, said Mr. German, the owner of a 2010 Audi A3 diesel compact wagon in Ithaca, N.Y. \u201cAre they just lying low and hoping this whole thing goes away? It\u2019s a little bit strange.\u201dVolkswagen missed a court deadline on Thursday to present a plan to bring the cars into line with clean air rules, but Judge Charles Breyer at United States District Court in San Francisco gave the company an extension until April 21.If no agreement is reached with the federal government, customers and dealers, a trial would be held this summer to determine what measures Volkswagen should be compelled to make and how much owners would be compensated.Volkswagen admitted that 11 million of its vehicles were equipped with software that was used to cheat on emissions tests. This is how the technology works and what it now means for vehicle owners.Lawyers trying to reach a settlement said during the hearing that they had made \u201csubstantial progress\u201d toward a solution. \u201cThe engineers are working around the clock,\u201d Robert Giuffra, a lawyer for Volkswagen, said during the hearing.The longer it takes for Volkswagen to come up with a way to stop the cars from spewing illegal levels of pollution, the greater the fines it is likely to have to pay the United States government. Car owners themselves face no legal jeopardy, but any repair is also likely to reduce fuel economy and cause parts of the emissions system to wear out more quickly. That will hurt the cars\u2019 resale value, and raise the amount Volkswagen must pay the owners as compensation.Some experts question whether it is even possible to make the cars in the United States conform to the law at a reasonable price. Those experts also cast doubt on the company\u2019s assertion that only a few low-level employees were responsible.People who have closely examined Volkswagen engine technology say that one reason the company cheated in the first place was that its engineers were unable to resolve a fundamental conflict in emissions technology, at least not at a price that fit their budget.Measures that reduce output of nitrogen oxides, which can cause lung ailments, automatically increase production of soot particles, which can cause cancer.If Volkswagen had turned up the equipment that reduced the nitrogen oxides, the additional soot output would have increased the need for the engine to periodically flush the particle filter by spraying diesel fuel into the exhaust system. That in turn would increase fuel consumption and raise the chances the car\u2019s particle filter would become overburdened and break down.That trade-off between soot and nitrogen oxides remains difficult and costly to resolve despite advances in technology since the diesels in question went on sale in the United States. In Europe, it was not as big a problem because limits on nitrogen oxides are not as strict. The few rival companies who sold diesel in the United States addressed these challenges with more expensive pollution-control technologies.Volkswagen, however, was intent on producing lower-cost, small cars and was in a major push to rebuild sales in the United States.Among them is Felix Domke, a self-described hacker who lives in L\u00fcbeck, Germany, who, on eBay, bought an example of the computer used by Volkswagen in its vehicles. He also examined the computer that came with his own car, a Volkswagen diesel van.He showed how the software adjusted variables like the amount of exhaust gas that was recycled back into the motor, one of the methods used to minimize harmful emissions. The software was precisely calibrated to track the simulated city, rural and highway driving that cars undergo during official tests on rollers in laboratories.Outside the cycle \u2014 in other words, under actual on-the-road driving conditions that regulators would not normally see \u2014 the computer turned down the emissions controls in a way that eased the burden on the particle filter, while also saving fuel.Daniel Lange, a former information technology executive at the German carmaker BMW who also spoke at the hackers\u2019 conference, expressed skepticism about Volkswagen\u2019s view that the software manipulation was the work of a small number of low-level employees.Software is heavily documented and it is very unlikely that engineers would have taken the risk of modifying the software without approval at a high level of management, Mr. Lange said in an interview.\u201cIt\u2019s completely unrealistic that a lonely engineer\u201d would have been responsible for the cheating, said Mr. Lange, who is founder and chief executive of Faster IT, a technology consulting firm.Volkswagen has not explained who inside the company was responsible for creating one of the biggest corporate scandals of the last decade. But in a German court filing last month, the company said that members of its management board \u201chad no knowledge of the rule violation.\u201dThe engine control software and onboard computer were provided by Bosch, one of the largest suppliers of electronic components for the auto industry. Bosch has been named along with Volkswagen as a defendant in class-action lawsuits filed by owners of Volkswagen-brand cars.Bosch declined to comment on the lawsuits or provide details about the way the engine software works, citing investigations by the authorities.The Bosch software, also used by other carmakers, can be customized for different vehicles and motors. One question for the courts will be whether Bosch shares any blame because of the relative ease with which the software could be used as a \u201cdefeat device\u201d to evade emissions tests.Another question is why Volkswagen\u2019s top managers never asked themselves why their engineers succeeded where others had failed in producing relatively inexpensive diesel cars that met American standards on nitrogen oxides, which are stricter than those in Europe.\u201cI was beating up on \u2019em pretty hard,\u201d Mr. Lutz said. \u201cThey\u2019re doing it and we can\u2019t? Nobody could figure out how they were complying and their engine technology is very similar to everybody else\u2019s.\u201dMr. German, the owner of the 2010 Audi, who recently moved to Ithaca from Austin, Tex., said by phone that he would gladly accept the car at its prescandal book value, with perhaps a little extra to cover \u201cthe hassle factor.\u201d According to Kelley Blue Book, an Audi A3 like Mr. German\u2019s was worth about $16,300 before the emissions cheating became known and about $14,370 now.\u201cI don\u2019t want my car anymore,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "George Osborne Warns of Brexit Risks and Cuts Growth Forecasts", "Date": "2016-03-16", "News": "Supported byLONDON \u2014 In a budget meant to appeal to voters before a looming referendum, Britain\u2019s chancellor of the Exchequer, George Osborne, on Wednesday mainly offered tax breaks, while warning the public against the risks of opting to quit the European Union.Despite a worsening economic outlook and a downward revision of growth forecasts, Mr. Osborne postponed billions of pounds of further reductions in public spending that he would need to keep his budget plans on track, while offering some significant tax cuts for individuals and businesses.The most controversial item was a new tax on sugary soft drinks, a measure meant to combat childhood obesity. The leader of a soft-drink industry trade group dismissed the tax as \u201cabsurd.\u201dOver all, though, Mr. Osborne\u2019s budget statement seemed intended to avoid antagonizing key groups of voters before the June 23 referendum on whether Britain should remain in the 28-nation European Union or leave it in a so-called Brexit.Mr. Osborne, who like Prime Minister David Cameron, favors staying in the European Union, warned of economic instability if Britain votes for Brexit.\u201cBritain will be stronger, safer and better off inside a reformed European Union,\u201d Mr. Osborne said in Parliament, adding that \u201cwe should not put at risk all the hard work that the British people have done to make our country strong again.\u201dHe added that turbulent financial markets, low productivity in Western nations and a weak outlook for the global economy made for \u201ca dangerous cocktail of risks.\u201dThe budget is expected to be approved by Parliament, coming as it does from the treasury chief of the controlling Conservative Party.The most unexpected initiative was the sugar tax on the soft-drink industry. This would apply, starting in April 2018, to drinks with a total sugar content above 5 grams per 100 milliliters, with a higher rate for beverages with more than 8 grams per 100 milliliters. Milk-based drinks and fruit juices would be exempt.\u201cFive-year-old children are consuming their body weight in sugar every year,\u201d Mr. Osborne told lawmakers, adding that \u201cone of the biggest contributors to childhood obesity is sugary drinks.\u201dThe plan to target soft drinks, but not other products with a high sugar content, was derided as \u201csimply absurd\u201d by Gavin Partington, director general of the British Soft Drinks Association, which says it represents a range of British manufacturers, importers and suppliers.\u201cWe are extremely disappointed by the government\u2019s decision to hit the only category in the food and drink sector which has consistently reduced sugar intake in recent years \u2014 down 13.6 percent since 2012,\u201d Mr. Partington said in a statement.Mr. Osborne\u2019s budget also announced moves to close tax loopholes, including one in which foreign suppliers use sites like eBay and Amazon to sell goods without paying Britain\u2019s sales tax, known as the value added tax.Britain\u2019s economic picture has worsened in recent months. Official growth forecasts for 2016 were revised downward on Wednesday, to 2 percent, compared with the 2.4 percent predicted earlier.The revised projections are based on the assumption that Britain stays in the European Union. The Office for Budget Responsibility, whose job it is to provide an independent analysis of public finances, had warned of \u201can extended period of uncertainty\u201d about Britain\u2019s relationship with the bloc if there was a vote to leave, Mr. Osborne said. That comment prompted protests from opponents of European Union membership that Mr. Osborne had quoted selectively from the report.Despite slower than expected growth, corporate tax rates will be cut to 17 percent by 2020.The amount that people can earn without paying taxes will rise, as will the earnings threshold that they need to cross before moving into a higher tax bracket.There were also tax concessions for the struggling North Sea oil and gas industry and a freeze on taxes on fuel and many types of alcohol. The capital gains tax would be cut to 20 percent, from 28 percent.Mr. Osborne missed one objective by failing to ensure that government debt would fall this year as a proportion of the country\u2019s gross domestic product.Jeremy Corbyn, leader of the opposition Labour Party, said on Wednesday that the budget had \u201cunfairness at its very core\u201d and that Mr. Osborne had \u201cfailed on the budget deficit, failed on debt, failed on investment, failed on productivity, failed on the trade deficit.\u201dPostponing further public spending cuts of 3.5 billion pounds, or $4.9 billion, until the fiscal period 2019-2020, Mr. Osborne remains on track to hit his target of a surplus by the end of the decade.But in aiming to meet this objective \u201cwithout squeezing the economy harder now, Mr. Osborne has backloaded the fiscal pain,\u201d Ian Stewart, chief economist at Deloitte, the business advisory firm, said in a statement. As a result, Mr. Stewart said, the government would need to find spending cuts of \u00a38 billion in 2019-20.\u201cMr. Osborne is hoping that, in the run-up to the next general election, the U.K. will be better placed to cope with the squeeze needed to wipe out the deficit,\u2019\u2019 Mr. Stewart said.\u201cHitting the government\u2019s most important and most cherished fiscal target,\u201d he added, \u201cwill need hard slog and luck.\u201dAn earlier version of the headline for this article misspelled the surname of Britain\u2019s chancellor of the Exchequer.

It was a vote of confidence for digital commerce in the Middle East, which has made little headway compared with elsewhere.Souq, the largest e-commerce company in the Middle East, was founded in 2005 on an eBay-like online auction model, but it subsequently evolved into more of an Amazon-style set-price retailer. It has been a rare success story in a region where online businesses face logistical problems, political challenges, stifling bureaucracy and regulations that vary greatly from country to country.Souq\u2019s latest round of funding included money from the New York-based investment firm Tiger Global Management, as well as from Standard Chartered Private Equity and the International Finance Corporation, which is an arm of the World Bank.Souq, which means market in Arabic, did not provide details on what the funding round meant for its overall valuation, and it has not released details on its annual sales or profit. The $275 million funding round was, however, the largest ever disclosed by a technology start-up in the Middle East and North Africa, according to Wamda, a research firm based in Dubai, the United Arab Emirates.Even after multiple fund-raising rounds, the Jabbar Internet Group \u2014 which sold Maktoob, a news site, to Yahoo for more than $150 million in 2009 \u2014 still holds a majority stake.\u201cThe start-up scene has changed so much since Souq launched over 10 years ago,\u201d Ronaldo Mouchawar, the chief executive of Souq, said in an interview, \u201cand the size and scope of this kind of funding is encouraging for entrepreneurs.\u201dMr. Mouchawar said the company would use the funds to bolster its technology, such as payment processing, and to help increase the scale of its operations by improving logistics. Souq also hopes to introduce new product categories, particularly related to beauty and fashion, and to recruit employees, he said.In particular, it will look to improve its mobile application; Mr. Mouchawar noted that 70 percent of purchases from Souq in Saudi Arabia, the Middle East\u2019s second-biggest market, were made on phones.Souq, now the largest online retailer in the Arab world, ships hundreds of thousands of products across the six countries of the Gulf Cooperation Council: Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. It also has operations in Egypt.\u201cMost local retailers \u2014 whether they will openly admit it or not \u2014 are fully aware that customers can find products cheaper online, whether locally or on global sites,\u201d said Alexandra Tohme, an independent e-commerce analyst with more than a decade of marketing experience in the region. \u201cIn some cases, even heavy items with shipping charges still generate savings of up to 50 percent compared to brick-and-mortar stores.\u201dMs. Tohme said Souq\u2019s particular success was driven by competitive prices compared with other retailers in the region, and by its reputation for reliable delivery.Several other online retailers have tried, and failed, to overcome the myriad difficulties of e-commerce in the Middle East.Barriers to trade across the region remain high and include tariffs, varying national laws and different currencies. Political instability can also be an obstacle in countries like Egypt, whose population of nearly 90 million has endured heightened levels of violence since an uprising in 2011. The high costs associated with online retail can also discourage start-ups.As a result, several major online retailers have struggled: Joob, an online travel website started by the Jabbar Internet Group, folded with little explanation a year after its introduction in 2011; the German start-up fund Rocket Internet closed Mizado, an Amazon copycat, in 2012, after just five months of operation, to concentrate on the online shoe retailer Namshi, it said. That same year, the online daily deals website LivingSocial abruptly exited the Middle East.The market\u2019s potential remains attractive, however.\u201cBy the end of the decade, two-thirds of the region will have smart devices \u2014 supercomputers in their pockets \u2014 which means increased innovation, problem-solving and purchasing power,\u201d said Christopher M. Schroeder, an American venture capitalist.Advertisement"}

Typically it\u2019s Rosie the Riveter buttons or something so anti-feminist that people think it\u2019s kitschy-feminist, like the 1960s board game, \u201cWho Will I Marry?\u201d or the book \u201cHow to Deprogram Your Valley Girl.\u201d I try to find the weirdest thing at the cheapest price. Usually, I don\u2019t find much \u2014 but in 2004, this came up when I searched. The title said \u201cfeminist art\u201d and it was described as a natural wood sculpture. It\u2019s not carved or sculpted except where someone cut off the top and bottom. To me, it looks like a super hairy vagina that has pants on \u2014 hairy vagina pants! And the legs are in this slouchy but confident posture, a little bit like wearing Gap boot-cut jeans. None of it \u2014 I have to repeat, none of it \u2014 is sculpted.This piece feels like it\u2019s giving a nod to 1970s feminist artists who had wonderful ideas, but also really essentialist ideas that people have rightly criticized them for. I\u2019m obsessed with the women who get called essentialists and get thrown in the garbage, and then none of their ideas get talked about. It\u2019s like, \u201cWell, that person did central core imagery work and believed in this binary system of male and female and therefore all their ideas and art are stupid.\u201d But then you look at something like Judy Chicago\u2019s \u201cDinner Party.\u201d It\u2019s one of the most important pieces of feminist art. It changed the art landscape forever, but it was in her garage being ruined, in the essentialist trash can, until it wound up at the Brooklyn Museum. We\u2019re not going to keep moving forward if we don\u2019t look at people\u2019s ideas from the generation before and say, \u201cThis part is totally interesting, and this part totally pisses me off.\u201d We should be critiquing, but we don\u2019t need to throw the baby out with the bathwater. I saw this sculpture as something that would be in that essentialist trashcan and I was like, \u201cI have to save it!\u201d I had to save it because I also saw it as a feminist historical object. And since someone was getting rid of it for cheap, it fits with my obsession with the erasure of feminist artists.When I was a young feminist I would have looked at the sculpture and been like, \u201cThat\u2019s so messed up, oh my God, it\u2019s like a woman\u2019s torso chopped off. It\u2019s the vivisection of women.\u201d I would have been totally self-righteous about it. But I fell in love with it on so many levels. I was like, \u201cIt makes me laugh. It makes me cry.\u201d The piece is funny to me, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s un-feminist that I think it\u2019s funny. I imagine these two girlfriends found it in the woods and thought it was funny, brought it home, got stoned and got out the drill, put it on this triangle base and were like, \u201cThis is art.\u201dAnd who decides if it\u2019s art? It\u2019s like God. You have to have faith. It\u2019s like saying, \u201cI believe this is art, and therefore it\u2019s art.\u201d You can think it\u2019s just some stupid thing off of eBay, but I believe it\u2019s a really great piece of art because it\u2019s funny and it makes me think.My favorite part about obtaining this piece was bidding on it. For a while, I was bidding against someone and I wanted to know who the other person was. My fantasy was that we would get into a crazy bidding war and we would end up being best friends. I wanted to meet whomever was bidding against me. I\u2019d tell them I really wanted it and they would be like, \u201cOkay, you can have it!\u201d or \u201cI\u2019ll share it with you. I\u2019ll meet you at the coffee shop every so often.\u201d But then the person just stopped bidding!I\u2019m moving right now and this was the first thing I unpacked from the first box that I opened. It\u2019s moved with me to four different apartments, and who knows where it was before me! I have lots of pictures and paintings and sculptures in my house and I\u2019m always thinking that I\u2019m going to move stuff around, hang the wall like a gallery, but I never do. But this piece \u2014 I move it to wherever I\u2019m spending the most time \u2014 I want it in my eye line.This interview has been edited and condensed.Advertisement"}

She had spent weeks obsessing over her dinner date, even wearing the same fragrance.\u201cI remember her coming through the revolving door, and there was this dappled light coming through the windows, so I couldn\u2019t quite see her face,\u201d Ms. Paulson said. \u201cBut I had studied her physical mannerisms so much that I could tell by her walk and her hands, the way she was pushing. And then, of course, the one thing I could see was that mole, illuminated and kissed by the sun.\u201dIn walked Marcia Clark.They ate, ordered tequila and talked for so long that they closed the place down.\u201cThat\u2019s the first thing people say when they hear \u2018Marcia Clark,\u2019\u201d Ms. Paulson said. \u201cThey don\u2019t even think \u2018lawyer.\u2019 They just think \u2018hair.\u2019\u201d Next week\u2019s episode, \u201cMarcia, Marcia, Marcia,\u201d covers Ms. Clark\u2019s midtrial makeover, which only brought her more criticism.Ms. Paulson, for her part, found the sudden attention \u201csurreal.\u201d She has tried to keep her distance from the hubbub but acknowledged, \u201cMy choices in romantic partners have not been conventional, and therefore the idea that it is \u2018other\u2019 makes it compelling.\u201dBut she has been wary of labeling her sexuality, for fear of being \u201cskewered\u201d should she change her dating habits later on.\u201cIf my life choices had to be predicated based on what was expected of me from a community on either side, that\u2019s going to make me feel really straitjacketed, and I don\u2019t want to feel that,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat I can say absolutely is that I am in love, and that person happens to be Holland Taylor.\u201dThe women first met at a dinner party about a decade ago, when Ms. Paulson was still with Ms. Jones. Nevertheless, she thought that Ms. Taylor was \u201cprobably the most exquisitely beautiful woman I\u2019d ever seen.\u201dMs. Paulson said she had never seriously dated anyone her own age. \u201cThere\u2019s a poignancy to being with someone older,\u201d she observed. \u201cI think there\u2019s a greater appreciation of time and what you have together and what\u2019s important, and it can make the little things seem very small. It puts a kind of sharp light mixed with a sort of diffused light on something. I can\u2019t say it any other way than there\u2019s a poignancy to it, and a heightened sense of time and the value of time.\u201dShe has always gravitated toward her elders, she added, beginning in junior high school. \u201cI had a complicated home life, and my teachers, predominantly my theater teachers and my English teachers, were very dedicated to taking care of me in a particular way,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd in doing so, I think I developed a very easy rapport with people older than myself.\u201dMs. Paulson was born in Tampa, Fla., in 1974. When she was 5, her mother, an aspiring writer, moved her and her younger sister to New York, leaving their father, an executive at a door-manufacturing company, in Florida. They got a small apartment in Queens and slept on a mattress on the floor. Ms. Paulson\u2019s mother worked as a waitress at Sardi\u2019s while taking writing classes on the side.By the time Ms. Paulson was in seventh grade, the family had moved to Park Slope, Brooklyn, and she had discovered the stage at the private school Berkeley Carroll. A teacher there told her about a high school where she could study acting, and she enrolled at the Fiorello H. LaGuardia High School of Music & Art and Performing Arts in Manhattan.She booked her first professional acting job months after graduation, understudying for Amy Ryan in Wendy Wasserstein\u2019s \u201cThe Sisters Rosensweig\u201d on Broadway. \u201cI opened the door and I said, \u2018Mom I got the part!\u2019\u201d she recalled. \u201cAnd her first response was, \u2018Oh, no, you\u2019re really going to do this?\u2019\u201dShe was at a friend\u2019s house in Brooklyn in 1994 when the notorious white Bronco chase took over the airwaves. By then, Ms. Paulson was a fledgling 19-year-old actress whose focus, she admitted, was \u201cdecidedly self-interested.\u201d She idolized Julia Roberts, whose image had been plastered all over her high school locker, and envisioned herself becoming a similarly \u201cglamorous, glitzy, charming\u201d leading lady.\u201cShe\u2019s effortlessly tough,\u201d Mr. Sorkin said. \u201cShe\u2019s always honest, there\u2019s never a false note. She\u2019s warm, sexy, incredibly funny and very, very smart. There\u2019s no such thing as \u2018a Sarah Paulson type.\u2019\u201d\u201cShe just has a real faculty for being somebody else,\u201d said Ryan Murphy, a co-creator of \u201cAmerican Horror Story\u201d and an executive producer and director of \u201cAmerican Crime Story.\u201d \u201c\u2018If I said, \u2018Sarah, next year you\u2019re going to play Pope Francis,\u2019 she\u2019d say, \u201cO.K.!\u2019\u201dMr. Murphy first met her on his show \u201cNip/Tuck,\u201d and was amazed by her dead-on impersonations of Kathleen Turner and Holly Hunter. \u201cShe does a hilarious impersonation of me, which I also love,\u201d he said.Her profile has risen in recent years thanks to a string of celebrated films including HBO\u2019s \u201cGame Change,\u201d Steve McQueen\u2019s \u201c12 Years a Slave\u201d and \u201cCarol,\u201d in which she played the former lover of the title character, played by Cate Blanchett.So varied are her characters that it is hard to point to any quality they share, although Ms. Paulson offered that \u201cthey\u2019re all survivors, in a way.\u201d Ms. Clark, for instance, endured relentless taunts about her appearance and messy home life during the Simpson case in the days before Internet trolls.\u201cTo me, her biggest mistake was being so ill prepared for the onslaught of circus activities surrounding the trial,\u201d Ms. Paulson said.During filming of the O. J. series, Mr. Murphy advised her not to seek out Ms. Clark so that she could arrive at a characterization on her own. But six episodes in, she got the green light. By then, she had already asked Ms. Clark, through a mutual acquaintance, what perfume she wore during the 1995 trial (Lanc\u00f4me\u2019s Magie Noire), then scoured eBay for a vintage specimen and wore it on set, despite its \u201cfecund earthy dirt scent.\u201d (Ms. Clark now wears Acqua di Gio and \u201csmells much better,\u201d Ms. Paulson added.)\u201cI like it when I don\u2019t recognize myself,\u201d said the actress, who wears Le Labo\u2019s Musc 25 when she wants to smell like herself.To Mr. Murphy, she has been both muse and confidante. \u201cSteve McQueen thinks she\u2019s like Bette Davis, and I think that\u2019s true,\u201d he said. He also attested to her spunky social presence: \u201cThere is nobody who is a bigger life of the party than Sarah Paulson.\u201dInevitably, her success has intensified the spotlight on her free-spirited romantic life. Like Ms. Clark, whose private travails were once splashed across the tabloids, Ms. Paulson never sought out the attention. But she does accept it as a fact of life.\u201cMarcia didn\u2019t ask for any of it,\u201d she said. \u201cI didn\u2019t ask for any of it, but some of it comes with the job.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Watch Master at Work", "Date": "2016-03-18", "News": "Supported byLE SOLLIAT, Switzerland \u2014 It is extremely difficult to get a watch made by Philippe Dufour, whom peers often refer to as a \u201cliving legend\u201d or \u201cthe pope of watchmaking.\u201d Internet forums are filled with questions from collectors asking how they can obtain one.Mr. Dufour, who makes each watch by hand, says he has a waiting list with almost 200 names. Since each watch takes months to make, the 67-year-old may not be able to work his way through the list \u2014 and that harsh reality only serves to make his watches more sought-after. Those who are fortunate enough to buy a Philippe Dufour watch are in luck in more ways than one. \u201cMost watches, like cars, depreciate in value the second you own them,\u201d Mr. Dufour said. \u201cMine double or even triple in value.\u201dOne of his Duality watches, originally 70,000 Swiss francs in 1997, the equivalent of about $70,500 today, was sold at a Christie\u2019s auction 10 years later for 180,000 francs. And in 2012 Sotheby\u2019s sold a Grande and Petite Sonnerie wristwatch from 1992 for $620,720. (The entry level price for one of his Simplicity watches \u2014 \u201cshould I decide to make it\u201d \u2014 is about 90,000 francs.)But the appeal of a Philippe Dufour watch is not just its rarity, but its beauty.The Espace Horloger, the watch museum of the Joux Valley in Switzerland, showcases one of Mr. Dufour\u2019s Simplicity watches as the most superb example of modern watchmaking: elegant and refined on the outside, a marvel of handmade complications inside.He \u201cis known and respected worldwide for his art and craftsmanship,\u201d said Vincent Jaton, the museum\u2019s director. \u201cPhilippe has his way of doing, working his movement, to prepare his watch so that it becomes perfect in every detail: technical and finishes. One could say that the watch is a work of art.\u201dHodinkee, a website that reports on the watch world, says he is considered \u201cthe greatest living watchmaker.\u201d The French magazine Le Point has called his watches \u201cmasterpieces.\u201d And to Forbes magazine, Mr. Dufour is, quite simply, \u201cthe god of watches.\u201dWatches made entirely by one person, start to finish, are increasingly rare, Mr. Dufour said. \u201cThe more centralized watchmaking becomes, the less knowledgeable are the people,\u201d he said \u201cYoung people know how to make this part or that, but very few know how to make everything.\u201cAt factories they need more machine operators than they need watchmakers. So the schools don\u2019t teach it,\u201d he continued. \u201cFiling is done by machine now, so there\u2019s no need to teach how to file.\u201dThings were different in his day. Mr. Dufour was born in 1948 in Le Sentier, a village in the Joux Valley, the heart of Swiss watchmaking. \u201cWhen I finished at the local school, I crossed the street and went to the \u00c9cole Technique,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is there I learned how to make a watch.\u201dUpon graduation, he worked down the street at Jaegar-LeCoultre with the promise that the company would send him abroad. The 1968 riots in Paris prevented his being sent there, so he was posted to London, where \u201cI trained employees so they could service watches.\u201d He also worked two years overseeing watchmaking in Ste. Croix, and he and his wife traveled around the United States in a van for six months.Back in the Swiss valley, he did stints at G\u00e9rald Genta and Audemars Piguet, then went on his own and restored watches for five years. It was a pivotal experience. \u201cI learned so much doing that, seeing what the old people did, and they did it with less equipment,\u201d he said. \u201cI was inspired to make my first Grande Sonnerie movement.\u201d He eventually made a Grande Sonnerie Minute Repeater pocket watch. \u201cIt took me 2,000 hours to make it \u2014 a whole year. But I couldn\u2019t sell it because nobody knew me.\u201dSo he took it to Audemars Piguet in the neighboring village of Le Brassus and the house ordered five watches \u2014 five years of work. But the agreement bothered Mr. Dufour: \u201cI wasn\u2019t allowed to say I made it.\u201d So he made his own Grande Sonnerie Minute Repeater but with a new twist. \u201cI made it wristwatch size,\u201d he said. \u201cIt took me 2.5 years. I took it to Basel in 1992, under my own name.\u201dA star was born.On a drive around the cluster of famed watchmaking villages \u2014 Le Brassus, Le Sentier, Le Solliat \u2014 housing the biggest names in watches, Mr. Dufour talked about growing up here, amid the modest farmhouses and grazing cows.His memories were tinged with sadness as he recalled how some of the big watch companies had taken over smaller ones owned by the watchmakers he and his father and grandfather, all working with watches, had grown up with. The corporations, he said, \u201ccame, and in a week, they removed the old names and put their own.\u201dWatchmaking began in Switzerland, Mr. Dufour said, when farmers had little to do in the dead of winter and turned to creating movements. You can tell which farmhouses harbored watchmakers, he added, by looking at the windows. \u201cSee,\u201d he said, pointing to a farmhouse, \u201cthere is a stretch of windows\u201d under the eaves. \u201cThat\u2019s a watchmaker\u2019s atelier. You need good light to work.\u201dOne stretch of windows belonged to Louis Fran\u00e7ois Reymond, who in 1778 made a watch for the king of France. His farmhouse is next door to Mr. Dufour\u2019s atelier, the plain gray building on the road out of Le Solliat that previously was the school building where his three daughters were educated. He shares the space with a retiree and a cheesemaker, and a discreet business card printed with \u201cPhilippe Dufour, Horlogerie Compliqu\u00e9e,\u201d marks his mailbox.Inside his workshop are a number of work benches, each with a function and each piled with the hundreds of tools needed to perform it. \u201cThis one is for filing, that one for pivoting,\u201d yet another for gem cutting.There also are dozens of cabinets with tiny drawers holding thousands of parts and tools. One belonged to Reymond; another, to Mr. Dufour\u2019s grandfather, and is filled with his tools. His photograph is on a wall nearby, next to a window with a view of snowy hills.When Mr. Dufour had assistants, each had his own desk. \u201cBut they come, they learn and they lose motivation and leave,\u201d he said.His daughter also worked for him for a while, but the arrangement didn\u2019t work out. \u201cI was her father at home,\u201d he said, \u201cbut her boss in here.\u201d She now works for Patek Philippe.Recently, a former colleague at Audemars Piguet has worked with Mr. Dufour with the sole aim of training new workers. \u201cI\u2019m tired of training,\u201d Mr. Dufour said.And fans often make pilgrimages to the atelier. Some bring offerings, including expensive pipes because he loves to smoke.Photographs he keeps in a folder document the customer anecdote he considers most touching. A doctor in Japan, who has decorated his waiting room with photos of Mr. Dufour\u2019s watches, allows his cancer patients to wear his own Simplicity watch. He has sent the watchmaker photos of them with the watch strapped to their wrists, big smiles on their faces. \u201cThe doctor said it makes them happy, and that gives me great pleasure,\u201d the watchmaker said, \u201cthat I have been able to give pleasure to people around the world.\u201dMr. Dufour is wary of visitors; the atelier was broken into in May and he believes it was done by someone who had been in the workroom before. Some old parts he had on display were taken, as well as one of his Simplicity watches that later turned up on eBay being sold from Romania. One of Mr. Dufour\u2019s collectors bought it and returned it to him as a gift.Luckily he had kept his current work in progress locked up in a safe: a Grande Sonnerie Minute Repeater wristwatch, 11 months in the making, only the seventh ever made.What comes next? \u201cMaybe I sell my business to the Chinese,\u201d he said. \u201cMaybe I collaborate with a big house.\u201dHe said he isn\u2019t ready to retire. \u201cWhen I no longer get pleasure from what I do, I will stop.\u201d For now though, he still loves making watches: \u201cI come to my atelier every day, even Sunday. I may not stay all day, but I have to go if even for just an hour or two.\u201d He smokes his pipe and listens to Mozart and works.Advertisement"}

Sometimes it\u2019s a reward after completing a tour or maybe just finishing a good performance or maybe because he sees or hears of a special one and just can\u2019t resist. \u201cI like the look of watches,\u201d he said. \u201cI also collect guitars, and I don\u2019t play, but I love the way they look.\u201dMr. Singer said he also loves the engineering: \u201cThere\u2019s this little machine on my wrist, made by hand, that\u2019s counting time with such precision. It\u2019s fascinating.

It was so cool \u2014 I could see the man in the moon. He owned a Gallet mini chronograph, the world\u2019s smallest chronograph. I thought it was just a cool stopwatch.\u201dMr. Singer recalled that his father, who was band leader for the Meyer Davis band and his own Johnny Singer Orchestra, gave him his first watch, a mechanical timepiece from Germany, when he was just 5 or 6 years old.\u201cMy mother gave me a mechanical Swiss Glycine watch for Christmas when I was about 13 or 14,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd my grandmother gave me a Timex LCD with crystal display when I graduated from high school.\u201dHe didn\u2019t buy his own watches until he became established in the music business.\u201cI arrived in L.A.\u201d \u2014 where he still lives \u2014 \u201cin 1983 driving a Subaru hatchback with my clothes in a box,\u201d he said. \u201cI wasn\u2019t making any money to buy watches.

People had no interest in mechanical watches then.\u201cYou can\u2019t do that any more,\u201d he added. \u201cThanks to eBay and the Internet there are no more rare finds.\u201dHe found himself drawn to chronographs, thanks to his father\u2019s influence (\u201cI get sentimental about his watches\u201d), and is fond of dive watches. \u201cI like the look of them,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re big, durable and adaptable.

They go with any style or setting.\u201dMr. Singer has lots of watch trawling tales: \u201cWhen I was in Japan touring with Brian May, one of my favorite guitar players \u2014 he used to play with Queen \u2014 I treated myself to a Jaeger-LeCoultre Duoface Reverso in stainless steel.\u201dDuring the 2008 Kiss tour, he snapped up a Blancpain 50 Fathoms and a 500 Fathoms to celebrate the tour\u2019s end; last year bought another 50 Fathoms but this time in 18-karat rose gold.\u201cYou don\u2019t think of a dive watch being in rose gold,\u201d he said, adding, \u201cIt\u2019s a beautiful, well-made watch, with a great movement. There\u2019s a simplicity to it as well, so people might not recognize the brand. I like that.\u201dHowever, Mr. Singer said, he is no match for some watch fans. \u201cAlice Cooper is a big watch guy,\u201d he said. \u201cWe would go out looking for watches when we were on tour. He would buy a watch every day. He would come on the bus and say, \u201cEric, watch of the day!\u201dThe watch he was wearing while he spoke on the phone: an Omega Seamaster 300 Co-Axial in stainless steel.Mr. Singer knows what he\u2019s doing when he buys. \u201cI\u2019m not book smart. I never went to college,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I have lots of life experience, and I have common sense.\u201cIf I don\u2019t know something I look it up. I read tons and tons of information \u2014 watch books, watch magazines, watch forums,\u201d he continued. \u201cI don\u2019t participate but I look to see people\u2019s different points of view.\u201cExposing yourself to different points of view, that\u2019s how you become worldly. I\u2019ve been to Basel a number of times and I keep my eyes and ears open, and I ask questions. There\u2019s no such thing as a dumb question.\u201dAsking questions and reading he was able to find out about what may be his most unusual piece: a Patek Philippe gold pocket watch from the 1920s inscribed: \u201cFrom the Leper Colony of Molokai to Tandy MacKenzie.\u201d It seems Mr. MacKenzie was an opera singer and the pocket watch was given to him by the Hawaiian compound in appreciation for his performance.What\u2019s next on Mr. Singer\u2019s wish list? \u201cSomebody stole my Glycine\u201d \u2014 the watch his mother gave him \u2014 \u201cwhen I was playing on stage.

{"Headline": "Sotheby\u2019s and Christie\u2019s Adapt to Digital Age", "Date": "2016-03-11", "News": "Supported byArt for TomorrowThe top art auction houses had a carefree and comfortable time of it for most of the first couple of centuries of their existence, but lately they have been hustling to adjust to a radical transformation of their industry. New digital technology and new customers with new attitudes in new places, along with new competition from deft and nimble upstarts eager to cater to them, have forced the dominant companies, Sotheby\u2019s and Christie\u2019s, to develop new ways to do business.They are responding to the challenge by throwing their money and names around, buying or forming looser affiliations with rivals that understand the shifting realities of the marketplace, including a collector base increasingly inclined to buy art online and on the go, better than they do because the arrivistes helped create those realities. \u201cBusinesses need to evolve, and although the auction process has been around close to forever, the technology changes things; the way the market works changes things, and so does the global nature of the market,\u201d said Suzanne Gyorgy, global head of art advisory and finance at Citi Private Bank, a subsidiary of Citigroup. As with many businesses, the Internet presents the greatest threat to the established order in the art market and the greatest opportunity, too. Online art sales in 2014 reached 3.3 billion euros, or about $3.6 billion, according to the latest edition of the European Fine Art Foundation annual report. That represents about 6 percent of the global market in art and antiques and a 32 percent increase from 2013. Global auction sales totaled \u20ac24.6 billion in 2014, the report said. That was 48 percent of the market, but it marked just a 9.3 percent gain on the year before and was barely over the \u20ac24 billion recorded in 2007, the previous high-water mark. Tefaf and other organizations that monitor the market, such as Hiscox, an insurance company that specializes in art, among other niches, foresee growth of about 25 percent a year in online sales for the rest of the decade. To grab a piece of the action, the auction industry leaders have expanded vigorously online. Christie\u2019s, in 2011, set up an online-only auction platform that held 79 sales in 2015, said Jennifer Ferguson, a company spokeswoman. Last year Christie\u2019s bought Collectrium, a digital art collection management service. \u201cWe have made important hires to support a new marketing and content strategy in both print and digital across all our platforms, as well as strategic digital acquisitions,\u201d Ms. Ferguson said. \u201cNone of this happened in just the last 12 months, but has been happening over the last five years.\u201d Sotheby\u2019s raised its profile online last year when it began streaming its auctions live on eBay, the all-purpose auction website. \u201cWe want to create more channels and more ways for our collectors to be able to engage in and buy things that they love,\u201d said David Goodman, Sotheby\u2019s executive vice president for digital development and marketing.Perhaps more important, arrangements such as this give the company access to customers they might not have had otherwise. \u201cWe\u2019re able to see a different group of people from what we would normally have in the consignment auction process,\u201d Mr. Goodman said. \u201cIt\u2019s a way to expand our distribution and our brand and introduce new people to the world of collecting. We\u2019re excited about the momentum we\u2019re seeing in the online space.\u201d The marketplace is expanding in the real world, too, and auction firms are taking varied steps to cater to new buyers. Sotheby\u2019s recently bought Art Agency Partners, which provides collectors with advice on art, legal and investment matters. The acquisition is expected to help Sotheby\u2019s expand and enhance its private sales, an activity that the industry sees as a more lucrative way to sell art than the traditional auction business. Among the moves that Ms. Ferguson highlighted at Christie\u2019s is the opening of offices in Shanghai and in Mumbai, India, part of an effort that \u201chas helped nurture new growth across both the emerging collector and established collector sectors.\u201d The collectors that have emerged from places like China and India have become a critical segment of the global art market. They have been sources of tremendous growth for auction houses, but also sources of volatility and consternation. China accounted for 27.3 percent of global art transactions in 2014, according to a Citigroup report, compared with just 0.2 percent in 2000. But after years of surging growth, the Chinese art market, like its economy and stock market, has been slumping lately. Auction sales of Chinese contemporary art dropped 41 percent last year, according to a report by ArtTactic, a London firm that analyzes the art market. The report noted that sales in other Asian markets took up some of the slack, rising 14 percent in India, for instance, and 28 percent in Southeast Asia. In a survey of industry experts by ArtTactic, 19 percent more respondents said they expected the Chinese art market to shrink this year than to expand, worse than for any market except Russia. India was considered to have the best prospects, with a net 48 percent positive on the market. The American and European markets combined had a 16 percent net favorable assessment. The possibility that Chinese art sales may be leveling off leads Benjamin R. Mandel, global strategist for multi-asset solutions at J.P. Morgan Asset Management, to warn that the next 15 years for the global art market may not be as fruitful as the last 15. He is also concerned that the trend toward ever more extravagant prices for a handful of works amid so-so growth elsewhere is bound to reverse. \u201cChina\u2019s extraordinary period of catch-up growth has largely played out, while the inequality in auction prices may reach some natural limit,\u201d Mr. Mandel wrote in a recent report. \u201cAs a result, the slowing of these factors could subtract up to a third from the annual growth of the global market; that is, global growth would be on the order of 9 percent, rather than 13 percent.\u201d Whether or not the auction houses are taking such forecasts to heart, they are easing back on the splashy evening sales that they\u2019re best known for by combining different genres of art, such as Impressionism and Postwar Contemporary, and bunching sales together on the calendar. They present the moves as a means of catering to clients with eclectic tastes, but they also may reduce costs. The more traditional competition that auction houses face comes from brick-and-mortar galleries, and they are adapting and contributing to the evolution of the market, too. Alessia Zorloni, adjunct professor in art markets at Libera Universit\u00e0 di Lingue e Comunicazione IULM, in Milan, observed a trend among galleries to abandon the middle ground. \u201cThere are two choices for dealers today, either to run a lightweight, cost-effective operation that supports young artists or adopt the mega-gallery model,\u201d she said. \u201cThe high-end art market is controlled by a few dozen operators and characterized by a small number of large and powerful galleries, often organized as real commercial companies with a wide network of connections with other galleries, and in the most important cases, with branches in other cities.\u201d These galleries trade on the value of their brands and reputations, Ms. Zorloni said, just as the auction houses do. These are important aspects of any business but especially in one like art where the value of the main product is hard to calculate and based on subjective criteria. That\u2019s why the auction industry faces little threat at the top end from online entities, in her view. \u201cIf you think about this feature of the art market, there will never be competition with websites, even mainstream ones like Amazon and eBay,\u201d she said. \u201cThey are simply different market segments appealing to different customers. The power of auction house brands will remain strong. Not only do auction houses have access to first-class works, but obviously they also have access to the clientele that no one dealer can compete with.\u201d As time goes on, auction companies may embrace the distinctions between market segments even further: providing a premium service for high-end collectors centered on a few evening sales while using extensive online abilities to grant greater access to the market, with fewer frills, to a growing number of customers with thinner wallets. \u201cThe number of buyers in the art market has increased so dramatically in the last five years,\u201d said Ms. Gyorgy, of Citi Private Bank. \u201cDeveloping an online presence is really smart.\u201d As for the marquee sales, \u201cpeople really like the auction experience,\u201d she said, adding, \u201cIt\u2019s some of the best theater in town, but it\u2019s expensive theater to put on.\u201dAdvertisement"}

His first boss at J. Walter Thompson was James Patterson, who had not yet become the best-selling author of thrillers. Mr. Patterson became his mentor, role model and, eventually, collaborator. In the last few years, he has hired Mr. Grabenstein to co-write several of his popular middle-school series, including \u201cI Funny,\u201d \u201cHouse of Robots\u201d and \u201cTreasure Hunters.\u201dBut Mr. Grabenstein credits another superstar novelist, Stephen King, with giving him the confidence to quit advertising. \u201cHis book \u2018On Writing\u2019 convinced me I could write books,\u201d said Mr. Grabenstein, who remembers being a wordsmith since the fifth grade, when he won an essay contest sponsored by the Signal Mountain Lions Club, in a suburb of Chattanooga, Tenn.Mr. Grabenstein found his muses as a child and never abandoned them. \u201cRocky and Bullwinkle are a big influence on me,\u201d he said, referring to the cartoon characters from one of the first prime-time animated network series, known for its use of puns in episodes like \u201cThe Guns of Abalone\u201d and \u201cRue Britannia.\u201d \u201cThe show got me playing with words.\u201dHis collection of Pinocchio dolls and puppets in the living room dates back to adolescence. \u201cThe Pinocchio thing started when my high school girlfriend gave me a Jiminy Cricket.

{"Headline": "We\u2019re More Honest With Our Phones Than With Our Doctors", "Date": "2016-03-23", "News": "Supported byOn TechnologyIn the late 1960s, an undergraduate psychology student at Wellesley College named Martha McClintock noticed something interesting: Women who spent a majority of their time together tended to get their periods around the same time. She suspected that menstruating bodies could influence one another somehow, but it was just a hunch. So she asked 135 of her fellow students to keep track of their cycles. Three times that year, she quizzed them about their period start and which women they socialized with the most.Initially, it seemed McClintock was right: Close-knit groups of friends tended to start their periods together. The phenomenon of menstrual synchrony was nicknamed the \u201cMcClintock effect,\u201d and her work was lauded as one of the first mainstream studies to demonstrate how one person\u2019s body chemistry can trigger responses in another\u2019s. But McClintock\u2019s results have been difficult to replicate; now, the scientific consensus is that cycles probably don\u2019t sync up \u2014 a claim that rings untrue to anyone who menstruates. My friends and I joke that we even seem to sync up digitally, thanks to constant contact via iMessage, Snapchat and Twitter.The unresolved nature of McClintock\u2019s investigation, now almost 50 years old, underscores the unnerving amount of opacity that still surrounds women\u2019s health. Even today, it\u2019s difficult for women to get a sense of what\u2019s normal and what isn\u2019t. When my friends and I talk about our bodies, we compare feedback from physicians, all of which seems to be slightly different; we warn one another about conditions like uterine fibroids and share horror stories about different methods of contraception. There still seems to be a combination of prudishness and ignorance around the unique, and sometimes idiosyncratic, functions of the female body \u2014 which is shocking, considering half the world is born with one.But in recent years, mobile technology has granted me and countless others the ability to collect an unprecedented amount of information about our habits and well-being. Our phones don\u2019t just keep us in touch with the world; they\u2019re also diaries, confessional booths, repositories for our deepest secrets. Which is why researchers are leaping at the chance to work with the oceans of data we are generating, hoping that within them might be the answers to questions medicine has overlooked or ignored.The researchers found the data collected via Clue to be more detailed \u2014 and more accurate. \u201cThe data is as close to real time as we can get,\u201d McDonald said. They hope their young participants will be more comfortable telling a faceless app about personal health matters \u2014 a slump of depression, gross blood clots, irritated bowels \u2014 than telling a doctor. And it\u2019s not just teenagers; most of us are willing to be much more honest with our phones than with professionals, or even with our spouses and partners. We look up weird symptoms and humiliating questions on Google with the same ease that we search for the name of a vaguely familiar character actor. For many of us, our smartphones have become extensions of our brains \u2014 we outsource essential cognitive functions, like memory, to them, which means they soak up much more information than we realize. When we hand over this information willingly, the effect is even greater.Both scientists say that the app has opened up endless possibilities for their research, because it offers a way to rethink \u2014 and potentially overhaul \u2014 how women\u2019s health is studied. \u201cWe think we know about menarche, because we\u2019ve been looking at it for decades,\u201d Houghton said. \u201cBut there\u2019s still so much to study.\u201d Clue can collect more than just period start dates. It can also gather data on things like bleeding and pain patterns, energy levels and sexual activity, allowing researchers to put old wives\u2019 tales to the test of scientific rigor.Ida Tin, a founder of Clue, hopes that the app will eventually be able to do its own studies, publish findings and loop them back into the app. For example, Clue could recommend users who report high menstrual irregularity to talk to their physicians about polycystic-ovary syndrome, a common (but often hard to detect) disorder that can contribute to obesity, diabetes, high blood pressure and heart disease.It wasn\u2019t until a friend introduced me to period-tracking apps in my 20s that my body became something I understood intimately, that it was more familiar than foreign. Initially, I was skeptical, but the apps were password-protected, which made me feel comfortable being honest about what I was actually feeling and with whom I was actually sleeping. After a few months, the apps weren\u2019t just a repository of daily facts; they had become a legible map to my body. My period no longer caught me off guard, and I eventually learned to connect the arc of my cycle to changes in mood, appetite, fatigue and sex life, and adjust my routines accordingly. By now, I have years of data about my periods and an extremely accurate understanding of how my body works: when I\u2019m likely to experience cramps and breast pain, when to skip yoga and social outings because I\u2019ll need more sleep. All my life, my doctors tended to be vague, making my bodily functions seem ultramysterious, when in fact they are just individualized, and easily understood with the assistance of software.By divulging every last detail to these apps, we make them incredibly valuable \u2014 but also potentially ruinous, if our most sensitive records were to fall into the wrong hands. Clue repeatedly talked up its airtight security, and I currently believe the company about that, just as I once believed eBay\u2019s, Snapchat\u2019s and Evernote\u2019s claims that their services were safe. And yet each was hacked, eventually. These days, breaches are inevitable, which presents an impossible dilemma. The only conclusion I\u2019ve come to is that we have to evaluate each new relationship to hardware and software individually and assess the trade-offs. Clue has this on the \u201cpro\u201d side of the ledger: McDonald, Houghton and Tin all believe Clue will settle the debate over McClintock\u2019s research.Jenna Wortham is a staff writer for the magazine.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "For One Los Angeles Designer, Jewelry Mingles With Fine Art", "Date": "2016-03-23", "News": "Supported byHome and Work14 PhotosAfter graduating from New York\u2019s School of Visual Arts in 2001, she worked for the New York-based jewelry designer Philip Crangi before relocating to Los Angeles in 2008. She landed in a Craftsman fourplex in Silver Lake; her neighbors were Roman Alonso, of the then-emerging design studio Commune, who gave her freelance work, and the bag designer Clare Vivier, with whom she went on to share a studio. Eventually, Bentley took over the space and transformed it into the Dream Collective shop, which she opened in 2012.The following year she moved to Montecito Heights, a quiet, hilly neighborhood a few miles east of Silver Lake. It was her version of going electric \u2014 both professionally and domestically. \u201cWhat I had been making at the time just happened to be \u2018the thing,\u2019 and suddenly my jewelry was everywhere,\u201d she says, referring to the mystical symbols she used in her jewelry when she first launched her diffusion brand. (She also has a fine jewelry line.) \u201cI was like, please, no more snakes and evil eyes \u2014 can we move on?\u201d So she did. \u201cI went less antiquated and Old World \u2014 and my house reflects that too. Before, I had a lot of Navajo rugs and could not miss a flea market. Now, the design is clean; it speaks for itself.\u201dShe found an airy, two-level midcentury home on a cul-de-sac, and discovered that she already knew its owner, Josh Kritzer, the founder of the vintage lighting gallery Rewire. He had enlisted the Neutra and Schindler expert Eric Lamers to restore the space, and lived there with his then-girlfriend, Amanda Bacon, the founder of the pressed-juice shop Moon Juice. \u201cI was not the highest offer, but Amanda insisted that Josh sell me the house, because she\u2019s all spiritual,\u201d Bentley says. \u201cShe did me a solid.\u201d Built in 1965, the 1,100-square-foot blueprint is set on a 5,000-square-foot lot that includes a terraced backyard with walnut, loquat and lemon trees dating back to the \u201960s \u2014 as well as agave, lavender, white sage and tangerine and grapefruit trees cultivated by Kritzer.For the interiors, Bentley traveled to Morocco to buy a selection of midcentury and \u201980s and \u201990s-era rugs. From there she slowly amassed interesting pieces: a Matteo Grassi dining set from the estate sale of a Dow Chemical heir, a pair of Mario Bellini chairs she found on eBay, a brash, craggy ceramic vessel purchased directly from the L.A. artist Roger Herman and, more recently, a custom maple and linoleum credenza commissioned from the independent furniture maker Doug McCollough.Every item testifies to her gift for collecting unusual, handmade works \u2014 as well as her support for the people behind them. \u201cI don\u2019t really think of it as decorating \u2014 each thing holds this special experience, this story of getting the piece,\u201d she says. \u201cEverybody that I have art from is a friend first. I don\u2019t think I would connect with the work if I didn\u2019t know the person.\u201d That group also includes the artist Sarah Ball, who built Bentley\u2019s bleached-white-oak bed, and whose photographs, which depict everyday objects in unconventional compositions, dot the space throughout. Still, the look is spare. \u201cI left this place a tiny bit empty to allow room for someone else to move in, but I have not met the right person yet,\u201d Bentley says. \u201cI\u2019m taking it as an opportunity to focus on my art.\u201dShe does this in her upstairs studio, where an array of architectural ceramics \u2014 some her own, others by friends Bari Ziperstein, Cody Hoyt, Laida Aguirre and Sean Brian McDonald \u2014 is on display. A white oak Enzo Mari desk is currently covered with collages Bentley has made from the graphic envelope liners of junk mail; there are paintings in progress too, but those, she admits shyly, are hidden away.Bentley keeps her jewelry design separate, working in the studio in the back of her boutique, and her latest accessories reveal an obsession with the Memphis Milano group, including a black and white striped bronze and enamel cuff dubbed the Noguchi bracelet. \u201cI want to take a little bit more risk \u2014 to explore and go a little bit bigger,\u201d she says of her guiding stylistic impulse. An ongoing flirtation with the postmodern movement also manifests itself in the d\u00e9cor, from an Ettore Sottsass table lamp to the boldly color-blocked bedding, a scheme that stars a linen duvet Bentley hand-printed with cobalt ink in a spongeware pattern. (The textile arose from a collaboration last year with furniture designer Shin Okuda of Waka Waka.)\u201cI don\u2019t buy things anymore, or at least, there\u2019s no impulse buying,\u201d she says. \u201cI have the things I want. And it\u2019s a nice place to be, at least for now.\u201d The sentiment seems to encompass her career stage as well as her relatively incognito coordinates, which allow for breathing room and retreat. \u201cThere is no cool coffee shop over here, and it\u2019s such a relief,\u201d she agrees. \u201cI make coffee here.

{"Headline": "25 Songs That Tell Us Where Music Is Going", "Date": "2016-03-10", "News": "By Nitsuh AbebeBy then, though, the song had become such an intense focus of discussion at the digital water cooler \u2014 to the point where it felt difficult to turn on a computer without someone\u2019s views about \u201cFormation\u201d and its various sociopolitical valences reaching out and grasping for your throat \u2014 that my not having heard it acquired some kind of political dimension. A decision had to be made. Either I needed to dutifully consume this object of conversation and develop an opinion about it or I needed to develop a defense of why I hadn\u2019t yet done so.The point being: Here, for a moment, was music that actively dragooned me into paying attention to it, based not primarily on sound, performance or composition, but on the rolling snowball of perspectives, close readings and ideological disputes accreting around it.It\u2019s songs that do this now; individual songs and mass opinion, working in tandem. This wasn\u2019t always the case. We\u2019ve spent the past century or so trying, in creaky and convulsive ways, to figure out what music is even for, and how we intend to use it. When and where will we listen to it? Will other people be there? Should people own music? Who should write it \u2014 the performers? What\u2019s a normal amount to release at once? How will we find out about it? Will there be pictures? Are you absolutely, definitely sure we have to pay money for it? For the moment, there\u2019s only one answer to these questions that seems to connect strangers in a truly monocultural way: We shall gather in huge, fawning riots around towering pop singles to trade politicized takes on them.It\u2019s not the worst thing. One of the great tricks of pop music is that no matter how much we like to imagine it\u2019s about musicians expressing themselves, it tends to be more useful as a way for listeners to figure out their own identities: Each song lets us try on a new way of being in the world. For a long while, the idea was that young people could use music to shape their style \u2014 their clothes, their haircuts, their sense of cool. Then came high-speed Internet and a touching enthusiasm for the idea of playlists: With so much of the world\u2019s music at our fingertips, we\u2019d express our intelligence and taste by playing D.J. and curator, sorting through songs to assemble our own reflections. That didn\u2019t last, either. Showing off your eclectic, handpicked treasures? This has become such a common online performance that there\u2019s no one left in the audience.So these days it\u2019s the song, and the scale of the event surrounding it. One song, one digestible thing, with millions of people standing in a circle around it, pointing and shouting and writing about it, conducting one gigantic online undergraduate seminar about it, metabolizing it on roughly the same level that cable-news debate shows metabolize a political speech. This is an ever-greater share of the public life of music. A song like \u201cFormation\u201d isn\u2019t set up as a story, or an interior monologue \u2014 it\u2019s set up as Beyonc\u00e9, the public celebrity whose biography you already know, addressing the world, like an op-ed with drums. Thus can we argue not about what the song says to us, but about what we think the rest of the world needs to be told, and whether Beyonc\u00e9 is telling it right. What do we make of her dancers\u2019 Black Panther styling? Is she \u201callowed\u201d to work with beloved artists from New Orleans or use references to the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina? How does the song sound through a feminist lens, through a queer lens, through an anticapitalist one? Can we have a conversation about her daughter\u2019s hair, and also about police violence? People talked about these things until, three days in, I\u2019d been quoted every last line of a song I still hadn\u2019t heard.How the pop star won us back with a disappearing act.By Mary H.K. ChoiThe second single from \u201cPurpose,\u201d Justin Bieber\u2019s fourth studio album, \u201cSorry\u201d is an infectious confection \u2014 a Dorito for your ears. There are two official videos for it: a dance video that stars a diverse cast of young women who seem to have been dressed by magpies let loose in a Delia\u2019s catalog; and a lyric video, which is sort of like that footage they use in karaoke bars, but slightly more polished. Between the two, there have been well over 1 billion views. At no point in either does the Canadian heartthrob appear. He simply doesn\u2019t need to.In previous years, by contrast, he was everywhere. He had transformed in the public eye from a teen-star brat to a grown-up brat, with the D.U.I. arrest to prove it. He had become a hollow hashtag of a person. When he visited the Anne Frank house, he wrote in the guest book that he sincerely hoped Frank would have been a \u201cBelieber.\u201d Not only did he come off like Joffrey Baratheon with a Hitler-youth haircut, his callow bad-boy affectation reeked of a keening need to be cool \u2014 anathema, as any teenager can tell you, to actually being cool. But the backlash to the backlash is here, and much like both videos, it has less to do with Bieber \u2014 the actual Bieber \u2014 than you\u2019d expect.Because get this: The most inspired part of Justin Bieber\u2019s reinvention is its erasure of all previously identifiable Bieberish elements. \u201cSorry\u201d is unlike anything Bieber has made in the past. It has been classified as \u201ctropical house\u201d and \u201cdancehall,\u201d but everyone seems to agree on one thing: It\u2019s a banger. The song is about a relationship Bieber has screwed up, and in the lead-in to the hook, he asks, \u201cIs it too late now to say sorry?/\u2019Cause I\u2019m missing more than just your body.\u201d But by the time the actual chorus arrives, Bieber lets the production take over: All you hear is a cooing arpeggio that feels like a gentle breeze on your brain. It\u2019s the best part of the song, and Bieber seems to appear in it only as a sample.This song is a triumph of music over narrative in the hellscape that is the pop music-industrial complex. Consider, for example, the confusing, protracted drama of Kanye West\u2019s latest album release, which involved a huge fashion show, several tweet storms and title changes all leading up to \u201cThe Life of Pablo,\u201d a record that\u2019s being finished in real time on a platform no one wants to pay for.So what is it, exactly, that we want from Bieber? Likability? Yes, Justin Bieber is a contrivance. Yes, Justin Bieber\u2019s lyrics are insipid \u2014 worse still, disingenuous. Yes, his tattoos stink. Yes, he\u2019s lousy at skateboarding. But what does any of this actually matter? In case you missed it, Bieber won. You used to hate him, and now it\u2019s pointless. So who\u2019s sorry now? \u2666Even if you can\u2019t score tickets, the cast album is its own transcendent experience.By Wesley MorrisThere\u2019s being locked out of heaven. Then there\u2019s being locked out of \u201cHamilton.\u201d And with all due respect to Bruno Mars (and God), being locked out of \u201cHamilton\u201d is crueller \u2014 as farce, but still. The musical is sold out \u2014 for, like, ever. And the resale market has achieved spit-take-level hilarity. To wit, this Craigslist ad: \u201cI bought tickets for the wrong night. These are legitimate \u2018Hamilton\u2019 tickets for Friday March 11, 8 p.m., purchased though Ticketmaster. I just want to get back what I paid for them. Great seats! $933.80 per ticket.\u201dBack on Earth, there\u2019s the cast album: a 46-number souvenir for an experience most of us won\u2019t be experiencing. At less than $20 on iTunes, however, where it has been in and out of the Top 10 for months, and Amazon, this is a more-than-adequate substitute for the budget-conscious. It\u2019s a gateway to obsession. To know someone who has this album is to know someone who needs a restraining order.This is to say that the cast recording is its own experience. In an age in which the album is notional \u2014 musical Tupperware \u2014 this one works as a complete concept and doubles as its own playlist, crammed with jams. There are King George\u2019s long-distance interludes, in which, under the mostly brown circumstances, white power sings the same, out-of-style song over and over and over. Meanwhile, the first five numbers alone \u2014 \u201cAlexander Hamilton\u201d; \u201cAaron Burr, Sir\u201d; \u201cMy Shot\u201d; \u201cThe Story of Tonight\u201d; and \u201cThe Schuyler Sisters\u201d \u2014 get halfway to a greatest-hits collection. Pilfered dabs of R.&B., show tunes, rock and rap recombine until identifying whatever you think you\u2019re hearing becomes its own sport.The rapping that Hamilton, played by Lin-Manuel Miranda, the show\u2019s creator, does at the start of the song sounds like some sweaty couplet from LL Cool J\u2019s \u201cI Need Love\u201d from 1987. The \u201cnos\u201d from the ensemble echo the \u201cwhoas\u201d and \u201cheys\u201d from Naughty by Nature\u2019s \u201cHip-Hop Hooray,\u201d from 1993. When Miranda gets to the chorus (\u201cLord, show me how to/Say no to this/I don\u2019t know how to/Say no to this/But my God, she looks so helpless/And her body\u2019s saying, \u2018hell, yes\u2019\u201d) handclaps and guitar licks gently join the percussion and bass line. And suddenly all I can hear is Champaign\u2019s 1981 love jam, \u201cHow \u2019Bout Us.\u201d Pairing those Greek-chorus \u201cnos\u201d with the ecstatic sounds of a harp as Hamilton and Mrs. Reynolds (presumably) do it generates moral tension. The bass line is where \u201cSay No to This\u201d gets both its erogenous nerve and antique heat. Your head spins as the song proceeds to combine sounds from a half-dozen old-school districts.The Karl Ove Knausgaard of grumpy independent musicians.By Sam Hockley-SmithMark Kozelek, who used to front an epically moody band called Red House Painters, is known as something of a jerk. Onstage, when not singing in a voice like crumbling granite, he says things that usually end up offending somebody: hipsters, women, journalists, the band on the next stage. But on the records he now releases as Sun Kil Moon, he examines his life with plain-spoken brutality, saving the most cutting remarks for himself.\u201cI Watched the Film the Song Remains the Same\u201d occupies more than 10 minutes of \u201cBenji,\u201d the album he released in 2014. It begins as the story of the first time Kozelek saw the Led Zeppelin concert film \u201cThe Song Remains the Same\u201d as a child; it ends as a song about nostalgia, chronic sadness and the way people drop in and out of your life. One moment Kozelek\u2019s admiring the electric piano on \u201cNo Quarter\u201d; the next, he\u2019s sharing memories of being a \u201cvery melancholic kid,\u201d or apologizing for the time he punched a classmate in school. The way he writes isn\u2019t so different from Karl Ove Knausgaard, also in his late 40s; both men spent long careers skirting the spotlight, then found new renown when they started excavating their own biographies for details.So on \u201cBenji,\u201d Kozelek sings about his relationship with his parents, about buying lampshades, about death. A second cousin\u2019s death sets him thinking about family; James Gandolfini\u2019s sets him thinking about his prostate troubles. He approaches each topic as if flipping through a disorganized photo album, and the more insular and lived-in the details, the more enthralling they seem. At the end of \u201cI Watched the Film ... ,\u201d he says he\u2019s headed to Santa Fe to visit a friend he hasn\u2019t seen in 15 years. Close Googlers can deduce that friend must be Ivo Watts-Russell, who signed Red House Painters to his 4AD label back in 1992; Kozelek, grave and grateful, says he\u2019s going to New Mexico just to say thank you. \u2666How to chart your own path in a post-label music industry.By Jenna WorthamWatch the virtual-reality film that accompanies this article by downloading NYT VR.The women in attendance seemed especially mesmerized by Sydney Bennett \u2014 better known as Syd tha Kyd \u2014 the frontwoman, whose Tiger Beat sex appeal gave her performance a depth charge. Bennett, 23, brown-skinned with a blond-tinged Mohawk, has the swayback stance of an adolescent skater and dresses like one too: On the \u201cKimmel\u201d set, she wore black vans, a black T-shirt and black jeans low on her hips. As she sang, she roamed across each quadrant of the small stage, staring deep into the throng, as if to find out whether her crush had bothered to make an appearance at the show. To create her stage presence, Bennett studied the R.&B. singer D\u2019Angelo, whose 2000 video for \u201cUntitled (How Does It Feel)\u201d features nothing but his extremely defined and extremely nude upper body dripping with sweat for four and a half minutes. It showed. Bennett flirted with the crowd, peeking at them through her heavily lashed eyes, shooting sly smiles at fans and gently lifting her chin to acknowledge those she knew \u2014 among them, her mom, Janel, and her godmother, Sheryl.The TV appearance was a rarity for the members of the Internet, who, as their name suggests, live online and work from home. Two of the band\u2019s three albums were created and recorded almost entirely at the house where Bennett lives with her parents in L.A.\u2019s Mid-City neighborhood. But their most recent record, last year\u2019s \u201cEgo Death,\u201d caught the attention of the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences, and it was nominated for a Grammy in the Best Urban Contemporary Album category. (Past nominees in the category include Frank Ocean, Rihanna and Beyonc\u00e9.) The \u201cKimmel\u201d performance was a dip into mainstream media that the Internet has largely succeeded without.The band\u2019s name itself hints at an irreversible and inevitable shift in the way music works. For decades, the music industry fancied itself an apparatus for tastemaking, but as technology has made labels\u2019 role less relevant, that has ceased to be the case. Listeners decide what\u2019s popular now, and record labels have to find a way to attach themselves to it. Aside from a few big-name acts, most artists are doomed to languish in relative obscurity with middling profits. This is usually seen as a tragedy \u2014 the death of a musical middle class \u2014 but it has also presented an opportunity for artists to avoid the suffocating effects of the label machine. And so the Internet has carved out an entirely new corner of R.&B., thanks mostly to Bennett: an androgyne who sings seductive incantations about falling in and out of love with women.After the performance, a small constellation of cousins, little sisters and girlfriends milled about, snacking on doughnuts in the greenroom and helping the band pack up. After the equipment was loaded into a caravan of modest sedans and S.U.V.s, the band stood in a circle behind the studio, and someone produced a celebratory blunt. As the smoke drifted overhead, the conversation turned to the next day.The group needed to practice for the first stop on their upcoming tour, which would start a few days later in Japan. Jameel Bruner, who plays the keyboard, wouldn\u2019t be able to come until he was done with his shift at Amoeba Music, where he works as a clerk. There was drama to discuss, too. The 17-year-old guitar player, Steve Lacy, had been photographed smoking weed, and someone had texted the picture to his mother, who was not happy. Despite the chilly El Ni\u00f1o air, the band lingered, seeming reluctant to leave and break the spell of the evening. They eventually agreed to regroup at their home base, Bennett\u2019s house, to make sandwiches, catch their performance on \u201cKimmel,\u201d smoke again and, eventually, crash.The new virtual-reality film from NYT VR takes you inside Sydney Bennett\u2019s home studio as the Internet prepares for a world tour. You\u2019ll experience the rehearsal process as Bennett teaches her band a new song, then get onstage with the band as they perform it for the first time.Turner may have been reacting to the banality of the question, but his answer also illuminated a changing dynamic for rap, which has historically been categorized by regional sounds. People Turner and Bennett\u2019s age are defined by a completely different geography, the social networks and websites they spend their time on. Odd Future was the epitome of this new statelessness: They were neither engineered by a label nor hometown heroes, but something wildly different.Odd Future dominated many conversations about pop culture and the future of music by the end of 2010. They had released all of their early work \u2014 a barrage of clever mixtapes, striking artwork and bizarro music videos \u2014 for free on Tumblr and YouTube. Their sound was prodigious. And not only was their music different but they also looked different too, a bunch of black weirdos who skated in their free time and moshed onstage.The frenzy surrounding Odd Future reached its peak in 2011: Cartoon Network gave the group their own television show; plans for an Odd Future retail shop were in the works. Labels were desperate to sign deals with the group, and Sony Music Entertainment succeeded. The crew had the upper hand and persuaded the label to give them their own imprint, and to award each member a cushy solo record deal. Bennett, the D.J., got one, too.Music came naturally to Bennett. Though her parents are 9-to-5 people \u2014 Janel is a city clerk and her father, Howard, owns a manufacturing company based in China \u2014 her uncle, Mikey Bennett, is a producer in Jamaica. (He co-wrote Shabba Ranks\u2019s 1993 hit \u201cMr. Loverman.\u201d) When she was young, the family took vacations to the island, and Bennett hung out in the studio and watched her uncle work. \u201cAt some point, I started listening to music a little differently,\u201d Bennett said. \u201cRather than being like, Yo, this is dope \u2014 who made this? it started being like, I wish I made this.\u201dWhen she was 16, her parents let her transform their guesthouse into a studio, where she worked on her own songs and recorded local musicians. In high school, she took music-technology classes and piano lessons; at night, she devoured beat-making tutorials and messed around with music software. She downloaded tracks from LimeWire (a file-sharing network like Napster) and remixed them using Pro Tools and GarageBand. She didn\u2019t need much capital to be a producer, just good Google skills and a wealth of persistence and patience.Bennett gravitated toward artists who had pioneered brand-new sounds: The sonic spaciness of Missy Elliott, the stanky soul of Erykah Badu and the acid jazz of Jamiroquai. Pharrell Williams, the original black skater weirdo, is her patron saint. And like most kids interested in music and living in Los Angeles in the mid-2000s, Bennett knew about a teenager named Tyler Okonma who called himself Tyler, the Creator. He had a sizable following on MySpace, where he released his music. \u201cHis production drew me in,\u201d she told me. \u201cIt didn\u2019t sound like what everyone was making \u2014 it was different and hot.\u201d Bennett noticed that one of the people at the top of his friend list was a kid named Matt Martin (who goes by Matt Martians). She browsed through his page, listening to the songs he posted, too. She admired his ability to create deeply complex soundscapes, and she eventually messaged him, seeking advice on ways to advance her own style.The two became friends, trading feedback on songs, which put her into Okonma\u2019s orbit. And when Okonma needed a place to record the early Odd Future mixtapes, Bennett offered up her home studio. She produced some of their early tracks and eventually became the group\u2019s D.J. In old footage of early Odd Future shows, Bennett plays songs from a laptop on a table at the back of the stage. Tomboyish, in a muscle tee and a short haircut, she crackles with the manic energy that Odd Future shows were famous for. She was generally indistinguishable from the boys in the group.From the beginning, Odd Future was meant to be a galaxy of loosely knit projects; the whole point was for the members to collaborate and spin off solo efforts. Christian Clancy, one of the group\u2019s managers, had also been a marketing executive at Interscope Records, and around 2011 he took notice of Bennett and Martin\u2019s tight friendship and encouraged them to start recording together. After all, they liked the same sounds: jazz, old-school slow jams, neo-soul. So they began experimenting, and these experiments would eventually lead to the formation of the Internet.Odd Future was a rare example of a viral sensation with lasting power; the music industry is rife with the ghosts of web talents who couldn\u2019t be repackaged as megastars. The terms of the Internet\u2019s deal with Sony \u201callowed us to shape ourselves,\u201d Bennett says. The band is artistically cocooned, trying to create, as she sees it, an entirely new style of R.&B., one that includes all types of desire. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t a conscious thing,\u201d she emphasizes. \u201cI just like women.\u201dBennett personally related to the themes that lent Okonma\u2019s music its emotional gravity: alienation, isolation, loneliness. She felt they shared a connection, one born of \u201cnot being a typical black kid or even a popular kid.\u201d But eventually the hypermasculinity and caustic sense of humor wore on Bennett, who is naturally low-key. She made tearful calls to her mother from the road, wondering aloud whether she should quit. Bennett also struggled with depression, worsened by the stress of touring and feeling disconnected from her family and her girlfriend at the time. She says that no one in the group \u2014 other than Martin \u2014 seemed to care. \u201cI couldn\u2019t talk to any of them about it,\u201d she says. \u201cWe weren\u2019t all that close, and they never seemed to want to hear it.\u201dNot long after, Bennett began training her little brother, Travis \u2014 who goes by Taco \u2014 to take her place as Odd Future\u2019s D.J. Her musical experiments with Martin had begun to congeal into the core of their first album, \u201cPurple Naked Ladies,\u201d an amorphous but promising collection of experimental jam sessions and fuzzed-out, vibey tracks. One morning while Odd Future was on tour, when the group was watching the sun crest over a beach in Australia, Bennett broke the news that she was leaving. She says it was not well received. It felt like a divorce, like a family \u2014 however dysfunctional \u2014 falling apart.\u201cThey weren\u2019t happy about it,\u201d she says. \u201cI was their get-out-of-jail-free card. It\u2019s easy to say they aren\u2019t homophobic because Syd is there.\u201dBennett\u2019s exit came at a time when gender norms were blurring. Artists now feel more emboldened to hint at sexual fluidity; it\u2019s edgy, if not outright trendy. Musicians like Wiz Khalifa and Jaden Smith have been photographed wearing skirts and dresses. Angel Haze and Shamir have said they\u2019re genderqueer. But being openly gay can still feel especially difficult in the world of hip-hop and R.&B., where artists who are suspected of being closeted can face harsher scrutiny. Lesbianism is often fetishized, made into a hypersexualized performance. While Young Thug can get away with wearing nail polish, female artists who give off an even slightly masculine air, like the rapper Dej Loaf, are hounded about their orientation.Minya Oh, the hip-hop journalist who goes by Miss Info, thinks Bennett has benefited from upheaval in the industry. \u201cI\u2019m sure that on some level of the major-label and old-establishment industry, there are execs and agents who think homosexuality is a liability,\u201d she says. On the other hand, she adds, \u201cthere are more and more handlers and mentors and facilitators who will see a new artist who is gay as either an opportunity to tap into a new market or, at worst, just a talking point.\u201d But even more important than all that, Oh says, is that artists like Bennett may not even have to pander to the mainstream anymore: \u201cAs fragmented as music audiences are these days, it would be difficult to alienate fans who are already bunched into nomad tribes.\u201dBennett\u2019s outward manner is so nonchalant and mellow it can start to seem like an affectation, but as soon as the words left my mouth, Bennett put down her forkful of pancake and slid me a sideways look, the kind you give someone when your patience is wearing thin but you still feel obligated to be polite.The Internet \u2014 the network \u2014 has a way of normalizing fringe ideas, marginalized identities and emerging artists that old media tends to ignore. It has done such a good job, you could argue, that people like Bennett \u2014 black, queer and weird \u2014 can exist without the burden of having to represent something larger. Bennett will never be something she\u2019s not. She\u2019s not looking for validation from record labels, or even really from audiences. Later that night, as thousands of Mexican teenagers rushed the stage, singing along in English and screaming her name, Bennett looked completely at home, and completely herself. \u2666A song as salve in an age of rancor.By George SaundersHow does a song work? What does it actually do? It doesn\u2019t instruct, exactly, or teach, necessarily. A song, I\u2019d say, causes the listener to assume a certain stance. Through some intersection of melody/lyrics/arrangement, it causes a shadow-being within us to get a certain expression on its face and fall into a certain posture. (Argent\u2019s \u201cHold Your Head Up,\u201d for example, would cause my 1970s teenage self to assume a, well, Thor-like posture: stoic, windswept, capable of enduring any hardship while, you know, holding my head up.)How does the song accomplish this? Was that the intention? I\u2019m not sure. Like much of Wilco\u2019s work, it\u2019s fundamentally a damned good popular song (simple chords, compelling melody), rendered symphonic by a process by which the song, seemingly rebelling against its own simplicity, seems to be seeking higher levels of emotionality via sonic complexity. This led me to assume the song had to be a result of weeks of arranging. But reportedly the band recorded it in one take, learning it from the songwriter Jeff Tweedy as the tape rolled. The song starts with a catchy eight-note guitar riff, to which it keeps returning, like a well-intentioned guy steering back to his mantra. Via inventive instrumental fills and a false ending (from which it rejuvenates with renewed purpose), it manages the strange task of seeming contemplative while escalating like crazy. It puts me in mind of a group of lifelong pals on a front porch, trying to musically solve some existential problem they can\u2019t quite articulate.The effect of all of this on the listener \u2014 this listener anyway \u2014 is transformative. Listening to \u201cOne Sunday Morning\u201d (every time) fixes me \u2014 like some sort of aural medicine. I feel a positive alteration in my body and mind: a renewed sense of humility at the sadness of the world, and a corresponding resolve to keep trying to be better; freshly reminded of the stakes of being alive, and of the fact that there are, at my disposal, more positive resources than I am currently employing. In this, \u201cOne Sunday Morning\u201d serves, for me, as a reliable 12-minute prayer. \u2666The radical act of ending an album in midsentence.By Jace ClaytonAt first, I thought my MP3 must have been corrupted. There\u2019s a springy, up-tempo beat that kicks off \u201c\u201906,\u201d the last track on Vince Staples\u2019s 2015 debut double album, \u201cSummertime \u201906,\u201d whose 20 songs are stark portrayals of a childhood caught between gangs and the police in Southern California. A lengthy instrumental stretch in \u201c\u201906\u201d gives the listener a break. When Staples appears with a fulsome \u201cGood mornin\u2019! Hope you had a good time last night\u201d and starts rapping, it\u2019s one of the most optimistic-sounding moments on the album. He\u2019s midway through the first verse (\u201cI\u2019m finna bring the gang in the buil\u2014\u201d) when the song cuts to a blast of loud static, followed by silence. The effect is so jarring that it can easily be mistaken for an error, a glitch in the stream.When I learned that this tear into white noise was intentional, I was shocked. This went beyond breaking the rules. \u201c\u201906\u201d plays an entirely different game than most music. Its words and sounds don\u2019t matter. What matters here is the rupture. The track uses white noise to depict a kind of death, yet it\u2019s also the sound of a channel being changed or a TV or radio shutting off: Someone is controlling this switch. A young man has been unexpectedly silenced. When it\u2019s over for him, it\u2019s over for the listener, too.His compressed rhymes sparkle with aphoristic detail. The opening lines of \u201cSummertime \u201906\u201d are \u201cHey, I\u2019m just a nigga until I fill my pockets/And then I\u2019m Mr. Nigga, they follow me while shoppin\u2019/I feel like Mick and Richards, they feel like Muddy Waters/So tell me what\u2019s the difference, so tell me what\u2019s the difference?/My momma was a Christian, Crip walkin\u2019 on blue-waters.\u201d The references multiply into serious depth. Yet before we have time to consider the Rolling Stones\u2019 relationship to the blues or how churches and gangs may offer similar types of belonging or anything else, Staples has raced ahead to end the verse with a punch: \u201cUber driver in the cockpit look like Jeffrey Dahmer/But he lookin\u2019 at me crazy when we pull up to the projects.\u201dThere are no radio-friendly singles here. Staples likes to call out things as they are, but he is not a stern moralist; if he were, he probably wouldn\u2019t have landed his gig as a brand ambassador for Sprite. (\u201cDifferent \u2019cause I\u2019m just like you\u201d he says in a recent national TV ad for the soft drink.) The preternaturally gifted rapper dresses in unflashy T-shirts and jeans. He\u2019s straight edge (no alcohol or drugs), a shrewd experimentalist with a complex politics.The song that precedes \u201d\u201906,\u201d \u201cLike It Is,\u201d clues us in to what the shocking signal crash might mean. Over a lurching, industrial beat, Staples explains: \u201cYou looking at a person, telling them that they story don\u2019t matter really no better than me/walkin\u2019 down the streets tryna shoot at somebody.\u201d To deny the validity of another person\u2019s story, he says, is to deny them life. And even when one can voice his or her mind freely, to be a successful black rapper is to perform your persona before a predominantly white audience, whose aggregate opinion determines your worth. This is a problem Staples continually addresses, whether discussing how one of his ambitions is to leave the rap game (and move on to more reliable ways of earning a living) during interviews, or in songs like \u201cLift Me Up\u201d: \u201cAll these white folks chanting when I asked \u2019em \u2018Where my niggas at?\u2019/Goin\u2019 crazy, got me goin\u2019 crazy, I can\u2019t get with that.\u201d Rapping about it only aggravates the paradox; those lines have been among the most quoted in reviews of his album, used to praise his self-awareness.Then comes the static.Staples knows that possibilities for mainstream black visibility are few and fraught. Black entertainers in the celebrity spotlight mark one extreme, the grainy videoclips of African-Americans dying at the hands of the police, whose name-recognition is always posthumous, another. How to speak against that? You can\u2019t. You can only unplug.\u201c\u201906\u201d adds to a growing body of work by black artists who flirt with disappearance in order to trouble the idea of representation itself. In \u201cConcerto in Black and Blue,\u201d David Hammons\u2019s 2002 piece for a series of pitch-black rooms in a large SoHo gallery, visitors were invited to explore with tiny blue flashlights. Their looking was the only thing to see. When the dancer-choreographer Storyboard P performs for video, he exploits the camera\u2019s two-dimensional limitations to create on-screen moves that appear simultaneously awkward and impossibly fluid. He dances as if he doesn\u2019t want to be captured, in gravity-defying bends and evasions \u2014 all escape, no center. The poet Claudia Rankine, in her 2004 book \u201cDon\u2019t Let Me Be Lonely,\u201d opens each section with an image of a TV showing static. \u201cThe years went by and people only died on television,\u201d she writes. \u201cIf they weren\u2019t Black, they were wearing black or were terminally ill.\u201dThe jagged conclusion of \u201c\u201906\u201d asks what it might mean to turn away from self-representation in sound. White noise is a spray of pitches and volumes that contains all audible frequencies. It is constant and patternless. Quite literally, it\u2019s the sound of undifferentiated possibility. One can think of Staples\u2019s provocative noise as the opposite of a stereotype, or freedom in sonic form. His signal fritzes into static with a snarl of hope: Noise and silence mark the edges of what can be considered music. To end an album like this points to a world beyond the song and to hands manipulating the transmission. What can be said outside the culture\u2019s limiting expectations, and who might we become if we learn to listen to it? \u2666A singular voice, aching with desperation and resolve.By Carlo Rotella Price usually drops down in pitch when she sings the second syllable of \u201cbottle,\u201d but sometimes she takes it up a bluesy interval instead, turning a honky-tonk lament into a call to arms. The two deliveries of the line play up countervailing qualities of desperation and resolve in her voice. Together they make it sound as if she\u2019s exerting considerable strength of character to keep despair and bad luck from carrying her song off the road and headlong into a telephone pole. This instantly detectable tension in her voice causes listeners to become alert, even alarmed, the moment she starts singing.\u201cHurtin\u2019 \u201c is the first single from Price\u2019s album \u201cMidwest Farmer\u2019s Daughter,\u201d which will be released by Jack White\u2019s Third Man Records on March 25. She\u2019s being rolled out with the fanfare appropriate to the next big thing out of Nashville, as the appearance on Colbert suggests, but she\u2019s not on country\u2019s standard ing\u00e9nue track. At 32, having weathered lean times and near misses, she\u2019s more of a hard-bitten classicist. Her album title evokes Loretta Lynn\u2019s \u201cCoal Miner\u2019s Daughter,\u201d and her diction, especially the way she chews on the word \u201cpain,\u201d raises echoes of Tammy Wynette; her mask of barroom bravado over tender vulnerability recalls Merle Haggard; and her band, the Price Tags, favors old-school arrangements, with Luke Schneider\u2019s pedal-steel guitar weaving prominently around her voice.As attention has built around Price, she has sometimes found herself placed in a cohort with Chris Stapleton, Sturgill Simpson and other scruffy dissenters who have recently made inroads into the dominion of the bro acts currently ruling Nashville\u2019s major labels and country radio. As the underground rocker-turned-\u201dcountry/garage\u201d producer Jonathan Bright has suggested, if current Nashville stars like Luke Bryan and Florida Georgia Line are the equivalent of M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce and other such glam-pop acts who dominated rock in the late 1980s, Price and company could be part of country\u2019s long-awaited back-to-basics riposte. Roots-music boosters are always announcing that the inevitable cyclical swing back to hard-country twang has begun, but listening to Price \u2014 or watching the growly, uncute Stapleton clean up at the Country Music Association Awards last November \u2014 you can begin to believe that maybe it\u2019s really happening.The songs on \u201cMidwest Farmer\u2019s Daughter\u201d mine the experience of further hard knocks. Her parents lost the family\u2019s corn-and-soybean farm in Buffalo Prairie, Ill., and her father went to work as a prison guard. Price endured a run of professional disappointment and personal sorrow after arriving in Nashville in 2003. With her husband, Jeremy Ivey, who plays bass in the Price Tags and writes songs with her, she tried her hand at rock and soul and made a brief, unhappy foray into writing commercial country music. Serially turned away, ripped off and let down by operators in the music industry, she grew used to selling her meager possessions to pick up and start over, waitressing, hoping for some luck. \u201cI can\u2019t count all the times I\u2019ve been had,\u201d she sings in \u201cThis Town Gets Around,\u201d her ode to the lecherous manager, fraudulent publicist and other Music Row animals who preyed upon her.Five years ago she gave birth to twin sons, one of whom died of a rare heart ailment two weeks later. She sank low after that and couldn\u2019t pull herself out of it. Drinking didn\u2019t help. \u201cIt just snowballed,\u201d she says. \u201cI felt as if I was cursed, some kind of running cosmic joke.\u201d A long weekend in the Davidson County jail after a drunken-driving incident persuaded her to get help and break the downward momentum. \u201cWeekender,\u201d a jail song on the album, is a good girl\u2019s rueful acknowledgment that the women in lockup are tougher and less fortunate than she is. \u201cThey were hard, and I was really scared,\u201d she says. \u201cThey could tell by your shoes that you were just a weekender.\u201dShe and Ivey sold their car to finance the recording of \u201cMidwest Farmer\u2019s Daughter\u201d at Sun Studio in Memphis. The album was rejected all over Nashville and eventually picked up by a label they didn\u2019t even consider approaching. Despite having a Nashville office, Third Man Records isn\u2019t widely known for producing country music (though Jack White produced a comeback album for Loretta Lynn in 2004). But Price\u2019s habit of putting vocal soul shadings into even the most straight-ahead country songs makes her an impure traditionalist, and therefore a surprisingly good fit for Third Man. Ben Swank, who runs the company with White and Ben Blackwell, says, \u201cWe\u2019re coming from a punk-rock, indie-rock background that discovered blues and American music in reverse,\u201d an aesthetic that tends to value emotional power over stylistic orthodoxy.Swank believes that Price\u2019s career travails might have fortuitously delayed her album just long enough to allow Third Man to take advantage of a new openness to \u201ca classical sound\u201d in country music. Another name for that sound is Americana: high-gloss corporate country\u2019s earthier foil and partner, which embraces not only folk traditions but also vintage commercial styles drawn magpie-fashion from bygone eras. Pointing in particular to the career of Stapleton \u2014 who went from writing pop-flavored radio fare for established stars to become a major-label juggernaut singing spare, bluesy songs in the outlaw country mold \u2014 Swank says: \u201cNow there are others who have knocked on the door. If she had come along two years earlier, maybe it\u201d \u2014 the next-big-thing buzz \u2014 \u201cwouldn\u2019t have happened.\u201dPrice\u2019s son, Judah, climbed on and off her lap as a stylist enlarged her blond hair. Friends and family were temporarily shooed away as she put on something tight and fringed. Foot traffic milled in and out of other dressing rooms along the hall, and from one came a furious burst of picking as a bluegrass band warmed up.Out on the main stage, Price sang her allotted two songs, ending with \u201cHurtin.\u2019 \u201c The band came to a full stop for her honky-tonk cadenza: \u201cThat don\u2019t touch . . . the paiiiinnnnn . . . you put . . . on . . . meeeeee,\u201d with a slow-rising two-note flourish on the final word. Robust applause followed, and then Mike Snider, the banjo player who serves as one of the Opry\u2019s chief traditionalist voices, said: \u201cGood job, Margo, you sweet little old thing. Good to have somebody come out here and sing country again.\u201d There was laughter, some knowing and some a little too hearty, in the crowd and among the house musicians onstage and the insiders thronging the wings. \u201cBy golly,\u201d Snider said, \u201cthat was stronger than new rope.\u201d \u2666The world\u2019s greatest session drummer confronts the machine age.By Jeff HimmelmanChamberlain, 48, is a session player paid by the project, a below-the-radar rock star who often shows up only in the liner notes. If you watched MTV in the \u201990s, you heard him drumming with Pearl Jam in their \u201cAlive\u201d video or with Fiona Apple or Tori Amos or the Wallflowers. He has appeared on records by everyone from Bruce Springsteen and David Bowie to Frank Ocean and Kanye West, toured with the Indigo Girls and Soundgarden, spent a season as the drummer for the \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d band. He played drums on the \u201cFrozen\u201d soundtrack for Disney. In a world of dwindling recording budgets and increased automation, he could well be the last one drumming before software takes over completely.At Blackbird Studio in Nashville, Urban told Chamberlain that he had \u201cJohn Cougar\u201d down on his acoustic guitar, but it felt too formulaic. He\u2019d been listening to the rapper Kendrick Lamar and wanted a groove that could not only propel the song but inspire an altogether new sound for it. Chamberlain assembled a drum loop \u2014 a small-scale mechanical repetition born more of hip-hop than country \u2014 and then played live drums over the loop, deepening the timbre and also providing accents and fills when the movement of the verses seemed to require it. Urban pronounced the whole package \u201csexy\u201d; in the sought-for moment of inspiration, he would put down his acoustic guitar in favor of an electric bass. Within a couple of hours, the drums-bass-and-voice opening and the entire vibe of the song were effectively complete. The catchy arrangement and on-the-nose country twang of the title and chorus eventually sent \u201cJohn Cougar\u201d to the second spot on Billboard\u2019s U.S. Country Airplay chart.This is the work of the modern session drummer, and it is why, when a major-label project needs drums, Chamberlain is often the first person producers call. When we met in Los Angeles in February, he posed his value proposition as a question: \u201cWhat can you add to a situation that\u2019s totally out of context but works?\u201d Chamberlain is good enough at playing his instruments \u2014 and at reading what producers and artists want \u2014 that they\u2019re willing to pay him well to make that kind of determination for them. And so he lives at an odd intersection, or perhaps a vanishing point; part virtuoso whose skills have never been more relevant, part John Henry figure, hammering away as music is increasingly composed and performed by machines.\u201cI do more and more work out of my studio because nobody has a budget anymore,\u201d he told me. \u201cThe Keith Urbans of the world can fly me to the studio because people still go to Walmart and buy country records.\u201d For the people who can\u2019t afford to fly him out, Chamberlain offers his services remotely from Van Nuys. He has a full recording studio set up: a control room stocked with vintage gear and a large soundproof tracking room where two drum kits sit miked and ready to go. There are drums everywhere, more than anybody should rightly own, stacked on top of each other and hanging from racks: multiple rock kits, a Brazilian pandeiro, Tibetan bells, a 40-gallon oil can rigged with a spring that Chamberlain pounded with evident joy and a built-in cupboard with 20 slots for different snares, each of which is filled. He has a vintage Ludwig Supraphonic (\u201cWhat John Bonham would have played\u201d), a 1930s Slingerland Radio King (\u201cFat and dead\u201d), a 1900s snare with a calfskin head. As he finished giving me a tour, he said: \u201cYou know sample libraries? These are the physical versions of the samples.\u201dWhen I stopped by, Chamberlain was tracking drums for a British singer named Hattie Webb. The first track had some programmed electronic drums already attached as a guide; Webb\u2019s producer had asked Chamberlain, via email, to \u201cbuild it, make it electronic-y with some acoustic elements.\u201d Chamberlain listened to the song twice, charting out its structure on a legal pad, and then he went into the tracking room, where he had a little setup that he called his \u201celectronic/analog kit\u201d \u2014 a small kick drum, a tiny snare that he had purpose-made for work like this and a cymbal with holes in it to sharpen the sound.He cued up the track and then, without any practice, played along with it, sounding so much like the programming that it was almost hard to believe it could be a live performance. And yet his playing also ebbed and flowed in ways that the programmed drums didn\u2019t, or couldn\u2019t. After that single immaculate take, Chamberlain returned to the control room, listened for about 30 seconds and said, \u201cThat sounds cool.\u201d He then set about making a drum loop to go along with the part he had just played. Within an hour or two, the track acquired shaker, tambourine and four flourish-filled runs on a full drum kit, just to give the production team some different options.Chamberlain is an elegant player; no movement is wasted. He plays with a traditional underhand grip, which is more often associated with jazz than rock. Sometimes, looking at him, you can\u2019t believe the range and sheer volume of sound he\u2019s producing. By 6:30 p.m., Chamberlain finished the second of the tracks Webb had sent to him and uploaded both to his Dropbox account to be accessed by the producers in England. Then he went home to make pasta with his wife.North Texas State (now the University of North Texas) accepted him into its music program on a scholarship, but he lasted less than a year. One of the percussion teachers threw a plastic piece of excrement at him while he was performing; another banged a gong in the middle of a piece and yelled, \u201cGo practice!\u201d It wasn\u2019t exactly the atmosphere he had imagined. \u201cI just wanted to play drums,\u201d he says. He didn\u2019t help matters by getting himself thrown out of his dorm for smoking pot. For a while he slept in his practice room with his head on the pillow in his kick drum.After he left school, Chamberlain moved to the Deep Ellum neighborhood of Dallas, about 40 miles away, where he played in several bands, often just for food or enough cash to put gas in his car. He eventually found himself living next door to Brad Houser, the bass player for Edie Brickell & New Bohemians, and after some problems with their original drummer during the recording of their first album, the band hired Chamberlain to tour with them. \u201cWhat I Am,\u201d the first single off \u201cShooting Rubberbands at the Stars,\u201d blew up so fast that his first major gig with the band outside Dallas was on \u201cSaturday Night Live.\u201d Chamberlain had just turned 21. He toured with Brickell for a couple of years and recorded a second record, \u201cGhost of a Dog,\u201d with the band, which broke up around the time Brickell married Paul Simon. (The band, without Chamberlain, has since reunited.)Chamberlain spent a summer touring with Pearl Jam, then returned to \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d as drummer for the house band \u2014 a job that for many musicians would be a career capper. TV gigs in general, and the \u201cS.N.L.\u201d gig in particular, offer the kind of steady, high-paying work that is pretty much impossible for musicians to find anywhere else. After a year, though, Chamberlain decided to move to Seattle. \u201cI had a whole house with a buddy of mine in a decent part of town, we could play music in it all day long and we each paid $250 rent,\u201d he told me, laughing. \u201cHow do you beat that?\u201dIn 1994, Chamberlain got a call from a little-known band called the Wallflowers, fronted by Bob Dylan\u2019s son Jakob. The band liked Chamberlain\u2019s drumming on \u201cGhost of a Dog\u201d and wondered if he\u2019d help them out in the studio. That work resulted in a single called \u201cOne Headlight\u201d that helped the band sell several million records. The Wallflowers\u2019 manager also represented a new and promising artist named Fiona Apple, and he asked if Chamberlain would play the drums for her too. Both albums \u201cdid really well,\u201d he told me, in characteristically understated fashion. \u201cSo that\u2019s kind of how you end up being a session musician. If you\u2019re not in a band, you\u2019re the guy who played on those records.\u201dChamberlain\u2019s network of producers and friends has continued to expand, and that\u2019s mostly how he gets his work. Over the last 15 years, he has played hundreds of sessions with some of music\u2019s biggest names, put out several side-project records and toured with Tori Amos and others whenever he could. A high-level studio musician in Los Angeles like Chamberlain can pull in as much as $2,000 for a day of work, though Chamberlain\u2019s rates fluctuate widely, depending on whom he\u2019s working with. He acknowledged that, with changes in the music business brought on by streaming and other technological innovations, \u201cthe herd is getting thinned\u201d in terms of the number of artists with sizable recording budgets. But demand for his services remains strong. In a poll to be published later this year, the readers of Modern Drummer have named him the best studio player in the business.Ryan Gruss, the Loop Loft\u2019s chief executive, showed me the sheet he had prepared for a previous session with the legendary drummer Omar Hakim, who has played for the likes of Michael Jackson, Madonna and Miles Davis. For Hakim, Gruss had typed out descriptions of beats and suggested tempos to go along with them, but there was no such list for Chamberlain. As an engineer got the kit sounding right in the control room, Chamberlain roamed over the drums and settled into a rhythm that Gruss liked. They set up a click track \u2014 a metronome that plays in Chamberlain\u2019s headphones \u2014 at the same tempo, then Chamberlain let loose for about five minutes, cycling through grooves, chorus feels, different patterns of the same basic beat.Over the next four hours, Chamberlain would roll through nine other grooves and five different setups, swapping out drums and cymbals in search of new sounds and textures. For one set of beats, he moved to the small \u201celectronic/analog kit\u201d and played it with Brazilian shakers instead of sticks. The 1900s snare with the calfskin head made an appearance and, somehow, sounded almost entirely synthetic and computerized, which Chamberlain hadn\u2019t anticipated. The Loop Loft team was happy just to sit back and watch, one of them muttering \u201cJesus\u201d under his breath whenever Chamberlain really let fly.\u201cI\u2019m a working musician,\u201d Chamberlain said to me at one point, with an emphasis on \u201cworking.\u201d Because he\u2019s not a songwriter or a member of a band, he doesn\u2019t get many residual checks or royalty payments \u2014 what musicians refer to as \u201cmailbox money.\u201d Even when times are good, he has to hustle. Sometimes he\u2019s in the studio with the Loop Loft; sometimes he\u2019s the guy Adele\u2019s producers call when she\u2019s writing in Los Angeles (for a track that didn\u2019t make her latest record); sometimes he\u2019s the guy the billionaire Paul Allen hires for a vanity rock project featuring, among other top-tier musicians, the Eagles guitarist Joe Walsh. (Sample song title: \u201cSix Strings From Hell.\u201d) Even on days off, Chamberlain goes into his studio and practices for a couple of hours.When the Loop Loft session was over, Chamberlain wandered in and out of the control room, packing up his gear for another recording stint with Keith Urban. This time the sessions would include the Welsh bassist Pino Palladino, one of the most respected players around. Instead of adding drums to a previously recorded track, Chamberlain would be playing live with Palladino in the studio. Chamberlain loves playing live above all else, for those moments when the music takes an inexplicable turn but somehow everybody stays together. No machine could match it. \u201cWith great musicians,\u201d he said, \u201cyou feel like you can\u2019t do anything wrong.\u201d \u2666A pop star claims a little time for herself.By Doreen St. F\u00e9lixMusical duets are usually ordered by heterosexual difference and its various dramas. As in: She gives, he takes. He pleads, she refuses. They may reconcile, but the performers always observe the classic sex distinction \u2014 making the circumstances of the female vocalist a good barometer for the circumstances of female speech in general.But Rihanna, pop\u2019s great maven of self-gratification, is a known loner, and she flouts that kind of reciprocal identity all the time. So it follows that even on her latest album\u2019s true duet, she would choose a vocal mirror, not a vocal foil. On \u201cConsideration,\u201d the first track on \u201cAnti,\u201d Rihanna and the genre-fluid singer SZA are two branches of the same river, braiding in and out. The women put on their respective versions of a placid attitude \u2014 Rihanna sings with cheek, SZA cheerlessly. Each is calm but, you suspect, coursing toward some possible furor. They sing into each other; their vocal registers match so closely that on first listen, you might even miss that Rihanna isn\u2019t singing by herself. The closeness approaches uncanny, suggests an erotics of the self. Rihanna\u2019s voice sinks into SZA\u2019s, which rises back into Rihanna\u2019s, the voices first crossing on these: \u201cWhy you ain\u2019t ever let me grow?/When I look outside my window/I can\u2019t get no peace of mind.\u201d If \u201dAnti\u201d has a thesis, it\u2019s this declaration of insolence.I almost used the usual expression \u2014 a \u201cdeclaration of independence.\u201d Then I remembered how secretive the two women sound, the complete disinterest the lyrics communicate. The way Rihanna likens herself to our most uncivil cultural child, Peter Pan: \u201cI came fluttering in from Neverland/Time can never stop me.\u201d I hear her indignation; I hear a clear defection from the typical girl-power conceit. \u201cConsideration\u201d could not care less about sounding like a feminist anthem in the proper way, one that telegraphs passive misandry in the service of forcing female communion. It\u2019s an anti-anthem, a song for the individual in a world full of cheap calls to solidarity \u2014 a misanthrope\u2019s chorus, built for people who would rather be alone, unseen and isolated from the work of being a girl. (\u201cWould you mind giving my reflection a break/from the pain it\u2019s feeling now?\u201d) Michael Jackson, long reviled for his identification with the boy Peter Pan, might have originated this kind of audacity, refusing to relate to society as much as society wanted to relate to him.Rihanna often returns to Barbados, the landmass that bore her. Like that island country, \u201cConsideration\u201d connects to nothing outside itself; it\u2019s a salve for those of us seeking mental and political quiet, an adult lullaby castigating the spectacle of public life. The song is haughtily against the \u201coutside\u201d; it invokes the private air of an enclosed room. I\u2019d like to stay inside, too, looking out the window, listening to the echo of my own voice. \u2666Riding a lo-fi sound to semifame.By John Wray\u201cI\u2019ll see discussions sometimes, on message boards online, about the sound I get from my guitar,\u201d Mac DeMarco said one overcast February afternoon as we drove around Far Rockaway, Queens. \u201cIt\u2019s kids, mostly, trying to figure it out: \u2018How does he get that freaky tone? What kind of pedals? What amp?\u2019\u201d He turned to me and grinned, showing the gap between his teeth. \u201cWhat they don\u2019t realize is that the guitar I\u2019ve played since I was 16 is a no-name piece of garbage that I bought at a pawnshop for about 30 bucks. It\u2019s got a loose neck, its pickup magnet is broken into tiny pieces and the pick guard is a piece of siding that I got from my Hasidic neighbor\u2019s house in Montreal.\u201d He laughed. \u201cFor a while there were bugs living in it. Actual bugs. It was cute.\u201dWe were driving along Rockaway Beach Boulevard in a borrowed car, because DeMarco\u2019s station wagon wouldn\u2019t start. At the owner\u2019s request, DeMarco was grading the CDs in the glove compartment with a pen: B+ for Morrissey, C- for Belle and Sebastian, an enthusiastic A+ for the Grateful Dead. \u201cMy life is stupid right now,\u201d he told me. \u201cI put a pair of my sneakers on eBay a while ago \u2014 partly to raise money for this girls\u2019 rock camp in Brooklyn, but mostly just as a joke \u2014 and some dude pushed the bidding up to 21 grand.\u201d He grinned again. \u201cIt turned out he didn\u2019t have the money, because he was, like, 13 years old. But that\u2019s still pretty sick.\u201dGiven the turn DeMarco\u2019s career has taken, his attitude of giddy disbelief makes perfect sense. In the course of four albums in as many years \u2014 \u201cRock and Roll Night Club,\u201d \u201c2,\u201d \u201cSalad Days\u201d and \u201cAnother One,\u201d all released by the pint-size Brooklyn label Captured Tracks \u2014 DeMarco has progressed from quasi squatter to bona fide indie-rock star, playing sold-out shows from New York to Los Angeles and basking in a degree of Internet fame that he finds hard to comprehend. In \u201cBacker,\u201d a bleakly hilarious clip, featuring none of his music whatsoever, DeMarco impersonates a depressed loser from Edmonton who guides cars into parking spots for a living. It has received around 400,000 views on YouTube. \u201cSalad Days,\u201d his 2014 breakout album, has been played more than five million times on YouTube, more than the Wu-Tang Clan album \u201cA Better Tomorrow,\u201d released the same year. DeMarco\u2019s brand of fame, however, is far from the rarefied, untouchable variety that stars like the RZA or Jack White enjoy: The more famous DeMarco gets, the more accessible he seems to become. \u201cKids think of me as a guy who\u2019d hang out with them and actually enjoy myself,\u201d he told me. \u201cAnd they\u2019re basically right.\u201dThe house he rents in Arverne, Queens, is an unprepossessing four-bedroom cottage in a lower-middle-class neighborhood, with cigarette butts peppering the lawn. When I rang his bell, he came to the door in boxers and a rumpled Hugo Boss T-shirt, greeted me with slightly bleary-eyed politeness, then led me past guitar cases and piles of laundry and a cluster of half-inflated party balloons to the kitchen, where Kiera McNally, his girlfriend of five years, was baking gluten-free banana bread. Over a cup of diner-style coffee \u2014 from an industrial steady-drip machine that DeMarco pointed out to me with pride \u2014 I asked what the repercussions of inviting hundreds of thousands of fans to his house had been.\u201cIt\u2019s cold outside now, so it isn\u2019t too bad,\u201d DeMarco said. \u201cRight after the EP came out, in August, we were averaging maybe 50 kids a day.\u201d He glanced toward McNally, who was diplomatically focusing on the banana bread. \u201cThe only thing that bugged me about it, personally, was the feeling I got that some of them hadn\u2019t even heard my music. I\u2019m basically a meme to a lot of these kids. It can get a bit weird.\u201dThe music DeMarco makes has been enthusiastically received by critics, but reviews of his albums can be frustrating to read: They tend to lean heavily on labels like \u201cslacker rock,\u201d \u201cchill wave\u201d and \u201cblue wave,\u201d to name only a few. \u201cWhat the hell does \u2018blue wave\u2019 even mean?\u201d DeMarco said. \u201cI have no idea.\u201dThe first song of his that I heard, \u201cBlue Boy,\u201d from \u201cSalad Days,\u201d is a bright, airy trifle, almost a lullaby, in which heartfelt advice to an insecure friend \u2014 \u201cNo use acting so tough/come down, sweetheart, and grow up\u201d \u2014 is subtly undercut by the ever-so-slightly camp vocals and even more so by the lead guitar, which seems to drift woozily in and out of tune. King Sunny Ade came to mind as I listened, as did Jerry Garcia, an acknowledged influence, but I found it nearly impossible to pin down the music I was hearing, or even to date it. Like many of DeMarco\u2019s best songs, \u201cBlue Boy\u201d sounds like the work of someone who spent his formative years combing through record-store bargain bins, carefully discarding anything that might conceivably be characterized as tasteful. It\u2019s an approach that has yielded dividends for musicians in the Internet age before \u2014 Washed Out comes to mind, as does Ariel Pink \u2014 but none of those artists\u2019 albums can claim five million YouTube plays.The family has musicians on both sides: a lyric soprano, a jazz saxophonist, an uncle who lives in London and sings standards. Agnes herself had a stint, as a teenager, singing at parties and weddings around Edmonton.At 16, Mac started recording songs in his room, by himself \u2014 the way he still records all his music \u2014 and playing in a band called Belgium with two friends from high school, Alec Meen and Peter Sagar. \u201cWe were trying to sound melodic and indie, like Pavement or Dinosaur Jr., even though all I knew how to play were Jeff Beck-style blues riffs,\u201d he told me. \u201cThey kept the band going after I moved to Vancouver, which was fine with me; it was pretty much their thing, anyway. I always hated the name Belgium.\u201dIn Vancouver, where he lived for a time in the boiler room of a printmaking studio for 200 Canadian dollars a month, DeMarco continued recording songs, posting them on Myspace under the name Makeout Videotape. \u201cThe first time you\u2019re out somewhere and some guy comes up to you and says: \u2018I heard that song you put up online. Pretty cool,\u2019 it\u2019s the weirdest thing,\u201d he told me, shaking his head. \u201cI got to be part of a scene that had started around this club called the Emergency Room, with bands who were already touring in the U.S. They were all these great, noisy, lo-fi bands, and I halfway fit in, mainly because I had no idea how to record. But I was trying to write Beatles songs the whole time.\u201dWhile performing at a music festival in Calgary, DeMarco reconnected with McNally, whom he knew in high school, and within the year they moved to Montreal together. \u201cWe had a hard time in Montreal,\u201d he told me. \u201cI worked the night shift at this cheap grocery store called Segal\u2019s, a 50-cents-for-a-wheel-of-brie kind of place.\u201d The job at Segal\u2019s, joyless though it was, provided a pivotal ingredient in his evolving aesthetic: a daily dose of schmaltzy classic rock. \u201cHearing that kind of music all the time \u2014 Dire Straits, Toto, Van Halen \u2014 it affected me,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can either embrace that stuff or let it drive you insane.\u201d He paused for a moment. \u201cTo tell you the truth, I\u2019m not a big Dire Straits fan, even now. But I found something in those songs that I could use.\u201dAfter a barely perceptible hesitation, he played the songs gently, sincerely and with a devotion and skill that were never entirely obscured by the grin on his face or the jokes he cracked. (\u201cA D.U.I.? I don\u2019t think so. I take a helicopter to work. I\u2019m Billy Joel!\u201d) Before his third and final song \u2014 \u201cStill Together,\u201d the closing track on \u201c2\u201d \u2014 he brought McNally out onstage to join him, beaming like a schoolboy, and kissed her lovingly but chastely on the cheek. I was reminded, watching them together, of something DeMarco told me on our drive. \u201cGrowing up in Edmonton, the horizon is so far away, you don\u2019t even realize it\u2019s there,\u201d he said. \u201cThis might all be over in six months, but there\u2019s nothing wrong with my life now. Not a thing.\u201d He nodded to himself for a moment. \u201cThe only thing I\u2019ve got to do is fix my car.\u201d \u2666Let\u2019s get it on. Or not.By Jia TolentinoCharlie Puth\u2019s brand is blandness: he\u2019s a pop star for the age of sponsored content. A fresh-faced, vanilla-flavored, Berklee-trained 24-year-old, Puth landed three singles on Top 40 radio in the year before he released his 2016 debut album, \u201cNine Track Mind.\u201d His style is marked by retro aesthetics and an almost haunting level of glibness, as encapsulated by his first single, the recent radio smash \u201cMarvin Gaye.\u201dYou may think you\u2019ve never heard \u201cMarvin Gaye,\u201d but it\u2019s possible you just haven\u2019t listened to it. It\u2019s a song that tends to register via alternate senses, a clamminess on the nape of your neck or a cloying taste, like children\u2019s cough syrup, in the back of your mouth. The platinum-selling doo-wop duet features the artist Meghan Trainor (who, like Puth, has thus far used her considerable songwriting talent to create songs so depthless they feel like waxworks).It\u2019s a song about sex that induces not lust but a feeling of desolation. \u201cLet\u2019s Marvin Gaye and get it on,\u201d sing Puth and Trainor brightly. \u201cYou got that healing that I want. Just like they say it in the song: until the dawn, let\u2019s Marvin Gaye and get it on.\u201dThe chorus feels like a bouncy castle inflated with hot air and ghosts, but in a technical sense, it\u2019s perfect. Its phrasing follows the classic AABA doo-wop format, and its four-chord progression (I, vi, IV, V) is emblematic of the genre: These are the ice-cream chords of \u201cHeart and Soul,\u201d \u201cBlue Moon\u201d and \u201cPlease Mr. Postman.\u201d Tweaked, the same progression can take on depth and winsomeness \u2014 with a 7th thrown in, you get \u201cUnchained Melody\u201d and with a 9th, \u201cEvery Breath You Take.\u201d But with the exception of a verse that has Trainor singing over a beat Puth describes (inaccurately) as a \u201chard-ass distorted 808\u201d drum machine, the track replicates the late \u201950s with unimaginative servility. Sonically, it lives a decade and a half before the song it\u2019s referencing; Marvin Gaye released \u201cLet\u2019s Get It On\u201d in 1973.In 1965, Gaye recalled to his biographer, he was listening to one of his songs playing on the radio when it was interrupted by a news bulletin about the riots in Watts. \u201cWith the world exploding around me, how am I supposed to keep singing love songs?\u201d No such scruples trouble Puth, who wrote his track as a \u201cmusical icebreaker,\u201d he told Billboard. \u201cIf you hear it on the radio or at a bar, it\u2019s a way to say: \u2018Hey! Let\u2019s Marvin Gaye and get it on.\u2019\u201d And so \u201cMarvin Gaye\u201d got its new use and meaning as a pickup line, dreamed up by an artist whose means is glibness and end is comfort, who can\u2019t imagine the fight that Gaye\u2019s love was built on, who sings about sex as if it\u2019s his due rather than a port of call in a storm. \u2666Who gets to say how black people see themselves?By Marlon James \u201cButterfly\u201d arrived at an unprecedented moment in pop. Black artists, as they conquered the mainstream, were getting even blacker. Kanye might have gotten there first (at least he probably thinks so) with \u201cNew Slaves\u201d and \u201cBlack Skinhead,\u201d and now even Beyonc\u00e9 is place-checking New Orleans and image-checking the Black Panthers. But Kanye was still speaking to the white gaze, the hatred and desire in it, and taking revenge by getting all black-sex-machine on somebody\u2019s white wife. \u201cButterfly\u201d is instead Toni Morrison circa \u201cSula\u201d: not looking outside for either validation or opposition. Black love, black empowerment, black history and black wisdom are explored so deeply and intelligently that you assume that conservative media fetish, black-on-black crime, will never show up. But then, in the third verse of \u201cThe Blacker the Berry,\u201d when Kendrick is waxing lyrical on Trayvon Martin\u2019s death, it does. All of a sudden \u201cBlacker\u201d becomes a song about black accountability while black men are being murdered and the implausible logic of slamming two ideas into the same thought. I was right there with him until that third verse.You can\u2019t be a hip-hop head and not be hit by \u201cThe Blacker the Berry.\u201d It brings the boom-bap from the get-go, dropping funk on the one, like an update of the drum break that opens NWA\u2019s album \u201cStraight Outta Compton.\u201d And even though I was tired of people\u2019s mapping anger onto blackness, Lamar\u2019s detonation of rage and wit was (and is) unmatched in hip-hop. He grabs at stereotypes as if they\u2019re slipping out of his fingers (\u201cMy hair is nappy,\u201d he says. \u201cMy nose is round and wide\u201d) and throws them right back at whoever would deploy them. He\u2019s not even rapping so much as spitting fire, jumping on a line, retracing it, firing it back at you, like the boxer Jack Johnson when he said: \u201cI\u2019m black, they never let me forget it. I\u2019m black, all right, I\u2019ll never let them forget it.\u201d Kendrick fuels his \u201cI\u2019m black\u201d with the knowledge that ain\u2019t a damn thing changed. He leaves it to the Jamaican DJ Assassin to bring backup in the chorus, drawing the line from plantation to street corner and the switch in who controls black self-determination, from the \u201cwhips left scars \u2019pon me back\u201d to the \u201cthe big whip parked \u2019pon the block.\u201dThe last couplet on the second verse echoes the first, with a crucial change: \u201cYou sabotage my community, makin\u2019 a killin\u2019/you made me a killer,\u201d turns into, \u201cHow can I tell you I\u2019m making a killin\u2019?/You made me a killer\u201d \u2014 and the different spin on \u201ckilling\u201d weighs a ton. In the first instance, exploitation and indifference make him a killer. In the second, his success comes from America\u2019s obsession with his assuming he looks like one. It was almost unbearable to anticipate what this prophet of rage was going to drop next.And then he dropped it.I could feel the verse pulling away from me as soon as he got halfway into it. It turned into call-and-response, me and this third verse, which went a little something like this:\u201cIt\u2019s funny how Zulu and Xhosa might go to war. ...Remind me of these Compton Crip gangs that live next door.\u201dMe: Hold up, K-dot, what is this you\u2019re dropping? No, dude, those are two nations going to war. And fine, war is hell, but if Britain and France aren\u2019t called thugs for Waterloo, if Lancaster and York aren\u2019t called bangers despite literally being family killing family, then why do Zulu vs. Xhosa get compared to gang warfare? Because it weakened them both in the face of the real enemy? Either all war is hell, or all war is thuggery. I\u2019m fine with either, but not with a special distinction when Africans do it.Kendrick continues:\u201cSo don\u2019t matter how much I say I like to preach with the PanthersOr tell Georgia State \u2018Marcus Garvey got all the answers\u2019Or try to celebrate February like it\u2019s my B-DayOr eat watermelon, chicken and Kool-Aid on weekdaysOr jump high enough to get Michael Jordan endorsementsOr watch BET cause urban support is importantSo why did I weep when Trayvon Martin was in the streetWhen gangbanging make me kill a nigga blacker than me?Hypocrite!\u201dMe: No, brother, no! Here was a black man invoking the detestable slogan of black-on-black crime to prevent himself from mourning the unjustifiable homicide of a black boy by a Neighborhood Watch vigilante. All I could think was: Where the hell was Kendrick going?\u201cWhat happened to [Michael Brown] should\u2019ve never happened,\u201d he said. \u201cNever. But when we don\u2019t have respect for ourselves, how do we expect them to respect us? It starts from within. Don\u2019t start with just a rally, don\u2019t start from looting. It starts from within.\u201dKendrick wasn\u2019t the first, and he won\u2019t be the last, to make the statement that black deaths are in some way blacks\u2019 fault and that black lives might be a matter of personal responsibility, right down to clothing choice. The idea that a sudden dose of self-respect is part of what is needed to stop the police from killing us is not only ludicrous \u2014 Amadou Diallo wasn\u2019t a gangbanger, but he was shot at 41 times anyway; I think we can assume that the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. had it all right within, but that didn\u2019t protect him from being brutalized by all sorts of authority, nor did his dressing impeccably prevent him from arrest \u2014 it is also old. It\u2019s a belief that the black person has a role to play in the erasure of hate toward herself. That kind of thinking almost suggests that racism makes sense.But racism makes no sense. It is perverse and aberrant yet such a constituent part of the American make up, so normalized in all its forms, that it\u2019s no surprise that the black person would scramble for answers as to why it exists. And in scrambling for answers, you look everywhere, even within: Did I do something to bring this on? Was a part of this outcome in even the slightest way my fault?Fact is, black people have always believed in respectability politics. It\u2019s also at the core of the non-American black\u2019s perspective on race, and I should know, because as a non-American black, I\u2019ve traded in that belief for years. It\u2019s particularly acute with us Jamaicans. Our stories are everywhere: How despite racism, or rather the black American\u2019s self-destructive perception of it, we worked hard to excel and gain respect. We achieved. Everybody knows how hard we Jamaicans work. That\u2019s why I have that job and you, black American, do not. Maybe you should stop whining about your troubles and own up to your laziness. Maybe if you do what I did, you would be manager of that Chase branch on the corner, just like me.Bootstrappism is the chocolate echo of white racism. You can find it in black self-help and how-I-became-a-millionaire books. Prince with \u201cAmerica,\u201d Ice Cube with \u201cLook Who\u2019s Burning.\u201d Lauryn Hill berating black girls who get hair weaves to look like Europeans. Nearly every time Steve Harvey addresses black people. President Barack Obama telling Morehouse College students at their 2013 commencement that there\u2019s \u201cno time for excuses,\u201d a lesson that the fact of their existence proved they didn\u2019t need. It\u2019s a road that leads to the granddaddy of the bootstrap, Bill Cosby, who declared in a 2004 speech that black kids were being shot because they were going around stealing Coca-Cola and poundcake.But Kendrick\u2019s conclusion is far more sophisticated than anything Cosby has ever said. In fact, it\u2019s not a conclusion at all. It was Kendrick doing what he does better than anybody else: complicating a discussion at exactly the point where everybody, including me, tries to simplify it. And this is what he was aiming for all along, questioning what even many black people would never dare question, arguing that yes, every argument, even this one, has two sides. More sides. Adding layers we might need but don\u2019t want. And that\u2019s what he did next, not on wax, but on MTV.\u201cKnow who I am first,\u201d he said. And then he said more than that:\u201cWhen I say, \u2018Gangbanging made me kill a nigga blacker than me,\u2019 this is my life that I\u2019m talking about. I\u2019m not saying you; you might not even be from the streets. I\u2019m not speaking to the community, I\u2019m not speaking of the community,\u201d he continued. \u201cI am the community.\u201dFast-forward to near the end of 2015, and I\u2019m on a flight to New York. Thirty thousand feet above everything, I put on \u201cButterfly,\u201d and something that never happened before happens. This incredible clarity, as if I\u2019d been listening to the soul brother all year but only now was finally hearing him. And then I got to that song, No. 13, the sticking point, the one reason I hadn\u2019t been able to join the best-of-the-year showering of praise, and I realized something that felt sudden yet inevitable. That this song, with its booming beat, the loudest on the record, that seemed to herald it as some global political statement, was in fact Kendrick\u2019s most deeply personal. Almost implosive. That the moment wasn\u2019t about we at all, it just sounded that way. It\u2019s his most \u201cI\u201d moment, reflecting a reality that I couldn\u2019t possibly connect to, only witness and try to understand. It\u2019s as personal as Ice Cube\u2019s \u201cDead Homiez.\u201d He\u2019s not speaking to the community or for the community. He\u2019s speaking for himself or, rather, a version of himself. The smarter me looked in the mirror and asked: \u201cWell, who\u2019s the one playing representational politics here? Who is the one expecting the black man to be Everyman, black man to reflect the universal good will, or at the very least a carefully curated black rage directed at a carefully identified target?\u201dHip-hop has always been about spinning clever fictions, doing what great narratives do: inventing stories that tell the real truth. But post-Biggie and Tupac, it\u2019s so easy to fall hard for hip-hop\u2019s insistence on keeping it real that I\u2019m surprised how easily I still fall for it, thinking that \u201cButterfly\u201d is either confessional or reportage, when it\u2019s neither. We do this over and over, judging artists of color based on a warped idea that legitimacy can come only from experience. You would think I would know better, given that as a novelist, I deal with the same assumption in nearly every interview. One journalist even congratulated me for escaping the ghetto through \u201cthe power of the pen and not the gun.\u201dMy last novel was about Jamaican gang members manipulated by politicians into an attempt on Bob Marley\u2019s life. Young men, murderers before 15, murdered before 18. Nearly everybody assumed that I had experienced some of this. In fact, the first time I heard a live gunshot was watching Martin McDonagh\u2019s play \u201cA Behanding in Spokane.\u201d And once each interviewer was convinced that there was no blood on my hands, then came the skepticism, the disbelief, the doubting: By what authority was I telling these stories? As if knowledge, talent and imagination weren\u2019t enough for a writer of color to make art; as if a work of art can\u2019t be personal and fictitious at the same time, invented and meaningful.And here I was doing the same thing to Kendrick. He was just a man wondering how someone gets to be part of the Black Lives Matter conversation when black lives don\u2019t matter to him. How someone can feel rage at murder while being fine with suicide. He was exploring these themes as concepts \u2014 you know, that thing that artists do. He was posing tricky, difficult questions, for which there were no answers, getting into the middle of his song, feeling it, breathing it, but still inventing. I wonder how much of what I thought my problem was with \u201cThe Blacker the Berry\u201d stemmed from me doing what is still being done to me: Questioning the black gaze, assuming that it must have sprung from something other than the storyteller\u2019s gift. That it must be autobiography or documentary. I\u2019ve never listened to Radiohead\u2019s \u201cA Wolf at the Door\u201d and wondered if Thom Yorke ever paid ransom money for his kidnapped children. Or thought Johnny Cash ever murdered anybody or knew anyone who did. Just like those songs, \u201cThe Blacker the Berry\u201d is several things at once, but mostly, at its essence, it\u2019s just that thing we call art. \u2666Rap and politics, inseparable as ever.By Bijan StephenRap is rooted as much in place and time as it is in rhythm and bass; it\u2019s hyperlocal and organic, if not always cage-free. (Free Max B!) You can tell a song\u2019s provenance from its sound; you can hear what was happening when the record was pressed. A cultural ferment, frozen in amber.Killer Mike & El-P, a.k.a. Run the Jewels, continue to push boundaries with their latest music video. Watch it in virtual reality. Download our NYT VR app.Earlier on the album, on \u201cClose Your Eyes,\u201d Killer Mike, El-P and Zack de la Rocha \u2014 former frontman of Rage Against the Machine \u2014 rap about a prison riot. Listening makes the blood rush to your cheeks, your heartbeat pulse behind your eyes. The value of the album is held between those two songs: It captures the variegated sides of black life in America and its specific feeling, a dizzying mix of frustrated helplessness and joyous survival.Perhaps it\u2019s not surprising that the group\u2019s aesthetic choices are very Public Enemy, which is to say, pretty \u201cretro.\u201d Public Enemy was among the first acts to grasp that for all its durability as an art form, rap is inescapably tied to the black experience. It\u2019s always political, because to live as a black person in America is to be politicized. Run the Jewels gets this. If you listen closely, through their artful grandstanding, you can hear a radical politics. Which is another way of saying the truth; listen, and hear the world change. \u2666A sound like the music on a holistic-medicine website \u2014 but cool.By Max ReadIt used to be, if you wanted to vibrate at the same frequency as the Mayan spacemen, you needed to move to a Southwestern city that specialized in horse art. It used to be, if you wanted your aura photographed, you had to go to a cramped Chinatown crystal shop. These days, there\u2019s a boutique around the corner from my apartment in Brooklyn with a pop-up aura-photography tepee. On a whim, I went to have my aura\u2019s picture taken, only to learn the photographer was fully booked days in advance. New Age is back, and turning up where you wouldn\u2019t have expected it a few years ago \u2014 in places where the young and culturally sophisticated congregate. Places that are, for lack of a better word, hip.It used to be, if you bought an album from a small Vancouver electronic-music label, you could expect some kind of weird minimal techno. These days? You get CFCF\u2019s \u201cThe Colours of Life,\u201d a 40-minute instrumental suite that layers airy synths, noodling guitars, marimbas and, God help us, panpipes over simple, propulsive rhythms. You could talk about it in terms of record-nerd touchstones \u2014 \u201cThe Colours of Life\u201d sounds a bit like the minimalist composer Steve Reich in places, or the Krautrock god Manuel G\u00f6ttsching in others \u2014 but really, it sounds as if it should be advertised on basic cable with stock footage of candles. Or like a cassette tape you would buy from a bookstore with an entire section devoted to \u201cAngels.\u201d Or like seduction music played by a barefoot European man with a soul patch. Do you catch my drift? It\u2019s cool, but it sounds as if it were recorded using a dreamcatcher as a pop filter. It sounds like the music for a 40-minute director\u2019s cut of an airline commercial. It sounds like a poster of a wolf. It sounds like a hologram sticker of a dolphin. It sounds like a tattoo of an open eye. It sounds like the font Papyrus. It\u2019s also really, really good.The assumption always seems to be that the New Age revival is weird, if not insincere in some unspecified, \u201cironic\u201d way. Why would urban-dwelling gentrified-Brooklyn types embrace the atavistic philosophies of conspiracy theorists and mononymous zither players? One answer is that this is how cool works: Things that used to be uncool become cool, and vice versa.But I think maybe it\u2019s the wrong question in the first place. We live in an age of aggressive positivism, a world overtaken by metrics and markets. To accuse New Age revivalism of insincerity \u2014 reducing the possibilities of belief to a binary \u2014 is to miss the point. The gentle woo-woo spirituality of New Age is attractive because it refuses the grinding realities of life spent in the shadow of Wall Street and Hollywood and Silicon Valley. Why wouldn\u2019t people overwhelmed by a slick and well-capitalized culture machine seek their pleasure in something defiantly corny? You can lie, and you can cook the books, but you can\u2019t fake a vibe. If a 40-minute New Age symphony can make you feel good \u2014 instead of harried or judged or pandered to \u2014 why should you care that it sounds like the soundtrack to a 1980s nature documentary? \u2666Is Coldplay bland? The future won\u2019t care.By Jeremy GordonA band that signs up to play the Super Bowl halftime show is making a declaration of immense confidence in its ability to hold a spotlight. It would seem contradictory for that band to then immediately cede that spotlight, but that\u2019s just what Coldplay did. They were contracted as the headliners at this year\u2019s game, but they wisely let Beyonc\u00e9 and Bruno Mars \u2014 both infinitely more charismatic \u2014 take control. As those two stars hit the stage, ready to trade hits and dance moves, the band\u2019s singer, Chris Martin, clung to the background, as if worried he might burst into flames if everyone appeared in the same frame.Coldplay\u2019s deference masks a steady success: For nearly two decades, they\u2019ve written a great many memorable songs, combining earnest Hallmark sentiments with anthemic melodies, worming their way into impressionable hearts and onto the charts. They\u2019re successors to U2, another band that crystallized the ineffable grandeur of the human experience into countless four-minute, radio-ready rock songs. Millions of Super Bowl viewers knew what it meant when Martin sat down at his piano, preparing to bang out the opening chords to \u201cClocks.\u201d As the rapper Future put it in a widely circulated tweet: \u201c#Coldplay legendary forever.\u201dThis brand of wide-screen pop attracts easy put-downs: edgeless, corny, white. But music has never lacked anodyne cornballs who didn\u2019t get their props until years later. Phil Collins used to symbolize the worst of slick \u201980s excess, but over time he has been recognized for his pop craftsmanship and technical innovations (especially the big drum sounds \u2014 you know, that fill in the middle of \u201cIn the Air Tonight\u201d \u2014 that blew a million rappers\u2019 minds). Jokes about how mawkish he seemed in the \u201980s are increasingly irrelevant to young people, who can care only so much about what anything seemed like before they were born.This is likely to be Coldplay\u2019s trajectory, too. Like Phil Collins, Michael McDonald, Abba or any number of desperately unhip artists, their \u201cimage\u201d will evaporate, while their songs will weather the years. In 2009, the Brooklyn band Grizzly Bear conscripted McDonald to sing a version of one of their singles, \u201cWhile You Wait for the Others,\u201d at the peak of their own rarified cool. Chris Martin might be asked to fill a similar role for tomorrow\u2019s Grizzly Bear. Imagine it: Sincerity will once again be on its way out of music, only for a familiar and tender voice to ring throughout the future blogosphere. Because when it\u2019s no longer certain what\u2019s cool, what will be more comforting than an elder statesman who never worried about it to begin with?A few weeks before the Super Bowl, Coldplay and Beyonc\u00e9 released a music video for \u201cHymn for the Weekend,\u201d a collaboration from the band\u2019s most recent and potentially final album. High-profile pop songs like this are conceived as nothing less than events, ready to be performed at mega-happenings like the Super Bowl halftime show. The actual Super Bowl halftime show featured both Coldplay and Beyonc\u00e9 but not the song. Martin said \u201cHymn\u201d was too new and wouldn\u2019t have been \u201cquite right.\u201dWhat his audience wanted was the warmth of familiarity. They wanted \u201cClocks.\u201d The live performance would have been an event, but Martin knows there will be plenty of opportunities in the future. The band is built to endure. \u2666Jeremy Gordon is deputy news editor for Pitchfork.Yes, darling, but is it feminist?By Jamie Lauren KeilesAs good-and-evil Christian morality falls out of fashion among the women in my social universe, a new binary has arisen to organize our outlook. In the heavens, there is all that is feminist: Beyonc\u00e9 singles, the selfie, menstruation ads on the subway and the dream of a woman in the White House. In hell, there is everything else. There are no nonbelievers, and there is no limbo. As new things come into being, we sort them accordingly by asking ourselves, \u201cIs this feminist?\u201dBy June 2015, Fetty Wap\u2019s \u201cTrap Queen\u201d had already claimed its place as the hot song of the summer. Beyond just the pleasures of a classic party anthem \u2014 an infectious hook, synth chords to ramp up your heart rate \u2014 the song offers an American love story for the ages. Fetty is a drug dealer weak-kneed for the girl who can match his hustle. When he cooks crack, she cooks crack with him. When he dreams of Lamborghinis, he dreams in matching pairs. Fetty\u2019s queen doesn\u2019t ride in the passenger seat. The couple make money together, and they spend it together too \u2014 at strip clubs, on weed, on gifts for each other. It\u2019s a vision of a love we can believe in, even outside the dreamland bubble of a rom-com plot. What could be more romantic than two equals teaming up to build their fantasy in a difficult and unjust world?For a summer, \u201cTrap Queen\u201d was everywhere. It would ultimately spend 25 weeks in Billboard\u2019s Top 3. We sang about cooking crack with our babies in the aisles of Duane Reade and on the dance floors of bat mitzvahs. Like Fetty himself, we landed seasonal crushes with \u201cHey, what\u2019s up? Hello!\u201d as our deceptively simple opening line. Rattling trap snares drowned out the sound of ice-cream-truck jingles, and summertime was better for it. But eventually it came time to ask the inevitable: Is \u201cTrap Queen\u201d feminist?I wonder about the purpose of this exercise. Why, in order for \u201cTrap Queen\u201d to be good, must we find a way to wedge it inside the narrow boundaries of white women\u2019s feminism? Is it not good enough on its own? Feminism and \u201cTrap Queen\u201d both spent the last year exploding ever further into the mainstream, and in both cases, we\u2019re still struggling to nail down exactly what they mean. Is the gutted, feel-good pop feminism of that Bustle post the same one that moves a panel of black women to declare Fetty Wap a feminist? Or perhaps the more important question is this: If \u201cTrap Queen\u201d is declared feminist in one system, does it suddenly belong to all feminists, regardless of race, of class or of circumstance?In the year that conversations about identity finally entered the small-talk realm of white folks, we seem to have lost sight of the fact that not everything is created for us \u2014 not even all feminist things. Identity politics is not always about identifying. \u201cTrap Queen\u201d is an immaculate song \u2014 a compelling love story and a true club banger. Perhaps, in the future, we can find a way to say so without needing to claim it for ourselves. \u2666A magnificently cheesy ballad that we\u2019ll never stop listening to.By Jody RosenLionel Richie\u2019s \u201cHello\u201d begins discreetly, almost sneakily, floating a sour little synthesizer melody over tiptoeing piano chords. The song crept into the collective consciousness in similarly stealthy fashion. It arrived in late 1983, buried on Richie\u2019s \u201cCan\u2019t Slow Down,\u201d the second solo album by the former Commodores singer. Reviewers took little notice of \u201dHello\u201d; Richie was ambivalent, cutting the song from \u201cCan\u2019t Slow Down\u201d at one point during the recording sessions before reinstating it. But when \u201cHello\u201d was released as a single in February 1984, it shot to No.1 on Billboard\u2019s Hot 100 and topped charts across the globe.In the decades since, \u201cHello\u201d has never said goodbye. It\u2019s one of those adult-contemporary ballads that has taken up residency in the ether, seeping from the walls of dentists\u2019 offices and tinkling on the phone line while you await a customer-service representative. It\u2019s a song, in other words, that has been judged soothing and innocuous enough to serve as Muzak \u2014 not necessarily an insult, but definitely a misapprehension of the fearsome beast that \u201cHello\u201d is. The song\u2019s narrator is a lovelorn weirdo who is both hapless \u2014 \u201cTell me how to win your heart/For I haven\u2019t got a clue/But let me start by saying/\u2018I love you\u2019\u201d \u2014 and vaguely sinister. The refrain, \u201cHello? Is it me you\u2019re looking for?\u201d sounds benign, but in the video, a dazed-looking Richie stalks the halls of an art school, mooning over a blind sculptor at least 15 years his junior.The revival of \u201dHello\u201d is a curiosity \u2014 a piece of pop flotsam borne back into the mainstream by the Internet\u2019s swirling surf. But it\u2019s also a testament to the magnetism of Lionel Richie, 66, a more durable presence, and a finer musician, than many have cared to admit. The meme-ing of \u201dHello\u201d has coincided with a wider Richie resurgence. \u201cTuskegee\u201d (2012), Richie\u2019s 10th studio album, was a surprise hit that paired the singer with country stars in new renditions of \u201dEasy,\u201d \u201cSay You, Say Me\u201d and other chestnuts. Richie has spent several years barnstorming arenas, quietly re-emerging as a top-grossing touring act. Last June, he played the Glastonbury music festival in England, drawing raves and a crowd of nearly 200,000, the festival\u2019s largest.Back in the \u201980s, I had mixed feelings about Richie: affection for his inescapable hits and regard for his craftsmanship, tinged with disdain I had absorbed from rock critics. He had been the Commodores\u2019 resident softy, the maudlin voice of \u201cThree Times a Lady,\u201d almost too genteel for the band\u2019s tame brand of funk-soul. Critics offered respect, but scorn leaked through: \u201cunctuous,\u201d \u201cmilquetoast,\u201d \u201cwhite-bread.\u201d The bottom line: Richie was talented, but too slight and sappy to be taken seriously.Today he stands as the biggest \u201980s pop star who is not quite canonized. He has sold tens of millions of records worldwide, most of them in the \u201980s, when he strode lofty heights alongside Michael Jackson, Madonna and Prince. But Richie couldn\u2019t match the charisma of those dynamos, and unlike all of them, he has gotten nowhere near the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. The industry celebrates his hit-making: There was an all-star Richie tribute at last month\u2019s Grammys. Still, the highest sort of esteem is denied him.A reappraisal may be in order. What hits me hardest is the robust beauty of Richie\u2019s voice \u2014 a smooth baritone roughened by hints of grit \u2014 and the casual virtuosity with which he puts it to use. Listen to the 1981 Diana Ross duet \u201cEndless Love,\u201d in which Richie enfolds his partner\u2019s rather colorless singing in plush, precise harmony vocals, airlifting the song to its rightful place: the honeymoon suite of a very posh hotel. That mix of understated and overwrought is pure Richie. He deploys one of pop\u2019s subtlest skill sets in the service of ferociously corny songs.The miracle is that Richie makes such sentiments stick. Credit his melodic gift and his knack for arrangements that wash over listeners in cresting, tumbling waves. \u201cHello\u201d is typical, with stately verses that open into a wind-whipped chorus. When the song rears up into its final refrain (\u201c\u2019Cause I wonder where you are ... \u201c), the effect is that of a unicorn rising on its hind legs, mane flashing, to meet the purple dawn.In short, Richie is a great singer-songwriter and a world-historical cheeseball. A century-plus of pop history has not erased the squeamishness we feel when faced with ballads like Richie\u2019s. Today\u2019s music critics have largely abandoned old snobberies, embracing commercial pop in all its gaudy splendor. Yet songs like \u201cHello\u201d remain for many a bridge too far, a musical pleasure we still take with a side helping of guilt.But pop culture has evolved a nifty system, allowing us to luxuriate in music we pretend to hold at arm\u2019s length. The campy karaoke performance, the TV comedy sketch, the \u201cRickroll\u201d \u2014 these bring songs back to us under the cover of irony. It\u2019s canon-making, 2016 style: We mock-venerate old records as kitsch and, lo and behold, they get inscribed in the Celestial Songbook.Richie knows how this game is played \u2014 how to laugh at himself, politely, and all the way to the bank. Last fall, he appeared on \u201cThe Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon,\u201d or rather, his disembodied head did: Richie played the role of the Lionel Richie bust, duetting with Fallon in a \u201cHello\u201d spoof. When Richie performs, though, the irony melts away.That\u2019s what happened at Glastonbury, where a crowd of mostly white rock fans greeted Richie in high tongue-in-cheek mode, waving banners with slogans lifted from memes. But when the opening strains of \u201dHello\u201d sounded, the throng erupted, joining Richie in a singalong as joyously cathartic as any you will hear. Suddenly, \u201cHello\u201d wasn\u2019t a tacky \u201980s artifact \u2014 the song was a communal hearth fire, casting a rosy glow over 200,000 souls. It was an example of pop\u2019s mysterious sorcery, the way that certain alchemical blends of music and words strike us right in the gut, circumnavigating our high-minded aesthetic ideals and studied postures. It was a reminder that some of the most powerful songs are the most gauche, scrambling together beauty and vulgarity, exquisite craftsmanship and appalling taste, exalted chivalric love-oaths and the queasy come-ons of a dork with a mullet. As for that Clay Head From the Lionel Richie \u201cHello\u201d Video: It works equally well as a platter for your cream-cheese dip and a bust on pop\u2019s Mount Rushmore. \u2666The master producer opens up his workshop.Photographs by JRA \u2018classical\u2019 musician with legions of unclassical admirers \u2014 including Kanye West.By Mark LevineA few years ago, Shaw, then 30, shocked the classical-music world by becoming the youngest-ever winner of a Pulitzer Prize in music. Shaw won for a piece she wrote for the cultish vocal group Roomful of Teeth, which specializes in otherworldly sounds that hardly suggest the word \u201cclassical,\u201d and which she is a member of. In swift fashion, Shaw emerged as the face of a flourishing scene of young composers \u2014 people like Nico Muhly, Gabriel Kahane and Missy Mazzoli \u2014 who were blurring the lines between classical and indie music. For the previous month or two, raw video footage from a fund-raiser held by the Democratic National Committee in San Francisco, and attended by President Obama, had been circulating online, showing Shaw singing a long, hypnotic, wordless introduction to Kanye West\u2019s performance of his song \u201cPower.\u201dIn Iowa, Shaw came onstage and sat cross-legged on her chair among the string players. Small and pixieish, she could easily have passed for a college student. She prefaced her work \u201cBy & By,\u201d a setting of three gospel songs, by saying that she was hoping to restore some authenticity to commercialized old-time music, and then began singing in an unadorned, incantatory alto shaded with both sorrow and fervor. Her slow, ribbonlike phrases, hovering just this side of harmonic resolution, might have risen from the Middle Ages as much as from the middle of Appalachia. The players plucked their instruments with picks, banjo-style, and occasionally broke into odd, agitated strumming or sawed away at their strings with the wooden part of the bow. Shaw and JACK could seem to be drifting into different songs, Shaw\u2019s vocals lost in plaintiveness while the quartet fought through bouts of improvisatory chaos. But the strewn-out pieces of sound kept finding their way back to one another. For all the hints of disruptiveness in the music, this was crowd-pleasing stuff, and the young members of the audience responded with shouts.Not long after the concert, Shaw and I struck up a phone and email correspondence. She grew up in Greenville, N.C., where her mother, a violin teacher, started her on the instrument at 2. \u201cI was a straight-up suburban Suzuki kid,\u201d she told me, reared on a strict diet of classical music. \u201cI lived under a rock for many years.\u201d She went to Rice University to study violin, then moved on to Yale for a master\u2019s in performance. While there, she sang in church choirs for $15 an hour to help pay the bills and got a job as an accompanist for dance classes, work that required her to improvise music on demand for a variety of rhythms, tempos and styles of movement. \u201cIf you\u2019re a good accompanist,\u201d she says, \u201cno one notices you. It\u2019s a way of making music to serve something that\u2019s larger than you, but something that\u2019s very human and simple, which is dance.\u201dAfter Yale, she moved to New York and gravitated toward the edges of the classical-music scene. She played a lot of thorny contemporary music, which often left her yearning for the full-bodied pleasures of traditional harmony, and which set her to wondering what she might have done differently had she written the score herself. She had also developed into a specialist in Baroque violin and sang early music in the choir of Trinity Church in Lower Manhattan. In 2009, she heard about an a cappella group that was being put together to explore vocal practices rarely found in standard classical music. \u201cIt was a gig, yes, but what a crazy adventure to learn things like throat singing and yodeling,\u201d she says.That summer, the group, Roomful of Teeth, met for the first time in a three-week residency at Mass MoCA, the contemporary art museum in North Adams, Mass. The eight young members settled in to study with a master throat singer from Tuva, a region of southern Siberia. The group\u2019s director, Brad Wells, invited them to write music for their first performance. Shaw worked late into the night after each day\u2019s rehearsal, \u201ctrying out these chords,\u201d as she puts it, \u201cand moving things around. I had it in my mind that I wanted to hear a mass of people talking, saying things that didn\u2019t have any particular content. Then I wanted to hear the talk break down into a guttural sound, \u2018vocal fry,\u2019 with no words, just vowels \u2014 the kind of thing kids do, just play with sound. And then I wanted to hear that strange sound turn into a big, beautiful chord, sung by all eight of us, a split second later.\u201dAfter 10 days, Shaw had a draft of a piece, \u201cPassacaglia,\u201d to take to rehearsal. It gave the group a chance to practice some of the effects they had been working on, like the lawnmowerish textures of throat singing and the sudden transition between head and chest voice that characterizes yodeling. There was a spoken text \u2014 from \u201cWall Drawing 305,\u201d by Sol LeWitt, on display at Mass MoCA \u2014 which, torn from context, came across as surreal and vaguely menacing. The work\u2019s opening harmonies, though, were straight from classical tradition. The audience at the first concert cheered and applauded when the swarming, crackling sounds of the vocal meltdown in \u201cPassacaglia\u201d resolved, suddenly and triumphantly, by returning to the piece\u2019s opening D-major chord.The following two summers, Roomful of Teeth returned to Mass MoCA, and Shaw wrote three more pieces, which she put together as a four-movement work called \u201cPartita for Eight Voices.\u201d The range of vocalizations expanded to include whispers, sighs, grunts, gasps, murmurs, whoops, heavy breathing. For a work written by a relative novice, \u201cPartita\u201d bristled with assurance. On a lark, Shaw wrote a check for $50 and submitted \u201cPartita\u201d to the Pulitzer committee, thinking it a useful way to get the high-profile judges to listen to Roomful of Teeth. She was walking along the Hudson on a spring afternoon when a friend called to tell her she had won the prize. Nine months later, Roomful of Teeth, which had mounted a Kickstarter campaign to help finance its first recording, which included \u201cPartita,\u201d won a Grammy. The group now has bookings for close to 75 performances this year.Last May, Kanye West heard Roomful of Teeth perform \u201cPartita for Eight Voices\u201d at Walt Disney Concert Hall in Los Angeles and came backstage afterward to meet the group. \u201cHe just seemed like someone who is honestly curious and interested in finding something new,\u201d Shaw recalls. \u201cWe exchanged phone numbers and started talking.\u201d West asked Shaw to produce a new version of his song \u201cSay You Will,\u201d a track from his 2008 album \u201c808s & Heartbreak.\u201d \u201cThere was no assignment given,\u201d Shaw says. \u201cI just did what I wanted to, and he really liked it.\u201d West released the remix on SoundCloud and added Shaw to the legion of collaborators on his new project, \u201cThe Life of Pablo,\u201d bringing her to Los Angeles for three weeks of studio work. She ended up co-writing, co-producing or contributing vocals to several songs.\u201cI\u2019m not really allowed to talk about it,\u201d Shaw told me. But she went on: \u201cThe work was really fun. It was like being given an amazing coloring book and being told to use all your crayons, use your paint and scissors, anything at all.\u201d At first, Shaw had little familiarity with West\u2019s music. She recognized an affinity, though. \u201cEverything is tightly, tightly controlled, held back, held onto. And then the moment comes and it just breaks out, everything explodes.\u201d Shaw paused seriously for a moment, then laughed. \u201cI kinda love that.\u201d \u2666\u2018Mr. Worldwide\u2019 speaks in pan-Caribbean code.By Julianne Escobedo ShepherdThere\u2019s a reason Pitbull christened himself \u201cMr. Worldwide\u201d: The bombastic party rapper is a global phenomenon. He also tends to be served a global helping of ire. In February, he closed out the Grammy Awards with his reggaeton single \u201cEl Taxi,\u201d in a slot normally reserved for rock music (and, occasionally, rock-rap hybrids); by the song\u2019s end, several Twitter users, including the \u201cBroad City\u201d comedy writer Chris Kelly, had likened the performance to the Zika virus.Jamaica and Cuba have enjoyed a friendly relationship since the early 1970s, when the former lobbied the Organization of American States in support of the latter. More important, though, there\u2019s Miami, the spiritual home of the \u201cEl Taxi\u201d sensibilities \u2014 where Caribbean immigrants have for decades melded and commingled culture and influence, with itinerant communities cross-pollinating and building off one another. Chaka Demus certainly approved of \u201cEl Taxi\u201d building on his original, \u201cthe biggest dancehall song of all time,\u201d as he told The Jamaica Star. (Besides, he said, \u201cI have lost track of the amount of persons who have copied the song already.\u201d)Diasporas live and thrive in these sonic interchanges, which work almost like a code among the communities that create them \u2014 a point of conversation among very different peoples whom the mainstream holds equally at arm\u2019s length. Pitbull described himself, in a 2015 Billboard interview, as \u201cthe epitome of the American dream, the underdog, the fighter, the forever hungry, forever appreciative.\u201d Some may be reasonably allergic to the strobe-light pulse of his Miami party zone. But every beat clearly illustrates the way immigrants have learned to flip that disdain to their advantage. \u2666The return of perfectly imperfect soul.By Amanda PetrusichThe R.&B. singer D\u2019Angelo once took a 14-year retreat from his public. After a tour for the 2000 platinum-selling \u201cVoodoo\u201d \u2014 during which grown women were reportedly shrieking, nightly, for D\u2019Angelo to reveal his carved abdomen, then so acutely defined that it seemed unreal, phantasmagoric \u2014 he split, using booze, drugs and solitude to numb his disappointment with a business that seemed to have everything backward. \u201cI\u2019m going to go in the woods, drink some hooch, grow a beard and get fat,\u201d is how he put it to his friend and collaborator Questlove.The decade-plus of pop music that D\u2019Angelo sat out was driven, in large part, by neurotic precision. Some of this is surely attributable to the Swedish superproducer Max Martin, who favors a punchy, airless, symmetrical approach to rhythm. You hit the beat and hit it squarely. Martin\u2019s aesthetic is ubiquitous \u2014 he has worked with Taylor Swift, Katy Perry, Adele, Maroon 5 and dozens of others \u2014 and doesn\u2019t allow for much creative meandering. In the Martin era, so much pop music has been violent in its fastidiousness: no stumbling, no retreat, no lackadaisical exhalations.It\u2019s not that \u201cReally Love\u201d is muddy or inexact \u2014 although by Martin\u2019s yardstick, it probably is \u2014 but that it\u2019s gentle, unstressed, forgiving of itself. This is not so unusual in R.&B. and soul, formative genres for D\u2019Angelo, but it has become anomalous within pop. While a listener might find it easier, at first, to holler along with a more fastidious singer like Taylor Swift (It is extraordinarily satisfying! Shouting each fixed syllable! Participating in the one! And only! Way! The song! Allows for!), D\u2019Angelo\u2019s vocal performance encourages something softer and less preordained. Even the few seconds of gritty crackle included at the end \u2014 a turntable\u2019s needle jerking into a run-out groove \u2014 suggest a way to quiet the mind, let the edges blur a little, like when you accidentally fall asleep in a poolside chaise, drink still in hand. It is hard, now, not to read D\u2019Angelo\u2019s departure as a reiteration of a creative ethos, writ larger; slowness, here, is not ignoble or archaic. It feels, instead, like a subversive act: a revolution of patience. \u2666From a jailed star, a soundtrack for Jamaica\u2019s cynical politics.By Miriam MarkowitzThat is, the party\u2019s political opposition, the Jamaica Labour Party, was too weak to have committed the crime. Riffing on another line from \u201cWeh Dem Feel Like,\u201d Vaz exhorted his listeners to \u201cload up the guns,\u201d before a D.J. played a few bars of the song. In newspapers for days afterward, politicians and private citizens denounced Vaz for his carelessness: On the eve of an election, a time when Jamaica\u2019s fragile political peace has historically been rived by violence, Vaz had channeled the menace of Vybz Kartel.Jailed on suspicion of murder in 2011 and convicted in 2014, Kartel is Jamaica\u2019s pre-eminent entertainer and a quandary for the political class, which has long defined itself in opposition to the nation\u2019s popular music \u2014 first reggae and now dancehall, its rude, raucous up-tempo successor. Jamaican artists like Buju Banton, Bounty Killer and Beenie Man popularized dancehall abroad in the \u201990s, and later crossover stars like Sean Paul and Shaggy scored stateside hits with \u201cGimme the Light\u201d and \u201cBoombastic.\u201d But dancehall\u2019s influence is even more profound, having grown from an indigenous genre into the ghost in the pop-music machine. It seeded the evolution of rap, drum and bass and electronic dance music, and has infiltrated American pop from Justin Bieber to Beyonc\u00e9. \u201cWork,\u201d the newest single from the Barbadian superstar Rihanna, is effectively dancehall, as was her first hit, \u201cPon de Replay\u201d in 2005.Here in Jamaica \u2014 where dancehall is the soundtrack to life, blasting every day and late into the night from car stereos and jury-rigged home speakers, in rum bars and barbershops \u2014 Kartel remains the genre\u2019s reigning monarch, despite having spent the last five years in prison. Born Adidja Palmer, Kartel built his reputation with graphic songs about guns, sex and unapologetic social transgressions, like bleaching his skin. His empire has extended beyond music to products, including a line of cake soap and \u201cdaggering\u201d condoms, named after a dance move in which a couple simulates rough sex on the dance floor. In 2014, he was convicted of murdering an associate, Clyde (Lizard) Williams, who disappeared in 2011 and whose body was never recovered. Kartel, who maintains his innocence, has continued to dominate the airwaves and awards circuit and somehow seems to be recording music in prison; a new album, \u201cViking (Vybz Is King),\u201d appeared last year.As the two political parties fought to form the next government, Vaz was not the only politician to take his cues from Kartel and dancehall. In November, Andrew Holness, the Jamaica Labour Party leader, toured Montego Bay wearing Clarks, Jamaica\u2019s most fashionable footwear, whose prices doubled on the island in 2010 after Kartel penned an ode to the British brand. Holness tweeted a picture of himself dusting off a brown shoe in Kartel\u2019s preferred style, the \u201cdesert boot,\u201d and Twitter went wild. \u201cA weh yuh get dah new Clarks deh daadi?\u201d Holness wrote, echoing the question posed to Kartel by Popcaan, another dancehall superstar and Kartel\u2019s now-estranged prot\u00e9g\u00e9.The People\u2019s National Party, meanwhile, has its own house D.J., Foota Hype. In January, Lisa Hanna, the party\u2019s minister for youth and culture and a former Miss Jamaica, posted lyrics on Instagram from \u201cSchool,\u201d one of Kartel\u2019s newer songs, in which he implores students to study hard and to refrain from bleaching their skin. Hanna might have been returning a compliment paid to her by Kartel, who late last year released a song, \u201cBoss Lady,\u201d that praised Hanna and also Portia Simpson Miller, then the prime minister.In their appeals to dancehall fandom, these politicians hoped to inspire an electorate exhausted by empty promises. Since 1989, when the previously socialist-leaning People\u2019s National Party embraced economic neoliberalism, the ideological gap between the two parties has collapsed. Jamaica\u2019s debt-to-G.D.P. ratio has reached 125 percent, making it one of the world\u2019s premier debtor states; I.M.F.-imposed austerity measures have yielded high unemployment rates and a declining standard of living. For young people \u2014 almost half of whom would, according to a recent poll, relinquish their Jamaican citizenship to live abroad \u2014 party politics is increasingly dispiriting. Dancehall is the perfect accompaniment to their mood: a jaded and bacchanalian lament for the Jamaican future as envisioned by its young.In \u201cWeh Dem Feel Like,\u201d Kartel asks about his enemies, \u201cDem skin too tough fi bleed?\u201d \u2014 a fitting question, too, regarding Jamaica\u2019s frequently violent politics. All told, before the voting, at least four people were shot to death at campaign events, and dozens more were injured in a stampede. When the votes were tallied last month, the nation got what it expected: a virtual tie between two nearly identical parties, with the Jamaica Labour Party eking out a slim majority. Vaz, Holness and Hanna won their seats handily. It was considered, by Jamaican standards, a peaceful election. \u2666110 million views and counting.By Jayson GreeneWhere on earth is the monoculture in 2016? It\u2019s clearly not dead. There is a song out right now: It\u2019s called \u201cStressed Out,\u201d and it is by a group called Twenty One Pilots. I discovered it recently, while poking around online during an office lunch break. As I watched the video play in its tiny YouTube window, I was dismayed to discover something. This song, by this group, of whose existence I had not been even dimly aware, had been viewed 110 million times.Bowled over, I consulted the Billboard charts and saw that \u201cStressed Out\u201d by Twenty One Pilots was the No. 3 song in the nation. (And seriously: Twenty One Pilots? Was this name invented by a spambot? Was their Twitter icon an egg?) A sense of the uncanny crept in: What else didn\u2019t I know about? Where was I, in relation to everyone else? Digging around more, I learned that the duo used to loiter outside a Chick-fil-A in their hometown, Columbus, Ohio, hawking tickets to their shows. Now, just a few years later, they\u2019re scheduled to play 75 arenas and counting in 2016. Their success has a certain \u201cAlex from Target\u201d feel to it, in which incomprehensible unseen forces conspire to lift an arbitrary phenomenon up into the national spotlight.In pop culture, \u201cincomprehensible unseen forces\u201d can reliably be shortened to just \u201cteenagers.\u201d And sure enough, dipping into Tumblr and Vine and Twitter \u2014 alone, again, on my office lunch break \u2014 reveals the band has a deep and devoted learner\u2019s-permit fan base. The appeal of \u201cStressed Out\u201d for teenagers is easy enough to grasp: It sounds like a cheery telegram from turn-of-the-century MTV \u2014 a kind of singsong rap that transforms, in the chorus, into emo pop. The backbeat instantly recalls Eminem\u2019s \u201cMy Name Is,\u201d and the verses take you back to Crazy Town\u2019s \u201cButterfly.\u201d Sometimes Tyler Joseph, their singer, picks up a ukulele, in the manner of so many YouTube stars. The whole thing is like a microhistory of the last 20 years of suburban white people.Music can take you to unexpected places.By Jazmine HughesI\u2019ve held onto that idea \u2014 a song as a route \u2014 ever since. The trick to music, though, is that it doesn\u2019t really take you anywhere; you take yourself. The song is just the ticket, the map, the conduit. You arrive at the destination entirely on your own.That sound brings me directly to my grandmother\u2019s church in Roanoke, Va., where I received my first blessing as a human baby (I don\u2019t remember), learned my first proper hymn (I don\u2019t remember) and, as a toddler, stood up on the pew and interrupted the service in which my Mema received special accolades from the pastor (I don\u2019t remember, but I wish I did). Hearing an organ is my own vibrant Sunday morning: slicing the thick air with a paper fan, tightening my stomach muscles to quiet any rumbling until lunch, trying not to sweat out my freshly pressed hair, searching for a lesson within the sermon that I could believe in. The song made me 2 again, then 5, then 12 and then (and now) 24, in the room but ever-so-slightly out of place, seeing love and trying to feel it. \u201cSunday Candy\u201d took me down South, took me back, put me back into my grandmother\u2019s lap for four generous, holy minutes. Church, still, is a strange sort of refuge: I never want to go, but I\u2019m always glad I went. I really go only whenever I visit my grandma.\u201cSunday Candy\u201d ends the way my grandma\u2019s church service always began: with the choir. The superb, slowed-down version Chance performed on \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d in late 2015 is as close to a hip-hop gospel song as I\u2019ve ever heard, due mostly to the outsize presence of that choir with its call-and-response approach to repetition. Chance ends the performance with a breathless, ecclesiastical freestyle not unlike the climax of a sermon, marrying the spiritual transcendence of a Sunday service with his artistic one.In buttoned-up Bulgaria, a viral sensation who plows through every taboo.By Mac McClellandBorn in Bulgaria\u2019s only women\u2019s prison (his mother was arrested for selling imported clothes before the fall of Communism), Azis was, he says, marked since birth \u201cto be different.\u201d He was gay in a culture that rejects homosexuality and Roma in a country \u2014 one of several \u2014 that continues to persecute the group. \u201cBeing gay and being Roma are highly discriminated against in Bulgaria,\u201d Azis continued. \u201cThey\u2019re both words that people here hate. For me, I\u2019m carrying the burden of the two.\u201dNonetheless, Azis\u2019s mother was determined to make her son a star, and after she got out of prison, she dragged him to endless auditions. But \u201cnobody wanted a Gypsy kid,\u201d Azis went on. \u201cThey just didn\u2019t want a Gypsy in their choir, a Gypsy standing in front, on TV, anywhere; it was beyond imagination to have somebody like me there.\u201d Eventually, this string of humiliations \u201ccrushed\u201d his mother. They moved to West Germany when Azis was 8. He returned to Bulgaria a few years later, after the wall came down; his mother\u2019s dream became his own the night he sang in a restaurant with live accompaniment. \u201cI felt really intoxicated by performing,\u201d he recalled. In his early 20s, he signed with a music agency in Sofia and a year later won best artist at a Bulgarian music festival. Within two years, he sold out the country\u2019s biggest stadium, where, with Communism more than a decade gone, he took the stage wearing high-heeled red leather boots that went up to his crotch.Now 38, Azis has dropped what he calls his \u201cdiva\u201d look. This is partly because he\u2019s \u201ctired and too old for everything\u201d \u2014 it takes him three hours to get into drag \u2014 but also because he no longer feels the need to make statements. \u201cNowadays, you can see boys in tight jeans holding hands on the street. And there is a street in Sofia where you can have sex with a transsexual.\u201d He laughed, a full throaty chuckle like a glamorous Disney villain. \u201cI\u2019ve done what I could to change people\u2019s perceptions,\u201d he later added. \u201cI showed that you can be Gypsy and you can be intelligent, you could be gay and you can be cool. That\u2019s it. I cannot do the very same thing for 20 years.\u201d\u201cHabibi\u201d may take its name from an Arabic endearment, but he insists he\u2019s not trying to imply that, in Bulgaria, Arabs may suffer a fate similar to the Roma. (A recent Amnesty International report noted that migrants live in terror of \u201cxenophobic hate crimes\u201d and admonished Bulgaria to address this climate of fear.) Rather, he explains, it\u2019s that Arab barbershops are trendy in Bulgaria. He has seen young people talking about them on Facebook.One day, the diva look will be back, he promises. In the meantime, he\u2019s considering recording a song entirely in English for American audiences, for whom he does have a message, however apolitical. \u201cI want them to know about Bulgaria,\u201d he said. \u201cI want to tell them that it\u2019s a small but very beautiful country, the nature here is amazing, the people are very friendly, especially in the countryside, and we have the most delicious feta cheese.\u201d \u2666On composing music, and your death, while dying.By Will HermesThere\u2019s a tradition of \u201cdeath poems\u201d in some Asian countries, and as a generation of outspoken musicians shuffles off our coil, the farewell album has become a Western equivalent. John Coltrane\u2019s \u201cExpression\u201d might be considered a forerunner. Warren Zevon made \u201cThe Wind\u201d after a diagnosis of inoperable cancer. On the last of Johnny Cash\u2019s \u201cAmerican Recordings\u201d series released during his lifetime, he performed Trent Reznor\u2019s \u201cHurt\u201d as a sort of deathbed confessional, then closed with \u201cWe\u2019ll Meet Again,\u201d a World War II-era send-off that was the smirking existential finale of \u201cDr. Strangelove.\u201dOther late works tilt toward consecrating summary, like Bach\u2019s \u201cMass in B Minor\u201d \u2014 or the new album by Loretta Lynn, still hale at 83, which reprises pointed favorites like \u201cEverybody Wants to Go to Heaven\u201d (\u201cbut nobody wants to die\u201d). Lou Reed\u2019s parting shot was extreme, even for him: a harsh art-metal collaboration with Metallica that reimagines Frank Wedekind\u2019s violently sexual \u201cLulu\u201d plays. But Reed was always a button-pusher. \u201cThe greatest disappointment/Age withered him and changed him,\u201d he snarled on \u201cJunior Dad,\u201d a song as mercilessly cleareyed as Reed\u2019s signature \u201cHeroin.\u201d Bowie is said to have called \u201cLulu\u201d his friend\u2019s \u201cgreatest work,\u201d a judgment colored, perhaps, by his own exit-music plans.In an era when our deaths are generally scripted by a profit-driven medical establishment, these conscious farewells are inspiring. Death is one of life\u2019s main events: Shouldn\u2019t it be our own composition? Reed died at home, surrounded by friends and family, with a posthumous, invite-only tribute at the Apollo Theater. There was no public funeral service for Bowie, only a final photo left on Instagram taken shortly before he died \u2014 the former and eternal Ziggy Stardust looking dapper in a designer suit, rakish hat and no socks, grinning widely, ready for his next act. \u2666Digital Design: Rodrigo de Benito Sanz and Linsey Fields.A picture caption on March 13 with an article about Sydney Bennett, leader of the band the Internet, misspelled the surname of the band\u2019s bassist. He is Patrick Paige II, not Page.An article on March 13 about the rapper Kendrick Lamar and his song \u2018\u2018The Blacker the Berry\u2019\u2019 paraphrased incorrectly the lyrics of a song by Lauryn Hill. She criticized black women who wear hair weaves that look European; she did not say that they got the weaves from Koreans.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Jessica Hecht, a Star of \u2018Fiddler on the Roof,\u2019 at Home", "Date": "2016-03-04", "News": "Supported byWhat I Love9 PhotosJessica Hecht\u2019s secret vice \u2014 although it isn\u2019t much of a vice and now, of course, it will no longer be a secret \u2014 involves standing at the kitchen window of her Midtown co-op and checking in on the strangers who live across the street.\u201cIf you\u2019re having a bad day, you see that everybody has trouble with their kids,\u201d she continued. \u201cYou see someone talking. You see someone crying. You see a husband touching his wife\u2019s head, and you think, \u2018What a nice couple. What a lovely couple.\u2019 \u201dThe very winsome Ms. Hecht and her husband, Adam Bernstein, a television and film director, are \u00e9migr\u00e9s from Hell\u2019s Kitchen, where for a decade they lived in a loft in the mid-West 50s. \u201cWe bought when Hell\u2019s Kitchen wasn\u2019t quite happening yet, and it was great, but we decided that having all that open space wasn\u2019t so good as our children were approaching their teen years,\u201d Ms. Hecht said of Stella, now 16, and Carlo, 14. \u201cWe came to a point where we decided we had to make it less loft-like and have actual rooms, or look for a new place.\u201dDespite such provenance, it took a certain amount of holiday cheer and good will to look beyond the peeling wallpaper in every room, the Lilliputian kitchen and the built-in rows of skinny drawers in the master bedroom.\u201cThe previous owner had been in the shirt business, and he put one shirt in each drawer,\u201d Ms. Hecht said. \u201cIt was a really interesting, dilapidated apartment, and the seller had just lost a contract, and it was Christmas Eve. And we thought, \u2018Why not?\u2019 \u201dWhen they tore down the wallpaper in the master bedroom, they replaced it with a similar floral pattern. Enamored of the vintage black-and-white tiles, they determinedly kept the bathrooms intact, even holding onto the previous owner\u2019s extendable shaving mirror. \u201cSome people want spa bathrooms, but I love the old stuff,\u201d Ms. Hecht said. \u201cThere must be some energy that rooms give off from the different lives that were lived there. You don\u2019t want to eradicate it all.\u201dBecause Mr. Bernstein has very exacting midcentury modern taste, and because Ms. Hecht has cheerfully bought into it, \u201ceverything has a rather Scandinavian feel, all those clean lines,\u201d she said. That feel is embodied in the Heywood-Wakefield dining table and coffee table, and in the two Danish-modern consoles that stand side by side. One, the genuine article, was a find on eBay; the other was commissioned by the couple.Mr. Bernstein likes bare walls, so family photos and souvenirs are displayed in nooks on the bookshelves. \u201cMy friends come here and say, \u2018Where\u2019s your stuff?\u2019 because it\u2019s all pretty sparse,\u201d Ms. Hecht said. \u201cIt\u2019s funny, but I\u2019ve grown to appreciate my husband\u2019s aesthetic.\u201dIn any case, she has found a place in the living room to display those objects that are most dear to her. They include a set of brass candlesticks from St. Petersburg, a legacy from a great-grandmother that now has added resonance thanks to her role in \u201cFiddler\u201d; a limited-edition Modigliani print from her paternal grandmother, \u201ca big socialist in the Bronx,\u201d Ms. Hecht said; and her physicist father\u2019s doctoral thesis. \u201cIt\u2019s like a work of art almost,\u201d she said, turning the pages and admiring the handwritten charts and computations. \u201cMy dad died a year ago, and I\u2019m extremely sentimental and nostalgic.\u201dMs. Hecht and her husband put their apartment on the market for a brief period last year. They had always wanted to live up near Columbia University, and maybe the time was right. \u201cWhen you haven\u2019t lived in a place long enough or your kids haven\u2019t experienced enough in it, your home can feel like a no man\u2019s land, and that\u2019s the way I felt here for the first three years,\u201d Ms. Hecht said. \u201cMy husband was traveling, and my kids were in middle school, and they were very emotional, and it seemed like our house was full of chaos.\u201dFor assorted reasons \u2014 among them, Ms. Hecht\u2019s growing contentment \u2014 the moving plans were scotched. \u201cSome months ago, I walked in and thought, \u2018This is my house. My books are here, and my baking stuff is here, and this is definitely my house.\u2019 \u201dBut some things don\u2019t change. Ms. Hecht still finds Midtown \u201cquite overwhelming.\u201d Then again, she couldn\u2019t have an easier commute to work. \u201cFiddler\u201d is playing a mere half-dozen blocks away. She often comes home between shows on matinee days to take a shower and cook dinner for her family, though she\u2019s far more celebrated for her a.m. contributions.\u201cBecause I\u2019m not around at night because of work, I always get up and make breakfast,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s our thing. Even if no one wants to talk, I make a lot of muffins and biscuits. My husband calls me the morning hostess.\u201dShe added: \u201cAt the end of the day, my kids don\u2019t care that I did any of these plays. They don\u2019t care about any of this stuff. They care that they had breakfast.\u201dAdvertisement"}
