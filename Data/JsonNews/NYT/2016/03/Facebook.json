Yes, Experts Say, but Here Are Some Tips", "Date": "2016-03-30", "News": "Supported byHe\u2019s in the Netherlands now, visiting a former roommate and his family, and will head to Belgium in a few days.\u201cAnything can happen anywhere at any time,\u201d Mr. Patterson, a Texas resident, said through messages on Twitter. \u201cYou can\u2019t stop living life, and this world is worth seeing, so I chose to do it.\u201dHe\u2019s not alone.\u201cAmericans especially seem to be fairly resilient and do not panic and cancel trips, unless perhaps they are traveling in the next few days,\u201d Jennifer Michels Jones, vice president of communications for the American Society of Travel Agents, said in an email.After the attacks in Paris last fall, 64 percent of the association\u2019s agents found that their clients did not plan to delay or cancel travel to and from or within Europe.The travel alerts issued by the State Department also fall far short of advising people to cancel their plans.\u201cWe\u2019re not saying, \u2018Don\u2019t travel,\u2019 especially not to Europe, but we are saying, \u2018Be careful if you do,\u2019\u201d said Michelle Bernier-Toth, the managing director of the federal Office of Overseas Citizens Services.Here are seven ways to take care when traveling to Europe, or really, anywhere.1. Log travel plans with the State Department. 2. Know how to contact the American Embassy.\u201cKnowing how to get ahold of us is important,\u201d Ms. Bernier-Toth said. \u201cIn the event of a major event, we will work as quickly as possible to identify people who need our assistance and do what we can to help.\u201d3. Find out how to contact local authorities in case of an emergency.On the page opened in Step 2, each country\u2019s equivalent to \u201c911\u201d is listed, as well. Britain\u2019s equivalent is 999. In France, it\u2019s 112. In Belgium, it\u2019s 101 if it requires the police, or 112 for everything else. This information is under the \u201cSafety and Security\u201d pull-down menu, though not usually at the top.4. Those phone numbers are only useful for working phones.But if something does happen, the number of people trying to make phone calls around the same time can overwhelm phone lines. \u201cBut often text messages will go through,\u201d Ms. Bernier-Toth said. Social media sites, like Facebook, and free messaging services, like WhatsApp or WeChat, are alternatives, too.5. Be vigilant when in public places and using mass transit. \u201cI don\u2019t think you can avoid using mass transit, but be smart about that,\u201d Ms. Bernier-Toth said. \u201cKnow the exit strategy.\u201d The same applies to major tourist attractions, sporting events, restaurants and other crowded areas.6. Give a copy of your itinerary to family members or friends.\u201cWe get a lot of calls from people who are worried sick about their family members overseas but don\u2019t have any idea where they are,\u201d Ms. Bernier-Toth noted.7. Understand the differences among travel insurance policies.Some policies will cover medical expenses. Others won\u2019t. And there are always clauses to worry about.\u201cWe recommend travelers ask the travel insurance provider about force majeure clauses and whether or not they are covered,\u201d Mrs. Michels Jones said. \u201cThese are things in contracts that are unavoidable accidents or chance occurrences that cannot be planned.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Robert De Niro Defends Screening of Anti-Vaccine Film at Tribeca Festival", "Date": "2016-03-25", "News": "Supported byOn the festival\u2019s website, the biographical material about Mr. Wakefield does not mention that he was stripped of his license or that his Lancet study was retracted. Rather, it says that the Lancet study \u201cwould catapult Wakefield into becoming one of the most controversial figures in the history of medicine.\u201dThe retraction by Science of a study of changing attitudes on gay marriage is the latest in a growing number of prominent withdrawals of the results of studies from scientific literature.On Friday, Robert De Niro, one of the festival\u2019s founders, said in a statement issued through the festival\u2019s publicists that he supported the plan to show the movie next month, although he said he was \u201cnot personally endorsing the film,\u201d nor was he against vaccination. Mr. De Niro\u2019s statement seemed to suggest that this was the first time he has expressed a preference that a particular film be shown at the festival.\u201cGrace and I have a child with autism,\u201d he wrote, referring to his wife, Grace Hightower De Niro, \u201cand we believe it is critical that all of the issues surrounding the causes of autism be openly discussed and examined. In the 15 years since the Tribeca Film Festival was founded, I have never asked for a film to be screened or gotten involved in the programming. However this is very personal to me and my family and I want there to be a discussion, which is why we will be screening VAXXED.\u201dWithin hours his statement, posted on Facebook, generated hundreds of comments.The plan to show the film has unnerved and angered doctors, infectious disease experts and even other filmmakers.\u201cUnless the Tribeca Film Festival plans to definitively unmask Andrew Wakefield, it will be yet another disheartening chapter where a scientific fraud continues to occupy a spotlight and overshadows the damage he has left behind in the important story of vaccine safety and success,\u201d Dr. Mary Anne Jackson, a professor of pediatrics at the University of Missouri-Kansas City, said in an email.She added that while the subject of ethics and truthfulness in a documentary can be uncomfortable, \u201cthis film is not some sort of disinterested investigation into the \u2018vaccines cause autism\u2019 hoax; this film is directed by the person who perpetuated the hoax.\u201d\u201cThe people who put on the Tribeca Film Festival are very prestigious and they draw a very thoughtful audience, and it\u2019s implicit that if they have suggested this film they think that there\u2019s some merit in it, and more importantly, merit to Wakefield\u2019s message,\u201d Dr. Schaffner said. \u201cAll of us are out talking about it reassuring parents, children, anyone who wants to pay attention to this issue that vaccines are safe and effective, and they certainly do not cause autism, and that Dr. Wakefield was a fraud and had his license removed over this very event.\u201dAccording to the festival\u2019s website, \u201cVaxxed\u201d will be screened only once, on April 24, the festival\u2019s closing day.

{"Headline": "A \u2018High Degree of Miserable\u2019 in a Refugee-Swollen Greece", "Date": "2016-03-17", "News": "More than 44,000 people are already trapped in the country, a number ticking upward each day, as aid groups warn of a potential humanitarian crisis by summer.Supported byIDOMENI, Greece \u2014 Taha al-Ahmad\u2019s family is sleeping in mud. His youngest daughter, age 1, lies beneath wet blankets, coughing inside their soggy tent. It has rained for days. Portable toilets are overflowing. Men burn firewood to stay warm. A drone circles overhead. Television trucks beam images of misery to the world.\u201cI am in a very high degree of miserable,\u201d Mr. Ahmad told me, speaking in a singsong English he learned in Syria, as our shoes sank into the muck.\u201cI ask my friends in Germany and Turkey: \u2018What is happening? Tell us,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cWe don\u2019t know what is happening outside.\u201dTo Mr. Ahmad, \u201coutside\u201d is the world of politics and policy beyond the wretchedness of the Idomeni camp. In Idomeni, refugees exist in a decrepit suspended animation. Disease spreads. Grandmothers sleep beside train tracks. Outside, specifically in Brussels, the leaders of the European Union, under public pressure to stop the migrant flow, will begin discussing the fate of refugees on Thursday, and a disputed plan to deport them to Turkey.\u201cImpossible,\u201d Mr. Ahmad said, startled at the suggestion that his family \u2014 having fled war in Syria, traversed Turkey and paid a smuggler to reach Greece by raft \u2014 could be forced to return. \u201cI can\u2019t accept this idea.\u201dFor now, Idomeni is a locked gate, where refugees wait anxiously, hoping the border will reopen. Greece, itself nearly bankrupt, is at risk of becoming a refugee prison, with more than 44,000 people already trapped in the country, a number ticking upward each day, as aid groups warn of a potential humanitarian crisis by summer.I walked into the Idomeni camp last Thursday to begin a journey across Greece and witness firsthand the new dynamic of Europe\u2019s migration crisis \u2014 refugees, desperate and exhausted, are now frozen in place in a troubled country without the means to absorb them and no ability to pass them on.Greece is now ground zero for the two greatest challenges to afflict Europe in recent years: the debt crisis and Germany\u2019s insistence on austerity as the only cure, and the backlash against the wave of human migration from war-torn and impoverished countries.Traveling along the migrant trail in reverse, from Idomeni in the north down to Athens and across the Aegean to the islands where refugees arrive from Turkey, amounted to a tour of dashed hopes: for refugees who are barred from going forward and do not want to go back, and for the Greek people, who see little chance of escaping the economic and social trauma of the past decade.Idomeni was already an emblem of the human cost of European Union policy dysfunction, and Greece is now hurriedly opening official refugee centers in military camps, a bankrupt hotel, the decaying Olympic Park in Athens \u2014 even in a castle.The question is when frustration will boil over, whether by Greeks already embittered by the economic crisis or by refugees angry at being penned in. On Monday morning, hundreds of disillusioned refugees marched out of Idomeni \u2014 some of them shouting, \u201cGoing to Germany!\u201d \u2014 and forded a river to enter Macedonia.Several hundred people made it to Moin, a Macedonian village. There, the police stopped them, and returned them to Idomeni.\u201cYou can\u2019t imagine this happening in Europe,\u201d Babar Baloch, a spokesman for the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, said days earlier while standing in Idomeni. \u201cThis is a humanitarian emergency.\u201dIs There No Hope?Before migration overwhelmed Europe last year, Idomeni was a tiny village, with 154 people in the last census, just across the border from the Flamingo Casino, whose lights beckoned Greeks for a night of gambling. Every so often, a freight train rumbled over the tracks.Unnerved Balkan countries soon began building fences and filtering refugees. By mid-November, Serbia had winnowed the approved list to Afghans, Iraqis and Syrians, and Macedonia quickly followed suit, leaving the outcasts stranded in Greece. Then on Feb. 22, Macedonian officials blocked Afghans and reduced the daily allotment of Syrians and Iraqis.Idomeni overflowed. By early March, the crowds topped 12,000 people. On the morning I met Mr. Ahmad, Macedonia had officially closed the border, but few refugees understood what was happening. Credible information was scarce.I came upon a group of Afghan families, living in a cluster of rain-soaked tents. A man named Zalmas Ghulam Haider produced an ID card from working as a translator for the United States Army. \u201cNow America go,\u201d he said. \u201cMy Army business is closed.\u201dHe said he had fled with his wife and children because the Taliban wanted to kill him as an American collaborator. He could not understand why Afghans no longer qualified as refugees. \u201cIn Afghanistan,\u201d he said, \u201ceverything bad.\u201dI peered into tents where women in black head scarves hid from the rain, often with young children. My Arabic translator was a young Iraqi refugee, Omar Sattar, who had studied English at a private school in Baghdad and wanted to reach Holland to become a dentist, or as he put it, \u201ca doctor of teeth.\u201d He had a smile any dentist would appreciate and helped break the ice with cautious Muslim women.One Syrian woman carefully spelled out her name as she sat atop a soggy blanket. She seemed dazed, her eyes dark and wide, and she suddenly refused to allow her name to be used. Omar unexpectedly grabbed my notebook and scratched it out. He understood her fear. \u201cIs there no hope for opening the border?\u201d she asked. \u201cWhat do we do now? Is there no hope?\u201dSmugglers promise to guide people over the border, but doctors say that those who have tried are often returned badly beaten by the police on the Macedonian side. Hygiene in the camp is abysmal. Cases of Hepatitis A were recently detected. Several women have delivered babies at a local hospital, only to return to the filthy camp. A photograph of a newborn being washed with bottled water ricocheted around social media, stirring outrage.\u201cEurope has the capacity to deal with this,\u201d said Dr. Tomislav Gijatiz, a physician working in Idomeni with Doctors Without Borders. \u201cTypically, camps are set up in Third World countries because there is no capacity there. These camps are purely the result of policy decisions.\u201dA Bankrupt HotelThe refugee crisis arrived in the ancient city of Thermopylae like a slowly rising flood tide. For months, refugees had been loitering in public squares, resting on the route north, as others simply walked up the national highway toward Idomeni, more than 200 miles away. Traffic whizzed past at 80 miles per hour.\u201cDo you want to see a child hit by a car?\u201d asked Kostas Bakoyiannis, 38, the tall, lanky governor of the central region of Greece.I had driven to Thermopylae on Friday with two colleagues because Mr. Bakoyiannis had reopened the Aigli Hotel, a hot springs resort, and filled it with about 250 Syrians, mostly families. The bankrupt resort is among the state assets that European creditors want Greece to sell to offset the country\u2019s crippling public debt.Mr. Bakoyiannis described the hotel shelter as \u201ccompletely a bottom up project,\u201d a jab at the central government and Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras. His uncle, the opposition leader of the Greek Parliament, was arriving soon for a political visit to make the same point.Mr. Tsipras spent the first half of last year in a losing showdown with the European Union over economic austerity. When refugees began pouring into the country, he essentially waved them through. But as Balkan countries and others began building fences and closing borders, Greece was suddenly coping with stranded refugees even as new protests were erupting over austerity.The European Union\u2019s proposed refugee deal with Turkey is a blunt attempt to create a disincentive for refugees to pay smugglers to reach Greece. The deal dictates that refugees landing in Greece would be deported back to Turkey and placed at the back of a waiting list to legally seek asylum in Europe. For every refugee deported from Greece, an eligible Syrian waiting in a Turkish refugee camp would be allowed to seek asylum in the European Union.The questions are whether it will work, and whether it is legal. As we waited in Thermopylae for the opposition leader, I stood with Mohammed Obeaida, 32, a Syrian who spoke English.\u201cWe escaped from Syria and Turkey, but we go back to Turkey? Why?\u201d he asked. \u201cWe lost our money, our homes, everything. We know the European Union is not criminals like Bashar al-Assad,\u201d the Syrian president. \u201cAnd it would be a crime to send us back to Turkey.\u201dA police cruiser roared up, lights flashing, ahead of a black BMW delivering the opposition leader, Kyriakos Mitsotakis, the president of the New Democracy party. He stepped out and slipped into a jacket as photographers quickly surrounded him. The Syrians stood quietly to the side, watching the spectacle.It lasted barely 15 minutes: Mr. Mitsotakis moved quickly through the hotel, trailed by his gaggle of photographers, then made a brief statement praising his nephew and denouncing the absence of the Greek state. \u201cThe problem becomes worse with every day that passes,\u201d Mr. Mitsotakis said. Then he hustled back into the BMW and sped away, barely acknowledging a single Syrian.Inside the hotel, men crowded around a television in the lobby as the Al Arabiya news channel flashed a map of Syria. Then an image of a young, screaming child filled the screen.Ordinary Greeks Respond\u201cWhat do you mean \u2018a system\u2019?\u201dAnetta Karathanasi was amused that I thought someone was managing the refugees pouring out of the morning ferries arriving at the port of Piraeus from the Greek isles. I had arrived early last Saturday morning as refugees disembarked from the Lesbos ferry. In the predawn darkness, hundreds of people stood in the rain, groggy and confused, as a few young Greeks handed out pink ponchos. Other refugees trudged toward Passenger Terminal No. 5 \u2014 but sleeping refugees already filled the room.Last summer, Ms. Karathanasi went on vacation on the island of Samos and was startled to find refugees sleeping outdoors. She started a Facebook page, Help Samos Refugees, and money and volunteers unexpectedly followed. She joined other Greek volunteers at Piraeus to become, more or less, the refugee greeting committee.\u201cWe were running from terminal to terminal with milk and tea,\u201d she said. Different aid organizations now deliver meals, though sometimes there are scheduling breakdowns. \u201cThen we are calling 10 mothers and 10 grandmothers,\u201d Ms. Karathanasi said.Just as many ordinary Germans rallied to help refugees in Germany last year (even as their arrival also set off a backlash), ordinary Greeks have also responded. In Idomeni, an elderly man parked his car and handed out candy, food and diapers. A pro-refugee rally in Athens brought a deluge of donations in a city where many people have lost their jobs.An occupational therapist, Ms. Karathanasi said her hardest job was persuading refugees to forget about Idomeni and instead take shelter in one of the government camps proliferating across Greece.\u201cThey think the camps are detention centers,\u201d Ms. Karathanasi said. \u201cThey get out of the camps and come back to the port.\u201dAt not yet 7 a.m., I followed Ms. Karathanasi to Passenger Terminal 3. Families were sprawled on the floor as the police took two refugees to the station. They were filing a complaint against a travel agency that had sold them bus tickets to Idomeni, even though the bus did not exist.Inside, a grandmother in a head scarf rocked a crying toddler as children played with a donated dollhouse. I stepped between people on the floor, and a man looked up. \u201cDoctor?\u201d he asked, showing me his leg, wrapped sloppily in gauze. Another man displayed his grossly swollen ankle. A young woman with red-rimmed eyes held a baby beneath a blanket.\u201cWhere is the doctor?\u201d she asked.Dazed, I sat on the floor beside a woman in a burqa as she carefully folded her children\u2019s clothes. She had fled the devastated Syrian city of Aleppo with her husband and six children. She knew the Macedonian border was closed. She did not care.\u201cI go to Germany,\u201d she said in broken English, \u201cto save my children.\u201dThey Killed My SonIt was 6:15 last Sunday morning, and volunteers had built a fire on the beach. They were on lookout along the southern coast of Lesbos Island, where only a narrow strait of the Aegean Sea separates Greece from Turkey. Lights flickered along the Turkish coast.Visible through binoculars, a gray raft was packed with refugees. But the raft was pointed down the beach, so everyone jumped into cars or vans. Later a Greek Coast Guard ship came and intercepted two other refugee rafts. But this one slipped through.We reached the spot. A volunteer rushed out in a speedboat. Swimmers in wet suits waded into the water. People on the raft began shouting, happily. A man stood and waved his arms.Then everything happened quickly: Mothers, babies, grandmothers were helped off, as well as the men. Blankets were wrapped around screaming toddlers. \u201cDoes anyone speak Kurdish?\u201d a translator yelled.Soon, everyone was on a bus headed to an official processing center. A man with blue slacks, a pressed jacket and a well-trimmed mustache could have been headed to work, except his slacks were wet. \u201cThank you! Thank you!\u201d he said into his cellphone.The man, Saydo Ashur Yousif, 36, is a math teacher. He had been talking with his brother. He fled Mosul, Iraq, with his wife and young children. I asked if he was happy to have made it to Europe. His family is Yazidi, the religious minority group whose members were raped and murdered by the Islamic State. An Islamic State fighter killed one of his children.\u201cI\u2019m not happy,\u201d he said.He plans to go to Germany. How would he get there? \u201cI have no idea,\u201d he admitted.He had traveled a long road. Now he faced the road ahead.Dimitris Bounias contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

Vivian rode with the Freedom Riders, organized sit-ins in Nashville and worked closely with the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.Many years later, before the 2008 election, he traveled the country along with other civil rights leaders exclaiming to voters that a Barack Obama presidency was exactly the kind of prize that they had been fighting for all their lives.All of that came back to him during a meeting at the White House three weeks ago between President Obama and several of those leaders. Mr. Vivian told the president how proud he was of him, and how sad he was to see him go.And then he began to cry.\u201cIf there was a way I could keep him there I would keep him there for another term,\u201d Mr. Vivian, 91, said later from his home in Atlanta. \u201cIt is difficult for people who are not African-American to understand what it has been to have someone in the White House that you know understands you.\u201dThe 2016 presidential campaign has been mesmerizing the country with its party-crashing personalities, what\u2019s-next intrigue and promise of a tantalizing November.But a large segment of the country has also been busy gazing upon the presidency that is ending. In interviews, African-Americans around the country said they were counting down the last 10 months of Mr. Obama\u2019s term with pride, with sadness and also with a looming despair.At dinner tables, Bible studies and classrooms throughout black America, elders, their children and their children\u2019s children have been asking whether the breakthrough they thought they would never see will turn out to be an anomaly that they never see repeated.\u201cI come from an area where we never thought it was going to be possible,\u201d said Russell Singleton, 64, who grew up on the South Side of Chicago and now tends a shoe shine station in the president\u2019s old barbershop. He recalled as a child seeing a racial slur stenciled onto a sidewalk in bright yellow paint, and as a teenager hurling bricks the night Dr. King was assassinated.He added, shaking his head, \u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ll see another black president in my lifetime and I\u2019ll say in the younger generation\u2019s lifetime.\u201d\u201cThey won\u2019t allow us to have the reins again,\u201d he continued. \u201cIt\u2019s a big prize and they hold onto it dearly.\u201dOn the West Side of Chicago, Jakya Hobbs, 13, said matter-of-factly that Mr. Obama\u2019s election was a \u201cmiracle,\u201d and not in a good way. \u201cOur system isn\u2019t built for a black person to become president,\u201d she said.\u201cI\u2019ll still be a citizen just like her,\u201d he added in a response that might not have pacified the girl.Ms. Jarrett said Mr. Obama \u201cis aware of the fact that it is natural for people to have this feeling of sadness.\u201d\u201cWhat he has been trying to do is to reassure people that although he won\u2019t be the president, he is still absolutely committed to moving that arc of the moral universe as a citizen.\u201dBut the feeling of loss was not just attached to Mr. Obama himself. What had given them hope, many said in interviews, was an achievement that could never be erased even as it slips into history: that a black person can become president.Mr. Vivian said that after Mr. Obama\u2019s election, a woman who had been teaching for more than two decades in Atlanta told him that her black students had started saying, for the first time, that they wanted to be president.\u201cThat was the first time that any class had been able to think about that, that they could be president of the United States,\u201d Mr. Vivian said.What\u2019s more, said Lawrence Ware, a lecturer and the diversity coordinator of the philosophy department at Oklahoma State University, is that \u201cblack families are losing a first family that is a model of a working relationship.\u201d\u201cThese are things that combat the vicious legacy of white supremacy that communicates to African-Americans that you are not beautiful, that you are not intelligent, that you cannot achieve, that your relationships are pathologically doomed for failure,\u201d Mr. Ware, 34, said. \u201cThat symbolism is absolutely powerful and needed.\u201dBut if seven years under President Obama has opened possibilities for black Americans, many of those interviewed were torn about his lasting impact on race relations.\u201cWe are losing a soldier who has actually been through the things that individuals are going through,\u201d said Jakya\u2019s father, Jevon Hobbs, 42. \u201cNone of the current candidates,\u201d he said, \u201cknow what it\u2019s like to be accosted by the police for no reason.\u201dThrough this filter, many ascribed Washington partisanship to darker motives. Republicans\u2019 repeated attempts to repeal the Affordable Care Act and refusal to entertain a Supreme Court nominee were, many of those interviewed had no doubt, a result of the president\u2019s ethnicity.\u201cThey don\u2019t want a black president,\u201d said Willie Mae Burrell, 90, who attended segregated schools as a child and once worked as a cook on the same Havana, Ala., farm where her mother picked cotton. \u201cThat\u2019s the reason he couldn\u2019t get things done.\u201d\u201cBy objective metrics, the African-American community has made progress during the president\u2019s time in office,\u201d Ms. Jarrett said. \u201cNow, is there still work left to do? Absolutely. And, the president would be the first to say that he didn\u2019t expect to be able to accomplish everything he wanted to accomplish in just eight years.\u201dMostly, though, there were questions about whether another black person could be elected president anytime soon.Asked who could be the next, a few mentioned Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey and Kamala D.

{"Headline": "The Facebook Breakup", "Date": "2016-03-12", "News": "Supported byFor Kate Sokoloff, a brand strategist in Portland, Ore., the Facebook mirror of her breakup with her boyfriend of three years was like \u201can emotional sucker punch,\u201d she said. \u201cNot 15 minutes after we broke up four years ago, and probably while he was still parked outside of my house, he changed his status to \u2018single.\u2019\u201dThis meant that all of the couple\u2019s Facebook friends, including her teenage sons, were instantly notified. \u201cThere was no hiding or time to cry on my own,\u201d said Ms. Sokoloff, now 55.She did message friends, asking them to remove any photos of herself and her former partner from their own Facebook albums, but she remembers wishing \u201cthere was a Facebook vacuum cleaner that could suck every trace of our relationship off the Internet. Photos, in particular. In fact, some just popped up yesterday.\u201dSince last November, there has been such a tool, part of a kit the social network has designed to manage and curate the digital archive that is growing with each relationship. It\u2019s like cleaning your closet, said Kelly Winters, a product manager on Facebook\u2019s designated \u201cCompassion Team,\u201d a changing squad of product managers and designers, engineers, researchers, social scientists and psychologists. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to keep anything around that doesn\u2019t spark joy,\u201d she said, echoing the mantra of Marie Kondo, the Japanese decluttering guru.Three million users have already deployed some aspect of the breakup flow, as it\u2019s called, by choosing to minimize what they see of an ex going forward, and similarly hide their own postings, settings that can easily be reversed if the future brings a change of heart or a dulling of the ache.Undoing the vacuum tool (to use Ms. Sokoloff\u2019s words for the engineering feat that harnesses what is known as distributed computing to untag hundreds or even thousands of images that no longer spark joy) is more laborious.It\u2019s not news that the social network, whose roiling environs hold over 1.5 billion people, is a complex and sometimes confounding space. Navigating its evolving rules and byways requires the nuance and skill of a Jane Austen heroine, as well as the thick skin of a politician.(As an aside, you can only pity any would-be Austens who try to chronicle this behavior poetically. Despite social media\u2019s demonstrable complexity, there\u2019s a narrative poverty to phrases like \u201cAnd then I unfollowed my lover on all platforms.\u201d)The Compassion Team is devoted to making Facebook\u2019s interactions more human, and more humane.Ms. Winters and her colleagues have developed tools to help with social resolution, bullying, online aggression (or perceived aggression), eating disorders and issues particular to high school students, working with the Greater Good Science Center at the University of California, Berkeley, the Yale Center for Emotional Intelligence and other academic partners.New projects will assist in identifying suicide ideation in a friend\u2019s posts, and offer help connecting to resources for suicide prevention. There is a team working on how Facebook profiles can be managed after someone dies; another group has created safety checks, so friends and family can communicate quickly in a disaster.One bright, hot Tuesday in February, the sun glinted off the baby-blue cruising bikes that Facebookers ride from one side of their extensive Menlo Park, Calif., campus to the other, looking like healthy undergraduates captured in a college brochure.Over 6,000 employees work there, shuttling between the New Urbanism \u201cvillage\u201d that once served as Sun Microsystems\u2019 headquarters (Facebook took it over in 2011) and the 433,000-square-foot open-plan mother ship designed by Frank Gehry on the other side of the Bayfront Expressway.Inside the Gehry space, plump Mylar balloons shaped like numbers floated gently above the desks, marking each staff member\u2019s \u201cFaceversary,\u201d as one\u2019s anniversary of hiring is called. Vending machines offered keyboards and chargers, not Snickers bars. Pink letterpress posters proclaimed \u201cBe the Nerd,\u201d among other inspirational slogans.Ms. Winters; Gregory Wells, a clinical psychologist; Dan Muriello, an engineer; and Emily Albert, a product designer, were gathered in a conference room named \u201cOutlook Not Syncing\u201d to explain how the breakup flow came to be.Conference rooms are titled thematically and idiosyncratically. While one series of rooms was inspired by the \u201cStar Wars\u201d franchise \u2014 \u201cLuke I Am Your Cousin,\u201d read one sign \u2014 others, like \u201cOlympic Fish,\u201d were more puzzling. This reporter was excited to crack the code of a series of rooms that flummoxed her guide. \u201cAscending and Descending,\u201d \u201cDrawing Hands\u201d and \u201cCube with Magic Ribbons,\u201d to name a few, would appear to pay homage to the work of M. C. Escher.Ms. Albert, an ebullient 25-year-old who had been a classically trained ballet dancer before she attended the Rhode Island School of Design, described struggling with the digital legacy of a former boyfriend from college.\u201cI was seeing one post after another,\u201d she said, \u201cexperiencing this thing that a lot of my friends have, where it\u2019s almost impossible to separate when you\u2019re constantly tied digitally. In one cathartic move toward empowerment, I thought, what if Facebook tried to tackle this?\u201dOn the company shuttle home to San Francisco one evening, she floated an idea she had been working on to minimize that entanglement. How to digitally unmesh without choosing \u201cthe nuclear option\u201d of unfriending or blocking someone? There was resounding encouragement, she said. \u201cHeartbreak is a very common ailment here.\u201dHeartache and Facebook do go hand in hand.A breakup has stages of aggressiveness, said Morgan Smith, 18, a freshman at Northwestern University.\u201cIf you block your ex on every platform, that\u2019s like 10 on the scale,\u201d she said. \u201cIf I cut my ex off on Facebook, it\u2019s also too much negative energy on my part. I want to extend a polite opening for the future. I don\u2019t want to see what you do every day with your life\u201d \u2014 as on Snapchat, for example \u2014 \u201cbut if you\u2019re accepted to the study-abroad program or become class president, I would like to congratulate you. Facebook is more of a long-term document of your life.\u201dThis meant, he said: \u201cthe vague passive-aggressive post would filter through my feed, and inject anxiety in whatever circumstance. Time is the only healer, but Facebook sure does throw it in your face sometimes. On the same note, my dog died two months ago, and Facebook wants me to share his picture once a week.\u201dFor Madeline Kaufman, 20, a journalism student at Northwestern, her Facebook breakup was like a game of digital chicken. It took her four months to \u201cbreak up\u201d with her long-term boyfriend on Facebook, though they had done so in the real world.\u201cHe kept his status \u2018in a relationship\u2019 for another two months,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was a weird \u2018letting go\u2019 concept I had to get over, and was weirdly hard for me to do. But I guess in that respect I may have \u2018won\u2019 because I took mine down first.\u201dAlisha Ardiana, 42, a dog trainer \u201cin training,\u201d as she put it, in San Francisco, is still wincing from her first foray into Facebook back in 2008, when she connected with her birth mother, along with her entire birth family, and joined the social network as a way of communicating with her new clan.The breakup that ensued was traumatizing, she said. When she had a falling out with her mother, the rest of the family unfriended her, too, which meant, Ms. Ardiana said, that she logged on one day and \u201cI had no friends at all. We had been in this virtual room together, and they all left.\u201dYears later, having overseen her birth father\u2019s illness and death on the social network, she said, \u201cI feel strongly that Facebook is an amazing tool, but it holds such a concentrated amount of emotions and not always on our terms.\u201dMichael Rich, director of the Center on Media and Child Health at Boston Children\u2019s Hospital and an associate professor of pediatrics at Harvard Medical School, has been studying the effects of social media on young adults since the birth of the technologies that have enabled the networks.\u201cWe see someone who would never think of stalking their ex-partner in real life doing it quite easily online,\u201d Dr. Rich said. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing a lot of behaviors that have existed since the dawn of time\u201d \u2014 jealousy, in other words \u2014 \u201cplaying out very differently on social media.\u201d Some behaviors are being amplified, but others may be muted.A few years ago, Dr. Rich\u2019s group, along with Boston\u2019s Public Health Commission, organized a seminar for teenagers that spurred the slogan \u201cFace it, Don\u2019t Facebook It.\u201dDr. Rich said: \u201cIt was about honoring the quality of the relationship when it was good by facing your partner and saying, \u2018It\u2019s not working.\u2019 \u2018Face it, Don\u2019t Facebook It\u2019 was about having some emotional skin in the game instead of just changing your status online. I\u2019m concerned that all these tools with the best of intentions will create a socially more-acceptable way of not facing things. These tools are morphing and evolving so rapidly that we have to keep re-educating ourselves as the tools change.\u201dIn a Facebook tradition for birthing new products, Ms. Albert refined her breakup idea at a 24-hour hackathon \u2014 like a sleepover for geeks, as she put it \u2014 then road-tested it among many survey respondents, had it massaged and amplified by more engineers and researchers, and finally presented it to Mark Zuckerberg in April 2015, in a two-minute pitch in his glass-walled conference room. (A guide pointed out the room and gestured vaguely to a clutch of identical workstations nearby. Which one was Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s? \u201cI can\u2019t tell you that,\u201d the guide said.)\u201cI\u2019ve had my fair share of trials to overcome,\u201d Ms. Albert said later. \u201cI was diagnosed with anorexia as a teenager. Working on the eating disorders project, I was able to act as half designer and half advocate. It\u2019s incredibly healing to bring goodness out of things that have caused you pain.\u201dFinding the right tone was a big part of the design process, Ms. Albert said, language being crucial in creating a tool kit that would be flexible enough to address a 14-year-old breaking up with her boyfriend of four weeks as well as longtime married couples with children.It also had to be neutral, not familiar, and not in any way hortatory. \u201cIf designers are in charge of surprise and delight,\u201d she said, \u201cwhat does it mean to design for aspects of life that are painful?\u201dFacebook language isn\u2019t lyric poetry, by any means, but it does the trick. If you\u2019re able to stumble onto the breakup flow (not an easy task, at this point; it\u2019s only available on mobile and only in the United States), you should discover, as Ms. Winters described, a bento box of options.\u201cTake a Break. Here are some changes that might be helpful. We won\u2019t notify Taylor of any changes you make. See less of Taylor. See Taylor on Facebook only if you visit his profile.\u201d And so on. Mostly the language is like that of an instruction manual \u2014 \u201cTurn on tag approvals for posts and photos you\u2019re tagged in\u201d \u2014 though at the end, it veers into self-care: \u201cReach out to people you trust for support. Stay Active. \u2026\u201dThere were some ideas that were, as Ms. Albert said, \u201cout of scope to build, the idea of locking yourself out, temporarily, from one person\u2019s account, trying to prevent that stalking behavior.\u201d Technologically, she said, it was a bridge too far, and it led to a bigger conversation about what role Facebook wants to play in people\u2019s lives. \u201cIt would be like Starbucks not accepting your credit card,\u201d she said.And just maybe such stalking is productive for some, a step toward resilience that would never accrue from watching baby sloth videos or mash-ups of Donald Trump tweets.Ms. Sokoloff, the brand strategist who yearned for a digital vacuum cleaner, wondered if there wasn\u2019t some emotional cost in making all traces of a relationship disappear. \u201cIs there something important in the healing process that would be lost if we can essentially have the Facebook equivalent of the dream removers from \u2018Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind\u2019?\u201dIn her latest book, \u201cReclaiming Conversation: The Power of Talk in a Digital Age,\u201d Sherry Turkle explores, as she puts it, \u201chow technology makes us forget what we know about life.\u201dDr. Turkle, director of the MIT Initiative on Technology and Self, and a longtime observer of how people interact with their machines, recalled a presentation in the \u201cearly days of the Internet of Things,\u201d she said, \u201cfor how we might use this new way of animating our worlds.\u201dIt was a phone app that would present you with a path to, say, Starbucks, that was designed to bypass former lovers who may be in the way, or indeed anyone you had tagged as someone to avoid. In this way, Dr. Turkle said, you could enjoy a friction-free walk to pick up your mocha frappuccino.The notion of \u201cfriction-free\u201d still disturbs her. \u201cMaybe you\u2019re not supposed to move on for a year,\u201d she said, while noting the boons of Facebook\u2019s breakup tools. \u201cI was thinking about people compulsively reading old love letters and diaries, poring over old wedding albums and photos, and then writing poetry, short stories, novels.\u201d Making art, in other words, after marinating in the stew of the past.\u201cIt\u2019s not to say that Facebook shouldn\u2019t make it easy to click that button to avoid certain painful memories,\u201d she said. \u201cBut the reason we\u2019re looking through those old love letters is we\u2019re trying to work through our past. I think we just have to acknowledge the humanness of that process and be compassionate with ourselves. Life is supposed to be complicated.\u201dA few weeks ago, Ms. Albert was on vacation in Barcelona with her boyfriend. In the last days of the trip, he surprised her with a private tour of the Gothic Quarter. When they arrived at the Barcelona Cathedral, he proposed, an event captured on film, as he had planned, by the two photographers who were running the tour.Nonetheless, the couple waited 24 hours before they changed their relationship status on Facebook.Advertisement"}

Trump to his state in a phone interview on his program on Monday, explaining that \u201chere in Wisconsin we value things like civility, decency and actual conservative principles.\u201dThe spat began after an anti-Trump \u201csuper PAC\u201d produced an ad geared at Utah voters featuring an image of Mrs. Trump, then Melania Knauss, posing nude from a January 2000 GQ magazine pictorial.On Mr. Sykes\u2019s program, Mr. Trump defended the photo of his wife \u00e2\u0080\u0094 calling it \u201can artsy picture\u201d \u00e2\u0080\u0094 but blamed Mr. Cruz for starting the feud, even though the super PAC that produced the Texas ad is not connected to the Texas senator.\u201cI expect that from a 12-year-old bully on the playground, not somebody who wants the office held by Abraham Lincoln,\u201d Mr. Sykes said.

But I certainly would like to see a debate in New York State.\u00e2\u0080\u009dA Clinton campaign spokesman declined to comment about the debate proposal on Sunday.Jeff Weaver, Mr. Sanders\u00e2\u0080\u0099s campaign manager, sent a letter on Sunday to his counterpart in the Clinton campaign, Robby Mook, asserting that the two teams had agreed to have a debate in California in May but had not yet come to terms on an April showdown. Mr. Weaver argued for New York as the location, noting that it had the most delegates at stake in April, and then adopted a taunting tone, suggesting that Mrs. Clinton was afraid to debate Mr. Sanders.\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt is difficult to understand your motivation,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Weaver wrote. \u00e2\u0080\u009cCan you please explain why New York should not host the April debate? Is the Secretary concerned about debating before the people who twice elected her to the U.S. Senate? Perhaps there is some tactical advantage you are seeking by avoiding a debate in New York but I would remind you that Senator Sanders agreed to debate the secretary in New Hampshire when he was well ahead.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Sanders ended up winning the New Hampshire primary in a rout; Mrs. Clinton had double-digit leads over Mr. Sanders in some recent New York polls.Advisers to Mrs. Clinton have said recently that they are waiting for the Democratic National Committee to weigh in on the April and May debates.

Kennedy killed and that the United Nations had hatched a plot to depopulate the world.Mr. Clark, 75, was unaware that the candidate he had supported \u2014 Mary Lou Bruner, 68, a former kindergarten teacher running for a seat on the State Board of Education \u2014 held such views. But as he sat with his wife eating lunch in this East Texas city, Mr. Clark was ready to give Ms. Bruner the benefit of the doubt.\u201cI would not discount her on the basis of having those beliefs,\u201d said Mr. Clark, a retired pilot. \u201cIt convinces me, though, that she\u2019s quite conservative, and if I were going to err either way, I would want to err toward the side of the conservative.\u201dMs. Bruner was a relative political newcomer when she started her campaign to represent a 31-county section of northern East Texas on the 15-member board that sets curriculum standards, reviews and adopts textbooks, and establishes graduation requirements in Texas public schools. Because of the board\u2019s clout in selecting textbooks for all of the state\u2019s schools, it can influence the content of textbooks produced nationwide.\u201cAt the end of the day, is Mary Lou a wacko extremist? No,\u201d Ms. Blair said. \u201cShe\u2019s a nice older lady who doesn\u2019t understand social media and the impact that it can have. I\u2019m still going to vote for Mary Lou, and I\u2019m going to encourage people to do the same.\u201dMs. Bruner was the top vote-getter in the Republican primary, winning 48 percent of the 220,000 ballots cast, and now faces Keven M. Ellis, 44, a chiropractor who is the president of the school board in Lufkin, Tex., in a Republican runoff on May 24.On her Facebook page, Ms. Bruner called Mr. Obama \u201cAhab the Arab,\u201d and wrote that he \u201chates all white people and all wealthy people because to him wealthy means white.\u201d Although she condemned the Ku Klux Klan in one posting, she wrote positively of its roots, writing that it started \u201cas citizens trying to fight back against a corrupt government when there were corrupt officials or no officials at all to keep law and order in the rural areas.\u201d Of Mr. Obama\u2019s youth, she wrote: \u201cI heard from a reliable source that Obama was also a male prostitute for a while when he lived in New York with his male \u2018partner.\u2019 How do you think he paid for his drugs?\u201dMs. Bruner declined a request for an interview. \u201cThe newspapers are not interested in doing anything nice to me, and so I\u2019m not interested in giving them ammunition that they can twist and use against me,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t know why I\u2019m getting so much attention. I\u2019m just saying what I believe and what the people of my district agree with.\u201dMr. Ellis, her opponent, disputes Ms. Bruner\u2019s claim that the district shares her views. \u201cThat hate-filled speech that she has is not conservative, it\u2019s not Christian,\u201d he said.Yet some Republicans have rallied around her, arguing that her social media postings do not disqualify her from sitting on the State Board of Education. \u201cI believe, like Benjamin Franklin said, stand on principle even if you stand alone,\u201d said John E.

{"Headline": "Lose With Cruz: A Love Story", "Date": "2016-03-25", "News": "Supported byBut I never expected a love quite like this to bloom.It\u2019s a singularly tortured love, one that grits its teeth, girds its loins and pines for a contested convention.It\u2019s hate worn down into resignation, disgust repurposed as calculation. Stopping a ludicrous billionaire means submitting to a loathsome senator. And so they submit, one chastened and aghast Republican leader after another, murmuring sweet nothings about Cruz that are really sour somethings about Donald Trump.Will they still respect themselves in the morning?I\u2019m not sure we\u2019ve ever witnessed a capitulation this grudging, a cynicism this grotesque, a reversal of regard this fraudulent and flat-out hilarious. While politics is an impure arena in which yesterday\u2019s enemies routinely become tomorrow\u2019s allies, the transmogrification of Cruz goes beyond that, proving that in the right circumstances, with the right motivation, you can see just about anyone in a newly flattering light.Attila the Hun? True, he was truculent, but what a can-do spirit! Torquemada? A tad rigid, yes, but that\u2019s what righteousness sometimes looks like.Cruz has gone from the insufferable nemesis of Republican traditionalists to their last, best hope, and the likes of Mitt Romney, Lindsey Graham and Jeb Bush have now given him endorsements \u2014 or approximations thereof \u2014 that will go down in political history as some of the most constipated hosannas ever rendered.They hardly mention Cruz\u2019s name. They barely manage to assign him a single virtue.\u201cConsistent,\u201d Jeb Bush called him \u2014 in a Facebook post. He apparently couldn\u2019t rouse or debase himself to a proper news conference.He was following the lead of his younger brother Neil, who had signed up with Cruz a few weeks earlier and explained, \u201cI commit this from my head, not my heart.\u201d There\u2019s a sentence you won\u2019t find on a Valentine\u2019s Day card.\u201cI\u2019m on the Ted train, absolutely,\u201d he told Trevor Noah, but when Noah pressed him about the charms of that particular mode of transportation, he confessed that he would have preferred another \u2014 possibly an Edsel, maybe even a tricycle with a wobbly front wheel. \u201cHe was my 15th choice. What can I say?\u201dNot much that\u2019s laudatory, apparently. Cruz is the love that chokes on its own words.It\u2019s a surprise-every-second love. On Friday, Cruz made public reference to \u2014 and furiously denied \u2014 a National Enquirer story that accused him of affairs.It\u2019s also a love that makes no promises of its endurance. In fact, many of the Republicans in a faux swoon for the far-right loon don\u2019t really want to see him fly all the way to the White House \u2014 or, for that matter, to the nomination.Few of the Cruz converts actually think he can amass a majority of delegates and win the nomination before the convention. For that to happen, their endorsements of Cruz would have to scare off John Kasich and turn the contest into a two-man race, and Kasich doesn\u2019t seem to be scaring.The real goal is to buck up Cruz to a point where he prevents Trump from getting that majority and either passes him in the delegate count or draws close. Abracadabra: a contested convention.Some of the new Cruz devotees indeed hope that he would be the beneficiary of that and the ultimate victor. They expect Cruz to lose the presidency. But then they also expect Trump to lose it \u2014 and to lose it in an uglier, more divisive fashion that drags down Republicans running for the House and Senate too. This lose-with-Cruz faction figures that a reset of the party after a Cruz defeat would be possible, whereas Trump might not leave them with much of party to reset.Both Ryan and Romney have stepped forward with high-minded soliloquies about the G.O.P.\u2019s values and future, and while that may well be a reflection of conscience, mightn\u2019t it also be a fig leaf over ambition?Poor Kasich. He governs the crucial battleground of Ohio, has high approval ratings there, has made a stand for decency in an indecent age, and is out there on the campaign trail wrapping his arms around every last American who will stand still long enough to let him. Even so he\u2019s spurned.That\u2019s the way Republican leaders fall for Cruz \u2014 with apologies, asterisks, angst. The terms of endearment are teary ones, because this isn\u2019t the relationship they wanted. It\u2019s the only relationship that\u2019s left. He gets their love because someone must.

He was 76.The cause was cancer, his son Mark said.Long before Facebook or Twitter, Mr. Kimsey was a co-founder of AOL, connecting a nascent online audience with news and information as never before. Through its online chat rooms and email service, the company influenced a generation of Internet providers and left an imprint on popular American culture, the sound of a buzzing modem and its trademark \u201cYou\u2019ve got mail!\u201d entering the national lexicon. (It was the title of a 1998 Nora Ephron film with Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan.)Indeed, one of his best known acts at AOL was handing power to someone else. Mr. Kimsey, a sort of elder statesman for the company, groomed another co-founder, Steve Case, at the time a young Internet marketing expert, to take over.Mr. Case oversaw AOL\u2019s expansion into a media conglomerate with a $220 billion market capitalization.\u201cI think one of the best things I ever did was let Steve run the company,\u201d Mr. Kimsey told The Washington Post in 1995. \u201cToday that one decision to get out of the way makes me look like a genius.\u201dIn a statement on Tuesday, Mr. Case credited Mr. Kimsey with helping to make \u201cthe Internet part of everyday life.\u201dAOL, the one-time king of media, is a shadow of its former self. Its deal for Time Warner is regarded as the high-water mark of the dot-com bubble.James Verlin Kimsey was born on Sept. 15, 1939, in Washington, D.C. He briefly attended Georgetown University before transferring to West Point, from which he graduated in 1962.His military career involved three combat tours in the 1960s, first in the Dominican Republic and then in Vietnam.After the war, Mr. Kimsey returned to the Washington area, where he raised his family.Mr. Kimsey is survived by three sons, Michael, Mark and Raymond; six grandchildren; a sister, Eleanor; and a brother, Thomas. His marriage to the former Bronwen Krummeck ended in divorce.In business, Mr. Kimsey had success as a local restaurateur. And in the 1980s, at the recommendation of a friend from West Point, he joined Control Video, a start-up online video game company.When that venture failed, Mr. Kimsey helped reorganize it into Quantum Computer Services, which later became America Online. He oversaw the company during its 1992 public stock offering.Mr. Kimsey stepped down as chairman in 1995, five years before Mr. Case helped engineer a $165 billion merger with Time Warner. Since then, AOL has receded to a shadow of its former self, a victim of the dot-com boom and bust it helped create.Mr. Kimsey also indulged a passion for music, recording a country music album in 2012 after seeing the film \u201cCrazy Heart.\u201d The album, which he recorded under the pseudonym Verlin Jack, was titled \u201cMy First Rodeo.\u201dAdvertisement"}

The deal would give the Chinese insurance company ownership of the Four Seasons hotels and resorts in Silicon Valley, Washington and Jackson Hole, Wyo., as well as the JW Marriott Essex House Hotel near Central Park in Manhattan.

Treasury Secretary Jacob J. Lew has also said that he intended to tighten the rules. Whether Pfizer would have more flexibility in using its overseas cash after the merger is an important question for the markets, but the answer is still unclear. Treasury, which is expected to issue new rules in the next few weeks, says that legislation would be required to stop inversions entirely, although the passage of several pending bills is unlikely this year.

{"Headline": "Apple Wins Ruling in New York iPhone Hacking Order", "Date": "2016-02-29", "News": "Supported byA federal magistrate judge on Monday denied the United States government\u2019s request that Apple extract data from an iPhone in a drug case in New York, giving the company\u2019s pro-privacy stance a boost as it battles law enforcement officials over opening up the device in other cases.The ruling, from Judge James Orenstein in New York\u2019s Eastern District, is the first time that the government\u2019s legal argument for opening up devices like the iPhone has been put to the test. The denial could influence other cases where law enforcement officials are trying to compel Apple to help unlock iPhones, including the standoff between Apple and the F.B.I. over the iPhone used by one of the attackers in a mass shooting in San Bernardino, Calif., last year.The government\u2019s view of the All Writs Act is so expansive as to cast doubt on its constitutionality if adopted, Judge Orenstein wrote.\u201cIt\u2019s important that a judge for the first time recognizes the All Writs Act doesn\u2019t provide the lawful authority the government has been claiming in these cases,\u201d said Esha Bhandari, a lawyer with the A.C.L.U., which supports Apple\u2019s position. \u201cIt demonstrates that when the government\u2019s arguments are put to the test, a federal court has decided they were not actually right.\u201dIn a statement on Monday in response to Judge Orenstein\u2019s ruling, the Justice Department said it would ask the judge to review the decision. Apple had previously agreed to help open up the iPhone in the drug case, and has complied with past All Writs Act orders, the Justice Department said.\u201cThis phone may contain evidence that will assist us in an active criminal investigation, and we will continue to use the judicial system in our attempt to obtain it,\u201d the Justice Department said.A federal judge has denied the United States government\u2019s request to open up an Apple iPhone in a drug case in New York.An Apple senior executive said Monday\u2019s ruling makes clear that helping to open an iPhone is a constitutional issue that should be taken up by Congress.Judge Orenstein\u2019s ruling stands out because the courts have largely been absent on the major questions of electronic surveillance and privacy of our day. While judges around the country have signed at least 70 orders at the request of the government compelling Apple to access data on phones, this was the first time that a judge and Apple have pushed back.The legal back and forth between Judge Orenstein, the Justice Department and Apple began last October, when federal prosecutors applied for a court order to force Apple to unlock an iPhone 5s seized by the Drug Enforcement Administration in a 2014 drug case, according to court documents.After federal prosecutors requested the order, Judge Orenstein argued in an 11-page memo last October that prosecutors were misusing the All Writs Act. The judge asked Apple to weigh in, and the company filed a brief that same month. In addition to agreeing with the judge, the company also said the request could create an undue burden and threatened to \u201csubstantially tarnish the Apple brand.\u201d\u201cThis reputational harm could have a longer-term economic impact beyond the mere cost of performing the single extraction at issue,\u201d Apple said in a brief.The government then called Apple\u2019s decision to side with the judge a \u201cstunning reversal.\u201d Saritha Komatireddy, a Brooklyn federal prosecutor, said the government\u2019s application in this case \u201cwas just a simple routine request for assistance in carrying out a valid search warrant issued by a federal court, as Apple has done so many times before.\u201dDuring the case, Judge Orenstein said he found it puzzling that Apple had not previously resisted the use of the All Writs Act, including in other cases where Apple had complied with the order.\u201cYou have had apparently 70 prior instances where you have not taken the steps available to you,\u201d Judge Orenstein said to Apple\u2019s lawyers during a hearing.Ultimately, Judge Orenstein argued that the government couldn\u2019t use the All Writs Act to ask Apple to help extract information from a device just because a different law, the Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act, or Calea, addresses the issue and does not include an \u201cinformation services\u201d company like Apple. Congress has been debating whether to amend Calea to include tech companies such as Apple, Facebook and Alphabet\u2019s Google.Still, the decision is not binding for the San Bernardino case, said Eric A. Berg, a litigation lawyer and special counsel with Foley & Lardner, who is a former Justice Department lawyer.\u201cFrom a technical, legal standpoint, it doesn\u2019t really have much of an effect in the California districts,\u201d Mr. Berg said. But \u201cif you start with public opinion, this is going to be viewed as a victory for the privacy lobby and a defeat for the government in that battle over privacy.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "F.C.C. Proposes Privacy Rules for Internet Providers", "Date": "2016-03-10", "News": "Supported byIn the proposal, before the Federal Communications Commission, the agency\u2019s chairman, Tom Wheeler, called for broadband service providers to disclose clearly how data may be collected about users\u2019 online browsing and other activities. The plan also called for the companies to bolster the security of customer data.In a statement, Mr. Wheeler said that since Internet service providers handle all network traffic, the companies have a \u201cbroad view of all of your unencrypted online activity.\u201d He added that \u201ceven when data is encrypted, your broadband provider can piece together significant amounts of information about you \u2014 including private information such as a chronic medical condition or financial problems \u2014 based on your online activity.\u201dThe proposed regulations would put broadband providers under stronger privacy oversight than Internet companies like Google and Facebook. Those companies are monitored by the Federal Trade Commission, whose ability to create specific privacy rules is limited.Many privacy advocates have pushed for a greater role by other agencies because the F.T.C. cannot create rules for online privacy and can only monitor data collection practices as an enforcement agency.\u201cThis is nothing short of a historic moment,\u201d Jeffrey Chester, executive director of the Center for Digital Democracy, a privacy advocacy group, said of the proposed new rules. \u201cUnlike the Federal Trade Commission, the F.C.C. has the legal authority to enact safeguards that will allow an individual to have real control over how their information can be gathered and used.\u201dSome privacy experts said an Internet service provider was capable of stitching together a more complete picture of a consumer by tracking the sites the consumer visits using its network. Because more devices in the home are now being connected to Wi-Fi, the broadband providers also have more ways to collect data on their customers for online advertising, said Harold Feld, a senior vice president of the nonprofit media advocacy group Public Knowledge.Under the proposal, broadband service providers could still collect and share data with other communications-related affiliates without permission. That would allow Verizon\u2019s broadband business, called Fios, for example, to give personal information about a user to its wireless service to market mobile data plans.But the Internet service providers would not be able to share data with noncommunications partners without permission. This would prohibit a broadband service like Google Fiber from blending consumer information with search, maps and email habits of a consumer, the F.C.C. said. Verizon also would not be able to share customer data with AOL, a media site it owns, without permission.The F.C.C.\u2019s proposal drew protest from telecom and cable companies, which have pointed to the F.T.C. as a strong privacy enforcer. The F.C.C. has argued that after it reclassified broadband as a utility, it was compelled by law to create privacy rules.In a recent blog post, AT&T said Internet service providers were collecting less data as more sites became encrypted. Also, consumers are choosing virtual private networks that prevent broadband providers from seeing the sites people visit, the company said. Websites like Google are leading behavioral advertising companies that should be held to the same standards as broadband access providers, AT&T said.The F.C.C. will vote on the proposal on March 31 and then will begin to take public comments, in what will be a monthslong process before final rules are considered.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "2 Italian Hostages of ISIS in Libya Are Freed, but 2 Others Are Feared Dead", "Date": "2016-03-04", "News": "Supported byCAIRO \u2014 Two Italian hostages have been freed from Islamic State captivity in Libya, but two others, who had been captured at the same time, have most likely been killed, Italian officials said on Friday.But their joy was tempered by accounts that the bodies of their fellow captives had been discovered at the site of a gunfight between Islamic State fighters and a local militia in Sabratha on Wednesday.Although not officially confirmed through DNA tests, Italian officials said privately that they had identified the bodies as those of Fausto Piani and Salvatore Failla, the other two hostages.The mayor of Sabratha told Italian news agencies that the two were among 12 bodies retrieved from the scene of the battle at a house outside the town. The hostages could have died in crossfire or been killed by their captors, he said.The mixed fortunes of the four hostages highlighted both the danger faced by foreigners working in Libya\u2019s diminished energy sector and the volatility of the situation in Sabratha, which has become a prominent focus of Western and Libyan efforts to stop the Islamic State\u2019s aggressive expansion across the country.There have been repeated clashes in the town since American warplanes bombed an Islamic State training camp there last month, killing at least 43 people, including, most likely, a senior commander linked to two major assaults on foreign tourists in Tunisia last year.That attack also killed two Serbian hostages, drawing an angry rebuke from Belgrade, which said it had been negotiating their release. The dead hostages, who worked at the Serbian Embassy in Tripoli, had been abducted from a convoy as they passed through Sabratha in November.Although Sabratha is far from the Islamic State\u2019s main stronghold around Surt, about 270 miles along the coast to the southeast, the extremists have tried to assert their authority there in recent weeks by clashing violently with other militia groups and, at one point, beheading rival fighters and blocking a road with their decapitated bodies.Kidnapping for ransom has become a major problem in Libya as the country has splintered into chaos since the ouster of its longtime dictator, Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi, in 2011.Italian officials tried to negotiate the release of the four oil and gas workers after they were abducted last summer near the Mellitah plant, which is operated by the Italian energy giant Eni, about 10 miles from Sabratha.A report in the Italian newspaper Corriere della Sera said the four men had been betrayed by their driver, who they said came from a family of Islamic State sympathizers.In a video taken after their release, Mr. Calcagno and Mr. Pollicardo were shown smiling and with unkempt beards. They said that they were safe at a police station, and that they were being treated well.\u201cWe hope to urgently return to Italy, because we need to see our families,\u201d said Mr. Pollicardo, who added in a separate Facebook post that they were \u201cphysically quite well but psychologically devastated.\u201dDeclan Walsh reported from Cairo, and Gaia Pianigiani from Rome.Advertisement"}

Establishment", "Date": "2016-03-14", "News": "Supported byLess than three years after colleagues accused him of misleading his own supporters about the efficacy of a government shutdown, Mr. Cruz recently scolded Donald J. Trump for \u201ctaking advantage\u201d of \u201clow-information\u201d voters.And while some of his allies took delight in Mr. Cruz\u2019s lack of endorsements from fellow senators, arguing that this solidified his standing as a Washington outsider, he has begun openly courting establishment figures with a practical pitch: I am your last, best hope.\u201cCome on in,\u201d Mr. Cruz told a crowd of thousands on Sunday in North Carolina, inviting supporters of other candidates to join him. \u201cThe water\u2019s fine.\u201dSome Republicans despairing over Mr. Trump\u2019s rise have already lurched over to Mr. Cruz. He picked up his first Senate endorsement, from Mike Lee of Utah, last week. National Review, the stalwart conservative magazine, announced its support on Friday. Even Neil Bush, the brother of George W. and Jeb, has come on board.What remains unclear is the extent to which Mr. Cruz intends to meet anxious Republicans halfway, a choice testing his political dexterity as never before. He has sounded big-tent notes, invoking a bipartisan lineup of presidents \u2014 Ronald Reagan, Franklin D. Roosevelt, John F. Kennedy \u2014 in election-night speeches. He has said that he could \u201csee a place\u201d for opponents like Mr. Rubio and Mr. Kasich in a Cruz administration.He has reached out to Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, a longtime foe, and met with Jeb Bush before last week\u2019s Republican debate in Florida.At times, the effort to play party unifier has been bumpy. In an interview last week with the Christian Broadcasting Network, Mr. Cruz recalled Mr. Trump\u2019s recent quote, \u201cI love the poorly educated.\u201d\u201cListen, part of it is, I think, Donald is taking advantage of his voters,\u201d Mr. Cruz said.The remark drew a furious response in some conservative circles. \u201cGOP Majority Voters in Primary are Wayyyyyy Beneath Cruz, So Says Cruz,\u201d Sarah Palin, the former Alaska governor who is supporting Mr. Trump, wrote on Facebook.Perhaps no issue better illustrates Mr. Cruz\u2019s bind than his reactions to the violence at Trump rallies in recent days.The next day, Mr. Cruz recalibrated, focusing most of the blame on protesters and criticizing the Bernie Sanders campaign and the Black Lives Matter movement.Asked what Mr. Trump would have to do to lose his support, Mr. Cruz said Saturday, \u201cI don\u2019t really want to set a challenge for Donald to try and do something even more outrageous.\u201dBy Monday morning, Mr. Cruz had settled on at least one deal-breaker: \u201cIf, for example, he were to go out on Fifth Avenue and shoot somebody,\u201d he told reporters in Illinois, \u201cI would not be willing to support Donald Trump.\u201dIn January, Mr. Trump had surmised that he could do just that without paying an electoral price.Such utterances by Mr. Trump have helped drive even past skeptics into Mr. Cruz\u2019s corner.According to the Associated Press, Donald J. Trump and Hillary Clinton have each won enough delegates to claim their party\u2019s nomination for president.C. Boyden Gray, who worked in the White House under Reagan and the elder President George Bush, repeated Mr. Cruz\u2019s well-worn attacks against \u201cthe Washington cartel\u201d without prompting in an interview on Monday.\u201cI know he\u2019s lost a lot of friends, or not made a lot of friends that he could have, in the so-called establishment,\u201d said Mr. Gray, who also served as ambassador to the European Union under George W. Bush. \u201cBut he was running against Washington.\u201dNo one outside Trump Tower has more effectively harnessed anti-Washington fervor. Mr. Cruz is so firmly committed to that theme that he cheered his own last-place finish in the District of Columbia on Saturday.\u201cI\u2019ve got to tell you, that result didn\u2019t surprise me at all,\u201d he told supporters with a grin.Still, among many of those who have worked with him, feelings remain raw. Josh Holmes, the former chief of staff to Mitch McConnell, the Senate majority leader, said it was \u201ca real open question as to whether people ultimately determine that Ted Cruz is any better for the Republican Party than Donald Trump.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s really an astonishing statement about the impression he\u2019s left,\u201d Mr. Holmes said, \u201cbut it\u2019s undeniably true given his inability to consolidate thus far.\u201dYet if Mr. Cruz has made no apologies for his Senate tenure, he has also played down some elements of it on the trail \u2014 rarely speaking, for instance, about the 2013 government shutdown.Alice Stewart, a spokeswoman for Mr. Cruz, said he had no plans to adjust his message but acknowledged that the campaign had entered a \u201cdifferent phase,\u201d requiring Mr. Cruz to speak to voters who did not initially view him as their first choice.\u201cThat\u2019s not a pitch you\u2019d make a month ago or two, three, four months ago,\u201d she said.In a primary season dominated by Mr. Trump, some voters may not require much cajoling, and Cruz allies predict more public defections this week if Mr. Rubio exits the race.Austin Barbour, a Republican strategist in Mississippi who had previously backed Rick Perry and Jeb Bush, said he voted for Mr. Cruz in his state\u2019s primary last week for a simple reason.\u201cI know he\u2019s a Republican, and I know he\u2019s a conservative,\u201d Mr. Barbour said. \u201cI can\u2019t say that about Donald Trump.\u201dJonathan Martin contributed reporting from Vienna, Ohio.Advertisement"}

Scott Walker of Wisconsin, a Republican who has waged public feuds with progressive groups over several issues, including voter identification laws, union organizing, reproductive rights and cuts to educational programs.The senator began the day in Kenosha, Wis., speaking to a crowd of 2,750 at Carthage College. There and in later events, he took aim at Mrs. Clinton for her stances on trade policies like the North American Free Trade Agreement and cast himself as the best person to protect American workers from companies who would rather employ lower-paid workers abroad.\u00e2\u0080\u009cOver the last 30, 40 years, we have had trade policies in this country written by corporate America, and what they have been designed to do is to allow companies to shut down plants in Vermont, in Wisconsin and all over this country because they don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want to pay workers here $15, $20, $25 an hour,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Sanders said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThey don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want to pay them a living wage.

They\u00e2\u0080\u0099d rather move to Mexico or China, pay people pennies an hour.\u00e2\u0080\u009dHe went on to connect Mrs. Clinton to those companies, using a line of attack that worked well in Michigan, where he pulled off a surprising victory this month. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe are talking, over a period of years, of the loss of tens of thousands of good-paying jobs here in Wisconsin, millions of jobs throughout this country,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cOn all of these trade policies, Nafta, permanent normal trade relations with China, I not only voted against them, I help lead the opposition against them. On the other hand, over the years, Secretary Clinton has supported virtually all of these disastrous trade agreements.\u00e2\u0080\u009dMr. Sanders listed several companies in Wisconsin that he said had been affected by trade deals. He said Chrysler received billions of dollars in a bailout in 2009 but then shut down its Kenosha Engine Plant and cut 800 jobs, moving the operation to Saltillo, Mexico. He also pointed to the 2008 closing of the General Motors manufacturing plant in Janesville, which he said meant the city lost more than 2,800 jobs because the company moved the plant to Silao, Mexico.In an effort to further appeal to voters, Mr. Sanders also assailed Mr. Walker for making changes to the state\u00e2\u0080\u0099s voter identification laws and urged his supporters to set a new voter turnout record for Wisconsin.\u00e2\u0080\u009cWe will win if the voter turnout is high.

{"Headline": "As a Data Deluge Grows, Companies Rethink Storage", "Date": "2016-03-14", "News": "Supported byMOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif. \u2014 John Hayes, cleareyed and wild-haired, stood before his silent creation. Big as a slim refrigerator, it held 16 petabytes of data, roughly equal to 16 billion thick books.\u201cPeople are going to have to think about things to put into this,\u201d he said, surrounded by the clutter of his office at a Silicon Valley company called Pure Storage. \u201cBut that won\u2019t take long \u2014 there\u2019s a demand for data that nobody was ready for.\u201dEach month, the world\u2019s one billion cellphones throw out 18 exabytes of data, equal to 1,100 of Mr. Hayes\u2019s boxes. There are also millions of sensors in things ranging from cars and appliances to personal fitness trackers and cameras.IBM estimates that by 2020 we will have 44 zettabytes \u2014 the thousandfold number next up from exabytes \u2014 generated by all those devices. It is so much information that Big Blue is staking its future on so-called machine learning and artificial intelligence, two kinds of pattern-finding software built to cope with all that information.Making storage products has long been a major part of the tech industry. It has also been one of the dullest, with little in the way of innovation. Now the surge in data is leading both start-ups and some of tech\u2019s biggest companies to rethink how they approach the problem.Pure, co-founded by Mr. Hayes, a 38-year-old former video karaoke engineer, is one of several companies trying new approaches.Mr. Hayes\u2019s box, which was unveiled on Monday, holds five times as much data as a conventional storage device, thanks to a combination of so-called flash storage technology and clever engineering. Sometime in 2017, he said, it will hold twice that much, as Pure tweaks the product. Power consumption, the company says, is 4 percent of the current standard.While traditional storage works much like a record player, with data stored on and fetched from spinning disks, flash storage gets data directly on and off a semiconductor. Flash storage has become common in consumer tech products like smartphones.The new Pure system is also built in blades, which act like building blocks. Add a blade, and the overall system reconfigures to raise efficiency. There is space on the device for additional processing, so a blade could easily be added.\u201cIt\u2019s not just about Google and Facebook,\u201d said Joe Unsworth, an analyst with Gartner. \u201cHealth care, manufacturing and natural resources companies can all justify owning this much storage. In 10 years, a big sanitation company with sensors on its Dumpsters to manage pickups could have tens of petabytes.\u201dPure is hardly alone in working on new ways to handle the world\u2019s immense data deluge. The industry leader, EMC, has both traditional and advanced storage, including flash. EMC was bought by Dell in October for $67 billion. \u201cIf Dell hadn\u2019t bought them, I\u2019d wonder what Dell was going to do,\u201d Mr. Unsworth said.Netflix, which offers streaming video to 75 million people in 190 countries, ships dozens of custom-built appliances a week to hundreds of local Internet service providers. The newest, a mix of flash and traditional storage, can store five petabytes \u2014 enough, the company figures, to hold almost anything from its catalog that anyone, anywhere would want to watch, for now.The company analyzes data to figure out both the kind of content it should offer next, and the Internet\u2019s capacity to stream all that entertainment. \u201cWe arguably have the most insight of anybody,\u201d said Ken Florance, vice president of content delivery at Netflix. \u201cThere are networks in Kenya that are better than some networks in the U.S.\u201dCapturing and analyzing masses of data already touches improbable corners, like championship auto racing. Mercedes AMG Petronas, the racing arm of the Daimler car company, is an early customer of the new Pure blades.Mercedes AMG has about 300 sensors on each high-performance car. Much the way human athletes are regulated for substances, racing officials now limit the amount of computation cars can use, including wind tunnel simulations between races, so it pays to move data quickly.\u201cThey audit the amount of processing we use,\u201d said Matt Harris, the head of information technology for Mercedes AMG. \u201cIf we can cut a few seconds off each job with faster storage, that\u2019s an extra simulation a month.\u201dPure is in a race of its own. The company went public in October, and since then its stock has fallen one-third from the highs reached soon after. The new flash blade product line will not be important for revenue this year, but the company\u2019s chief executive, Scott Dietzen, hopes it will calm disappointed investors.\u201cNo one can look at all their data anymore; they need algorithms just to decide what to look at,\u201d he said, adding that he planned to offer 10 times the performance of competing products, at a lower cost. \u201cThis market is at least as large as our original storage business, and a lot bigger over time.\u201dMr. Hayes didn\u2019t set out to shake up a once-staid storage world. In 2006, he was a software engineer at a company that did online karaoke talent searches, when it was purchased by Yahoo.When Yahoo killed the product, he became a promoter of Yahoo\u2019s social networks, then quit in 2009. His old bosses at the karaoke company, backed by venture capitalists, were looking at a way to use flash and needed a good coder.The first Pure Storage product came out in 2012.By mid-2013, he was thinking about how he would build his product for a world of falling memory prices, and rapidly rising amounts of data inside cloud computing systems.Working with Mr. Dietzen and investors, he set up a venture inside Pure but away from the rest of the company, hiring a team of experienced people from places like Oracle, Microsoft Research and Facebook.

While teenage marriage and pregnancy are acceptable in some places in southwestern China, Ms. Xiao says it may create economic and educational obstacles, particularly for the girls.

Payne Whitney Gymnasium, which Yale describes as \u201ca nine-story, Gothic-style building\u201d and which is where the Bulldogs play their home games, is hardly a campus hot spot. Average attendance was a little over 1,500 this season, a spokesman said.Perry Bacon Jr., class of 2002, an NBC News political reporter, had not been aware until Sunday that his alma mater was in the tournament. (Yale clinched its berth eight days earlier.)Mr. Bacon learned that the score of Yale\u2019s game against Baylor on Thursday was close from former Gov. Howard Dean of Vermont, class of 1971, who was set to appear on MSNBC just after Mr. Bacon. Upon finishing his segment, Mr. Bacon watched the last few minutes, and Mr. Dean joined him after completing his own segment.\u201cThe two of us watched together, the final 30 seconds or so,\u201d Mr. Bacon said. \u201cWe became very intense fans, cheering every free throw Yale made, even though I could not name a single player on the team.\u201dMr. Bacon added: \u201cI saw Yale\u2019s coach on the screen and was like, \u2018Oh, that\u2019s the same coach from when I was there.\u2019 But I did not know his name. In fact, I still don\u2019t.\u201d (Coach James Jones is in his 17th season at Yale.)Ms. Holmes said she had noticed \u201ctons and tons\u201d of her Yale friends altering their Facebook profile pictures recently so that one corner had the N.C.A.A.\u2019s March Madness logo and another had the familiar block Y and snarling Bulldog of their shared alma mater. The bandwagon was filling up, even if many did not quite know how to get on.Wendy D\u2019Amico, class of 1993, attended the game in Providence, R.I., where she lives. She had not really been following the season until the past couple of weeks. \u201cWe went because we felt we had to seize the opportunity,\u201d Ms. D\u2019Amico said, \u201cbecause it only happens every half-century or so.\u201d\u201cI was much more aware of that than March Madness,\u201d Ms. Holmes said.\u201cThat was an amazing thing to me,\u201d said Mr. Feldman, a former Whiffenpoofs president. \u201cThat was my hook.\u201dStill others were blissfully unaware. Mari Hinojosa, a member of the class of 1994 who is development director for the organization Lawyers for Children, said she was \u201cnot sure it\u2019s possible to be more unaware of sports than I am,\u201d but nonetheless, upon hearing of the victory, \u201ccheered and put on my Yale T-shirt, which is literally the only item of clothing I own that has any writing on it.\u201dTo any hard-core college basketball fan \u2014 one monitoring more than a dozen games on Thursday, from noon to midnight \u2014 Yale\u2019s upset of Baylor was an exciting development, but not an altogether shocking one. Yale was 13-1 in the increasingly competitive Ivy League. And in the N.C.A.A. tournament, No. 12 seeds have been known to knock off No. 5 seeds.But Yale fans are rarely described as hard-core college basketball fans. As Mr. Feldman put it, \u201cI don\u2019t follow college sports ever, but if Yale is going to go to the tournament, then I tune in.\u201dTo be fair, Yale alumni are not alone in their lack of profound interest in college basketball.Though the men\u2019s basketball championship remains popular, with millions of television viewers and billions of dollars wagered, regular-season TV ratings are down, and the sport has become comparatively a niche attraction.Much of the tournament\u2019s broad appeal is what Yale experienced Thursday \u2014 upstarts beating traditional powers that operate with immense athletic budgets. Often those feel-good stories are snuffed out after the first week, and casual fans tune out.That fate is expected to befall Yale, too. Its next opponent, on Saturday, is Duke \u2014 a program that over the past few decades has produced basketball championships about as often as Yale has produced heads of state. Oddsmakers favor Duke to win by 6 points. But the Bulldogs have already exceeded expectations.\u201cMy 6-year-old twin daughters wanted to pick Yale in their school bracket,\u201d said David Franklin, a professor of constitutional law at DePaul who graduated from Yale in 1990. \u201cLike an idiot, I vetoed it.\u201dAdvertisement"}

They are the anti-victims in a prevalent culture of victimhood; Jews, it seems, are the sole historical victim whose claim is dubious.The Jewish state was needed. History had demonstrated that.

The survivors had to recover their homes, finances and belongings. They had to mourn loved ones, rebuild synagogues and reclaim their identity.Working alongside a young reporter, Max Snijders, Mr. Freed spent a year photographing their daily lives. He photographed the bar mitzvah of Naftali Schipper, whose parents had escaped to England just days before the German invasion in 1940. When they returned to the Netherlands in 1947, the father built a successful business as a jeweler and diamond merchant.Mr. Freed photographed Eli Abrahams, who sold herring and flowers on the streets. Mr. Abrahams had faked a psychiatric disorder during the war and was admitted to a general psychiatric hospital, where he survived (the rest of family was killed in Auschwitz).And he photographed Shabbat at the Moskovits family home.

{"Headline": "A Legislature Where Palestinian Lawmakers Go to Hide", "Date": "2016-03-17", "News": "Supported byRamallah JournalHer adult daughters had upended a lectern with a State of Palestine seal for use as a coffee table. The night before, her brother had brought in KFC, whose smell mingled with clinging cigarette smoke and the powerful air freshener Ms. Abu Baker had used to douse the bathroom. One of scores of idle employees, who still clock in daily though the legislature has not convened for nearly a decade, settled into a cushiony chair, seeking advice.The topic was not politics or policy, but relationships. Plucking the leaves off freshly picked herb stalks, the employee, who would not identify herself for fear of getting in trouble, complained that her handsome, philandering husband kept leaning on her for money.\u201cJust arrange for your husband to meet a rich woman, and then he can send you money from time to time!\u201d advised Ms. Abu Baker, who had emerged as something of a Dear Abby to lovelorn staff.\u201cHe says he loves me!\u201d the woman insisted. But she quickly moved on to joking \u2014 sort of \u2014 about getting her husband arrested by Israeli forces, which would at least mean she would not have to pay for his meals. The employee and the lawmaker collapsed into shrieking laughter.The 132-member legislature has been defunct since a 2007 split between Fatah, which dominates the Palestinian Authority and the Palestine Liberation Organization, and Hamas, the Islamist faction that rules the Gaza Strip. Yet there are not one but three legislative buildings: one here in Ramallah, the seat of the Palestinian Authority; one in the Gaza Strip, where Hamas lawmakers occasionally make decisions whose legality is dubious; and a half-built one in Abu Dis, outside Jerusalem, once imagined as the capital of a future independent Palestinian State.\u201cWhere else in the world would a parliamentarian, doing her job, calling out corruption, become a prisoner, while the corrupt walk free?\u201d Ms. Abu Baker asked in an interview. \u201cThis is painful for me, to be here like this. This is a place that should be full of dialogue, people, justice, not a place of detention for a parliamentarian.\u201dMs. Abu Baker left the building last week after making a deal with prosecutors to avoid arrest. She was the fourth Palestinian legislator in trouble to hide out in what is viewed as a protected space where security forces, Palestinian or Israeli, may not enter.And in November 2014, Ibrahim Khreisheh, facing an arrest warrant for insulting the Palestinian prime minister, decamped to the office suite of the former speaker of the house (a Hamas man who has spent years in and out of Israeli prisons).The guards provided a mattress, which Ms. Abu Baker shoved near a portrait of Yasir Arafat, the first Palestinian leader, in the former speaker\u2019s boardroom. The main room, with a desk and couches, became the salon. The lawmaker herself scrubbed the bathroom after years of disuse.Relatives poured in, including Khaled, a toddler who delighted in the elevator.\u201cKid, the Parliament is your playground!\u201d laughed his father, Shadi Zeidat, 27. \u201cWho would have imagined it?\u201dThe employee who complained about her philandering husband said 400 people still collected salaries for jobs connected to the legislature across the West Bank and Gaza, 120 of them deployed in the grand Ramallah building. Sometimes, they host foreign delegations, most recently a group of Polish lawmakers, for official visits.An employee named Haifa, who declined to provide her surname because she was not authorized to speak to journalists, described her daily routine.\u201cI sit here,\u201d said Haifa, 32. \u201cI check Facebook. I read the news.\u201d Did she do any work? Haifa shrugged. \u201cI sometimes send faxes.\u201dShe said she did not like being so idle, but could not quit a paying job when she needed money to support her parents. In February, she pointed out, some Palestinian legislators met in the building to discuss the teachers\u2019 strike. Before that? Haifa struggled to recall. Maybe last year?It has been more or less this way since 2007, a year after Hamas won the most seats in the last Palestinian legislative elections. The unity government formed by Hamas and Fatah fell apart, followed by a violent conflict in which Hamas seized control of Gaza. Ever since, Mr. Abbas has governed mostly by decree.\u201cThe president should leave nicely\u201d and arrange for new elections, Ms. Abu Baker said in an interview, echoing her controversial speech to the teachers. She also described the prime minister, Rami Hamdallah, as a \u201cdictator\u201d unable to withstand criticism.Ms. Abu Baker grew up in a well-to-do family of merchants. Her daughters said she had been a smart but rebellious girl who threw stones at Israeli soldiers and joined Fatah as a teenager. She lied to her father about studying in a Muslim seminary in Hebron and went instead to Najah University, where she majored in political science.She married a man against her parents\u2019 will, then divorced him against their will. She was elected in 2005 to represent Nablus, part of Fatah\u2019s quota for female legislators, after working for the Palestinian Authority in a quality-control department, fining merchants for selling expired or unhygienic products.\u201cI used to be the daughter of Fatah,\u201d Ms. Abu Baker said last week. \u201cNow I say I am a daughter of Palestine.\u201dShe left her vigil in the legislature on March 10 and was escorted to the office of the prosecutor, who had agreed to cancel the arrest warrant. The building folded back into its usual quiet.Until Monday, that is, when some 600 women showed up outside waving Palestinian flags and calling for an end to the bitter divide between Hamas and Fatah, which would revive Parliament\u2019s role.Standing on the stairs of the legislative building, supervising the scene, was Ms. Abu Baker.The Ramallah Journal article on March 18, about members of the defunct Palestinian Parliament who hide in the Parliament building to avoid arrest, referred incompletely to the case of Khalida Jarrar, a lawmaker who was arrested and prosecuted by the Israeli authorities. Though the charges against her were not initially made public when she was placed in administrative detention, they were in fact made known a month later when her detention status changed and she was formally charged. (She has since been convicted, under a plea agreement, of incitement and belonging to an illegal organization.).Rami Nazzal contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Parent-Child Discussion That So Many Dread: Donald Trump", "Date": "2016-03-10", "News": "Supported byIt was mortifying enough when the Republican debate last week introduced the question of whether it was appropriate for one presidential candidate to accuse another of wetting his pants. But the final straw for Gary Goyette and Andrea Todd, who were watching at home in Sacramento with their 10-year-old son, was Donald J. Trump\u2019s jarring, out-of-left-field boast about his sexual endowment.\u201cWe were just incredulous,\u201d Ms. Todd said, when Mr. Trump leeringly declared that there was \u201cno problem\u201d with that part of his anatomy. She and her husband looked at each other, she said, and then looked at their son. \u201cGary said, \u2018Tommy, you\u2019ve got to leave \u2014 you\u2019ve got to get out of here.\u2019 And Tommy actually got up and ran out of the room.\u201dMany unforeseeable things have happened so far in the raucous Republican presidential race. But the 2016 election \u2014 with its rudeness, crudeness, bluster and bullying \u2014 has also presented adults with an unexpected, unpleasant quandary: How on earth do they explain Donald Trump to children?\u201cQuite frankly, it\u2019s been quite embarrassing when I have an 11-year-old who is better behaved and more polite than some people who are the potential next leaders of our country,\u201d said Maury Peterson, who runs Parenting Journey, a nonprofit group in Somerville, Mass., that provides support for families. \u201cThis name-calling and making fun of people is basically the opposite of what he\u2019s been taught at home and at school.\u201dKathy Maher, a sixth-grade teacher in Newton, Mass., said that election years usually presented an excellent opportunity for students to observe the virtues of the American democratic process. But this year, she said, she worries about the school\u2019s mock-debate season, when someone will have to play Mr. Trump \u2014 a candidate who, if he were a student, would be sent straight to the principal\u2019s office.Her school has a program encouraging students to speak up if they see someone being mistreated, Ms. Maher said, and for that reason, she has felt obliged to address the subject of Mr. Trump.\u201cI try really hard, when we discuss politics, to take a balanced view,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I felt I had to say something this time, because the things Donald Trump says wouldn\u2019t be tolerated in our schools. He bullies people, he name-calls, he makes fun of people because of their race, their ethnicity and the way they look.\u201dWhat about students whose parents are Trump supporters? \u201cI say, \u2018People might like some of the things that Donald Trump stands for, but there are better ways of saying it,\u2019\u201d Ms. Maher said. \u201cI did say that some people like that he says things for shock value, like the crazy old uncle who just says whatever he wants. But as an educator, I can\u2019t support that. It\u2019s not funny \u2014 it\u2019s mean.\u201dFor some children, Mr. Trump\u2019s message has filtered down in extremely upsetting, possibly dangerous, ways. Social media has buzzed with parents relaying their children\u2019s fears that they or their friends will be deported, walled in or walled out if Mr. Trump becomes president.A coalition of Republicans is banking on a scenario in which Donald J. Trump fails to reach the 1,237 delegates required to secure the party\u2019s nomination before its July convention, creating a potential opening for another nominee as the delegates vote on the convention floor.Jon Michaud of Maplewood, N.J., who is white and whose wife is Dominican, wrote on Facebook about a conversation he had with one of his two sons: \u201cSo if Donald Trump becomes president, he\u2019s going to bring racism back,\u201d he said his 8-year-old had told him. \u201cThat means Marcus, Mommy and I will be separated from you because we have darker skin than you do, right?\u201dSpeaking on MSNBC\u2019s \u201cMorning Joe\u201d on Wednesday, Cokie Roberts put the question to the candidate himself. \u201cThere\u2019ve been incidents of white children pointing to their darker-skinned classmates and saying, \u2018You\u2019ll be deported when Donald Trump is president,\u2019\u00a0\u201d she said. \u201cThere\u2019ve been incidents of white kids at basketball games holding up signs to teams which have Hispanic kids on them, saying, \u2018We\u2019re going to build a wall to keep you out.\u2019\u00a0\u201d\u201cAre you proud of that?\u201d Ms. Roberts asked. \u201cIs that something you\u2019ve done in American political and social discourse that you\u2019re proud of?\u201dMr. Trump replied that he had no knowledge of such reports. \u201cI think your question is a very nasty question,\u201d he said, \u201cand I\u2019m not proud of it because I didn\u2019t even hear of it, O.K.?\u201dAs much as they might want to, parents and educators cannot keep their children insulated from news about Mr. Trump.\u201cHe\u2019s omnipresent. It\u2019s going to come up, so you better be prepared,\u201d said Carolyn Lee, a substitute kindergarten teacher in the Hawaii public school system.With very young children, she advised that parents remain calm and refrain from retaliatory anti-Trump name-calling. \u201cLet\u2019s say the family\u2019s watching the news and they see this man on TV tossing water bottles and making fun of people,\u201d Ms. Lee said. \u201cI would say something like, \u2018We try to treat people the way we would like to be treated, and somehow he\u2019s showing the exact opposite of that.\u2019\u00a0\u201dRichard Klin of Stone Ridge, N.Y., said he saw little point in trying to shield his 11-year-old daughter from the campaign. \u201cI had this impulse to lock her away in an enchanted land where Donald Trump doesn\u2019t exist, but you can\u2019t,\u201d he said.Mr. Klin said he had traumatic memories of watching his own father erupt into \u201cparoxysms of rage\u201d whenever he saw President Richard M. Nixon on television. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to be that guy yelling at the TV, so I\u2019m trying to cool it,\u201d he said.In Los Angeles, Andy Behrman, a single parent of two girls, 8 and 10, said that his daughters continually accused Mr. Trump of violating \u201cthe double v\u2019s,\u201d a reference to their school\u2019s \u201cvirtues and values\u201d program.\u201cThey\u2019re not picking up on the innuendoes of his hands, they\u2019re not catching on to the genital issue,\u201d Mr. Behrman said. \u201cBut they\u2019re catching on to the fact that Trump, Rubio and Cruz are all talking at the same time, which they\u2019ve learned doesn\u2019t make sense. It\u2019s not polite and it doesn\u2019t allow anyone to voice their own opinion.\u201dParents who support Mr. Trump disagree, of course. They say that his authenticity and his refusal to pander to his critics are more important than the words he uses.

So what if he did a retweet?\u2019\u00a0\u201d Ms. Ben-Ghiat said. \u201cBut we can tell our children that he\u2019s a product of our branding culture and our selfie culture and our attraction to reality-show television, where the behavior is so brutal.\u201dThe ubiquity of Mr. Trump, she said, provides a useful opportunity for children to examine their own preoccupations.\u201cThey can learn to look beyond flash and glamour, to be skeptical of the power of messaging and branding, but also to learn that it\u2019s important that each one of us speak out and use our right to vote,\u201d Ms. Ben-Ghiat said. \u201cAnd to listen to the other side even if you don\u2019t agree with them.\u201dIn Sacramento, though, Mr. Goyette and Ms. Todd have been unable to bring themselves to fully explain last week\u2019s debate to 10-year-old Tommy.\u201cHe asked us later, \u2018What does it mean about the hands thing?\u2019\u00a0\u201d Ms. Todd said. \u201cBut none of us wanted to tell him.\u201dAdvertisement"}

The first responds to stress by triggering a fight-or-flight reaction, raising heart rates and putting us generally on edge; the second counters those responses, bringing physiological calm. For this study, nearly four dozen university students were outfitted with sensors to monitor electrical activity in the heart and then shown photos on a computer screen. Half the pictures displayed urban spaces full of buildings and parked cars; the rest were green places \u00e2\u0080\u0094 but homely ones, like empty pathways flanked by trees, not majestic wilderness.Having viewed the photos, the students tackled a series of increasingly difficult computerized math problems while an on-screen assessment compared their results with the average performance and, whether accurately or not, showed them to be subpar. This test has proved to be a robust means of raising stress levels. Afterward, the subjects re-viewed the pictures, retook the math test, then looked at more photos.When the students saw green spaces after the math stressor, their parasympathetic nervous systems kicked in, lowering heart rates, for example. (Pictures from the concrete jungle had no such effect.) Interestingly, though, the same green scenes when viewed before the math test did not lessen the reaction to stress: Their heart rates still rose as they struggled with the problems.Related:Your health questions answered by Times journalists and\u00a0experts.Get Well's Running email for practical tips, expert advice, exclusive content and a bit of motivation delivered to your inbox every week to help you on your running journey.

Mr. Sanders sued Ohio\u00e2\u0080\u0099s top elections official, Secretary of State Jon A. Husted, in federal court on Tuesday arguing that Mr. Husted had \u00e2\u0080\u009carbitrarily\u00e2\u0080\u009d discriminated against young black and Latino voters by not allowing 17-year-olds who will be 18 by the general election in November to vote in the primary on Tuesday. On Friday, an Ohio state judge ruled that the teenagers can vote in the primary as well as in congressional, legislative and mayoral races. Mr. Husted has vowed to appeal the decision.Brad Deutsch, Mr. Sanders\u2019s lawyer, praised the state court\u2019s ruling Friday.He also said the judge had \u201cadmonished the secretary of state for abusing his discretion by prohibiting 17-year-olds from voting for presidential candidates and not only directed the secretary to instruct poll worker to allow 17-year olds to vote but also instructed them to make a reasonable effort to attempt to determine and record choices that have already been made by any 17-year-old who already voted in early voting.\u201dIn a statement Friday saying he would appeal the decision, Mr. Husted said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cThis last-minute legislating from the bench on election law has to stop.\u201d\u201cWe will appeal this decision because if there is a close election on Tuesday we need clarity from the Supreme Court to make sure that ineligible voters don\u2019t determine the outcome of an election,\u201d he said.Michael Briggs, a spokesman for Mr. Sanders, said he expected that the state ruling would be appealed this weekend. He added that the federal judge dealing with Mr. Sanders\u2019s lawsuit has said that he will rule in federal court by Monday afternoon.At least 20 states allow 17-year-olds to participate in presidential primaries or caucuses if they will be 18 on Election Day in November, according to FairVote, a voting-rights advocacy group. In December, Mr. Husted, a Republican, said that under state election law, 17-year-olds could vote in nominating contests but not elections, and thus a presidential primary was off-limits since voters will be electing delegates to the party conventions.Talking to reporters in Toledo before boarding a plane to Illinois, Mr Sanders said he was \u201cdelighted\u201d by the decision.\u201cThe idea that in the year 2016, we have Republican secretaries of state trying to suppress the vote, trying to make it difficult for young people to participate in the political process, is an outrage,\u201d he said. \u201cOur jobs is to get more people involved in the process, not fewer people, and I am glad that decision was won and I am confident that it will be sustained.\u201dAlso at the Toledo rally, Representative Marcy Kaptur of Ohio announced her endorsement. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAmerica could have no stronger Democratic leader for jobs in America, for fair trade and for economic progress for all, not just the privileged few, than Bernie Sanders,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Ms. Kaptur said as she introduced him in front of 2,600 supporters.Mr. Sanders, addressing the recent incidents of violence at Donald J.

{"Headline": "In the Apple Case, a Debate Over Data Hits Home", "Date": "2016-03-13", "News": "Supported byNews AnalysisBut the national debate touched off this winter by the confrontation between the Justice Department and Apple over smartphone security is not exactly the one Mr. Obama had in mind.Mr. Snowden\u2019s revelations produced modest changes and a heightened suspicion of the government\u2019s activities in cyberspace. Because the issue now centers on a device most Americans carry in their pockets, it is concrete and personal in a way that surveillance by the National Security Agency never was.\u201cDiscussing the case with my friends has become a touchy subject,\u201d said Matthew Montoya, 19, a computer science major at the University of Texas, El Paso. \u201cWe\u2019re a political bunch with views from all across the spectrum.\u201dLike many of her friends, Emi Kane, a community organizer in Oakland, Calif., recently found herself arguing via Facebook with a family friend about the case. Ms. Kane thought Apple was right to refuse to hack the phone; her friend, a waitress in Delaware, said she was disgusted by Apple\u2019s lack of patriotism.After exchanging several terse messages, they agreed to disagree. \u201cIt was a hard conversation,\u201d Ms. Kane said.The novelist Russell Banks, who signed a letter to Attorney General Loretta Lynch on behalf of Apple, said he had spoken with more than a dozen people about the case just in the last week.\u201cIt\u2019s not just people in the tech industry talking about this,\u201d Mr. Banks, the author of \u201cAffliction\u201d and \u201cThe Sweet Hereafter,\u201d said. \u201cIt\u2019s citizens like myself.\u201dThat may be because the Apple case involves a device whose least interesting feature is the phone itself. It is a minicomputer stuffed with every detail of a person\u2019s life: photos of children, credit card purchases, texts with spouses (and nonspouses), and records of physical movements.Mr. Obama warned Friday against \u201cfetishizing our phones above every other value.\u201d After avoiding taking a position for months, he finally came down on the side of law enforcement, saying that using technology to prevent legal searches of smartphones was the equivalent of preventing the police from searching a house for evidence of child pornography.\u201cThat can\u2019t be the right answer,\u201d he said at the South by Southwest festival in Texas, even as he professed deep appreciation for civil liberties and predicted both sides would find a way to cooperate. \u201cI\u2019m confident this is something that we can solve.\u201dThe technology company has been locked in a major legal battle against law enforcement officials over privacy and security.But polls suggest the public is nowhere near as certain as Mr. Obama. In surveys, Americans are deeply divided about the legal struggle between the government and one of the nation\u2019s most iconic companies. The polls show that Americans remain anxious about both the threat of terrorist attacks and the possible theft of personal digital information.But despite the fears about terrorism, the public\u2019s concern about digital privacy is nearly universal. A Pew Research poll in 2014 found more than 90 percent of those surveyed felt that consumers had lost control over how their personal information was collected and used by companies.Now, people are beginning to understand that their smartphones are just the beginning. Smart televisions, Google cars, Nest thermostats and web-enabled Barbie dolls are next. The resolution of the legal fight between Apple and the government may help decide whether the information in those devices is really private, or whether the F.B.I. and the N.S.A. are entering a golden age of surveillance in which they have far more data available than they could have imagined 20 years ago.\u201cIt\u2019s an in-your-face proposition for lots more Americans than the Snowden revelation was,\u201d said Lee Rainie, director of Internet, science and technology research at Pew Research Center.Cindy Cohn, executive director of the Electronic Frontier Foundation, said: \u201cEveryone gets at a really visceral level that you have a lot of really personal stuff on this device and if it gets stolen it\u2019s really bad. They know that the same forces that work at trying to get access to sensitive stuff in the cloud are also at work attacking the phones.\u201dFor the F.B.I. and local law enforcement agencies, the fight has become a high-stakes struggle to prevent what James B. Comey, the bureau\u2019s director, calls \u201cwarrant-free zones\u201d where criminals can hide evidence out of reach of the authorities.Officials had hoped the Apple case involving a terrorist\u2019s iPhone would rally the public behind what they see as the need to have some access to information on smartphones. But many in the administration have begun to suspect that the F.B.I. and the Justice Department may have made a major strategic error by pushing the case into the public consciousness.Many senior officials say an open conflict between Silicon Valley and Washington is exactly what they have been trying to avoid, especially when the Pentagon and intelligence agencies are trying to woo technology companies to come back into the government\u2019s fold, and join the fight against the Islamic State. But it appears it is too late to confine the discussion to the back rooms in Washington or Silicon Valley.The fact that Apple is a major consumer company \u201ctakes the debate out of a very narrow environment \u2014 the universe of technologists and policy wonks \u2014 into the realm of consumers where barriers like the specific language of Washington or the technology industry begins to fall away,\u201d said Malkia Cyril, the executive director of the Center for Media Justice, a grass-roots activist network.That organization and other activist groups like Black Lives Matter have seized on the issue as important for their members. In February the civil liberties group Fight for the Future organized the day of protest against the government order that resulted in rallies in cities nationwide.\u201cWhen we heard the news and made a call for nationwide rallies, one happened in San Francisco that same day,\u201d said Tiffiniy Cheng, co-founder of Fight for the Future. \u201cThings like that almost never happen.\u201dMs. Cyril says the public angst about the iPhone case feels more urgent than did the discussion about government surveillance three years ago.\u201cThis is one of those moments that defines what\u2019s next,\u201d she said. \u201cWill technology companies protect the privacy of their users or will they do work for the U.S. government?

A few months later, he had vertebrae in his neck fused to repair a football injury, and his ability to control his hands declined to the point where he could no longer write. The next year, doctors said that he had A.L.S.Turner pushed for former players to approve the settlement with the N.F.L. Some players complained that the N.F.L., which initially agreed to pay $765 million, was not doing enough to help players. The judge in the case concurred, and the N.F.L. then agreed to pay an unlimited amount of damages for players found to have A.L.S., Parkinson\u2019s disease, Alzheimer\u2019s disease and dementia.The families of players found to have had chronic traumatic encephalopathy, which can be diagnosed only posthumously, were also eligible to be paid. But some players appealed the settlement, objecting to the restriction that among players found to have C.T.E., only those who died between 2006 and last April would be paid.Because of his age at the time of his diagnosis, Turner stood to receive $5 million, money that will go to his family if the settlement remains unchanged after all appeals are exhausted. (The United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit heard oral arguments in the appeal in November; judges have yet to rule.)\u201cI can empathize with players\u201d who want a better settlement, Turner said. \u201cBut for me and people like me, time is a luxury we don\u2019t have.\u201dAdvertisement"}

So, somewhere between a library and a Red Wings game.(LAUGHTER) (CHEERING)BAIER: Am I right? Is that OK?Let\u2019s get started.WALLACE: Mr. Trump, as you may have heard, the 2012 Republican nominee for President, Mitt Romney, had some things to say about you today.He said your domestic policy will lead to recession, he\u2019s said your foreign policy will make us less safe, and then he listed what he said are your personal qualities. Quoting now Romney on Trump, quote, \u201cthe bullying, the greed, the showing off, the misogyny, the absurd, third-grade theatrics\u201d.(CHEERING)He challenged you to answer with substance, not insults. How do you answer Mitt Romney, sir?TRUMP: Well look, he was a failed candidate, he should have beaten president Obama very easy.He failed miserably, and it was an embarrassment to everybody, including the Republican party. It looked like he went away on a vacation the last month. So, I don\u2019t take that, and I guess, obviously, he wants to be relevant. He wants to be back in the game.As far as domestic policy and trade which is killing our country, he said free trade and I believe in free trade also. But, if you look at China, and you look Japan, and if you look at Mexico, both at the border, by the way, where they\u2019re killing us.Both at the border, and with trade \u2014 and every other country we do business with we are getting absolutely crushed on trade. And, he said free trade, I say free trade great. But, not when they\u2019re beating us so badly.With China we\u2019re going to lose $505 billion dollars in terms of trades. You just can\u2019t do it.Mexico, $58 billion dollars.Japan, probably about, they don\u2019t know it yet, but about $109 billion dollars.Every country we lose money with. As far as I\u2019m concerned, we\u2019ve got to reduce \u2014 we have to redo our trade deals 100 percent. I have the greatest business people in the world lined up to do it. We will make...(BELL RINGING)TRUMP: ... great trade deals.(CHEERING)WALLACE: Mr. Trump, Romney also talked about your position on race, and the controversy over your failure to denounce David Duke on Sunday. You have repeatedly disavowed him since then, but I\u2019d like to go deeper than that. What are your views on the Klu Klux Klan, and white supremacists?TRUMP: I totally disavow the Klu Klux Klan. I totally disavow David Duke. I\u2019ve been doing it now for two weeks, this is your \u2014 you\u2019re probably about the 18th person that\u2019s asked me the question. It was very clear, that question was also talked about in the form of groups. Groups, I want to know which groups are you talking about? You have to tell me which groups?Ultimately, he got to the Klu Klux Klan, which obviously I\u2019m going to disavow. And, by the way, if you look on my Twitter account, almost immediately after the program they were disavowed again.You know, it\u2019s amazing. When I do something on Twitter, everybody picks it up, goes all over the place. But, when I did this one nobody ever picks it up. Take a look at my Twitter account.WALLACE: Thank you, sir.TRUMP: Thank you. Thanks.(APPLAUSE)BAIER: Senator Rubio, three weeks ago you said, quote: \u201cI don\u2019t do the personal attacks, primarily because it\u2019s not who I am, because I think it\u2019s beneath the office that I\u2019m seeking but also because I don\u2019t want to embarrass my kids.\u201dBut in the past week you\u2019ve mocked Mr. Trump\u2019s tan. You\u2019ve made fun of his spelling. You called him a con artist. You suggested he wet himself backstage at the last debate, along with other vulgar jokes and jabs. So what happened?RUBIO: Yes, you know, Bret, let me say something. This campaign for the last year Donald Trump has basically mocked everybody with personal attacks. He has done so to people that are sitting on the stage today. He has done so about people that are disabled. He has done it about every candidate in this race.So if there is anyone who has ever deserved to be attacked that way, it has been Donald Trump, for the way he has treated people in the campaign.Now that said, I would much prefer to have a policy debate. I hope that\u2019s what we will have here tonight. Let\u2019s have a policy debate...TRUMP: And we will.RUBIO: ... let\u2019s talk about Donald Trump\u2019s strategy and my strategy and Ted\u2019s strategy and John Kasich\u2019s strategy when it comes to ISIS. And on health care and on the important issues facing this country.But let\u2019s be honest too about all this. The media has given these personal attacks that Donald Trump has made an incredible amount of coverage. Let\u2019s start talking again about the issues that matter to this country. I\u2019m ready to do that starting right here right now tonight.BAIER: Mr. Trump, your response?TRUMP: Well, I also happened to call him a lightweight, OK? And I have said that. So I would like to take that back. He is really not that much of a lightweight. And as far as \u2014 and I have to say this, I have to say this. He hit my hands. Nobody has ever hit my hands. I have never heard of this. Look at those hands. Are they small hands?(LAUGHTER)TRUMP: And he referred to my hands, if they are small, something else must be small. I guarantee you there is no problem. I guarantee.BAIER: OK. Moving on.KELLY: OK, Senator Cruz, you say that you are the true conservative in this race. But 15 states have voted now, and you have won only four of them. You have lost repeatedly with what is supposed to be your core voter groups, including evangelicals and conservatives.Hasn\u2019t your brand of conservatism been rejected by an electorate that appears to be more taken with Mr. Trump\u2019s populist message?CRUZ: Well, Megyn, you know, at the end of the day for the folks at home, this is not about the insults back and forth between the candidates. This is not about what attacks we can throw at each other. This is the people at home who are struggling through seven years of Barack Obama.This is the single moms who are working two and three jobs, 28, 29 hours a week because their hours have been forcibly reduced because of Obamacare. This is the truck drivers and the steel workers and the mechanics with calluses on their hands who have seen their wages not grow year after year after year while the cost of living goes up.This is all the young people coming out of school with student loans up to their eyeballs that aren\u2019t able to find a job.And I don\u2019t think the people of America are interested in a bunch of bickering school children. They are interested in solutions, not slogans. It\u2019s easy to say, make things better, make things great. You can even print it and put it on a baseball cap.But the question is, do you understand the principles that made America great in the first place? As president, I will repeal every word of Obamacare. I will pull back the regulators that are killing small businesses.And we will pass a simple flat tax and abolish the IRS. And what that\u2019s going to do, Megyn, is small businesses are going to explode. We are going to see millions of high-paying jobs. We are going to see wages going up. We are going to see opportunity.That\u2019s where our focus needs to be. That\u2019s where my focus is. And that is why our campaign is the only campaign that over and over again has beaten Donald Trump to date, and it\u2019s why we are the one campaign that going forward can and will beat Donald Trump in this election.KELLY: Go ahead, Mr. Trump. TRUMP: I have heard Ted say that over and over again on television, that he is the only one that can beat me. Just, for the record, I have won 10. He has won three or four. Last week, in fact, on Tuesday, I was a half a million votes higher than him. I was a million votes higher than Marco, 1 million votes. That\u2019s a lot of votes. And was by far in first place.So I keep hearing that he is the only one that can beat me but he is getting beaten very, very badly. So where does this come from? Where does it come from?KELLY: Go ahead, Senator Rubio.RUBIO: Yes, I would just say a couple of things. There is no doubt that Donald has done well in these elections. There is no doubt about that. The numbers are there.Here is what the numbers also say. Two-thirds of the people who have cast a vote in a Republican primary or caucus have voted against you. They do not want you to be our nominee.RUBIO: And, the reason why is because we are not going to turn over the conservative movement, or the party of Lincoln or Reagan, for example, to someone whose positions are not conservative. To someone who last week defended Planned Parenthood for 30 seconds a debate stage. To someone, for example, that has no ideas on foreign \u2014 someone who thinks the nuclear triad is a rock band from the 1980\u2019s.TRUMP: Oh yeah, you\u2019re...RUBIO: ... To someone who time and again on issue after issue has not proven that he has the principals...(BELL RINGING)RUBIO: ... That outline what the conservative movement has been about. And, as Ted said, the things that made America great.America is great because of the conservative principles of limited government and free enterprise, and a strong national defense...KELLY: ... OK...RUBIO: ... And, our nominee needs to be someone that stands by those things...KELLY: ... Alright...RUBIO: ... Donald has not demonstrated that.KELLY: ... Go ahead, Mr. Trump, and then we\u2019re going to have to go to Governor Kasich.(APPLAUSE)TRUMP: Very nice words, but happens to be wrong. CNN just came out with a poll two days ago that...RUBIO: ...

Of all the people on this stage, he performs the worst against Hillary Clinton.TRUMP: Wrong...RUBIO: ... If you\u2019re our nominee, we will lose...TRUMP: ... I beat Hillary Clinton. I beat Hillary Clinton in many polls...RUBIO: ... You lose by (INAUDIBLE) points (ph). She will wipe you out.TRUMP: I beat Hillary Clinton in many polls...RUBIO: If you\u2019re our nominee (INAUDIBLE)...KELLY: ... Hold on, Senator, hold on...TRUMP: ...

They should vote for Senator Cruz in states that he can beat Mr. Trump to prevent Mr. Trump from getting the nomination.So, do you buy Romney\u2019s blueprint, and can you say tonight to your Florida supporters that they should vote for Senator Rubio to get a contested convention?KASICH: You know, this so much about process. It frankly is boring to me. I would like it clear though, since we\u2019re talking about polls, I beat Hillary Clinton by more than 11 points, and the reason it happens...(CHEERING)TRUMP: ... In one poll...KASICH: ... The reason it happens...TRUMP: ... In one poll...KASICH: ... You know, the reason is because, as the Democrats tell me all the time, I can get the crossover votes. You see, because throughout this campaign I\u2019ve talked about issues, I have never tried to go and get into these scrums that we\u2019re seeing here on the stage. And, people say everywhere I go, \u201cyou seem to be the adult on the stage.\u201d(APPLAUSE)In terms of \u2014 you know, Mitt Romney\u2019s a great guy, but he doesn\u2019t determine my strategy. The fact of the matter is I\u2019m running for president because I worked hard to fix this country when I was in Washington as the Chairman of the Budget Committee where we had some of the most significant job growth after we balanced the budget.We had wages going up, it was very successful in Ohio. Our wages grow faster than the national average. We\u2019re up over 400,000 jobs. We paid down, back in the old days, they paid down half a trillion dollars of the national debt. It\u2019s a formula that works. And, I believe that formula will work when I return to Washington as the president.And, by the way, I won\u2019t need on the job training because I know how to do all of this, and within the first 100 days I will have a plan that will pass the Congress because...(BELL RINGING)KASICH: ... It is reasonable, and I can bring both sides together...(APPLAUSE)BAIER: ... But Governor, this is all about process. For voters, they need to see a path to get to the nomination if they\u2019re going to support you.On Super Tuesday you finished in single digits in nine out of 11 states. So, you can see that your path is through a contested convention. How do you...KASICH: ... Well, Bret, I think we\u2019re all really there. I mean, the simple fact is that, you know, you all wrote me off. You wrote me off before I even got to New Hampshire, then when I finished in New Hampshire you wrote me off in the South, then you wrote me off in Super Tuesday.I split delegates in Vermont with Donald Trump, I finished second in Massachusetts, and we won delegates in Virginia. But, guess what? It\u2019s now March Madness and we\u2019re heading up North to the place \u2014 to my turf, OK?(CHEERING)KASICH: And, let me just tell you this, I will win Ohio, and I am going to move all across this country, and over time as people begin to finally hear my message \u2014 you know what people say, Bret, to me all the time?Why don\u2019t they give you any time on the debate stage? Why is that?(CHEERING)KASICH: So now all of a sudden, I\u2019m starting to get it, and what I want the people to know is, I know how to bring people together, Republicans and Democrats. I have successfully, both at the federal level and the state level brought economic growth, wage growth, and economic security to this country.And I want to go back and do it again, and I\u2019m going to keep talking about my message of bringing people together and motivating people in the neighborhoods that realize they don\u2019t need somebody from Washington galloping in. There are many things they can do where they live, because the strength of our country is in our neighborhoods and our families. And I\u2019m going to keep doing this.(APPLAUSE)BAIER: Thank you.WALLACE: Well, then, we want to focus now on the economy, which is one of the top issues on Facebook, with 6.6 million people discussing it online. A lot of that conversation is happening here in Detroit, where the unemployment rate is 10.9 percent. That\u2019s more than double the national average.Senator Rubio, you have taken to calling Mr. Trump a con artist who portrays himself as a hero to working people while he\u2019s really been, in your words, \u201csticking it\u201d to the American workers for 40 years. But he has built a big company that employs thousands of people. Question. How many jobs have you created?RUBIO: Well, first of all, government doesn\u2019t...(AUDIENCE BOOS)First of all, Chris, my point is exactly right. He has spent a career of convincing Americans that he\u2019s something that he\u2019s not in exchange for their money. Now he\u2019s trying to do the same in exchange for their country. This is a fact. He talks about these great businesses that he\u2019s built. He inherited over $100 million.TRUMP: Wrong. Wrong.RUBIO: And with that money, he lost more money than he made.WALLACE: Mr. Trump, it\u2019s not your turn. You\u2019ll get your turn, sir.(CROSSTALK)RUBIO: He can start tonight by announcing that all the Donald Trump clothing will no longer be made in China and in Mexico, but will be made here in the United States.(APPLAUSE)And on the issue of job creation, I find this interesting. The private sector creates jobs. The jobs of those of us in public service are to put in place policies that allow the economy to grow.That\u2019s the problem with the Democratic Party. They think government is what creates jobs. Government does not create jobs.WALLACE: Sir? Mr. Trump, I\u2019d like you to respond. You have 30 seconds to respond. But as part of that, could you respond to his specific assertion about Trump Collection clothes, which you say some of it is made in Mexico?TRUMP: This little guy has lied so much...RUBIO: Here we go.TRUMP: ... about my record.RUBIO: Here we go. It\u2019s personal.(AUDIENCE BOOS)(CROSSTALK)TRUMP: He has lied so much about my record.WALLACE: Mr. Rubio \u2014 Senator Rubio, why don\u2019t you let him finish?TRUMP: And I will tell you this. First of all, I got a call from my sister and brother tonight, and they said we had no idea Dad gave you $200 million. Believe me, I started off with $1 million. I built a company that\u2019s worth more than $10 billion. And I say it not in a bragging way, but that\u2019s the kind of thinking we need.Very low debt, tremendous cash flow. My financials are all \u2014 they\u2019re all in there with the federal elections. You\u2019ve seen them. Everybody has seen them. I say it only because that\u2019s the kind of thinking this country needs with $19 trillion in debit. Believe me.(APPLAUSE)WALLACE: But wait one second. Specifically and quickly on the question, will you promise that you will \u2014 and how soon will you move your clothing collection, the clothes that are made in China and Mexico?TRUMP: They devalue their currencies. I will do that. And by the way, I have been doing it more and more. But they devalue their currencies, in particular China. Mexico is doing a big number now, also. Japan is unbelievable what they\u2019re doing.They devalue their currencies, and they make it impossible for clothing-makers in this country to do clothing in this country. And if you look at what\u2019s happened on Seventh Avenue, and you look at what\u2019s happened in New York with the garment industry, so much of the clothing now comes out from Vietnam, China, and other places. And it\u2019s all because of devaluation.By the way, the Trans-Pacific, if you look at the TPP, a total disaster, which, by the way, Marco is in favor of, they need \u2014 it is a disaster for our country. It\u2019s trying to be approved by various people, including President Obama. And I\u2019ll tell you something. The biggest problem with that is: They don\u2019t take into concurrence the devaluation. They\u2019re devaluing their currency.WALLACE: Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Trump. Senator Rubio?TRUMP: And they\u2019re killing \u2014 they\u2019re going to...(CROSSTALK)WALLACE: Wait, wait, Senator Rubio.RUBIO: The answer is, he\u2019s not going to do it. And you know why? Because there are plenty of clothing makers in America.(APPLAUSE)(CROSSTALK)And the second point, you see what happens, again, when you challenge him on a policy issue. You asked him about the economy, and the first thing he does is launch an attack about some little guy thing. Because he doesn\u2019t have answers.TRUMP: No, no. I have very good answers.RUBIO: And he\u2019s asking us to make him the president of the United States of America.(CROSSTALK) (APPLAUSE)RUBIO: This is not a game.TRUMP: I know what\u2019s happening with the economy. You don\u2019t know a thing.RUBIO: Well, then answer the economy question.TRUMP: You haven\u2019t employed in your life one person.RUBIO: But he doesn\u2019t answer the employment question.TRUMP: I have employed tens of thousands of people.(CROSSTALK)TRUMP: You haven\u2019t employed one person.RUBIO: You ever heard of Trump Steaks? You ever heard of Trump Vodka?TRUMP: Oh, you know what? You know what? Take a look at Trump Steaks.RUBIO: All of these companies he has ruined.TRUMP: By the way, that\u2019s the other thing...RUBIO: Trump Steaks is gone. You have ruined these companies.TRUMP: Mitt Romney...(CROSSTALK)TRUMP: ... false, totally false. And now the funny thing is he didn\u2019t talk about the hundreds of really successful jobs, the buildings all over the world that have made a fortune.(CROSSTALK)WALLACE: I have a policy question for you, sir.RUBIO: Let\u2019s see if he answers it.TRUMP: I will. Don\u2019t worry about it, Marco. Don\u2019t worry about it. Don\u2019t worry about it little Marco, I will.RUBIO: All right, well, let\u2019s hear it big Donald.TRUMP: Don\u2019t worry about it, little Marco.(CROSSTALK)WALLACE: Gentlemen. Gentlemen.(CROSSTALK)WALLACE: You have got to do better than this. TRUMP: This guy has a number one \u2014 the number one absentee record in the United States...WALLACE: Mr. Trump, I would like to ask you a policy question.TRUMP: He doesn\u2019t show up to vote.WALLACE: Your proposed tax cut...TRUMP: That\u2019s why the people in Florida do not like him.WALLACE: Mr. Trump, your proposed tax cut would add $10 trillion to the nation\u2019s debt over 10 years, even if the economy grows the way that you say it will. You insist that you could make up for a good deal of that, you say, by cutting waste, fraud, and abuse.TRUMP: Correct.WALLACE: Like what? And please be specific.TRUMP: Department of Education. We\u2019re cutting Common Core. We\u2019re getting rid of Common Core. We\u2019re bringing education locally. Department of Environmental Protection. We are going to get rid are of it in almost every form. We\u2019re going to have little tidbits left but we\u2019re going to take a tremendous amount out.We have various other things. If you look at the IRS, if you look at every single agency, we can cut it down, and I mean really cut it down and save. The waste, fraud, and abuse is massive.Larry Kudlow, great guy, everybody respects him, said my plan for taxes and tax cutting is the best by far of everybody.WALLACE: But, Mr. Trump, Mr. Trump, your numbers don\u2019t add up. Please put up full screen number four. The Education Department, you talk about cutting, the total budget for the education department is $78 billion.And that includes Pell grants for low-income students and aid to states for special education. I assume you wouldn\u2019t cut those things. The entire budget for the EPA, the Environmental Protection Agency, $8 billion.TRUMO: OK.WALLACE: The deficit this year is $544 billion. That\u2019s more than a half trillion dollars. Your numbers don\u2019t add up, sir.TRUMP: Let me explain something. Because of the fact that the pharmaceutical companies \u2014 because of the fact that the pharmaceutical companies are not mandated to bid properly, they have hundreds of billions of dollars in waste.We don\u2019t bid properly. We don\u2019t have proper bidding procedures. The reason we don\u2019t is because they take care of all of the senators, all of the congressman, and they don\u2019t bid. They don\u2019t go out to bid. WALLACE: Mr. Trump...TRUMP: Take a look \u2014 excuse me. You are talking about hundreds of billions of dollars...WALLACE: No, you are not.TRUMP: ... if we went out to the proper bid. Of course you are.WALLACE: No, you\u2019re not, sir. Let\u2019s put up full screen number 2.You say that Medicare could save $300 billion a year negotiating lower drug prices. But Medicare total only spends $78 billion a year on drugs. Sir, that\u2019s the facts. You are talking about saving more money on Medicare prescription drugs...TRUMP: I\u2019m saying saving through negotiation throughout the economy, you will save $300 billion a year.WALLACE: But that doesn\u2019t really cut the federal deficit.TRUMP: And that\u2019s a huge \u2014 of course it is. We are going to buy things for less money. Of course it is. That works out...WALLACE: That\u2019s the only money that we buy \u2014 the only drugs that we pay for is through Medicare.TRUMP: I\u2019m not only talking about drugs, I\u2019m talking about other things. We will save $300 billion a year if we properly negotiate. We don\u2019t do that. We don\u2019t negotiate. We don\u2019t negotiate anything.KASICH: Can I...WALLACE: No. I promise I will get to you in a moment, sir.Senator Cruz, one of centerpieces of your campaign, in fact, you mentioned it again tonight, is that you will abolish the IRS. Question though, who will collect the taxes that you are still calling for? Who will oversee to make sure that people pay the taxes that they rightfully owe? And who will check on the various tax deductions and tax credits that you still want?When he we get rid of all the corporate welfare, all the subsidies, all the carve-outs in the IRS code, it dramatically simplifies it. And under Obama, the IRS has become so corrupt and so politicized we need to abolish it all together.Now, at the end of that there will still be an office in the Treasury Department to receive the postcards but it will be dramatically simpler. CRUZ: And let me take a moment, Chris, to go back to go back to this exchange that was going on.In between all of the insults, let me point out the specificity that was lacking. It\u2019s very easy to say, \u201cLet\u2019s cut waste, fraud, and abuse.\u201d I\u2019ve rolled out a detailed plan to cut $500 billion in federal spending, specifying exactly what I would cut.(APPLAUSE)It\u2019s easy to say it, but one of the great disconnects to all the people, all of the voters, I understand the folks who are supporting Donald right now. You\u2019re angry. You\u2019re angry at Washington, and he uses angry rhetoric.But for 40 years, Donald has been part of the corruption in Washington that you\u2019re angry about.(APPLAUSE)And you\u2019re not going to stop the corruption in Washington by supporting someone who has supported liberal Democrats for four decades, from Jimmy Carter to John Kerry to Hillary Clinton. You\u2019re not going to stop the corruption and the cronyism by supporting someone who has used government power for private gain. Instead, we need a president who stands with the American people.(APPLAUSE)WALLACE: Governor Kasich, I promise I will get to you. But you do get 30 seconds to respond, Mr. Trump.TRUMP: Well, all of a sudden, I hear for 40 years I\u2019ve been involved in Washington. I have been supporting people for many years. And these people have been politicians, and they\u2019ve been on both sides, Democrats, Republicans, liberals, conservatives. I\u2019ve supported everybody, because, until recently, I wasn\u2019t a politician, and I hope maybe you don\u2019t all consider me a politician right now. I hate the term politician.But I\u2019ve been supporting politicians. A recent article somewhere said Donald Trump is a world-class businessman who goes out and he does get along with everybody. I\u2019ve supported Democrats, and I\u2019ve supported Republicans. And as a businessman, I owed that to my company, to my family, to my workers, to everybody to get along.Part of the problem we have in Washington, Chris...WALLACE: Mr. Trump...TRUMP: ... is it\u2019s total gridlock. Nobody gets along. We need people to get along. We need to be able to get things done.(APPLAUSE)WALLACE: Governor Kasich, Democrats, as you know, will make income inequality a big issue in the general election. You support raising the minimum wage, although you say not to the $15 an hour that Democrats are talking about. Mr. Trump opposes any increase because he says it will price American workers out of the world market. Is he wrong about that? No increase in the minimum wage?KASICH: Well, well, wait a minute, first of all, I didn\u2019t say I was for an increase in the federal minimum wage. I said in Ohio we increased it modestly every single year. So I\u2019m not for a federal minimum wage increase.WALLACE: But you did talk about states doing it.KASICH: Well, states \u2014 if states want to do it, they ought to sit down with businesspeople and the lawmakers and figure out what will work. But hold on a second here with everything else.I\u2019m the only person on this stage who actually was the chief architect of balancing the federal budget. It\u2019s not a theory for me. It\u2019s not \u2014 it\u2019s not some \u2014 you have to know how to put everything together. And you know, I spent 10 years of my life to get there, and I did not do that because I\u2019m worshiping at some balanced budget shrine.The reason I did it is when you have commonsense regulations, lower taxes on individuals and businesses, and you have a fiscal plan that makes sense, the job creators will expand employment. And what happened? When I was there, the jobs were exploding. Bill Clinton\u2019s tried to take credit for it. When I went to Ohio, we\u2019re up 400,000 jobs. It\u2019s the same formula.But it isn\u2019t easy. I fought the entire Washington establishment and won, because when you balance a budget, you must affect every single thing. Everything in the federal government specifically. You cannot get there with theories or broad statements, and you have to be willing to take the heat. In fact, I fought a Republican president, who I thought was not offering constructive proposals to fix this economy.So when we talk about all this, there\u2019s one person on this stage and one person who\u2019s been a candidate for president in either party that restored economic strength, growth, a balanced budget, paid down debt, cut taxes, the things that people in this country want. No theories. Reality.(APPLAUSE)WALLACE: Thank you, Governor.(APPLAUSE)KELLY: All right. Let\u2019s talk immigration for a little bit. Senator Cruz, let\u2019s start with you. You have repeatedly touted how you have stood shoulder to shoulder with Senator Jeff Sessions to fight illegal immigration and amnesty. But Senator Sessions just endorsed Donald Trump. If voters want Jeff Sessions-style immigration policies, isn\u2019t their choice rather clear?CRUZ: Yes, their choice is very clear. If you look to the actual record \u2014 you know, Donald mentioned a moment ago that he was just doing business when he was writing checks to liberal Democrats. But that\u2019s not, in fact, the checks he was writing.Listen, we could all understand if you write a check to a city commission because you\u2019re looking for a zoning waiver on building a building. That may be corrupt, but you could understand real estate developers doing that.CRUZ: That\u2019s not what Donald Trump did. Donald Trump supported Jimmy Carter over Ronald Reagan. Donald supported John Kerry over George W. Bush. If you don\u2019t like Obamacare, Donald Trump funded Harry Reid and Nancy Pelosi taking over Congress to pass Obamacare.On immigration, if you don\u2019t like amnesty, if you don\u2019t like the Gang of Eight, Donald Trump funded five of the eight members of the Gang of Eight $50,000.And let\u2019s talk about this election. The choice Republican primary voters are making is who is best prepared to stand up to Hillary Clinton and beat Hillary Clinton. Donald Trump has written checks to Hillary Clinton not once, not twice, not three times. Ten times. And four of those checks were not to her Senate campaign. It wasn\u2019t that she was the New York senator and it was a cost of doing business. It was to her presidential campaign.Donald Trump in 2008 wrote four checks to elect Hillary Clinton as president.KELLY: OK.CRUZ: So I\u2019d like to ask Donald, why did you write checks to Hillary Clinton to be president in 2008? It wasn\u2019t for business. And how can you stand on a debate stage now with her and say you don\u2019t think she should be president?(APPLAUSE)TRUMP: Actually, it was for business. It was. It was. It was for business. I pride myself, including outside of the United States. I\u2019m doing almost 120 deals outside of the \u2014 which I hope to be able to stop very soon and let my children handle it \u2014 but we\u2019re doing many, many deals outside of the United States.I support politicians. In 2008, I supported Hillary Clinton. I supported many other people, by the way. And that was because of the fact that I\u2019m in business. I did support very heavily Ronald Reagan. I also supported George Bush, by the way.KELLY: All right. Mr. Trump...CRUZ: But what would you say...KELLY: Well, stand by \u2014 stand by, Senator Cruz.CRUZ: ... to Hillary Clinton on the debate stage when you wrote her a check in 2008, wrote her four checks to be president?TRUMP: Let me tell you, something, Ted. The last person that Hillary Clinton wants to face is Donald Trump. That I can...(APPLAUSE)KELLY: Let\u2019s move on. And with all due respect, we have \u2014 we have questions. We have questions.TRUMP: That I can tell you.(CROSSTALK)KELLY: No, no, no. Hold on. Hold on. We can do more of this later. Mr. Trump, hi.TRUMP: Hello.KELLY: How are you doing?TRUMP: Nice to be with you, Megyn.KELLY: Great to have you here.TRUMP: You\u2019re looking well. You\u2019re looking well.KELLY: As are you.(APPLAUSE)Back in January, you gave an off-the-record interview to the New York Times. It was apparently audiotaped. Now, a recent report in Buzzfeed citing sources at the Times reports that in that interview you expressed flexibility when it comes to your immigration policy, specifically with respect to your promise to deport the 11 million people who are now living here illegally. You have suggested that you may have expressed some flexibility when it comes to the size of the wall that you want to build. But did you tell them, specifically, that you are flexible when it comes to your deportation plan?TRUMP: I don\u2019t know exactly what \u2014 when you talk about off the record. First of all, Buzzfeed? They were the ones that said under no circumstances will I run for president. And were they wrong. But a lot of people said that.Then, I did have a meeting with the editorial board of the New York Times, a very nice meeting. Many of those things were off the record, I think at their suggestion and my suggestion. And I think being off the record is a very important thing. I think it\u2019s a very, very powerful thing.And I will say this. These three gentlemen have gone off the record many times with reporters. And I think they want to honor it, and I would always honor that.I will say, though, in terms of immigration \u2014 and almost anything else \u2014 there always has to be some, you know, tug and pull and deal. And, you know, when I watch Ted stand on the Senate floor, I had great respect for what he did. He stood there for a day-and-a- half or something. In the meantime, what came of it? Nothing. You have to be able to have some flexibility, some negotiation.Now, sometimes you ask for more than you want and you negotiate down to the point. I may have discussed something like that with the New York Times, but I would never release off-the-record conversations. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s fair, frankly, to do that to anybody.KELLY: How flexible are you on this issue?(AUDIENCE BOOS)TRUMP: Not very flexible. No, not very flexible. I give the example \u2014 I\u2019m going to build a wall. I\u2019m the one that wants the wall. I\u2019m the one that can build the wall.(APPLAUSE)It\u2019s going to get built. And by the way, Mexico is going to pay for the wall. I can tell you that. Mexico is going to pay for the wall.(APPLAUSE)But \u2014 and I used an example. And this isn\u2019t necessarily what was said, but whatever was said, the wall\u2019s 50 feet high. Is it going to be 45 feet or 40 feet? That could very well be. That could very well \u2014 he wants it to be higher.(LAUGHTER)That could very well be. But there\u2019s always give and take. There\u2019s always negotiation. And the best negotiator that knows what he\u2019s doing will make a great deal. But we need give and take in government. If you don\u2019t have give and take, you\u2019re never going to agree on anything.(APPLAUSE)KELLY: Senator Rubio, you not only supported the failed immigration reform effort through the Gang of Eight, but you\u2019re still on record as favoring an eventual path to citizenship for those who are here illegally. And in addition...(AUDIENCE BOOS)... you favored in-state tuition for Florida illegal immigrants. You\u2019ve been hitting Mr. Trump hard on this flexibility discussion with the New York Times, but his supporters might say at least his opening stance was tough.RUBIO: Well, first of all, let me say that on the issue of the off-the-record, that\u2019s not up to the New York Times. That\u2019s up to you, Donald. If tonight you tell the New York Times to release the audio, they will do it, and we can exactly see what your true views are on immigration...TRUMP: Fine (ph).RUBIO: ... because it is a major issue, in your campaign that you\u2019ve made a center issue. Now, as far as my record on it is concerned, I absolutely want to solve this issue. And I did the best we could in a Senate that was controlled by liberal Democrats and Harry Reid in the hopes that the House, made up of conservatives, would take it up and make it even stronger. And I said that repeatedly at the time.I\u2019m not just saying that now; I said it throughout that process. We do need to do with this issue. (AUDIENCE BOOS)RUBIO: When I\u2019m president it will not be dealt with the way it was done in the Senate.It will be done first and foremost by bringing illegal immigration under control and proving it to the American people. And only after that is done can anything else happen.And it will be something the American people support. We\u2019ll see what they are willing to support. It\u2019s not going to be an executive order and we\u2019re not going to ram it down their throats.KELLY: Mr. Trump, we will let respond, but will you release the tapes? Will you authorize of The Times to release the tapes?TRUMP: I will say one thing, what Marco said is \u2014 I understand it. He is talking about a little give and take and a little negotiation. And you know what? That\u2019s OK. That\u2019s not the worst thing in the world.There is nothing wrong with that. I happen to be much stronger on illegal immigration. Sheriff Joe Arpaio endorsed me. And if he endorses you, believe me, you are the strongest, from Arizona.But give and take is OK. And I thought what he said is OK. We may differ on the degree. But what he said to me is OK.KELLY: Will you release the tapes?TRUMP: No. I never do that. I would not do that. I don\u2019t think \u2014 I have too much respect \u2014 if I deal with you off the record, if I deal with Bret or Chris off the record, I have too much respect for that process to say, just release everything. I would not do that.KELLY: OK. Stand by. We\u2019re going to continue this right after the break. We have more.BAIER: Coming up, more with Megyn on immigration, plus questions on other top issues, including the war on terror. The \u201cFOX News Republican Presidential Debate Live from Detroit\u201d continues after a quick break.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)KELLY: Welcome back everybody to the FOX News Republican presidential debate, live from the FOX theater here in Detroit. Let\u2019s get back now to the questions.Mr. Trump, your campaign website to this day argues that more visas for highly skilled workers would, quote, \u201cdecimate American workers\u201d. However, at the CNBC debate, you spoke enthusiastically in favor of these visas. So, which is it?TRUMP: I\u2019m changing. I\u2019m changing. We need highly skilled people in this country, and if we can\u2019t do it, we\u2019ll get them in. But, and we do need in Silicon Valley, we absolutely have to have.So, we do need highly skilled, and one of the biggest problems we have is people go to the best colleges. They\u2019ll go to Harvard, they\u2019ll go to Stanford, they\u2019ll go to Wharton, as soon as they\u2019re finished they\u2019ll get shoved out. They want to stay in this country. They want to stay here desperately, they\u2019re not able to stay here. For that purpose, we absolutely have to be able to keep the brain power in this country.(APPLAUSE)KELLY: So you abandoning the position on your website...TRUMP: ... I\u2019m changing it, and I\u2019m softening the position because we have to have talented people in this country.KELLY: And you\u2019re not releasing the discussion with the New York Times behind closed doors...TRUMP: ... That is correct.KELLY: Which will have some asking whether, on your immigration policies, you\u2019re really just playing to people\u2019s fantasies, which is a tactic...TRUMP: ... No, I\u2019m not playing.KELLY: ... you praised in your book, The Art of the Deal.TRUMP: I\u2019m not playing to anybody\u2019s fantasies, I\u2019m playing to the fact that our country is in trouble, that we have a tremendous problem with crime. The border is a disaster, it\u2019s like a piece of Swiss cheese. We\u2019re going to stop it, we\u2019re going to stop people from coming into our country illegally. We\u2019re going to stop it.(APPLAUSE) (CHEERING)KELLY: Senator Cruz, not long ago you propose quintupling the number of these foreign worker visas. After you announced for president, you reversed yourself, citing reports that the program was being abused. But, that abuse had been around long before your 180. In fact, it was so bad that just a few months earlier that a bipartisan group of senators called for an investigation and you declined to join them.Isn\u2019t it a good thing that the American public didn\u2019t trust Ted on that one?CRUZ: Well, the abuse of the H1-B program has been rampant. On the face of that H1-B abuse, I have proposed, and promised as president that I will impose a 180 day moratorium on the H1B program to implement a comprehensive investigation and audit because you got U.S. companies that are firing American workers, bringing in foreign workers, and forcing them to train their replacements.And, I would note that is not dissimilar to what we discovered at the last debate concerning the hotel that Donald owns down in Florida. Down in Florida that hotel has brought in hundreds of foreign workers, and afterwards it was really striking.I watched the CNN interview Donald did where he explained, he said, well the problem is you can\u2019t find Americans who are qualified, or who want to work as waiters and waitresses. Now, let me ask the people here, how many people have worked as a waiter or waitress?(APPLAUSE)CRUZ: Millions across this country. That is an astonishing statement. You know, Marco\u2019s Dad started as a bartender. My Dad started washing dishes, and yet, you know how many Americans wanted those jobs?(BELL RINGING)CRUZ: Roughly 300 applied, Donald hired 17. And, that\u2019s why this New York Times tape is so troubling because what\u2019s been reported is that Donald told the Editorial Board of the New York Times what I\u2019m saying on immigration, I don\u2019t believe. I\u2019m not going to build a wall, I\u2019m not going to deport people, this is all just rhetoric for the voters.Now, if he didn\u2019t say that, he has an easy solution. Simply release the tape.But, for everyone at home who\u2019s mad at politicians that lied to us, Donald\u2019s record right now as he standing here...KELLY: ... OK.CRUZ: ... His record right now is one of repeatedly hiring illegal aliens...KELLY: ... Times up, sir...CRUZ: ... abusing (ph) American workers...KELLY: ... Go ahead, Mr. Trump.TRUMP: First of all I\u2019ve had tens of thousands of people working for me, most of which are \u2014 98, 97, 98 percent of the people in this country, from this country. I\u2019m very proud of it. You have a club in Palm Beach, Florida called the Mar-a-Lago Club, it\u2019s a very, very successful club. It has a very short season, it\u2019s called, the Season, and it goes from November until March.It\u2019s a few months, five months at the most. People don\u2019t want a short-term job. They don\u2019t want \u2014 so, we will bring people in, and we will send the people out. All done legally, all done with the process that\u2019s...(BELL RINGING)TRUMP: ... Approved by government in Palm Beach, or West Palm Beach. We bring people in, we bring them out. We want to hire as many Americans as we can, but they don\u2019t want part-time, very short part-time jobs.KELLY: Understood. Thank you.RUBIO: That\u2019s not accurate. I\u2019m sorry, Megyn, that\u2019s not accurate. That\u2019s my \u2014 there were at least 300 Americans that applied last year, none of them were hired. Some of them...TRUMP: ... Wrong...RUBIO: ... have been interviewed...TRUMP: ... That\u2019s wrong.RUBIO: ... They were not hired...TRUMP: ... Wrong...RUBIO: ... And, here\u2019s why he does it this way, let me explain why he (INAUDIBLE) H2-B...TRUMP: ... Wrong...RUBIO: ... Because when you bring them in this way, when you bring someone in on one of these visas they can\u2019t go work for anybody else. They either work for you or they have to go back home. You basically have them captive, so you don\u2019t have to worry about competing for higher wages with another hotel down the street. And, that\u2019s why you bring workers from abroad.You argue that you\u2019re here to fight on behalf of the American worker, but when you have chances to help the American worker... (BELL RINGING)...RUBIO: ... but when you have chances to help the American workers, you\u2019re making your clothes overseas and you\u2019re hiring your workers from overseas.(APPLAUSE)KELLY: Go ahead, sir.TRUMP: The \u2014 the \u2014 the other hotels during the season, they do the same thing. They take in a lot of people, because you can\u2019t get them. They take in a lot of people. Long-term employees, we don\u2019t do that, but short-term employees, we have no choice but to do it, and other hotels in that very, very hot area. It is a very hot area.RUBIO: There were Americans in that hot area.TRUMP: It\u2019s very, very hard to get people. But other hotels do the exact same thing. And just so you understand, just again, this is a legal process. This is a procedure. It\u2019s part of the law. I take advantage of that. There\u2019s nothing wrong with it. We have no choice.KELLY: All right.CRUZ: Donald, you could resolve this issue very quickly by simply...(AUDIENCE BOOS)... releasing the New York Times tape. Because, listen, maybe it\u2019s right.TRUMP: This wasn\u2019t on the subject.CRUZ: ... that you didn\u2019t tell them you\u2019re misleading the American people. If that\u2019s the case...TRUMP: Tapes were not on the subject, but that\u2019s...CRUZ: If you didn\u2019t tell them that, the tapes will prove you\u2019re innocent.KELLY: OK.CRUZ: But if, in fact, you went to Manhattan and said I\u2019m lying to the American people, then the voters have a right to know.TRUMP: No, no. You\u2019re the liar. You\u2019re the lying guy up here.(CROSSTALK)CRUZ: Because we\u2019ve been lied to too many times.TRUMP: You\u2019re the \u2014 you\u2019re the one. You\u2019re the one.CRUZ: Why don\u2019t you release the tapes? Release the tapes.TRUMP: You\u2019re the one. Now, let me just tell you. Let me just tell you.(CROSSTALK)TRUMP: Excuse me. Excuse me. I\u2019ve given my answer, Lyin\u2019 Ted. I\u2019ve given my answer.KELLY: All right. Let\u2019s leave it at that.(AUDIENCE BOOS)Let\u2019s leave it at that. We have more to get to.(AUDIENCE BOOS)BAIER: Gentlemen, the next topic to discuss is terrorism. Senator Rubio, ISIS is a big topic of conversation on Facebook. We have a map that shows the conservation about ISIS around the country. You proposed sending a larger number of American ground troops to help defeat ISIS in Syria and Iraq...RUBIO: That\u2019s correct, and Libya.BAIER: ... but military commanders say the biggest ISIS threat to Europe in particular now is coming from Libya, not Syria.RUBIO: Correct.BAIER: So just to be clear, if you\u2019re for putting more U.S. ground troops in Iraq and Syria, are you also ready to send U.S. ground troops on the ground in Libya?RUBIO: Well, Bret, what I\u2019ve argued from the very beginning is ISIS \u2014 in order to defeat ISIS, you must deny them operating spaces. This is how ISIS or any radical group, for that matter, can grow. It\u2019s how Al Qaida was able to carry out 9/11, is that the Taliban gave them an operating space in Afghanistan.Today that operating space has largely been based in Iraq and Syria, but I\u2019ve been warning about the Libyan presence for the better part of two years. So they need to be targeted wherever they have an operating space. They do need to be defeated on the ground by a ground force made up primarily of Sunni Arabs themselves. This is a radical Sunni movement. They can only be defeated if they are driven out and the territory is held by Sunni Arabs. But it will require a specific number of American special operators, in combination with an increase in air strikes. And that will include, if necessary, operating spaces in Libya, which, in fact, they are using to project into the Sinai against Egypt and ultimately into Europe, as well.BAIER: Governor Kasich, would you put ground troops in Libya?KASICH: Well, first of all, just to be clear, not only did I serve for 18 years on the Defense Committee, more than anybody on this stage, but, secondly, I was called into the Pentagon after 9/11 to help Secretary Rumsfeld with some of his difficulties.I will say, look, let me tell you what happened with Libya. And I pointed out in the last debate \u2014 Hillary Clinton worked aggressively to depose Moammar Gadhafi. We had no business doing it. He was working with us. He was cooperating with us. He denuclearized. And now they pushed him out, and now we have a fertile ground for ISIS.Fortunately in Libya, there\u2019s only a few cities on the coast, because most of Libya is a desert. The fact of the matter is, we absolutely have to be \u2014 and not just with special forces. I mean, that\u2019s not going to work. Come on. You\u2019ve got to go back to the invasion when we pushed Saddam Hussein out of Kuwait. We have to be there on the ground in significant numbers. We do have to include our Muslim Arab friends to work with us on that. And we have to be in the air.And we \u2014 it should be a broad coalition, made up of the kinds of people that were involved when we defeated Saddam. Now, you\u2019ve got to be on the ground and in the air both in Syria and Iraq. And at some point, we will have to deal with Libya. I am very concerned about ISIS getting their hands on the oilfields in Libya and being able to fund their operations. The fact is cool, calm, deliberate, effective, take care of the job, and then come home. That\u2019s what we need to do with our military foreign policy.(APPLAUSE)BAIER: Mr. Trump, just yesterday, almost 100 foreign policy experts signed on to an open letter refusing to support you, saying your embracing expansive use of torture is inexcusable. General Michael Hayden, former CIA director, NSA director, and other experts have said that when you asked the U.S. military to carry out some of your campaign promises, specifically targeting terrorists\u2019 families, and also the use of interrogation methods more extreme than waterboarding, the military will refuse because they\u2019ve been trained to turn down and refuse illegal orders.So what would you do, as commander-in-chief, if the U.S. military refused to carry out those orders?TRUMP: They won\u2019t refuse. They\u2019re not going to refuse me. Believe me.BAIER: But they\u2019re illegal.TRUMP: Let me just tell you, you look at the Middle East. They\u2019re chopping off heads. They\u2019re chopping off the heads of Christians and anybody else that happens to be in the way. They\u2019re drowning people in steel cages. And he \u2014 now we\u2019re talking about waterboarding.This really started with Ted, a question was asked of Ted last \u2014 two debates ago about waterboarding. And Ted was, you know, having a hard time with that question, to be totally honest with you. They then came to me, what do you think of waterboarding? I said it\u2019s fine. And if we want to go stronger, I\u2019d go stronger, too, because, frankly...(APPLAUSE)... that\u2019s the way I feel. Can you imagine \u2014 can you imagine these people, these animals over in the Middle East, that chop off heads, sitting around talking and seeing that we\u2019re having a hard problem with waterboarding? We should go for waterboarding and we should go tougher than waterboarding. That\u2019s my opinion.BAIER: But targeting terrorists\u2019 families?(APPLAUSE)TRUMP: And \u2014 and \u2014 and \u2014 I\u2019m a leader. I\u2019m a leader. I\u2019ve always been a leader. I\u2019ve never had any problem leading people. If I say do it, they\u2019re going to do it. That\u2019s what leadership is all about.BAIER: Even targeting terrorists\u2019 families?TRUMP: Well, look, you know, when a family flies into the World Trade Center, a man flies into the World Trade Center, and his family gets sent back to where they were going \u2014 and I think most of you know where they went \u2014 and, by the way, it wasn\u2019t Iraq \u2014 but they went back to a certain territory, they knew what was happening. The wife knew exactly what was happening.They left two days early, with respect to the World Trade Center, and they went back to where they went, and they watched their husband on television flying into the World Trade Center, flying into the Pentagon, and probably trying to fly into the White House, except we had some very, very brave souls on that third plane. All right?(APPLAUSE)BAIER: Senator Cruz, you were mentioned.TRUMP: I have no problem with it.BAIER: Senator Cruz?CRUZ: Bret, you know, I think the American people understand that yelling and cursing at people doesn\u2019t make you a tough guy. We need a commander-in-chief that, number one, will rebuild the military, just like Ronald Reagan did in 1981 coming out of the weak Jimmy Carter administration. He passed tax reform and regulatory reform. The economy took off. It generated millions in high-paying jobs, trillions in new revenue. He rebuilt the military, bankrupted the Soviet Union, and won the Cold War.As president, I will do the exact same thing with radical Islamic terrorism. We will rebuild this military so that it remains the mightiest fighting force on the face of the planet. And then, when I am commander-in-chief, every militant on the face of the Earth will understand that if they go and join ISIS, if they wage jihad against the United States of America, they are signing their death warrant.(APPLAUSE)BAIER: But, Senator Cruz, in 2013, you said you were open \u2014 you were open to the possibility that Edward Snowden had performed a considerable public service, you said back then, in revealing certain aspects of the NSA procedures. Many of your colleagues in the Senate, including Senator Rubio, called him a traitor. It took you until January of this year to call him a traitor and say he should be tried for treason. Why the change of heart? And why did it take you so long?CRUZ: Well, Bret, as someone who spent much of his life in law enforcement, I believe you should start with the facts and evidence first before ending up with the verdict. When the news first broke of the United States government engaging in massive surveillance on American citizens, that was a very troubling development, and it\u2019s why the United States Congress acted to correct it.Now, at the same time, I said in that initial statement that if the evidence indicated that Edward Snowden violated the law, he should be prosecuted for violating the law. And, indeed, since then, the evidence is clear that not only does Snowden violate the law, but it appears he committed treason. Treason is defined under the Constitution as giving aid and comfort to the enemies of America, and what Snowden did made it easier for terrorists to avoid detection.And Snowden\u2019s comments afterwards, and his behavior afterwards, he fled to Russia, he fled to China. His conducts afterwards indicates that he was not a whistleblower, but instead he was undermining the ability to defend this country. But we need a president who isn\u2019t rash, who doesn\u2019t just pop off at the \u2014 at the hip, but waits to see what the facts are and then acts to defend this country.(APPLAUSE)BAIER: Mr. Trump, you\u2019ve repeatedly deflected calls for specific national security or defense policy plans with the claim that you\u2019ll ask the best people when you become president, and take their advice.So who are the best people? Can you reveal two or three names that you trust for national security?TRUMP: I think Richard Haass is excellent. I have a lot of respect for him. I think General Keane is excellent. I think that there are \u2014 I like Colonel Jacobs very much. I see him. I know him. I have many people that I think are really excellent but in the end it\u2019s going to be my decision.When you just asked the question about Snowden, I will tell you right from the beginning, I said he was a spy and we should get him back. And if Russia respected our country, they would have sent him back immediately, but he was a spy. It didn\u2019t take me a long time to figure that one out. Believe me.But I would get the best people, people that I\u2019d be comfortable with. And we will do the right thing.KASICH: Bret, it\u2019s very interesting to note, I think it\u2019s for the good of the record here that they took a survey of foreign policy magazines, 700 foreign policy experts, who would be the best person to conduct foreign policy of all the candidates in the race?I received 55 percent of the vote. Jeb Bush received 30 percent of the vote. And everybody else, none of them made double digits. And that\u2019s because you have to have the experience.And you know, we hear about Ronald Reagan rebuilding the military. I was there when Ronald Reagan rebuilt the military. I worked with him. I was there when Ronald Reagan rebuilt the economy. I was there, and I worked with him. I knew Ronald Reagan.And I\u2019ll leave it right there with what comes after that. You can figure that one out.BAIER: Governor Kasich, thank you.KELLY: We\u2019re going to have more questions for the candidates right after this break. And during the commercial break, join us for a \u2014 Facebook live on the FOX News Facebook page and tell us what you think about tonight\u2019s debate in the comment section. (COMMERCIAL BREAK)BAIER: Welcome back to the historic Fox Theater in downtown Detroit and the Republican presidential debate. Let\u2019s get right back to the questions.KELLY: Mr. Trump, one of the things people love about you is they believe you tell it like it is. But time and time again in this campaign, you have actually told the voters one thing only to reverse yourself within weeks or even sometimes days. We\u2019ve teed up just three examples in a videotape, similar to those we used with Senator Rubio and Senator Cruz in the last debate. The first is on whether the war in Afghanistan was a mistake. Watch.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)CUOMO: What about in Afghanistan? Do you believe that American boots should stay on the ground in Afghanistan to stabilize the situation?TRUMP: We\u2019ve made a terrible mistake getting involved there in the first place. That thing will collapse about two seconds after they leave. Just as I said that Iraq was going to collapse after we leave.(UNKNOWN): About Afghanistan, you said we made a terrible mistake getting involved there in the first place.TRUMP: We made a mistake going into Iraq. I\u2019ve never said we made a mistake...(UNKNOWN): Our question was about Afghanistan. That day on October...TRUMP: Well, OK, I never said that.(UNKNOWN): ... was on Afghanistan.TRUMP: OK. Wouldn\u2019t matter. I never said it.(END VIDEO CLIP)KELLY: Next, on whether we should accept...TRUMP: Should I respond to that first?KELLY: Two more, and then you\u2019ll have the floor. Next on whether we should accept the Syrian refugees...TRUMP: You\u2019ll be here a long time.KELLY: On whether we should accept the Syrian refugees.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)O\u2019REILLY: Do you object to migrants who are getting out of the Middle East and North Africa? Do you object to them coming to the USA?TRUMP: I hate the concept of it, but on a humanitarian basis, with what\u2019s happening, you have to. It\u2019s living in Hell in Syria; there\u2019s no question about it. They\u2019re living in Hell.HANNITY: Are you saying absolutely people from Syria, the Middle East, should we allow any of them into this country?TRUMP: Look, from a humanitarian standpoint, I\u2019d love to help, but we have our own problems. We have so many problems that we have to solve.(END VIDEO CLIP)KELLY: Most recently, on whether President George W. Bush lied to get us into the Iraq war.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP: They lied. They said there were weapons of mass destruction; there were none. And they knew there were none.I don\u2019t know if he lied or not. He could have lied. Maybe he did. Maybe he didn\u2019t. I guess you\u2019d have to ask him.(END VIDEO CLIP)KELLY: And there are many other examples. So how is any of this \u201ctelling it like it is\u201d?TRUMP: Well, on Afghanistan, I did mean Iraq. I think you have to stay in Afghanistan for a while, because of the fact that you\u2019re right next to Pakistan, which has nuclear weapons, and we have to protect that. Nuclear weapons change the game.And I was always against going into Iraq. In fact, I \u2014 believe me, I was always against it. There was some cases where I sort of \u2014 in one interview with a great friend of mine, and yours, Howard Stern \u2014 said that \u2014 said that...(LAUGHTER)I said very meekly, long before we went in, I said very meekly, well, maybe, maybe, I don\u2019t know. By the time it got to that point, I was always against Iraq. But Afghanistan, I felt \u2014 and in that one, if you notice, I corrected it the second day. OK? Second question? KELLY: There are several examples, Mr. Trump.TRUMP: No, no. But...KELLY: We went through the Afghanistan being a mistake. Within one day, you reversed yourself on Syrian refugees.TRUMP: Now on \u2014 let me explain that. You\u2019re right. Let me explain. First time the question had been put to me, it was very early on. The migration had just started. And I had heard that the number was a very, very small number.By the second day, two or three days later, I heard the number was going to be thousands and thousands of people. You know, when they originally heard about it, they were talking about bringing very, very small numbers in.And I said, begrudgingly, well, I guess maybe that\u2019s OK. It was not like, \u201cLet\u2019s bring them in,\u201d because I think we should build a safe zone in \u2014 we should really \u2014 what we should be doing is building safe zones so they can stay in their own country and not go all over, and at least this way we\u2019re not going to have the problem. That\u2019s what we have to do.(APPLAUSE)But just \u2014 just to set \u2014 because I fully understand what you\u2019re asking. When I first heard the question, first time the question was ever asked to me, first time I really had known about the question, the migration had just started. I was very much like, OK, by the time I went back and studied it, and they were talking about bringing thousands and thousands, I changed my tune. And I don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything wrong with that.KELLY: But the point I\u2019m going for is you change your tune on so many things, and that has some people saying, what is his core?TRUMP: Megyn, I have a very strong core.(APPLAUSE)I have a very strong core. But I\u2019ve never seen a successful person who wasn\u2019t flexible, who didn\u2019t have a certain degree of flexibility. You have to have a certain degree of flexibility.(APPLAUSE)You can\u2019t \u2014 for instance, let\u2019s say, on \u2014 on the second question, you can\u2019t say it\u2019s OK, and then you find out it\u2019s not OK, and you don\u2019t want to do anything. You have to be flexible, because you learn. I mean, before I knew the question was asked by Bill, and the next day, or the couple of days later, the question was asked by, by \u2014 you know \u2014 I was asked by a number of people, actually. I was asked by Sean, but I was asked by a number of people. But by that time, the number had increased significantly.KELLY: Sean was the next day after Bill.TRUMP: The next day. But I had learned. I mean, nobody had ever asked me the question. This was brand new. But \u2014 and I really mean it. You have to show a degree of flexibility. If you\u2019re going to be one way and you think it\u2019s wrong, does that mean the rest of your life you have to go in the wrong direction because you don\u2019t want to change? (APPLAUSE)KASICH: Megyn.TRUMP: (INAUDIBLE)KELLY: Go ahead, Governor.KASICH: I did 200 meetings in New Hampshire, I don\u2019t know how many in Michigan now. In these townhalls people come in and they\u2019re very emotional meetings. And, you know what they really want to know? If somebody tells them something, can they believe it?And, the reason why people are so upset in this country is because politicians all the time tell them what they want to hear. And, they go to Washington, or they go to the state capital, wherever, and they don\u2019t deliver on those promises.You know, when I ran for Governor of Ohio, I said not only would we balance the budget, but we would cut taxes. People said that can\u2019t be done. I wouldn\u2019t have said it if I didn\u2019t believe it.We cut taxes in Ohio more than any governor in the country, and $5 billion dollars worth of tax cuts \u2014 we\u2019re not running a surplus in Ohio. But, you see, what\u2019s getting in the hearts and souls of the people is they want change, and they keep putting outsiders in to bring about the change, then the change doesn\u2019t come. Then they put more outsiders in because we\u2019re putting people in that don\u2019t understand compromise. They don\u2019t understand policy...(BELL RINGING)(APPLAUSE)KASICH: ... They\u2019re getting more and more frustrated with the system which is why we must pick somebody that has a record of achievement, not just talk.KELLY: OK.KASICH: Not just talk, but a record of achievement. That\u2019s how we\u2019ll restore credibility..RUBIO: ... This isn\u2019t just about flexibility.KELLY: Go ahead, Senator. RUBIO: There\u2019s a difference between flexibility and telling people whatever you think you need to say to get them to do what you want them to do.(CHEERING)RUBIO: And, that\u2019s what Donald has done throughout his career.TRUMP: (INAUDIBLE)RUBIO: Well, he did, and that\u2019s why Trump University...TRUMP: ... That\u2019s not right...RUBIO: ... Is so relevant here. I saw this video last week where he\u2019s sitting in front of a camera saying we\u2019re going to hire the best people, and I\u2019m going to hand pick them. There are going to be hand picked and instructors, the best instructors in the world. One of them, but the way, was the manager at a Buffalo Wild Wing. And, that\u2019s who they hired to do this, and people borrowed money, and they signed up for this fake university.And, these people owe all this money now, and they got nothing in return for it, but you are willing to say whatever you had to say...(BELL RINGING)RUBIO: ... To get them to give you their money...KELLY: ... Go ahead, Mr. Trump...TRUMP: ... We\u2019ll find out when we have the (INAUDIBLE)...RUBIO: ... And, we\u2019re not going to do that to our country...TRUMP: ... And, by the way, just so you understand...(APPLAUSE)TRUMP: ... This is a case I could have settled very easily, but I don\u2019t settle cases very easily when I\u2019m right. Ninety-eight percent approval rating, we have an \u201cA\u201d from the Better Business Bureau...RUBIO: ... That\u2019s false...TRUMP: ... We have a 98 percent approval rating from the people who took the course. We have an \u201cA\u201d from the Better Business Bureau. And, people like it. Now, he\u2019s saying they didn\u2019t learn.We have many, many people that will be witnesses. Again, I don\u2019t settle cases. I don\u2019t do it because that\u2019s why I don\u2019t get sued very often, because I don\u2019t settle, unlike a lot of other people.We have a situation where we will win in court...(BELL RINGING) TRUMP: But, many of the people that are witnesses did tremendously well, and made a lot of money...RUBIO: ... That\u2019s false...TRUMP: ... By taking the course.KELLY: Go ahead, Senator.TRUMP: You\u2019re going to see, you don\u2019t know...RUBIO: ... The Better Business Bureau gave it a \u201cD\u201d minus.TRUMP: You\u2019re going to see, you\u2019re going to see.KELLY: ... It\u2019s Senator Rubio\u2019s turn...TRUMP: ... No, no. Before they had the information...TRUMP: ... Before they had the information...KELLY: ... Senator Rubio, standby, let him finish his point, and then I\u2019ll give you the floor...TRUMP: ... Before they had the information it got \u2014 it is right now an \u201cA\u201d, once they had the information...RUBIO: ... (INAUDIBLE) this anymore.TRUMP: ... The only reason that is was a \u201cD\u201d was because we didn\u2019t care \u2014 we didn\u2019t give them the information...RUBIO: ... A third of the people (INAUDIBLE)...TRUMP: ... When they got the information it became an \u201cA\u201d...KELLY: ... With respect \u2014 wait. With respect...TRUMP: ... Marco you don\u2019t know (INAUDIBLE)...KELLY: ... With respect, we went back and looked at this...TRUMP: ... Yes.KELLY: The rating from the Better Business Bureau was a \u201cD\u201d minus...(CHEERING) (APPLAUSE) TRUMP: ... (INAUDIBLE)KELLY: ... that\u2019s the last publicly available rating in 2010, and it was the result of a number of complaints they had...The New York Times will be checking assertions made throughout the 2016 presidential campaign.TRUMP: ... But it was elevated to an \u201cA\u201d...UNIDENTIFIABLE MALE: (INAUDIBLE)KELLY: ... That\u2019s never been publicly available.TRUMP: ... I can give it to you. I can give it to you tomorrow..KELLY: ... Let\u2019s just bring the viewers up to speed, let\u2019s just bring the viewers up to speed.TRUMP: ... It was elevated to an \u201cA\u201d.KELLY: Let me just set the record, and then you guys can have at it. There was Trump University, which was a business that you started, and it was marketed...TRUMP: ... Small business...KELLY: ... to many people, and now there is a class-action of over 5,000 plaintiffs against you, Mr. Trump...TRUMP: ... Right...KELLY: ... And, it involves veterans, and it involves teachers, and it involves so-called little guys, working class, and lower- working class and middle class who say that they were fleeced, who say that it was as scam. The class has been certified, and in that case you counter-sued the lead plaintiff alleging that you were being defamed.That case was thrown out against her...TRUMP: ... The lead plaintiff is now getting out of the case because it\u2019s so bad for her...KELLY: ... But, what happened was...TRUMP: ... Excuse me, the lead plaintiff signed a letter saying how great it was, and it on tape saying how great it was.KELLY: OK, no, but \u2014 standby. But, what happened in that case was you counter-sued her. The court threw out your counter-suit, and made you pay almost $800,000 dollars in legal fees of hers, and you made the same argument about 98 percent of the people being happy with Trump University. And, that woman in particular signing a survey saying she liked it while someone was standing over her shoulder...TRUMP: ... She\u2019s trying to get out of the case. She\u2019s trying to get out of the case...KELLY: ... And this is what \u2014 standby, this is what the Court of Appeals found. They said that the plaintiffs against you are like the Madoff victims...TRUMP: Oh, give me a break... KELLy: ... This is what the Court of Appeals said.TRUMP: Give me a break.KELLY: This is what the court of appeals said.TRUMP: Give me a break.KELLY: They found that victims of con artists often sing the praises of their victimizers until they realize they have been fleeced.TRUMP: You know what, let\u2019s see what happens in court. This is a civil case. Very easy to have settled. Could settle it now. Very easy to have settled. Let\u2019s see what happens at the end of a couple years when this case is over, OK?KELLY: It has been going for five years.TRUMP: Yes, it has been going for a long time.KELLY: Go ahead, Senator.RUBIO: I spoke to one of the victims yesterday.TRUMP: We\u2019ll win the case.RUBIO: I spoke to one of the victims yesterday.TRUMP: One, one of the victims.RUBIO: No, there are several. Obviously there are so many, I can\u2019t talk to them every day. I spoke to one of them, he told me exactly what happened. They signed up for this course because they believed Mr. Trump was this fantastic businessman, that Donald is going to teach them the tricks of the trade.They signed up. They paid $15,000 for this course. They were asked for additional money for this course. If they really wanted the real secrets of success, they had to pay even more money, and so they did.And you know what they got in these courses? Stuff you can pull off of Zillow. When they finally realized what a scam it was, they asked for their money back.And you refused to give them their money back. Why don\u2019t you tonight...TRUMP: I gave many people their money back. RUBIO: Then why don\u2019t you tonight say you\u2019re going to give the money back to everybody who wants...TRUMP: Let me just...(CROSSTALK)KELLY: OK. Senator Rubio, let him answer.(CROSSTALK)KELLY: Let him answer.Go ahead, Mr. Trump.TRUMP: We will see who\u2019s right at the end of a few years. But all of the \u2014 almost all of the people, many, many people signed what\u2019s called the report card at the end, did you like the course, how did you like it.Almost all of them said it was terrific, OK? With letters, with this. Some of them are on tape saying it was terrific. Let\u2019s see what happens at the end of three years.KELLY: With respect, Mr. Trump, one-third of the plaintiffs in that case demanded refunds. So it\u2019s not the case that 98 percent were...TRUMP: I gave some refunds to people because if they asked for the refunds in a certain period of time, and we gave refunds to people.KELLY: OK.TRUMP: But let\u2019s see what happens at the end of three years. Let\u2019s see who\u2019s right.KELLY: Still a pending litigation.(CROSSTALK)TRUMP: It\u2019s called pending litigation.RUBIO: Megyn, this is why this is relevant to this election.KELLY: All right. Senator Rubio then Senator Cruz. Go ahead.RUBIO: This is why, because he\u2019s trying to do to the American voter what he did to the people that signed up for this course. He\u2019s making promises he has no intention of keeping. And it won\u2019t just be $36,000 that they lose, it\u2019s our country that\u2019s at stake here.The future of the United States and the most important election in a generation, and he\u2019s trying to con people into giving them their vote just like he conned these people into giving him their money. TRUMP: Let me tell you the real con artist. Excuse me. Excuse me. The real con artist is Senator Marco Rubio who was elected in Florida and who has the worst voting record in the United States Senate.He doesn\u2019t go to vote. He\u2019s absent. He doesn\u2019t go. Now, the people of Florida can\u2019t stand him. He couldn\u2019t get elected dogcatcher. The people of Florida \u2014 the people of Florida \u2014 and by the way, I know he\u2019s going to spend $25 million on ads. Without that he wouldn\u2019t have a chance. He\u2019s 20 points south.The people in Florida wouldn\u2019t elect him dogcatcher. He couldn\u2019t get any \u2014 he\u2019s right now 21 points down to me. And, you know...KELLY: OK.TRUMP: ... again, there will be a lot of advertising. It\u2019s the only thing that might save him. But I doubt it.RUBIO: Notice that\u2019s not an answer.KELLY: I\u2019m coming to you next. But go ahead.(CROSSTALK)TRUMP: He scammed the people of Florida. He scammed people. He doesn\u2019t vote. He doesn\u2019t show up for the U.S. Senate. He doesn\u2019t vote. He scammed the people. He defrauded the people of Florida.KELLY: With respect, you\u2019ve made that point.Go ahead.RUBIO: There\u2019s no \u2014 as you can see in his answer, it\u2019s always the same thing.TRUMP: You defrauded the people of Florida, little Marco.RUBIO: He has defrauding people out of things, and not just \u2014 and not just, by the way, on the issue of Trump University. He had another development in Mexico that he had nothing to do with except his name on the building. People put money into that building.TRUMP: That was licensing.RUBIO: They lost their money. Yes, licensing, but you told them you owned the building. So they gave him his money. They lost their money. Time and again...KELLY: All right. Stand by. I will come back to you. Senator Cruz wants to weigh in. You\u2019re coming back.Go ahead.CRUZ: Megyn, let me ask the voters at home, is this the debate you want playing out in the general election? The stakes in this election are too high. For seven years, millions of Americans, we\u2019ve been struggling, wages have been stagnating, people are hurting, our constitutional rights are under assault.And if we nominate Donald, we\u2019re going to spend the spring, the fall, and the summer with the Republican nominee facing a fraud trial...TRUMP: Oh, stop it.CRUZ: ... with Hillary Clinton saying...TRUMP: It\u2019s just a minor case. It\u2019s a minor case.CRUZ: ... why did you give my campaign and my foundation $100,000?TRUMP: It\u2019s a minor civil case.CRUZ: And with Hillary Clinton...TRUMP: Give me a break.CRUZ: ... pointing out that he supported her four times in her presidential race.TRUMP: It\u2019s a minor civil case.CRUZ: Donald, learn not to interrupt. It\u2019s not complicated.TRUMP: There are many, many civil cases.CRUZ: Count to 10, Donald. Count to 10.TRUMP: Give me a break.CRUZ: Count to 10. The stakes are too high and if you are one of the 65 to 70 percent of Republicans who recognize that nominating Donald would be a disaster, then I ask you to come join us. If you\u2019re supporting other candidates, come join us.We welcome you to our team because we\u2019ve demonstrated not once, not twice, not three times, but five separate times we have beat Donald. And if you don\u2019t want him to be the nominee, then I ask you to stand with us as a broad coalition of people who believe in the Constitution, believe in freedom, and want to turn this country around.KELLY: Go ahead, Mr. Trump.TRUMP: I don\u2019t believe these politicians. All talk, no action. I\u2019m standing here listening to \u2014 I\u2019m hearing him say about a percentage. CNN, he gets 15. That means 85 percent, based on what you\u2019re saying, of the people don\u2019t dig you, number one, number one. Is that a correct statement? How do you get \u2014 are you at 15 in the new CNN poll? Do you believe in CNN? I mean, I know we\u2019re with FOX. But CNN spent \u2014 CNN...CRUZ: All right, I\u2019ll respond...(CROSSTALK)TRUMP: CNN spent a lot of money on a poll, just came out. I\u2019m at 49. He\u2019s at 15. He tells me about 65 percent of the people. It\u2019s not 65 percent of the people. If you go by that, 85 percent of the people.Then he goes, we have five. And \u2014 well, excuse me, I won 10. I won 10 states. If you listen to him, it\u2019s like \u2014 I won 10 states. Everybody knows that on Super Tuesday Trump was the winner. There wasn\u2019t one person that didn\u2019t say that. Even the two people on your left and right said we did a great job. So how does he take \u2014 how does he take five and say it\u2019s better than 10?KELLY: Go ahead, Senator.TRUMP: I am by far the leader. But if you listen to a politician, he\u2019ll try and convince you otherwise.KELLY: Senator Cruz, go.CRUZ: All right, well, Donald lives by the polls every day. He tweets about the polls.TRUMP: No, I don\u2019t. No, I don\u2019t.CRUZ: He\u2019s told us to look to the CNN poll. Well, that\u2019s a very good poll to look to, because that CNN poll showed that head to head Donald Trump loses to Hillary Clinton by 8 points. He doesn\u2019t just lose close; he loses by 8 points. That same poll he told you to look at shows me beating Hillary Clinton.(APPLAUSE)We cannot mess this up. And, by the way, the last four polls in a row, when you nominate a candidate who literally has been on every side of every issue, and in the course of this debate may be on two other sides before we\u2019re done, that\u2019s not how you win. And the stakes are too high. (CROSSTALK)KELLY: All right. I\u2019m going to let Mr. Trump \u2014 I\u2019m going to let \u2014 let me just...TRUMP: According to your poll...(CROSSTALK)KELLY: I\u2019m going to let you respond to that, Mr. Trump. I\u2019m going to then go to you, Governor. You\u2019re up next.TRUMP: ... I know, but your recent polls have me beating Hillary Clinton, and very, very easily.KELLY: OK. Do you want to weigh in?KASICH: All right, look, honestly, when I see people at these meetings, these town halls, where we take massive questions, and I get to spend time with them. Last night, there was a woman that came to tell me about the loss of her 15-year-old son, who took his own life.See, there\u2019s people in this country \u2014 and Ted\u2019s right \u2014 their wages haven\u2019t gone up for so long, they see the rich get richer, they believe, and they\u2019re not moving. And they put their money in the bank, and they got no interest on their money. They receive none. And their sons or daughters are living in the basement because they can\u2019t get a good job after they rang up so much college debt.What people are hungry for is, who can fix this? People want to know who \u2014 what can you do to solve the problems in Washington, to make sure that we have stronger job growth and better wages? But you know what else they\u2019re yearning for? They want to believe that they have the power to fix things where they live, and they want the power back, so they can begin to do things in their community.Now, listen, this has been going on for a long time here. And I appreciate the discussion back and forth. But there are a lot of people out there yearning for somebody who\u2019s going to bring America back, both at the leadership level and in the neighborhood, where we can begin to reignite the spirit of the United States of America. And let\u2019s stop fighting.(APPLAUSE)KELLY: Governor, thank you. Gentlemen, thank you.WALLACE: Much more to come live from the Fox Theater, including where the candidates stand on the social issues facing the country. The Republican presidential debate continues in a moment.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)KELLY: Welcome back, everybody, to the Fox News Republican presidential debate. We want to get right back to the questions.(APPLAUSE)BAIER: We are here in Detroit. The top issues in Michigan, according to Facebook, are displayed in a word cloud you\u2019re taking a look at. The second biggest issue is clean water. That, of course, is directly tied with the situation in Flint.Senator Rubio, Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton have both been to Flint. They are both running ads in this state focusing on that, focusing on supporting Flint and fixing the problems, showing images of people in Flint thankful that they\u2019re there.Without getting into the political blame game here, where are the national Republicans\u2019 plans on infrastructure and solving problems like this? If you talk to people in this state, they are really concerned about Flint on both sides of the aisle. So why haven\u2019t GOP candidates done more or talked more about this?RUBIO: Well, I know I\u2019ve talked about it, and others in our campaign have talked about it, and other candidates have talked about it, as well. What happened in Flint was a terrible thing. It was systemic breakdown at every level of government, at both the federal and partially the \u2014 both the state and partially at the federal level, as well.And by the way, the politicizing of it I think is unfair, because I don\u2019t think that someone woke up one morning and said, \u201cLet\u2019s figure out how to poison the water system to hurt someone.\u201d(APPLAUSE)But accountability is important. I will say, I give the governor credit. He took responsibility for what happened. And he\u2019s talked about people being held accountable...(APPLAUSE)... and the need for change, with Governor Snyder. But here\u2019s the point. This should not be a partisan issue. The way the Democrats have tried to turn this into a partisan issue, that somehow Republicans woke up in the morning and decided, \u201cOh, it\u2019s a good idea to poison some kids with lead.\u201d It\u2019s absurd. It\u2019s outrageous. It isn\u2019t true.(APPLAUSE)All of us are outraged by what happened. And we should work together to solve it. And there is a proper role for the government to play at the federal level, in helping local communities to respond to a catastrophe of this kind, not just to deal with the people that have been impacted by it, but to ensure that something like this never happens again.BAIER: Thank you, Senator.(APPLAUSE)KELLY: Governor Kasich, the city of Detroit has long suffered with urban blight, broken street lights, dilapidated and vacant houses, and so on. In 2013, Detroit actually declared bankruptcy, which helped, but the schools here remain a big problem. They\u2019re $3.5 billion in debt and are some of the most troubled and poorly testing in the country. The kids too often go to classrooms that are unsafe, falling apart, infested with rodents and insects. Experts say the schools could go bankrupt by next month.Question to you. If the federal government bailed out the auto industry here in Detroit, should it also bail out the Detroit schools?KASICH: Well, look, first of all, I think the mayor now is controlling the schools. This is not much different than what happened in Cleveland, Ohio, where the African-American Democrat mayor, the union, and business leaders came to see me and said, \u201cWould you help us to pass legislation to really create a CEO environment so that we can take control of the schools?\u201dWe even invested in a buyout plan, where we bought out the teachers who had been there a long time, because there were so many young teachers who had been laid off who were so enthusiastic to get back in the schools. It worked beautifully. Cleveland\u2019s coming back. The Cleveland schools are coming back because of a major overhaul.It\u2019s the same thing that has to happen in all of our urban schools. And, frankly, look, if I were president, I\u2019d take 104 federal programs, bundle them into four buckets, and send it to the states, because fixing schools rests at the state and the local level, and particularly at the school board level. (APPLAUSE)KASICH: Now, I also believe \u2014 I also believe that you need to introduce vocational education in those schools. You need mentoring in those schools. And you need to have a situation where people can have an alternative forum to get a degree. And you need school choice, both vouchers and charter schools. All of those things can come together to help, Megyn.But here\u2019s the bottom line. And I\u2019ll go quickly. We as adults have to fight in our neighborhoods, in our communities, for our children\u2019s education. Put the politics aside, and everyone in this room can play a role in lifting their schools and lifting the students who are in those schools, because too much politics gets in the middle of it, and where we focus as adults, and put children first, we see tremendous results. And the people of this town are going to rise. And they need to be involved. Thank you.(APPLAUSE)WALLACE: For \u2014 for half a century, as you all know, Detroit was the symbol of America\u2019s industrial might: 300,000 manufacturing jobs in this city. At last count, there are now fewer than 30,000 manufacturing jobs here, and the unemployment rate in this city is 11 percent, twice the national average.Senator Cruz, I know that you have general plans for tax reform, but what specifically would you do to bring manufacturing jobs back to America and train residents of cities like Detroit to do those jobs?CRUZ: Well, Chris, thank you for that question. Let me start by observing that Detroit is a great city with a magnificent legacy that has been utterly decimated by 60 years of failed left-wing policy.(APPLAUSE)You know, Henry Ford revolutionized automobile manufacturing and brought automobiles to the middle class. During World War II, Detroit provided \u2014 funded the arsenals of democracy to help us win World War II. In \u2014 in the 1960s, Detroit was the Silicon Valley of America. It had a population of 2 million people, had the highest per capita income in the country.And then, for 50 years, left-wing Democrats have pursued destructive tax policies, weak crime policies, and have driven the citizens out. (APPLAUSE)This city now has just 700,000 citizens. There are vacant homes, one after the other after the other. Crime has been rampant, and it is an outrage. And let me say to folks in the media: That is a story that the media ought to be telling over and over again, the destruction of left-wing policies and the millions who have hurt because of it.(APPLAUSE)WALLACE: Well, I was going to say, I\u2019ll give you 30 seconds to try to answer my question. What specifically would you do to bring manufacturing jobs back to Detroit and to train the residents here to do those jobs?CRUZ: The way you bring manufacturing back to America is, number one, you lift the regulations. As president, I will repeal Obamacare, the biggest job-killer in America.I will pull back the federal regulators, the EPA and all the regulators that are killing small businesses and manufacturing.What that will do, Chris, is bring millions of manufacturing jobs back to this country, bring the steel industry back to this country, create an environment where when we compete on a fair and level playing field, American ingenuity can beat anyone. But right now, the federal government isn\u2019t giving us a level playing field.WALLACE: Thank you, Senator.(APPLAUSE)BAIER: Gentlemen, the next series of questions will be on social issues. Governor Kasich, the last debate, you were asked a question about religious liberty, in a hypothetical situation where a same-sex couple approaches a cupcake maker to do their wedding. Here\u2019s what you said.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)KASICH: If you\u2019re in the business of selling things, if you\u2019re not going to sell to somebody you don\u2019t agree with, today I\u2019m not going to sell to somebody who\u2019s gay, then tomorrow maybe I won\u2019t sell to somebody who\u2019s divorced.(END VIDEO CLIP)BAIER: Governor, some faith leaders got nervous about that answer. Do gay marriage dissenters have rights?KASICH: Well, look, first of all, I try to be a man of faith every day as best as I can, and I try to focus in my faith on the dos and I think the don\u2019ts will take care of themselves once I get the dos right, which is humility, and loving my enemy, and caring for my neighbor.But secondly, look, you\u2019re in the commerce business, you want to sell somebody a cupcake, great. OK? But now if they ask you to participate in something you really don\u2019t like, that\u2019s a whole \u2018nother issue, OK? Another issue.Here\u2019s what I\u2019d like to see happen. The Supreme Court ruled, I don\u2019t agree with the ruling. I\u2019m of favor of marriage between \u2014 you know, traditional marriage, a man and a woman. What I hope was going to happen after the Supreme Court ruling is things would settle down.If you go to a photographer to take pictures at your wedding, and he says, I\u2019d rather not do it, find another photographer, don\u2019t sue them in court. You know what, the problem is in our country \u2014 in our country, we need to learn to respect each other and be a little bit more tolerant for one another.And at the end of the day, don\u2019t go to court. Can\u2019t we have common sense in America? That\u2019s the way it used to be. And there was a book written called \u201cThe Death of Common Sense.\u201d We need to bring it back.But at the end of the day, if somebody is being pressured to participate in something that is against their deeply-held religious beliefs, then we\u2019re going to have to think about dealing with the law.But you know what, I\u2019d rather people figure this out without having to put another law on the books and have more arguments in this country. Why don\u2019t we come together as a country, respect one another, love one another and lift this country? I think that\u2019s what people want.So thanks for asking.BAIER: Senator Cruz, the U.S. Supreme Court obviously declared same-sex marriage legal in all 50 states, a decision you have criticized. Given the current status of the law, do you believe a gay couple should be able to adopt?CRUZ: Well, listen, adoption is decided at the state level and I am a believer in the 10th Amendment in the Constitution, I would leave the question of marriage to the states, I would leave the question of adoption to the states.That\u2019s the way it has been for two centuries of our nation\u2019s history until five unelected judges in an illegitimate and wrong decision decided to seize the authority over marriage and wrongfully tear down the marriage laws of all 50 states.Now, interconnected to this is the question of religious liberty. And at the last debate, one of my colleagues on this stage said on the question of religious liberty and Supreme Court nominees that he\u2019d be willing to compromise and negotiate.I can tell you, for me, there are areas that we should compromise on. Marginal tax rates, we can reach a middle ground on. But when it comes to core principles and convictions, when it comes to the Constitution and Bill of Rights, I can tell the men and women at home I will never compromise away your religious liberty.And for me, Bret, religious liberty has been a lifelong passion. I\u2019ve spent two decades defending religious liberty, including defending the Ten Commandments before the U.S. Supreme Court and winning. Defending the Pledge of Allegiance before the Supreme Court and winning.And defending the Mojave Desert Veterans Memorial, a lone white Latin cross that was erected to honor the men and women who gave their lives in World War I. I represented 3 million veterans for free defending that memorial and we won 5-4 before the Supreme Court.BAIER: Senator, thank you.Senator Cruz definitely avoided saying your name, Mr. Trump, but I think he was referring to you and your religious liberty answer. Would you like to respond?TRUMP: I have nothing to say. I mean, generally speaking, agree with what he said. I would have certainly have rather left it to the states. I was always in favor \u2014 I was very surprised when they came up with that decision.I would have certainly \u2014 I would have preferred had it been left to the states and I think most people would have preferred that.BAIER: Senator Rubio, the late Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia, a conservative icon, obviously, pointed out, in the United States versus Heller, that like most rights, the Second Amendment right is not unlimited.Just like the First Amendment doesn\u2019t allow you to go into a theater and yell fire, he said the Second Amendment leaves room to regulate guns. So do you agree with Justice Scalia? And if so, what limits would you draw around the Second Amendment?RUBIO: As few as possible. The Second Amendment, as I\u2019ve said before, is not a suggestion. It is the constitutional right of every American to protect themselves and their families. It is a right that \u2014 it is the Second Amendment for a reason.It is right after the defense of the freedom of speech for a reason, for clearly the founders of our nation understood and the framers of the Constitution understood that you cannot have life and you cannot have liberty and cannot pursue happiness if you are not safe.RUBIO: And the Second Amendment \u2014 when people talk about gun laws, what they need to realize is, criminals don\u2019t follow gun laws. They\u2019re criminals. By definition, they ignore the law.(APPLAUSE)But the gun rights of Americans, if you are talking to a law- abiding citizen and a gun-owner like myself, if you pass a law, I will follow whatever the law is. A criminal will not do it. They will continue to pursue these guns on the black market, where they then go out and commit crimes and they steal guns from each other.Gun laws are not effective. They simply do not provide for safety. But they do, however, ensure that law-abiding people don\u2019t have access to weapons to protect themselves and guns to protect themselves, but criminals always will be well armed. They don\u2019t care about the law; they don\u2019t follow the law. We will protect the Second Amendment when I\u2019m president of the United States.(APPLAUSE)BAIER: Mr. Trump, you were once a supporter of an assault weapons ban. So do you think there should be any restrictions on the Second Amendment?TRUMP: No, I\u2019m a big defender of the Second Amendment. And if you look at what\u2019s happened, whether it\u2019s in California, where you had the 14 people killed, whether it\u2019s in Paris \u2014 which, by the way, has the toughest gun laws in the world and 130 people killed. Many, many people in the hospital gravely injured. They will be dying. Many people will be dying in addition.If we had guns, or if they had guns on the other side of the room, with the bullets going in the opposite direction, you would not have had 130 people killed. That I can tell you right now.(APPLAUSE)So I\u2019m a very, very big supporter of the Second Amendment.BAIER: But in 2000, you wrote in your book, \u201cI generally oppose gun control, but I support the ban on assault weapons.\u201dTRUMP: I don\u2019t support it anymore. I do not support the ban on assault.(AUDIENCE BOOS)BAIER: Senator Cruz? Any limits to the Second Amendment?CRUZ: Well, listen, unlike Donald, I would not support banning firearms. In that instance, Bill Clinton banned many of the most popular firearms in America. And by the way, the study showed that ban did nothing to reduce violent crime. It just took away the Second Amendment rights of law-abiding citizens.(APPLAUSE)And let me point out, you know, it is easy for political candidates to have rhetoric and say, \u201cI support the Second Amendment.\u201d But you cannot say that and at the same time say what Donald just said, which is that on the question of Supreme Court nominees he wants to compromise and reach a middle ground with Harry Reid and Chuck Schumer. That\u2019s what he said in the last debate.TRUMP: I \u2014 I did not say that. I did not say that.CRUZ: And any justice that Harry Reid and Chuck Schumer sign off on...TRUMP: I did not say that.CRUZ: And I would point out, Harry Reid and Chuck Schumer are both Democrats that Mr. Trump has written checks to repeatedly. Any justice that those two sign off on is going to be a left-wing judicial activist who will undermine religious liberty, and we are one vote away from the Heller decision being overturned, which would effectively erase the Second Amendment from the Bill of Rights.If you care about the Second Amendment, then you need to ask who on this stage do you know will appoint principled constitutionalists to the court and not cut a deal with your Second Amendment rights?BAIER: Mr. Trump...TRUMP: So we\u2019re listening to the all-talk, no-action politician, and he was the primary supporter of John Roberts, who gave us Obamacare.CRUZ: That\u2019s flat-out wrong.TRUMP: No, it\u2019s not. You take a look. He was the primary supporter. He pushed John Roberts, and pushed him, and pushed him, and Bush ultimately appointed him. He got appointed. And when it came his time to raise his hand and kill Obamacare, not once, but twice, he let us down, and he did the wrong thing.This is the man that was the primary supporter. And you can read law journal, you can read whatever you want to read \u2014 I\u2019ve read plenty of it. There was no stronger supporter of John Roberts than him. And it was a very, very big mistake.BAIER: Quickly, Senator Cruz. CRUZ: You know, Donald has a tenuous relationship with the truth.(LAUGHTER)I wrote one op-ed supporting President Bush\u2019s nomination after he made it. I would not have made that nomination. But let me point out...TRUMP: Not what you say in the op-ed.CRUZ: ... if Donald actually cared about...TRUMP: That is not what you said in the op-ed.CRUZ: But, Donald, please, I know it\u2019s hard not to interrupt. But try.TRUMP: Yeah, I know it is. But it\u2019s not what you said in the op-ed.CRUZ: Breathe, breathe, breathe.TRUMP: Lyin\u2019 Ted.CRUZ: You can do it. You can breathe. I know it\u2019s hard. I know it\u2019s hard. But just...RUBIO: When they\u2019re done with the yoga, can I answer a question?CRUZ: You cannot.(LAUGHTER)RUBIO: Unbelievable.CRUZ: I really hope that we don\u2019t \u2014 we don\u2019t see yoga on this stage.RUBIO: Well, he\u2019s very flexible, so you never know.(APPLAUSE)CRUZ: But you cannot, in fact, care about conservative Supreme Court justices and support Jimmy Carter for president. You cannot care about conservative Supreme Court justices and support John Kerry for president, as Donald did. You cannot care about conservative Supreme Court justices and support Harry Reid for Senate majority leader.And you cannot care about conservative Supreme Court justices and write four checks to Hillary Clinton for her to be president if you care at all about the Second Amendment or religious liberty or anything else.BAIER: Gentlemen, gentlemen, we\u2019re going to move on. Thank you very much. We want to talk about some more policy questions coming up.WALLACE: And coming up, the candidates tackle foreign policy. But first, during the commercial break, join us for a Facebook live on the Fox News Facebook page and tell us what you think about tonight\u2019s debate in the comments section. Stay with us. More to come. (COMMERCIAL BREAK)KELLY: Welcome back, everybody. We\u2019re going it get right back to the questions.WALLACE: And gentlemen, we\u2019re going to focus for a bit now on foreign policy.Senator Rubio, you like to take a shot at Mr. Trump on the campaign trail saying that negotiating a hotel deal in a foreign country is not foreign policy. The other day you even compared him to Kim Jong-un, the North Korean leader, as lunatics trying to get a hold of nuclear weapons.Please tell Mr. Trump why he\u2019s unprepared to be commander-in- chief.RUBIO: Well, first of all, I think, as we\u2019ve seen throughout this campaign, Donald has not shown a seriousness about the issues of foreign policy. He just simply hasn\u2019t.Whether it was the structure of our military, even today he was asked a question about the issue of commanders not following his lead on killing the family of terrorists. And his answer basically was, if I tell them to do it, they\u2019re going to do it. Now that\u2019s just not true.Foreign policy is not only consequential, I think much of our future now depends on it. You know, I see a lot of young people at my events around the country. I feel great when they come.And I always them that despite the hardships of the moment, I honestly believe that today\u2019s Millennials have a chance to be the greatest generation we\u2019ve had in 100 years. I really do.Because the world today has hundreds of millions of people that can afford to be their clients, their customers, their partners, people they collaborate with. But that won\u2019t happen if the world is dangerous and it\u2019s unstable.And that will require strong American leadership. The next president of the United States is going to have eight years of a mess of a foreign policy to clean up. That\u2019s why it can\u2019t be Hillary Clinton.And quite frankly, that\u2019s why it can\u2019t be someone who simply has not shown the intellectual curiosity or the interest in learning about these very complicated issues. And Donald simply hasn\u2019t.WALLACE: Mr. Trump, your response.TRUMP: Well, let me just say this. I\u2019ve gotten to know Marco over a period of time, believe me, he is not a leader. Believe me.RUBIO: But that doesn\u2019t answer the question. (CROSSTALK)WALLACE: He didn\u2019t interrupt you. Let him talk.TRUMP: He didn\u2019t answer \u2014 he\u2019s not a leader. And, frankly, when I say they\u2019ll do as I tell them, they\u2019ll do as I tell them. And that\u2019s very \u2014 it\u2019s very simple. It\u2019s very simple.We are in a very dangerous place. We have a depleted military. Totally depleted. We have \u2014 by the way, our vets are treated horribly. We\u2019re going to take care of our vets. We\u2019re going to start taking care of our vets, properly, like we should.(APPLAUSE)But we\u2019re going to build up our military, and we\u2019re going to get the equipment we want, not the equipment that\u2019s sold to us by somebody that gave him and him and not the governor campaign contributions. OK? We\u2019re going to get the equipment that the generals and the soldiers want.I will prove to be a great leader. And, you know, it\u2019s very interesting, we talk about the polls. Every single poll when it comes to ISIS and the military and the border say, by far, Trump is the best.WALLACE: Mr. Trump, your time is up.RUBIO: Yeah, I just want to \u2014 a couple points. Once again, he was pressed on a policy issue to show his understanding of the foreign policy, and his reaction was just to attack somebody else with a name.Here\u2019s the bottom line. And I\u2019m going to repeat it again. The world today is as complicated and as complex as it has been certainly in a very \u2014 certainly in the lifetime of anybody here today. You indeed do have a lunatic in North Korea with nuclear weapons. You indeed do have the Chinese government taking over the most important shipping lane in the world. And Vladimir Putin, who you\u2019ve expressed admiration for, Donald...TRUMP: Wrong. Wrong.RUBIO: You\u2019ve expressed admiration for him.TRUMP: Wrong.(CROSSTALK)RUBIO: Donald, you said he\u2019s a strong leader.TRUMP: Wrong.RUBIO: He is now dividing Europe up...TRUMP: He said very good things about me, and I said...(CROSSTALK)RUBIO: All right, I\u2019m going to finish my statement here.TRUMP: Yeah, finish.RUBIO: And he\u2019s also sowing instability in the Middle East. You have Iran who\u2019s going to get $100 billion of sanctions relief. You have radical jihadists spreading all over the world. This is a time for seriousness on these issues. You have yet to answer a single serious question about any of this. Will you give us a detailed answer about foreign policy any time you\u2019re asked on it?TRUMP: Let me just tell you, first of all, I\u2019ve been hearing this man so long talking about Putin. Putin said about me \u2014 I didn\u2019t say about Putin \u2014 Putin said very nice things about me. And I say very nicely, wouldn\u2019t it be nice if actually we could get along with Russia, we could get along with foreign countries, instead of spending trillions and trillions of dollars?You\u2019re talking about Flint, Michigan. You\u2019re talking about places \u2014 we need to rebuild the infrastructure of our country. Wouldn\u2019t it be nice if we got along with the world, and maybe Russia could help us in our quest to get rid of ISIS, et cetera, et cetera?(CROSSTALK)WALLACE: Gentlemen, you both have had a chance to talk. You both have had a chance to talk a couple of times. I\u2019d like to move on to Senator Cruz. Senator, we have some breaking news tonight. North Korea\u2019s dictator, Kim Jong-un, has ordered that country\u2019s nuclear weapons to be made ready at a moment\u2019s notice.CRUZ: Yes. Yes.WALLACE: And this comes just hours after the U.N. Security Council announced that \u2014 approved the toughest sanctions in two decades against that country. Assume you\u2019re President Cruz tonight. What do you do?CRUZ: Well, you\u2019re right, the news is very disturbing that Kim Jong-un has put their nuclear weapons on ready state. I\u2019m glad that we\u2019re sending another carrier group to the South China Sea. I\u2019m glad that Congress passed sanctions on North Korea.But this is all the result of the failures of the Clinton administration two decades ago that negotiated a deal with North Korea lifting the sanctions, allowing billions of dollars to flow in, and they used that money to develop nuclear weapons in the first place.What we \u2014 now we\u2019re in a much harder position. When you have a lunatic with nuclear weapons, to some extent, it constrains your options. We need to be moving the carrier \u2014 carrier group to the South China Seas. We \u2014 we need to be putting in place missile defense, such as the THAAD missile defense system in South Korea.We need to be pursuing space-based missile defense. One of the advantages of space-based missile defense is that if you have a missile launch in North Korea or you have a missile launch in Iran, a space-based missile defense can take out one or two or three missiles before it can cross over and do damage.And we also need to be putting pressure on China, because North Korea is effectively a \u2014 a client state of China. All of that will happen with a strong commander-in-chief that is devoted to keeping this country safe.WALLACE: Thank you, Senator.Governor Kasich, I want to move back to the debate that we heard earlier about Vladimir Putin. In December, after Vladimir Putin had some nice thing to say about Donald Trump, calling him bright and talented, your campaign ran a video suggesting that Trump might name the Russian president as his running mate. Here\u2019s a clip.KASICH: I\u2019ll have to see this.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)(UNKNOWN): If elected, Trump promised that the dictatorial duo would, quote, \u201cmake tyranny great again.\u201dTRUMP: I think I\u2019d get along very well with Vladimir Putin. I just think so.(END VIDEO CLIP)(LAUGHTER)WALLACE: That was your campaign video, sir.KASICH: That was a pretty good one.WALLACE: Well, OK.KASICH: No, I...(CROSSTALK)WALLACE: If I may \u2014 sir, if I may ask my question...KASICH: Of course.WALLACE: I think you were kidding...WALLACE: But it was your video and the serious question is, because the suggestion is, do you think that Donald Trump is naive about the threat that Vladimir Putin represents?KASICH: I\u2019m not biting. Let me take you around the world, OK? Let me \u2014 look, I\u2019m going to take you very quickly.In Russia, we need to tell them we\u2019re going to arm the Ukrainians with defensive lethal weapons. And we\u2019re going to tell Putin if you attack anybody in Eastern Europe in NATO, you attack Finland and Sweden, which is not in NATO, consider it an attack on us. And he will understand that.Secondly, I would tell the Chinese you don\u2019t own the South China Sea. Stop hacking us. And we\u2019re going to beef up our cyber command. And we\u2019re going to be in a position to be able to take out your systems if you continue to do this.Now let\u2019s move over into the Middle East. The Egyptians, they know they\u2019re on their last legs there because of the attack from ISIS. The Jordanians are \u2014 really have been our friends. They know that they are at risk. So do the Saudis. So do the Gulf states.They are our allies, really, or have similar aims, we need to bring them closer to us. Turkey a critical avenue to the Middle East. We have to bring them towards the West, and not towards the East.WALLACE: Governor...KASICH: And we have a joint, good human intelligence. That is called a semi-trip around the world. And if you gave me more time, I\u2019d finish the trip.WALLACE: Governor, thank you.KASICH: Thank you.BAIER: Coming up, a final question and closing statements. And take a look at this. The volume of conversation on Facebook surrounding the remaining candidates over the last month. Whether that conversation is good or bad, Donald Trump clearly dominates the field.We\u2019ll be back with more of the Republican presidential debate live from Detroit. (COMMERCIAL BREAK)BAIER: Welcome back to the Republican presidential debate. Let\u2019s get back at it.Gentlemen, this is the last question of the night. It has been a long time since our first debate, seven months ago in Cleveland. A lot has transpired since then, obviously, including an RNC pledge that all of you signed agreeing to support the party\u2019s nominee and not to launch an independent run. Tonight, in 30 seconds, can you definitively say you will support the Republican nominee, even if that nominee is Donald J. Trump?Senator Rubio, yes or no?RUBIO: I\u2019ll support the Republican nominee.BAIER: Mr. Trump? Yes or no?RUBIO: I\u2019ll support Donald if he\u2019s the Republican nominee, and let me tell you why. Because the Democrats have two people left in the race. One of them is a socialist. America doesn\u2019t want to be a socialist country. If you want to be a socialist country, then move to a socialist country.The other one is under FBI investigation. And not only is she under FBI investigation, she lied to the families of the victims of Benghazi, and anyone who lies to the families of victims who lost their lives in the service of our country can never be the commander- in-chief of the United States.BAIER: Senator...RUBIO: We must defeat Hillary Clinton.BAIER: Senator Cruz, yes or no, you will support Donald Trump is he\u2019s the nominee?CRUZ: Yes, because I gave my word that I would. And what I have endeavored to do every day in the Senate is do what I said I would do. You know, just on Tuesday, we saw an overwhelming victory in the state of Texas where I won Texas by 17 percent.And I will say it was a powerful affirmation that the people who know me best, the people who I campaigned, who made promises that if you elect me, I\u2019ll lead the fight against Obamacare, I\u2019ll lead the fight against amnesty, I\u2019ll lead the fight against our debt, and I will fight for the Bill of Rights and your rights every day, that the people of Texas said you have kept your word, and that\u2019s what I\u2019ll do as president.BAIER: Governor Kasich, yes or no, would you support Donald Trump as the Republican nominee?KASICH: Yeah. But \u2014 and I kind of think that, before it\u2019s all said and done, I\u2019ll be the nominee. But let me also say...(APPLAUSE)But let me also say, remember...BAIER: But your answer is yes?KASICH: But I\u2019m the little engine that can. And, yeah, look, when you\u2019re in the arena, and we\u2019re in the arena. And the people out here watching \u2014 we\u2019re in the arena, we\u2019re traveling, we\u2019re working, we spend time away from our family, when you\u2019re in the arena, you enter a special circle. And you want to respect the people that you\u2019re in the arena with. So if he ends up as the nominee \u2014 sometimes, he makes it a little bit hard \u2014 but, you know, I will support whoever is the Republican nominee for president.(APPLAUSE)WALLACE: Mr. Trump, I\u2019m going to ask you a version of the same question. As we saw today with Mitt Romney, the #NeverTrump movement is gaining steam. Some people are talking about contributing millions of dollars to try to stop you. Again today, you raised the possibility that you might run as an independent if you feel you\u2019re treated unfairly by the Republican Party.So I\u2019m going to phrase the question that the other three people on this stage just got. Can you definitively say tonight that you will definitely support the Republican nominee for president, even if it\u2019s not you?TRUMP: Even if it\u2019s not me?(LAUGHTER)Let me just start off by saying...WALLACE: Thirty seconds, sir.TRUMP: ... OK \u2014 that I\u2019m very, very proud of \u2014 millions and millions of people have come to the Republican Party over the last little while. They\u2019ve come to the Republican Party. And by the way, the Democrats are losing people. This is a trend that\u2019s taking place. It\u2019s the biggest thing happening in politics, and I\u2019m very proud to be a part of it. And I\u2019m going to give them some credit, too, even though they don\u2019t deserve it. But the answer is: Yes, I will.WALLACE: Yes, you will support the nominee of the party? TRUMP: Yes, I will. Yes. I will.KELLY: Candidates, it\u2019s now time for your closing statements. Governor Kasich, we\u2019ll start with you.KASICH: Well, ladies and gentlemen, I love being here in Michigan, and I want to say to all of you here that I have a record of being able to solve some of the biggest problems. It\u2019s not just talk, and it\u2019s not theory.I did it in Washington by helping people get into a healthier economic situation. I\u2019ve done it in Ohio. And as we\u2019ve made progress in Ohio, we\u2019ve left no one behind. We\u2019ve not left behind the mentally ill, the drug addicted, the working poor, the developmental disabled, and we have raised our minority community.And as president of the United States, I will go back to Washington, I will take the formulas that I used, and I will \u2014 I will fix the problems in Washington, and you\u2019ll work with me as I send you power to fix your \u2014 your communities, your neighborhoods, your state, and together, we\u2019ll restore the spirit of America. And I know you want that. Thank you.(APPLAUSE)WALLACE: Senator Rubio, 30 seconds, closing statement.RUBIO: Well, I know this has been an unusual election cycle, as it continues, and there\u2019s a lot of problems in America, and people are truly hurting. But this election is not just about confronting our problems; it\u2019s also about embracing our opportunities.(APPLAUSE)BAIER: Senator Cruz, your closing statement?CRUZ: I want to talk to every soldier and sailor and airman and Marine. I want to talk to every mom and dad and sister and brother and son and daughter of someone fighting for this country. For seven years, you\u2019ve had a commander-in-chief that doesn\u2019t believe in you, that sends you into combat with rules of engagement that tie your arms behind your back. That is wrong. It is immoral. And in January 2017, it will end.I want to also talk to all the police officers and firefighters and first responders who have been left behind with this president. Starting in January 2017, I will have your back.(APPLAUSE)KELLY: Mr. Trump, your closing statement.TRUMP: Thank you. I am going to bring jobs back to the United States like nobody else can. We\u2019re going to fix our very depleted military. We\u2019re going to take care of our vets. We\u2019re going to strengthen our borders. And you\u2019re going to be very, very proud of this country in just a few years if I\u2019m elected president. Thank you.KELLY: Thank you, sir.And that will do it for the 11th Republican primary debate of the 2016 presidential race. But the night is not over yet.WALLACE: Not by a long shot. A special edition of \u201cThe O\u2019Reilly Factor\u201d is next. And remember, Fox News has the race for the White House covered, all the way to the conventions and onto the general election.BAIER: Our thanks to Detroit and the crowd here. Thank you again for joining us. Have a great evening.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Ted Cruz Opens Two Fronts in Push Against Donald Trump", "Date": "2016-03-24", "News": "The Republican presidential primary race, once a frenzied sprint of rallies and retail stops, has become a grind-it-out slog. Senator Ted Cruz of Texas is opening up two fronts against Donald J. Trump \u00e2\u0080\u0094 trying to peel away delegates in New York, where they will be allocated by congressional district unless Mr. Trump clears 50 percent, and in Wisconsin, where he hopes to win outright. Mr. Cruz was in both states on Wednesday, beginning his morning with an event to sway New Yorkers \u00e2\u0080\u0094 the ones with and without \u00e2\u0080\u009cNew York values,\u00e2\u0080\u009d apparently \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and later in Wisconsin, where he appeared with Charlie Sykes, a local radio host whose main subject matter has been the state\u00e2\u0080\u0099s governor, Scott Walker. In New York, he was on the defensive over the Police Department\u00e2\u0080\u0099s criticism of his call for surveilling Muslim communities.  Mr. Trump did not campaign publicly, but throughout the day he and Mr. Cruz traded barbs and Twitter posts over an ad that ran in Utah highlighting a nude photo shoot by the New Yorker\u00e2\u0080\u0099s wife, the former model Melania Trump. Mr. Cruz continued to defend his wife against Mr. Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s vague threat to \u00e2\u0080\u009cspill the beans\u00e2\u0080\u009d about her.On the Democratic side, Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont\u00e2\u0080\u0099s team pointed to his wins from Tuesday night\u00e2\u0080\u0099s nominating contests to push back on calls that he should drop out. Buoyed by the thousands of people who still turn out to see him, Mr. Sanders is showing no signs of quitting. Hillary Clinton, on the West Coast, delivered a speech about defeating terrorists, in which she denounced Mr. Trump and Mr. Cruz, accusing them of making bellicose proposals that were not grounded in reality. Much as she has with Mr. Sanders on the topic of domestic policy, Mrs. Clinton used the speech to try to position herself as the sensible voice and to pivot toward the general election in a more-pronounced way.  \n\t\tFirst Draft provides fast-paced and comprehensive coverage of politics and elections by The New York Times.

{"Headline": "Small-Business Lobbying Group Steps Into Supreme Court Fight", "Date": "2016-03-25", "News": "Senator Mitch McConnell, in making his case against Judge Merrick B. Garland, has noted that Judge Garland is opposed by the National Federation of Independent Business and that the small-business lobbying group has never before inserted itself in a high-profile court fight. The point Mr. McConnell, the Kentucky Republican and majority leader, is trying to make is that Judge Garland\u2019s record is so egregious that even a normally reserved lobbying group is taking on the nominee. But there is another reason as well. The 325,000-member group, known universally as the N.F.I.B., has a new president, Juanita Duggan, and the Garland fight is providing an opportunity to showcase an aggressive posture for the lobbying organization and for her to establish herself. \u201cWe can\u2019t sit this one out,\u201d Ms. Duggan, the former head of the American Apparel and Footwear Association, said when the nomination was announced. Federation officials say that Judge Garland\u2019s record in finding for regulators over businesses might have spurred the organization regardless, but that Ms. Duggan\u2019s taking the reins last month eliminated any question about whether it would jump in. The group is a plaintiff in two challenges to the Environmental Protection Agency on water and energy regulations moving through the courts.\n\t\tFirst Draft provides fast-paced and comprehensive coverage of politics and elections by The New York Times.

{"Headline": "Prime Suspect in Koala\u2019s Murder: Los Angeles\u2019s Mountain Lion", "Date": "2016-03-23", "News": "Supported byLOS ANGELES \u2014 The murder was grisly. A koala disappeared from the Los Angeles Zoo one night this month. Its body, mangled and bloody, was found the next morning on a nearby hillside.Suspicion immediately fell on the area\u2019s most famous resident: a wild mountain lion, known as P-22, who has made a home in the rugged hills near the zoo in this city\u2019s Griffith Park since wandering from a nearby national recreation area in 2012.The question of what will happen to P-22 has riveted the city for weeks now, as state officials conduct DNA tests to confirm that he is the culprit.Lisa Lampman, on a visit to the zoo this week with her 3-year-old daughter, was unperturbed. \u201cI\u2019m not worried about it at all,\u201d said Ms. Lampman, 46. \u201cWe hike around all the time. I\u2019ve seen bobcats and coyotes.\u201dEven officials at the zoo \u2014 which has spent a decade trying to rehabilitate its reputation after falling into disrepair during the 1990s when coyotes sneaked through a broken fence and snacked on rare birds \u2014 said they hoped P-22 would remain in the park. For now, the koalas are being taken inside at night, at least until the zoo can build a fence high enough to keep out a mountain lion.\u201cThis is a natural park and home to many species of wildlife,\u201d April Spurlock, a spokeswoman for the zoo, wrote in an email. \u201cWe will continue to adapt to P-22.\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s become kind of a celebrity, as will happen in L.A.,\u201d said Andrew Hughan, a spokesman for the California Department of Fish and Wildlife.Earlier this week, one of the P-22 Twitter accounts asked whether Mr. O\u2019Farrell still wanted him removed.Not anymore, as it turns out. In an interview, the city councilman said he believed P-22 should stay in the park for now, given that he had shown no aggressiveness toward humans. But Mr. O\u2019Farrell remained wary. \u201cI\u2019m rooting for his survival,\u201d he said. \u201cHe\u2019s at the apex of the food chain there. And I have my doubts whether his life is sustainable there indefinitely.\u201dNo one has suggested that the park is an ideal habitat for P-22. He is the only lion in the park (which makes his celebrity pretty useless for picking up females). Two years ago he contracted mange. And although he does occasionally come down out of the hills \u2014 like the time last year when he spent a day camped under a house in the Los Feliz neighborhood \u2014 the park is not a large enough territory for an adult mountain lion.The problem, experts say, is that there is nowhere else for him to go. Male mountain lions fight to the death to protect their territory, and there is no suitable habitat left unclaimed in California. \u201cIt\u2019s not like there is some mountain lion Shangri-La with no adult male lion,\u201d said Seth Riley, a wildlife ecologist with the National Park Service, which has been tracking P-22 with a GPS collar since 2012. \u201cMoving animals around generally results in their death.\u201dThere are benefits to having an apex predator in Griffith Park, said David Ryu, the city councilman whose district includes the park. They eat coyotes, which are much more likely than a mountain lion to eat a pet dog.\u201cIf we get rid of him, what next?\u201d Mr. Ryu said. \u201cDo we get rid of all the coyotes? They prey on raccoons. Then do we get rid of the raccoons? Where do you draw the line?\u201dAdvertisement"}

Vasily Golubev, the governor of the Rostov region, said strong winds appeared to have caused the crash, but Russian officials said other factors could also have contributed.The airliner belonged to the Dubai budget carrier FlyDubai, which confirmed that the plane had crashed on landing and that none of the passengers had survived. Forty-four of the passengers were Russian, eight were Ukrainian, two were Indian and one was Uzbek, the airline said.\u201cWe are doing everything that we can to help those who have been affected,\u201d the airline\u2019s chief executive, Ghaith al-Ghaith, said in a video posted on Facebook.The Russian Investigative Committee, a law enforcement agency, said both of the plane\u2019s flight data recorders had been recovered. In a statement on its website, the agency listed \u201ccrew error, technical failure, adverse weather conditions and other factors\u201d as possible reasons for the crash.Russia\u2019s Emergency Situations Ministry said the crash occurred at 3:42 a.m. as the plane was making its second attempt to land, two hours after an earlier attempt had failed. A wing of the plane struck the runway, and the aircraft began to disintegrate and burn, the statement said.The Interfax news agency quoted Mr. Golubev, the regional governor, as saying that the plane had crashed about 830 feet from the runway. \u201cWith all likelihood, the strongly gusting wind, approaching a hurricane level, was the cause of the air crash,\u201d Interfax quoted Mr. Golubev as saying.Wind gusts reached 43 miles per hour at the time of the crash, according to the Flightradar24 website, which said there had also been light rain.The Rostov-on-Don airport was closed to air traffic, officials said. It was scheduled to be closed next year, after a new one farther from the city center is completed. The airport served just over two million passengers last year.A well-known Russian pilot, Andrei Litvinov, said Saturday on Russian television that the airport lacks advanced navigation equipment that would make the landing procedure easier for pilots.President Vladimir V. Putin expressed his condolences to the families of the victims, according to a statement on the Kremlin\u2019s website. Mr. Golubev declared Sunday a day of mourning, Interfax said.FlyDubai\u2019s website said the plane could seat up to 189 people, suggesting that the toll could have been much worse. The airline said 33 of the passengers were women and four were children. The Rostov government said one of the crew members was Russian and the other six were foreigners. Citizens of Greece, Spain and Cyprus were among the crew members, Interfax quoted Russia\u2019s consul general in Dubai as saying.The Russian Investigative Committee said in a statement online that it had set up a team of at least 50 investigators to look into the crash.

As these readers discovered, there are many different strategies to handle a breakup on Facebook.I defriended my ex and all her friends. Before defriending her friends, I sent each one an individual note (via Facebook) recounting some time we spent together, apologizing for defriending them and explaining that I just needed my space and that in the future we might be friends again under different circumstances.In doing so, much of your interactions are eliminated from each others\u2019 profiles, such as likes or posts including you by others. Blocking on Facebook is much better than Instagram because it also prevents you from searching for the person you blocked \u2014 removing the temptation of checking up on his/her profile. I wish Instagram worked this way!I broke up a year ago with a long-term boyfriend. We were listed as \u201cin a relationship\u201d on Facebook and did not want others to see that we removed that listing. Therefore, we both put our relationship info to \u201cprivate\u201d and ended the Facebook version of our relationship. We were both pleased with this solution since \u201cEva and X ended their relationship\u201d did not show up in our friends\u2019 news feed.I\u2019ve found that removing a former romantic partner is more of a message to them, whereas I typically want to give them no indication that I am suffering. So I usually let them remain on my contact list. One abusive relationship did end up with me deleting an ex-boyfriend for obvious reasons. He recently friend-requested me again, and it brought back a lot of bad memories. Otherwise, and maybe it\u2019s a bit masochistic, but I never unfollow exes \u2026 I\u2019m too curious.

But at the same time, in a sense I felt paralyzed and could not do anything about that. I probably somehow unconsciously still needed to know everything. Even though it hurt. After a while, he removed our \u201cin a relationship\u201d status (and added the one with his new girlfriend). After a few months, I realized I had enough of those happy posts, they did not do me any good and were not helping me heal, so I unfollowed him (but did not unfriend him).Advertisement"}

Or that it would leave her with no sensation \u00e2\u0080\u009cfrom the front all the way to the back in the entire bra area,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cNothing. Zero. Zip.\u00e2\u0080\u009dMs. Foldes says there are days that she asks herself, \u00e2\u0080\u009cShould I have done it?\u00e2\u0080\u009d But, she said, her mother had two types of cancer, and she wanted to be proactive: \u00e2\u0080\u009cI didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want to be waiting for the other shoe to drop.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00e2\u0080\u009cQuite a few studies have shown that in patients who don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have a genetic mutation that increases breast cancer risk, the benefit from removing the healthy breast \u00e2\u0080\u0094 purely from a cancer perspective \u00e2\u0080\u0094 is zero to tiny at best,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Dr. E. Shelley Hwang, the chief of breast surgery at Duke Cancer Institute, who led the study.What she wanted to find out was, \u00e2\u0080\u009cIf it doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t extend longevity, does it at least improve their quality of life?\u00e2\u0080\u009dDr. Hwang concluded that the benefits were marginal. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want to sound terribly negative; some women had very good results and are happy they made the decision,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said. But, she added, \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not better off, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not happier, you don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t feel better about yourself sexually by having the healthy breast removed.\u00e2\u0080\u009dThe number of women opting to remove the cancerous breast and the healthy breast \u00e2\u0080\u0093 a procedure known as contralateral prophylactic mastectomy or C.P.M. \u00e2\u0080\u0094 has surged in recent years. In 2011, about 11 percent of women who were having a mastectomy for cancer chose C.P.M., compared with less than 2 percent in 1998.Many breast cancer doctors are concerned by the trend, which they expect to increase. Women with early-stage breast cancer have the same odds of survival whether they have a lumpectomy or a mastectomy, and research suggests the risk of a cancer in the contralateral breast is low. But patients say they want to eliminate even the most negligible risk of a recurrence or cancer in their healthy breast.\u00e2\u0080\u009cNine times out of 10, the women are the ones who decide,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Dr. Hwang said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThey have cancer, they never want to deal with it again, they just want both breasts off, and they can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t rest until the other breast is done.\u00e2\u0080\u009dBut Dr. Hwang says she has seen the downside of double mastectomies. Surgical complications can occur during reconstruction, which is often a protracted process, and many women have unrealistic expectations about what the new breasts will look and feel like after reconstruction.Surgery usually leaves the patient with no sensation in the breast area, and the extensive operations can also result in chronic pain.\u00e2\u0080\u009cOne patient said she couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t feel hugs anymore when she snuggled up to her kids,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Dr. Hwang said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThat really affected me.\u00e2\u0080\u009dMany women are influenced by family history. Valerie Garguilo, 54, of Bellport, N.Y., watched her sister die in 2008 after a seven-year bout with breast cancer that was treated with a lumpectomy followed by two recurrences and two more lumpectomies, and then metastasis to her bones and brain. When Ms. Garguilo was found to have a stage-zero cancer herself four years ago, she opted for a double mastectomy, even though she tested negative for harmful genetic mutations.\u00e2\u0080\u009cI wanted to do whatever I could to cut my chances of a recurrence; I wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t going to keep going in for lumpectomies,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said.Some women say they do not believe studies that report no difference in survival rates. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI feel like a lumpectomy can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t possibly get everything out,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Maria Sawicki, 67, of Massapequa, N.Y., who needed a mastectomy on her affected breast but removed her other breast as well. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe littlest thing can be missed.\u00e2\u0080\u009dFor the study, 3,977 volunteers who had had mastectomies \u00e2\u0080\u0094 including 1,598 who had had both breasts removed \u00e2\u0080\u0094 completed an extensive survey, called BREAST-Q. The survey measured physical well-being, which asks about neck, arm and upper back pain, mobility and the ability to lift the arms; psychosocial well-being, which focuses on body image and confidence in social settings; sexual well-being, including sexual confidence and feelings of attractiveness and comfort level during sex; and breast satisfaction. The last question asks whether bras and clothes fit well, whether the breasts are symmetrical and whether one is comfortable with one\u00e2\u0080\u0099s appearance, clothed and unclothed.After adjusting for differences between the groups, the researchers found that women who had had double mastectomies had slightly higher scores on psychosocial well-being and breast satisfaction \u00e2\u0080\u0094 the differences were only about a point higher on a scale of 100. But scores on the other domains of physical and sexual well-being did not differ from those of women who did not have double mastectomies.The most important factor in a woman\u00e2\u0080\u0099s overall well-being, the new study found, was whether she had had reconstructive surgery. Most women who had had such surgery reported substantially higher quality of life scores, whether they had single or double mastectomies.\u00e2\u0080\u009cThat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a much more powerful intervention to improve quality of life than a contralateral prophylactic mastectomy,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Dr. Hwang said.Your health questions answered by Times journalists and\u00a0experts.Get Well's Running email for practical tips, expert advice, exclusive content and a bit of motivation delivered to your inbox every week to help you on your running journey.

But the Sanders team, excited about its Thursday night placement in prime time (8:48 p.m.) on the network, is expecting the ad to reach millions. It will air just days before the March 15 Democratic primary in Florida.It tells the story of a visit Mr. Sanders made to the small town in 2008, where he discovered a \u00e2\u0080\u009chuman tragedy,\u00e2\u0080\u009d as he described it, and worked to expose the harsh conditions in the area.But rather than Mr. Sanders recalling the episode, the ad centers around one character, a young Mexican immigrant named Udelia, who tells the story of her life as a farm worker in Immokalee, an unincorporated town in southwest Florida known for its tomato fields.The ad is similar to one the Sanders campaign released featuring Erica Garner, the daughter of Eric Garner, the man killed by police officers in Staten Island in 2014. In that spot, nearly the entire story is handed over to Mrs. Garner to tell her story. Mr. Sanders only becomes a part of the ad halfway through.Udelia, who narrates in Spanish with English subtitles, speaks as a mother, detailing the difficulties and abuses she and fellow workers faced in the tomato fields, saying they were denied water and bathroom breaks, endured physical abuse and were paid wages so low they were unable to afford food.\u00e2\u0080\u009cThey don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t understand what we have to live through,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she says of the bosses in the fields, \u00e2\u0080\u009cbecause we have families.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The ad shows glimpses into her family life, with the children playing in a bedroom and waiting for a school bus.Three minutes into the five-minute ad, Mr. Sanders is finally heard from, giving a speech at the National Association of Latino Elected and Appointed Officials in 2015. He recalls what he found examining the farm workers\u2019 plight, but it is Udelia who tells of Mr. Sanders\u2019s actions to address the situation, including holding hearings.\u00e2\u0080\u009cI could buy small things for my children,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she says. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThis changes a person.\u201d\n\t\tFirst Draft provides fast-paced and comprehensive coverage of politics and elections by The New York Times.

The results were also a reminder of her weakness among two key voting blocs: working-class white men and independent voters.The setback will almost certainly lead her to sharpen or even rethink her economic message, which does not seem to be reaching voters who feel betrayed by the Democratic Party\u2019s embrace of free trade and left behind by the forces of globalization and deregulation. The first big test will come Wednesday night, when the two candidates debate in Miami, and then in the major industrial states that vote on March 15, including Ohio and Illinois.Despite the loss, Mrs. Clinton still has a large lead among delegates and was likely to pick up more than Mr. Sanders on Tuesday night because of her lopsided win in Mississippi.One ad, according to advisers to Mr. Sanders, was especially effective: It portrayed Mr. Sanders as the only candidate who had consistently opposed the free trade agreements many Michigan voters blame for job losses.Despite Mrs. Clinton\u2019s advantages, including the support of much of the state\u2019s Democratic establishment, the Sanders campaign showed deft organization and strategy: Mr. Sanders crisscrossed the state, speaking to more than 41,000 people, and his campaign opened 13 offices and hired 44 staffers to carry his message. He also visited places that were largely overlooked by the Clinton campaign, including Traverse City and Kalamazoo.Beverly Christensen, a retired pilot, said she had waited in line for a couple of hours to see Mr. Sanders at his rally in Traverse City. She called it \u201chuge\u201d for Mr. Sanders to come to the area, saying she could not recall another presidential contender visiting since the home-state favorite Gerald Ford stopped by.\u201cTo have him show up here \u2014 it was like he was a superstar just coming to our small town,\u201d Ms. Christensen, 68, said in a telephone interview. \u201cWe felt like we were being heard and being listened to, and that was really important.\u201dIn Grand Traverse County, the home of Traverse City, Mr. Sanders won with about 64 percent of the vote. He also performed especially well in counties that are home to major campuses like the University of Michigan, Michigan State University and Western Michigan University.As results flooded in Tuesday night, Mr. Sanders said he had felt the race shifting in his favor in recent days as he talked with auto workers, union leaders and college students, who all seemed eager for a more assertive progressive agenda.\u201cIf you understand that two weeks ago, we were 30 points behind, it is very clear, as I felt, that we have a lot of momentum with us,\u201d Mr. Sanders said in an interview. \u201cMany of the vibes we were getting were very, very positive. I knew, I knew that these polls that had us 20 or 30 points behind were wrong.\u201dBut even Mr. Sanders seemed surprised by the outcome: He had no victory speech prepared, instead holding a seven-minute news conference from Miami as the votes were being counted.While Michigan\u2019s economy has recovered substantially since the economic crisis, its unemployment level has continued to hover above national averages. More problematic, some analysts fear that many have simply stopped looking for work as the state\u2019s labor force has shrunk.Although the auto industry, which fuels the regional economy, has rebounded significantly from the lows of 2008, Detroit only recently emerged from bankruptcy. \u201cHe was strong and forceful on trade, and persuasive with a lot of Michigan Democrats who have seen what\u2019s happened to their economy over the past 20 years,\u201d said Tad Devine, a senior adviser to the Sanders campaign.When Mrs. Clinton accused Mr. Sanders at the debate of opposing the 2009 federal bailout of the auto industry, and then began broadcasting a radio ad about the issue on Monday morning, Sanders advisers scrambled to come up with an ad of their own, explaining that Mr. Sanders had supported the bailout but opposed earlier aid for Wall Street that included some money for car companies.A coalition of Republicans is banking on a scenario in which Donald J. Trump fails to reach the 1,237 delegates required to secure the party\u2019s nomination before its July convention, creating a potential opening for another nominee as the delegates vote on the convention floor.While the Clinton ad was unmatched on the air for several hours, Sanders advisers said, their ad was up on Monday night and covered by the Michigan news media \u2014 enough to halt the effectiveness of the Clinton spot, they argued.Mr. Sanders\u2019s Michigan operation ultimately drew on hundreds of volunteers to make phone calls and help transport voters to the polls on Tuesday, while other aides used a string of short advertisements \u2014 some lasting five seconds or less \u2014 to spread the message about Mr. Sanders on Facebook and Twitter.Mr. Sanders performed particularly well among white voters \u2014 especially white men, but also white women \u2014 and he won independents strongly. He lost to Mrs. Clinton among Democrats and minority voters.Mrs. Clinton\u2019s advisers had been fearing a loss, and the team sent her husband, former President Bill Clinton, and their daughter, Chelsea Clinton, to campaign around the state. Her campaign\u2019s leaders are worried that Mr. Sanders could upend her recent momentum if he parlays his narrow victory in Michigan into wins next Tuesday in Illinois, Missouri and Ohio, where he is focusing his resources.Jennifer Palmieri, a spokeswoman for the Clinton campaign, and other advisers pointed to Mrs. Clinton\u2019s significant lead in delegates and said the team would like to \u201cwrap up\u201d the primary campaign \u201cas soon as possible.\u201d\u201cWe feel confident she is going to be the nominee, but the race will continue to be competitive through next week,\u201d Ms. Palmieri said.Mrs. Clinton is competing hard in Illinois, Missouri and Ohio, as well as in Florida and North Carolina, which also vote Tuesday. Her aides are confident that even if she loses the three Midwestern states to Mr. Sanders, she could still come away with more delegates that night, because her victories in Florida and North Carolina would most likely be bigger than his in the other states.Amy Chozick, Steve Eder and Giovanni Russonello contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

To save time, I took my jacket off and started scouring social media \u2014 Twitter and Facebook \u2014 to gather witness accounts and whatever scraps of information were available. I called The New York Times\u2019s news desk in London, and an editor told me that correspondents in Brussels were already on the story.About twenty minutes later, having gathered some information, I jumped on my bike and rode as fast as I could from my apartment in north London to The Times\u2019s office in central London \u2014 usually about a 12-minute journey. I wove through the hordes of cyclists and morning traffic and arrived as news of the attacks was blaring from a television in the lobby. I immediately went to confer with editors on the news desk.I went to the desk of Sewell Chan, the international news editor, and volunteered to travel to Brussels. Before I had finished a sentence, he\u2019d already begun to email Dick Stevenson, The Times\u2019s Europe editor, to suggest that I deploy \u2014 along with Kimiko de Freytas-Tamura, another London-based reporter. We soon had our marching orders.The Eurostar trains to Brussels were not running, so we scrambled to find a way to get there. We decided to take a train to Paris, then drive from there. I biked home to pack my bags.I knew from covering previous terrorist attacks that getting witness accounts was key, so I sent a Facebook message to a wide network of friends and contacts in Brussels. Within minutes I had a name \u2014 an American communications consultant from Washington who worked in Brussels and had been on a subway car at Maelbeek when the station was attacked.Outside the Angel tube stop in London near my apartment \u2014 before taking the tube to St. Pancras station to hop on a Paris-bound train \u2014 I called the American consultant, crouching on the sidewalk and scribbling in my notepad. Some curious passers-by peered down at the strange man who had turned the sidewalk into a desk. By the time I arrived at St. Pancras Station, a few minutes away, I had written up my notes on my iPhone and filed them via email to the news desk in London.Contact information for a second witness, a Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois actress who had been at the airport, arrived while I was en route to Paris. I interviewed her in the car on the way to Brussels, writing up my notes as I arrived at the outskirts of the city.Simon O\u2019Connor, a European Commission official, whom I know from my Brussels days, also responded to my Facebook plea. He told me how he had arrived at the airport for a business trip to Rome, and was about to walk across the parking lot to the departure terminal, when the building was suddenly ripped apart by a loud explosion. The serendipity of life: \u201cIf only I had gone in a few minutes earlier,\u201d he muttered.Those interviews \u2014 and additional reporting by colleagues in Brussels \u2014 formed the basis of a story that set the scene of what happened at the airport and the subway station. I refined and refiled my reporting once Ms. de Freytas-Tamura and I arrived in Brussels at 8 p.m., about eight hours after we had left London.The streets near our hotel, on a usually busy square peppered with chocolate emporiums and antique shops, were eerily deserted. Ms. de Freytas-Tamura and I continued to report and, after we were finally finished, arranged to meet Ms. Rubin and Mr. Breeden at a nearby restaurant for a late bite and strategy session.We were the only ones there.videovideoAdvertisement"}

We sat down aboard Air Force One on the way to California to talk about their routine at the ranch.Mrs. Reagan was eager to dispel the popular idea that the ranch was Mr. Reagan\u2019s interest, and not hers. They had bought the ranch more than 25 years earlier, and they both worked to rebuild the ramshackle house on the property, she said. The president was going on about the hard work they undertook to redo the place. \u201cAnd we \u00e2\u0080\u0094 WE \u00e2\u0080\u0094 put that tile down,\u201d Mrs. Reagan interrupted, referring to the veranda. \u201cAnd WE painted that. Nobody will believe that, but it\u2019s true,\u201d she said. Mr. Reagan then described how they had been pruning the woods on the hillside, and had looked over as Nancy was wrestling with a dead tree. Mr. Reagan yelled at her to stop, saying he would get to it. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAll of a sudden, over it went,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Reagan said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cPeewee Powerhouse there had pushed over the tree.\u00e2\u0080\u009dMr. Reagan was notoriously bad about remembering names. I remember, on one visit to the ranch, reporters asked him the name of his dog, a collie. Mr. Reagan suddenly looked puzzled and blurted out, \u00e2\u0080\u009cLassie,\u00e2\u0080\u009d because it was the name of the TV collie.Nancy never forgot a name. I saw her a couple times whispering into Mr. Reagan\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ear the name of someone who was approaching he should have known. When I first met her, I mentioned that I had grown up in Beverly Hills, that my mother had gone to school with the wife of a member of the cabinet, and that I had even known Mr. Reagan\u00e2\u0080\u0099s son, Michael, growing up. She quizzed me intently about it and never forgot it when I saw her again. In December 1984, at the White House Christmas party, I told her I was about to go to India for The Times and I wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be covering the second term. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI knew that,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWish us luck.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Steven R.

Maybe they were brought on by the almost summery sunrises and the definitely summerlike temperatures last week. Or maybe it was being out in the softer, gentler air, walking around in a city of walkers \u2014 and noticing little things like the baseball caps.In Times Square at midday, you will probably see a couple of people wearing baseball caps emblazoned with \u201cNew York\u201d on the front. If you are paying attention \u2014 not scrolling through emails or Facebook posts on your cellphone \u2014 you will notice that some caps say \u201cEst. 1625\u201d below the New York, while other caps say \u201cEst. 1664.\u201dIf the presidential candidates cannot agree on immigration reform and trade policy, perhaps it is no surprise that souvenir manufacturers cannot agree on something as basic as the year in which New York was founded.It turns out the caps come from different manufacturers. The 1625 caps are made by a company in Queens called Elidan.\u201cI did research, unlike other people,\u201d said Daniel Yun, an owner of Elidan and the \u201cdan\u201d half of the company\u2019s name.\u201cI said, if it\u2019s on the seal, that\u2019s the best argument,\u201d Mr. Yun said. \u201cSixteen sixty-four, the name changed, but the city was still the same.\u201dA call to Michael Miscione, the borough historian of Manhattan, essentially confirmed that version of events.\u201cThe first Dutch settlers get here in 1624 and settle on Governors Island,\u201d he said. \u201cThe following year, 1625, after one year on Governors Island, they move to Manhattan. They go there to set up a trading post, and in that year, 1625, they get a city charter establishing the city of New Amsterdam.\u201dThere is a but.Sam Gohari, one of the partners at Torkia Apparel and Pet Inc. of Secaucus, N.J. \u2014 maker of the 1664 caps \u2014 shrugged off the question of how he chose that date.\u201cIt\u2019s just a date,\u201d he said. \u201cIt may or may not be the exact date that New York City was established, because it\u2019s debatable. Someone can say when the Dutch settled, that\u2019s the date. Someone else can say when the British came, that\u2019s the date.\u201dSo he decided to go with the date the British came to power?\u201cI don\u2019t even know which one it is,\u201d Mr. Gohari said. \u201cIt\u2019s just product. It\u2019s not like an encyclopedia that has to be precise.\u201dSo much for the baseball caps. Now for the March-Hare-or-White-Rabbit mystery.It was raised the other day at a book party for G. A. Mudge, the author of \u201cAlice in Central Park \u2014 Statues in Wonderland,\u201d which he calls the only book about all the statues in the park.Mr. Mudge said the parks department issued a news release in 1959, just before the statue was dedicated, that said the figure was the March Hare. But he said that a brochure distributed at the ceremony identified the figure as the White Rabbit. As did The New Yorker, which said Alice was flanked by \u201cthe White Rabbit, watch in hand (he had just pulled it from his waistcoat pocket).\u201dLast week, the parks department and the conservancy were sticking to their stories. Maeri Ferguson, a spokeswoman for the parks department, repeated a passage from the website about the March Hare. The conservancy\u2019s official historian, Sara Cedar Miller, said in an email that it was the White Rabbit \u201cbecause he has the telltale watch in his hand.\u201dMr. Mudge himself sidestepped the issue. He said the figure was a lagomorph, a classification that covers both rabbits and hares. (Rabbits tend to be smaller than hares and have longer ears. Hares mostly live above ground, rabbits below \u2014 hence the phrase \u201cdown the rabbit hole.\u201d)\u201cWhat difference does it make?\u201d she added. \u201cPeople get hung up on trivial things. It\u2019s the White Rabbit.\u201dWe stopped by the statue on the way to work the other day and can report that none of the children climbing on it were wearing either kind of New York cap.

{"Headline": "The Echo From Amazon Brims With Groundbreaking Promise", "Date": "2016-03-09", "News": "Supported byState of the ArtMany of the world\u2019s largest technology companies have spent the last five years searching in vain for the holy grail, a machine to succeed the smartphone as the next must-have gadget.They have made digital watches and fitness trackers, all manner of computerized glasses and goggles, and more doodads to plug into your TV than there are shows to watch on it.This time it may be different. A bit more than a year after its release, the Echo has morphed from a gimmicky experiment into a device that brims with profound possibility. The longer I use it, the more regularly it inspires the same sense of promise I felt when I used the first iPhone \u2014 a sense this machine is opening up a vast new realm in personal computing, and gently expanding the role that computers will play in our future.What is most interesting about the Echo is that it came out of nowhere. It isn\u2019t much to look at, and even describing its utility is difficult. Here is a small, stationary machine that you set somewhere in your house, which you address as Alexa, which performs a variety of tasks \u2014 playing music, reading the news and weather, keeping a shopping list \u2014 that you can already do on your phone.But the Echo has a way of sneaking into your routines. When Alexa reorders popcorn for you, or calls an Uber car for you, when your children start asking Alexa to add Popsicles to the grocery list, you start to want pretty much everything else in life to be Alexa-enabled, too.In this way, Amazon has found a surreptitious way to bypass Apple and Google \u2014 the reigning monarchs in the smartphone world \u2014 with a gadget that has the potential to become a dominant force in the most intimate of environments: our homes.Scot Wingo, the chairman of ChannelAdvisor, an e-commerce consulting firm, said the early signs suggested that the Echo was on a path to become Amazon\u2019s next $1 billion business.\u201cIt\u2019s one of the most sold-out things that I see on Amazon,\u201d Mr. Wingo said. \u201cIt\u2019s an unusual thing for Amazon to be out of something, but for the Echo, it\u2019s usually in stock just for a couple weeks before it goes out of stock for a few days \u2014 so it feels like they\u2019re having trouble making enough of the devices.\u201d Mr. Wingo noted the Echo, which Amazon sells for $180 only through its own site, was selling for $200 to $300 on eBay.During an interview at a media event last week, Dave Limp, Amazon\u2019s senior vice president for devices, said the company created the Echo because it had seen interesting possibilities arising out of advances in microphone technology, speech recognition and cloud connectivity. Amazon\u2019s engineers spent years perfecting the device\u2019s unusual capabilities. Unlike competing assistants, the Echo can be activated hands-free from far across the room (Siri only works from a couple of feet away), and it can decipher your voice in noisy environments, even when it\u2019s playing music.Amazon also worked to make sure the device responded very quickly. \u201cEarly on in the product, to play music took eight or nine seconds, and it\u2019s just unusable when it\u2019s like that,\u201d Mr. Limp said. \u201cNow it\u2019s often 1,000 milliseconds or 1,200 milliseconds.\u201dThe speed makes a crucial difference. Compared with the trudge of chatting with Siri, speaking to Alexa feels natural, closer to speaking to a human than a machine \u2014 and even when it gets your request wrong, which in your early days with the device will happen often, it doesn\u2019t feel like you have paid a huge penalty for trying.More important, just like the early iPhone, Amazon has managed to turn the Echo into the center of a new ecosystem. Developers are flocking to create voice-controlled apps for the device, or skills, as Amazon calls them. There are now more than 300 skills for the Echo, from the trivial \u2014 there is one to make Alexa produce rude body sounds on command \u2014 to the pretty handy. It can tell you transit schedules, start a seven-minute workout, read recipes, do math and conversions, and walk you through adventure games, among other possibilities.Makers of digital home devices like Nest are also rushing to make their products compatible with the Echo. Alexa can now control your Internet-connected lights, home thermostats and a variety of other devices. Hardware makers can also add Alexa\u2019s brain into their own devices, so soon you won\u2019t need an Echo to consult with Alexa \u2014 you could find it in your toaster, your refrigerator or your car.The Echo also ties in to Amazon\u2019s main business, its retail store. When you tell it to reorder popcorn, it gets your order through Amazon, of course. Still, Mr. Wingo noted that Amazon had so far kept the platform relatively open \u2014 other retailers and product manufacturers are free to build their own apps that will allow for interactions with their stores.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Bud Collins, Who Covered Tennis With Authority and Flash, Dies at 86", "Date": "2016-03-04", "News": "Supported byBud Collins, the passionate, often irreverent face of tennis for nearly half a century in his Wimbledon broadcasts and his newspaper and magazine columns, died on Friday at his home in Brookline, Mass. He was 86.Mr. Collins had largely been away from tennis since tearing tendons in his left leg in a fall at his hotel room while attending the 2011 United States Open in New York. The injury required many surgical procedures.But last September, accompanied by Ms. Klaussen, he attended a ceremony at the Open in which the new media center was named in his honor. A plaque for him reads, \u201cJournalist, Commentator, Historian, Mentor, Friend.\u201d\u201cEither the ball goes over the net or it doesn\u2019t,\u201d Mr. Collins wrote in the opening sentence of \u201cBud Collins\u2019 Modern Encyclopedia of Tennis.\u201d Having stripped the sport to its essence, he nonetheless observed, \u201cFor some degenerates, tennis is a way of life, even a religion.\u201dIt was much that way with Mr. Collins, who popularized tennis for millions of Americans in its boom years after the emergence of the Open era in 1968, when professionals were finally allowed to compete for the major championships.Mr. Collins was a flamboyant part of the tennis scene. Balding and sometimes bearded, he could be spotted in a crowd by his wardrobe, one that favored bow ties and his custom-made signature slacks. Yellow, violet and burgundy were among his favorites, and strawberry embellishments were added for Wimbledon.Reporting on tennis for NBC, he was best known for \u201cBreakfast at Wimbledon,\u201d his play-by-play and commentary at the tournament\u2019s finals, broadcast live on weekend mornings.But Mr. Collins considered himself as much a print journalist as a TV personality. His first bylined article in The Boston Globe appeared in December 1963, when he covered Davis Cup play in Australia. His final article for the newspaper appeared in September 2011, when he was reporting on the United States Open. He was a writer and senior editor at World Tennis magazine. His encyclopedia, written with Zander Hollander and first published in 1980, went through several editions, and he followed it with \u201cThe Bud Collins History of Tennis\u201d and \u201cTotal Tennis.\u201dWhile he focused on tennis, he mused about anything that caught his eye in his travel column, \u201cAnywhere,\u201d and he covered combat in the Vietnam War.Mr. Collins was much the showman. He often quoted his imaginary Uncle Studley\u2019s reflections on tennis. Steffi Graf was \u201cFraulein Forehand,\u201d Bjorn Borg was \u201cthe Angelic Assassin\u201d and the hard-serving Venus and Serena Williams were \u201cSisters Sledgehammer.\u201d He considered himself the representative of the everyday player, or the hacker, as he put it.Mr. Collins did the play-by-play for \u201cBreakfast at Wimbledon\u201d at its inception in 1979, after NBC had previously confined coverage to taped matches. In 1983, NBC shifted him to analysis and interviews when Dick Enberg was given the main broadcasting role.\u201cBud\u2019s enthusiasm when he\u2019s doing play-by-play can be a little overwhelming,\u201d Michael Weisman, the executive producer of NBC Sports, told Sports Illustrated in 1985. \u201cIt goes back to my philosophy that less is more. I\u2019m a big fan of Bud\u2019s, but I thought if he made only one reference to his uncle instead of six, it might play better.\u201dMr. Collins was dropped by NBC in 2007 after 35 years with the network; afterward, he broadcast for ESPN and the Tennis Channel while continuing to write a column for The Globe.\u201cThe guy is utterly unique,\u201d the sportswriter Frank Deford wrote on Sports Illustrated\u2019s website in the summer of 2007, expressing his dismay when NBC dropped Mr. Collins. \u201cThere isn\u2019t another American journalist so identified with his sport as Bud is with tennis. He is the very soul of the game \u2014 as historian, as authority, as devotee, as enthusiast.\u201dHe was a fine player, as well. Mr. Collins won the national indoor mixed doubles at Longwood Cricket Club in suburban Boston in 1961, teaming with Janet Hopps, and he reached the final of the French Open senior men\u2019s doubles in 1975, playing with Jack Crawford. He was inducted into the International Tennis Hall of Fame in Newport, R.I., in 1994.His reverence for tennis did not extend to the bureaucracy that ruled it in the amateur era. Writing in Sports Illustrated in February 1968 as the Open era dawned, he described the United States National Lawn Tennis Association as \u201can organization that, in terms of efficiency and coordination, rivals that of the New York Mets.\u201dArthur Worth Collins Jr. was born on June 17, 1929, in Lima, Ohio, and grew up in Berea, where his father was the athletic director and a coach at Baldwin-Wallace College. As a youngster, Mr. Collins thrilled to radio broadcasts of the United States Nationals from Forest Hills, Queens.At age 18, he drove with two high school friends to Forest Hills for the 1947 Nationals \u2014 the forerunner of the United States Open \u2014 arriving there just as play was ending for that day.\u201cSprinting up a steep concrete stairway, we burst through a portal and were stunned by a green flash,\u201d he wrote in his memoir, \u201cMy Life With the Pros\u201d (1989). \u201cTwo men in white were still playing to a congregation of perhaps two hundred. The minarets of the Forest Hills Inn and the groves of Forest Hills Gardens, the comfortable residential pocket in which the club nestles, stood confidently in the gloaming, sturdy defenders of the faith, gray against an azure evening. Forest Hills. It was indeed revelation to the weary, sticky pilgrims, a romantic encounter.\u201dMr. Collins played tennis at Baldwin-Wallace and graduated in 1951. After Army service, he enrolled at Boston University, seeking a master\u2019s degree in public relations, but left to join The Boston Herald\u2019s sports staff.He covered tennis for the first time when his editor apologetically sent him to Longwood for an event when everyone else on the paper\u2019s sports staff was shunning tennis, considered by many at the time as an outpost for elitist amateurs.Mr. Collins became The Herald\u2019s lead sports columnist in 1959. He also coached the Brandeis University tennis team, whose roster included Abbie Hoffman, destined for far greater notice in the counterculture movement of the 1960s.Mr. Collins moved to The Globe in 1963, when he also began broadcasting tournaments for WGBH, Boston\u2019s educational television outlet, which pioneered TV coverage of the sport.He covered the Nationals for NBC in 1964 and the United States Open for CBS from 1968 to 1972, then returned to NBC to cover Wimbledon and other major events.In May 2009, Boston University awarded him the master\u2019s degree in public relations he had never completed, citing his writings on the history of tennis as sufficiently scholarly.Besides his wife, Mr. Collins is survived by his stepchildren from that marriage, Danielle Klaussen and Karl Klaussen; a daughter, Suzanna Mathews, from his first marriage, to Palmer Collins, which ended in divorce; his stepchildren Betsy Bartelt, Kristin Hunt, Sharon McMillan and Gretchen West from his second marriage, to Mary Lou Barnum, who died in 1990; Rob Lacy, a son of Judy Lacy, a companion of Collins\u2019s and now deceased, whom he raised with her; and 11 grandchildren, The Globe reported.When the United States Tennis Association announced it would take the United States Open out of Forest Hills and move it to Flushing Meadows-Corona Park, Mr. Collins reflected on some of the great names and matches in remembering the setting that had entranced him on first blush while a teenager.But Mr. Collins shunned unvarnished sentimentality.\u201cThe towers of an inn become shabby still look good at a distance,\u201d he wrote, \u201cand Forest Hills Gardens remains a pleasant residential enclave. But the effect is fleeting, probably because the floodlights have been turned on for night play, and the stadium floor is now down to the gritty, and drab clay courts have replaced most of the handsome lawns.\u201cThere is really no way to recreate Forest Hills-as-it-was any more than you can recreate a first love.\u201dAn earlier version of this obituary misspelled the surname of the executive producer of NBC Sports, who was quoted about Mr. Collins. He is Michael Weisman, not Wiseman.An obituary on Saturday about the tennis broadcaster and journalist Bud Collins misstated the year he was inducted into the International Tennis Hall of Fame in Newport, R.I. It was 1994, not 1984.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Selling High-End Socks by Giving Them Away", "Date": "2016-03-19", "News": "Supported byRevaluedDavid Heath, a 32-year-old entrepreneur wearing customized black and pink Nikes, hovered near the lunch line at the Bowery Mission, one of New York\u2019s oldest homeless shelters.\u201cWant a pair of socks?\u201d he asked an aging man in a tattered black coat who had come indoors on a cold, rainy afternoon.\u201cI would love a pair of socks,\u201d the man said. \u201cJust what I need.\u201dMr. Heath handed the man a pair of new high-end cotton socks and turned his attention to the next person in line.Along with his pal Randy Goldberg, Mr. Heath is a co-founder of Bombas, a start-up based in New York that makes what it calls \u201cthe most innovative sock in the last 20 years.\u201dPricing its socks, which feature neon colors with a bee logo, at up to $18 a pair, Bombas has been developing a reputation for design and for its business model. For every pair that the company sells, it gives a pair to someone in need.While it may be tempting to write off Mr. Goldberg and Mr. Heath as millennial do-gooders piggybacking on poverty to make a quick buck, the Bombas co-founders say they are addressing a real need. Socks, it turns out, are the most requested item at homeless shelters. (Shelters won\u2019t accept used socks, not many socks are donated, and people living on the street wear through pairs quickly.)It was this sobering fact that inspired the Bombas founders to start their company in 2013. A few years on, they have donated more than 900,000 pairs of socks.By building altruism into its business model, Bombas joins a growing list of so-called buy-one-give-one companies. Toms, a shoemaker based in Los Angeles, pioneered the idea. It gives away a pair of shoes to children in the developing world for each pair it sells. In recent years, the approach has expanded to companies making eyeglasses, snack bars, soap, toothbrushes and even pet food.But as the buy-one-give-one companies have proliferated, so have questions about the model\u2019s efficacy, and even its ethics. Impoverished children don\u2019t need shoes as much as education and clean drinking water, goes one line of criticism. Others pointed out that by flooding a community with free shoes, a company like Toms was effectively putting local shoe stores out of business.That may be a worthwhile venture, but at some point, the connection between profit and benevolence becomes strained. \u201cOpportunities exist for smoke and mirrors, sleights of hand and confusion on the part of the consumer,\u201d said Katherine Klein, head of the Social Impact Initiative at the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania.Writing in The Journal of Consumer Psychology last year, a group of professors referred to the practice as \u201cguilt laundering.\u201d And yet despite these critiques, buy-one-give-one companies are not only doing good, but also thriving.Mr. Heath and Mr. Goldberg were colleagues at a lifestyle website when they learned \u2014 via a Facebook post \u2014 that socks were the most requested items in homeless shelters. Keen to start their own company and solve that problem, they spent the next couple of years researching the sock business and developing prototypes.It didn\u2019t take long for the men to arrive at a conclusion: \u201cMost socks aren\u2019t very comfortable,\u201d Mr. Heath said. The sock business was ripe for disruption, they decided.After dozens of iterations, the Bombas founders developed a sock with several new features: a seamless toe, a cushioned foot bed, an arch support system, elastic that keeps long socks up and blister tabs on the backs of ankle socks.\u201cIf we build a better pair of socks, we can sell more socks,\u201d Mr. Heath said. \u201cAnd if we sell more socks, we can donate more socks.\u201dIn October 2013, Bombas raised $145,000 through Indiegogo, a crowdfunding site. A year later, the company raised a $1 million seed round from friends and family. To date, Bombas has sold more than 900,000 pairs of socks.As Mr. Heath and Mr. Goldberg have developed their business, they have learned from the stumbles of their buy-one-give-one peers. Instead of trying to solve problems in distant lands, the founders have focused on giving their socks to homeless shelters in the United States.\u201cIf other companies can do this for developing world countries, why can\u2019t we do this to solve a problem that people don\u2019t even know is right here in our backyard?\u201d Mr. Heath said.And rather than lead their pitch with the social mission, they try to keep the focus on what they say are the most comfortable socks on the market.\u201cIt\u2019s a fine line between exploiting the people you\u2019re trying to help and helping those people,\u201d Mr. Heath said.Homeless advocates say their help is welcome, however it arrives. \u201cSocks are one of the most needed but often the least donated items at shelters,\u201d said Megan Hustings, interim director of the National Coalition for the Homeless. \u201cAnything that works to get those socks to people is good.\u201dThe socks that Bombas gives away differ slightly from those that it sells. The donated socks feature reinforced seams for added durability, dark colors that show less wear and an antimicrobial treatment that prevents odors and germs.While Bombas employees distribute some socks personally, they send most of the donations to charity partners like Hannah\u2019s Socks, a group in Ohio that has distributed 100,000 pairs to local shelters.Giving away so many socks comes at a cost. In 2014, when Mr. Heath and Mr. Goldberg appeared on \u201cShark Tank,\u201d the reality television show where entrepreneurs pitch investors, their buy-one-give-one model came under fire.\u201cYou have to double your sales to give me the equivalent returns I get from a company that\u2019s not doing the same thing,\u201d said Kevin O\u2019Leary, one of the hosts, declining to invest.Another host, Mark Cuban, the billionaire owner of the Dallas Mavericks basketball team, said the price point for socks was too low to justify the $4 million valuation the Bombas founders were seeking.Finally, Daymond John, founder of the Fubu clothing line, agreed to invest $200,000 for 17.5 percent of the company, or a valuation slightly over $1 million. (After the show, the terms of his investment were renegotiated.) It was a humbling outing for the founders, who are now seeking more funding.Yet even without a heady valuation, Bombas is enjoying a growth spurt. Sales reached $4.6 million last year, and are expected to hit $7.4 million this year. The average pair sells for about $11.During their recent visit to the Bowery Mission, while Mr. Heath and Mr. Goldberg handed out socks, Bombas employees served stewed chicken, quinoa and tomatoes to more than 200 people who had turned up at the shelter in the rain.As Mr. Heath engaged in charity, he addressed a thorny issue. Was Bombas exploiting people\u2019s sympathy in order to make a buck? And if it was, did that even matter?\u201cAs far as people washing away their guilt, that\u2019s fine,\u201d Mr. Heath said. \u201cWe\u2019re doing something good with the purchases they\u2019re making. If they feel good about themselves, great.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Apple Is Rolling Up Backers in iPhone Privacy Fight Against F.B.I.", "Date": "2016-03-03", "News": "Supported byThe extraordinary show of support for Apple from the tech companies, including many rivals, underscores how high the stakes are for the industry with the case, in which the authorities are demanding Apple\u2019s help to break into an iPhone used by a gunman in a terrorist attack in San Bernardino, Calif., last year.In all, around 40 companies and organizations, along with several dozen individuals, submitted more than a dozen briefs this week to the Federal District Court for the District of Central California, challenging every legal facet of the government\u2019s case, like its free speech implications, the importance of encryption and concerns about government overreach.\u201cThese companies, which are often fierce competitors, have joined together to voice concern about the attempted government overreach in this case, which threatens the integrity and security of their products and privacy rights of consumers in general,\u201d said Neal Katyal, a lawyer at Hogan Lovells for the tech companies and a former acting solicitor general of the United States.Edward J. McAndrew, a lawyer at Ballard Spahr who is not involved in the Apple matter, said it was highly unusual to see a flood of briefs by so many parties this early in a case. He called the outpouring \u201cSupreme Court-level advocacy\u201d and said the campaign was intended to have influence beyond the court with legislators and others.\u201cThis is a show of force,\u201d said Mr. McAndrew, a former federal prosecutor who focused on online crimes. \u201cThis is a battle for public opinion.\u201dBruce Sewell, Apple\u2019s general counsel, said on Wednesday that the company was \u201chumbled by the outpouring of support.\u201dA group of Internet companies submitted this court brief supporting Apple in the case in which the government is seeking Apple\u2019s help to break into an iPhone used by a gunman in the San Bernardino terrorist attack.In the brief on Thursday from Amazon, Microsoft and others, the tech companies said they shared the public\u2019s outrage over the \u201cheinous act of terrorism\u201d in San Bernardino, but said they were united in the view that the government\u2019s case exceeded the boundaries of existing law and would hurt Americans\u2019 security.In the filing from the group that includes Twitter and LinkedIn, the companies said the government \u201cseeks unbounded authority to compel Apple to design software that does not currently exist and that will circumvent and undermine security measures intended to protect its users\u2019 data.\u201d\u201cWe\u2019re facing a very big question as a country, industry and a world about what privacy will look like in the digital era,\u201d said Aaron Levie, the chief executive of the data storage company Box, which signed on to the brief with Amazon, Google and others. \u201cThere is a global impact for these tech companies if we don\u2019t land on the right side of having a strong framework for how companies deal with security and these kinds of requests in the digital age.\u201dApart from the tech companies, seven prominent security experts and 32 law professors signed on to joint briefs on Thursday. Several industry trade organizations and digital rights groups submitted their own filings this week.The technology company has been locked in a major legal battle against law enforcement officials over privacy and security.Some echoed Apple\u2019s slippery slope argument that opening up one iPhone would lead to a domino effect from governments worldwide. The Media Institute, a nonprofit research foundation that focuses on communications policy, warned in its filing that the court\u2019s order could be \u201cbe applied against media companies as government authorities seek to acquire access to confidential information stored on mobile devices used by journalists.\u201dThe support for Apple was a torrent compared with the stream of filings backing the Justice Department in the case. Among the staunchest supporters on the side of government were six people whose family members were killed in the California attack.\u201cBroader questions about the fate of smartphone encryption and data privacy can be saved for another day and another forum,\u201d the families wrote in a brief. \u201cThis case certainly presents the conditions \u2014 a mass murder by terrorists implicating national security interest \u2014 where requiring Apple\u2019s technical assistance is at its apex.\u201dStephen G. Larson, the lawyer representing the victims\u2019 families, said he was frustrated that Apple was drawing a line in the sand \u201cover a phone that didn\u2019t even belong to the terrorist and that they have permission to unlock.\u201d The iPhone of the San Bernardino attacker, Syed Rizwan Farook, was issued by his employer.\u201cSo many of Apple\u2019s arguments are red herrings because this is not about privacy more than any other search in a criminal investigation is about privacy,\u201d Mr. Larson said. \u201cThat is scaremongering and that is false.\u201dA handful of law enforcement groups also filed briefs supporting the government\u2019s position, including a joint one from the Federal Law Enforcement Officers Association, the Association of Prosecuting Attorneys and the National Sheriffs\u2019 Association.Those groups listed several instances when iPhone data was an essential piece of a criminal case, including child pornography and sex trafficking cases.

{"Headline": "Twitter at 10: \u2018A Window Into Other Lives\u2019", "Date": "2016-03-21", "News": "AdvertisementWhen I was a teenager in the \u201990s, your public square was the coffee shop. Today our public square isn\u2019t a building. It\u2019s Twitter. It\u2019s Facebook. And the thing that\u2019s on the line here is: Are women going to be included in shaping the future, or are we going to be silenced and basically bullied out of getting the vote? Engineers built society, so the stakes could not be any higher. The beauty of Twitter is that it has connected me to some of the smartest women I have ever known in my life. It also organizes this harassment against us in a way that is unparalleled. It is absolutely imperative that Twitter get serious about solving this problem.What Twitter has done, specifically for traditionally marginalized and underrepresented communities, has redefined the public sphere. When I think about Missouri, people would\u2019ve convinced you that we just did not exist in August 2014. Twitter was where the links were shared. It was where the images were shared. Literally, when people were told what was happening, it galvanized the nation. The question for me is: How does Twitter continue to attract the people who want to share information in this way to the platform? For some reason, other platforms have made it a race to the number of users. It makes people feel comfortable from a metrics standpoint but it\u2019s a misunderstanding of the power of the platform. I would describe my first experiences with Twitter (before June 2015) as positive. It felt good to be able to have a platform for networking with others globally around shared goals, causes and interests. I saw Twitter as a tool for education, awareness and networking \u2014 a platform that could organize activism and positive change. My experience changed when my personal life and identity came under such fierce media scrutiny last summer. In the wake of negative press, my relationship with Twitter switched instantly from love to hate. What once was a casual and positive place to go online became a space where I was mocked, bullied and even threatened. I think obviously there are a lot of good things about Twitter. I think the civil liberties aspect of Twitter is great and is changing things, as opposed to pulling private individuals out of the crowd and making them responsible for systemic failings. Within the world of Twitter, it\u2019s changed the way people talk to each other. In my experience, that hasn\u2019t leaked over to regular exchanges offline. To me, Twitter is like a lot of things on the Internet: It tells you where to start, but it doesn\u2019t tell you where to end. It allows fans to be more up close and personal. Whereas in the past all the things you knew about athletes were just what you saw on the court or on TV, nowadays they get to know you as a person. They follow your every move, they see what kind of slang you speak with, they get to learn the things you like to do. They literally get a chance to follow you as a person, not just as an athlete.We miss the dominant newspaper days, though it\u2019s hard to pinpoint how much of that has to do with the evolution of Twitter and the digital day we\u2019re now living in. Had neither come along, we might still be sitting at the kitchen table, sipping our coffee, reading the newspaper, rather than hearing about who the next Supreme Court justice is, at almost the same time he is selected. Twitter is evidence of our ability to flock. It is a spontaneous force of flocking of our species. Who would\u2019ve even thought that was a thing that could happen? For me, Twitter has primarily been a window, or windows, into other lives and perspectives. Social injustice, for instance, is not adequately exposed in the media; presumably, it has never been. If we\u2019d had the equivalent of Twitter decades ago, would crimes against persons of color, ethnic minorities, women, children have been hidden as they were? For instance, the media did not report lynchings, particularly in the South; presumably, if Twitter had existed, such crimes could not have been hidden, as police brutality and misconduct have been hidden. I made a choice to raise my kids, but of course continued to be a movie/TV nerd and take screenwriting classes at night and weekends and write online \u2013 something I\u2019d been doing since the late nineties because I\u2019m an insane person. I\u2019d become friends with acclaimed television writer Jhoni Marchinko very early on, on Twitter. She told me my life with my kids was funny, was what TV was made of. That was an inspirational and mentor type of relationship what wouldn\u2019t have been possible without Twitter. Interviews have been condensed and edited for clarity.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "After Complaints on Wounded Warrior Project, Pressure From Donors", "Date": "2016-03-11", "News": "Supported byWhen the Wounded Warrior Project was hit in January with multiple accusations in the news media of lavish spending on travel, conferences and public relations, and a toxic corporate culture, Fred Kane, one of its major fund-raisers, was stunned by the organization\u2019s response.\u201cWhy was that poor guy placed in front of a CBS News crew?\u201d Mr. Kane, who has raised more than $325,000 for the organization, asked in an email sent in February to dozens of high-level donors. \u201cWhere was Steve Nardizzi and why didn\u2019t he face the reporter?\u201d Mr. Kane asked, naming the outspoken chief executive who had been accused of much of the excess.Mr. Kane said the leader\u2019s failure to take responsibility \u201cshows a total lack of regard for the mission, the alumni, the employees, proud supporter organizations and the thousands of other individual and corporate donors.\u201d He canceled his own contributions and encouraged others to do the same.That moment in February was part of the building pressure by donors, veterans and supporters of the organization that culminated Thursday night in the abrupt firing of Mr. Nardizzi and his second in command, Al Giordano, who together earned nearly $1 million per year. By the time the board met Thursday to dismiss the two men, contributions were down and it had in hand an internal investigation that convinced it that the top leadership had to go.Mr. Odierno, who is the son of Gen. Raymond Odierno, a former chief of staff of the Army, became the group\u2019s interim chief executive Thursday evening and is conducting a nationwide search for a new leader. In an interview Friday, he said donations had fallen, but declined to say by how much. \u201cRight now we are in a position where we can still meet our obligations,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I am concerned about our ability to meet our obligations in the future.\u201dMr. Nardizzi and Mr. Giordano did not return repeated calls to their cellphones. By Friday afternoon, both phones had been disconnected.The group\u2019s founder, a wounded Marine named John Melia, announced late Friday that he was interested in returning to the organization, which he left in 2009 after a dispute with Mr. Nardizzi and Mr. Giordano. Mr. Melia could not be reached, but Julie Melia, his former wife, said, \u201cHe feels he can help get it back in the good direction.\u201dThe Wounded Warrior Project began in 2003 as a basement nonprofit organization run by Mr. Melia, who was wounded in a helicopter crash off Somalia. He started by handing out backpacks of comfort items to wounded troops. As the group grew, it expanded its programs and brought on Mr. Nardizzi, a lawyer who had never served in the military, and his longtime friend, Mr. Giordano.Mr. Nardizzi took over the organization, based in Jacksonville, Fla., in 2009. That year, he doubled the spending on fund-raising and started running television ads imploring viewers to send in donations. Money poured in. Since 2009, the group raised nearly $1 billion.About 40 percent of the organization\u2019s donations in 2014 were spent on its overhead, or about $124 million, according to the charity-rating group Charity Navigator.The organization initially denied the accusations and demanded retractions, but then went silent.Employees say Mr. Nardizzi vanished from view, refusing to talk to the news media, stopping his weekly addresses to the staff, and even disappearing from the halls of the group\u2019s offices. His tweets and Facebook posts stopped.\u201cIt was like he had been kidnapped,\u201d said one employee who did not want to speak publicly because she feared being fired. \u201cThere was no one there to tell us what was going on or how we were going to get through this.\u201dAfter Mr. Kane\u2019s email to other donors, he said he got a call from Mr. Giordano. Mr. Kane said he lambasted Mr. Giordano for hiding behind a wounded veteran on camera and said he would cancel his donations.Mr. Giordano tried to refute the news media accounts, Mr. Kane said, and explained that the executives\u2019 silence had been recommended by a public relations firm as a way to defuse criticism.\u201cIt made me sick,\u201d Mr. Kane said Friday in an interview. \u201cThey needed to take responsibility, and they weren\u2019t doing it.\u201dWhile top executives kept a low profile, the organization\u2019s board pursued an independent investigation, conducted by outside lawyers who combed through financial filings and interviewed more than 50 current and former employees.The board refused to make the report public, but in a summary it found among other things that $26 million had been spent on conferences and events from Oct. 1, 2013 to Sept. 30, 2014. It said that 94 percent of the travel spending \u201cwas associated with program services delivered to Wounded Warriors and their families.\u201d It noted that the retreat at the Broadmoor cost about $1 million, not $3 million as CBS News had reported. But it added that such events would be \u201ccurtailed in the future.\u201dIt did not dispute findings reported by The Times, including that the organization had fired a number of wounded veterans with little cause.Mr. Odierno said the board took issue with \u201ccultural and policy findings\u201d as well as financial issues when deciding to replace the organization\u2019s top leaders.Board members called a few former employees this week to thank them for coming forward.Though many have criticized him for spending too much on fund-raising, and some charity watchdogs downgraded Wounded Warrior Project\u2019s rating for its overhead spending, Mr. Nardizzi argued that an organization could not serve its mission without upfront investment.The charity grew to offer more services in more locations, but in the process, former employees said, it became wasteful, spending millions on travel, food, drinks and team-building trips for staff members.It also began to focus on programs like group bike rides and concert-ticket handouts that left many staff members wondering about how much they were helping veterans.\u201cIt\u2019s a fund-raising machine that is a grant-maker for a number of other veterans organizations,\u201d said Phillip Carter, a fellow at the Center for a New American Security, which also gets funding from the organization. \u201cIf that money goes away, it\u2019s not clear these groups can make it on their own.\u201dAn article on Saturday about the dismissal of two executives of the Wounded Warrior Project quoted incorrectly from a comment by Phillip Carter, a fellow at the Center for a New American Security, who discussed the value of the organization in helping other veterans groups. He called the Wounded Warrior Project \u201ca fund-raising machine that is a grant-maker\u201d \u2014 not a \u201crent-maker\u201d \u2014 for other organizations.Advertisement"}

He also planned events in Akron, Ohio, Charlotte, N.C., and St. Charles, Mo., before ending the day of nonstop campaigning with an evening rally in Chicago.Focused on winning as many Democratic convention delegates as possible and trying to deliver another surprise victory in the Midwest, Mr. Sanders continued to attack Hillary Clinton for supporting \u00e2\u0080\u009cdisastrous\u00e2\u0080\u009d trade policies and cast her as part of the reason so many manufacturing jobs have been lost.  In Youngstown, Ohio, Mr. Sanders expressed confidence about Tuesday\u00e2\u0080\u0099s races as he told thousands of people that he needed them to come out in droves to support him.\u00e2\u0080\u009cIn the last 10 months, we have won nine states, eight of them with double-digit victories,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Sanders said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd nobody expected us to have won Michigan last week.

If people come out, we are going to win Ohio.\u00e2\u0080\u009dThe senator, however, also stressed that his ability to win was closely connected with voter turnout. In a now familiar plea, Mr. Sanders told the crowd that if voter turnout was high he would win Ohio and other states, but if voter turnout was low, he would lose.He said corporations need to be pressured to stop making American workers compete with workers in other countries who make pennies an hour.\u00e2\u0080\u009c\u00e2\u0080\u0098Our disastrous trade policies, NAFTA, CAFTA, permanent normal trade relations with China have cost this country millions of decent paying jobs,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Sanders said as the crowd booed. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIn Ohio alone from 1994 to 2015, this state lost 300,000 manufacturing jobs, 31 percent of its factory jobs.\u00e2\u0080\u009dMr. Sanders went on to argue that Mrs. Clinton had sided with businesses over everyday people. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhen it came down to whether to stand with corporate America, the people who wrote these agreements, or whether to stand with the working people of this country, I proudly stood with the workers,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Sanders said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cSecretary Clinton stood with the big money interests.\u00e2\u0080\u009dHe also attacked Mrs. Clinton for being backed by \u201csuper PACs\u201d and for taking campaign contributions from Wall Street, pharmaceutical companies, and the fossil fuel industry.

{"Headline": "Supreme Court Nomination Drives Groups From Left and Right to Fight", "Date": "2016-03-16", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 More than 100 protest rallies are being scheduled in key electoral states like Ohio, Pennsylvania, Illinois, Wisconsin, New Hampshire and Iowa. Television advertisements are being scripted. Twitter and Facebook campaigns are rolling out, and email blasts are filling up inboxes.\u201cBork and Thomas, those were titanic battles,\u201d said Curt A. Levey, the executive director of FreedomWorks Foundation, a conservative group, referring to the Supreme Court nomination fights over Robert H. Bork in 1987 and Clarence Thomas in 1991. \u201cI think this will be the biggest battle of all. \u201dAs one measure of the scale of the fight, several former top aides to Mr. Obama, including Stephanie Cutter, Katie Beirne Fallon and Anita Dunn, are joining to create a nonprofit group they will call Constitutional Responsibility Project to coordinate the campaign by liberal groups and perhaps buy television ads.The White House on Wednesday declined to say whether the White House would coordinate with the groups to push for Judge Garland.Part of the intensity of the effort on both sides is a reflection of the diverse range of special interest groups that have decided to engage in what will be the first confirmation fight in an age in which social media has become a dominant force. In many cases, the groups have set aside longstanding tensions that have prevented them from teaming up in a unified way.On the right, conservative groups like Heritage Action, which have in the past sparred with Senator Mitch McConnell, the Kentucky Republican and majority leader, are already working closely with his office to back up his call that the Senate should wait until the next president is sworn in to fill the court vacancy. Judge Garland was approved by the Senate to the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit in a 76-to-23 vote in 1997.The House Majority PAC, which supports Democrats, sent out a solicitation urging recipients to contribute money \u201cto help us support President Obama\u2019s Supreme Court nominee.\u201d\u201cIt is different than a lot of the fights over the last five or six years,\u201d said Dan Holler, a Heritage Action spokesman. \u201cThe unity on the right is pretty remarkable and encouraging.\u201d\u201cThere is an incredibly diverse and deep coalition of organizations that have left their institutional egos at the door and have come together for the purpose of advancing a unified goal,\u201d said Wade Henderson, the president of the liberal Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights, whose civil rights organization hosted leaders from 30 to 40 groups at its offices last Friday.Liberal groups see their push as a win-win: If the Senate Republicans decline to hold hearings or vote on Judge Garland, they are convinced the protests they are busy organizing will help Democrats pick up at least some Senate seats.\u201cIf we apply enough political pressure, McConnell will see the majority slipping out of his hands and he will relent,\u201d said Brad Woodhouse, president of the progressive advocacy group Americans United for Change. \u201cIf not, we are still going to extract a political price and we will just do this all next year with President Clinton.\u201dMany of the liberal events, at least according to the plan, are going to feature speakers like construction workers or nurses \u2014 to emphasize the \u201cDo your job\u201d theme.On the right, there is a similar sense that a high-profile nomination fight will motivate their core supporters \u2014 which is why a broad range of conservative causes, from the Federalist Society, a legal group; Americans United for Life, an anti-abortion group; and Gun Owners of America are prepared to invest so much effort in this debate.\u201cWe want to make sure that people recognize what is at stake \u2014 when it comes to issues like the death penalty, gun rights and immigration,\u201d said Carrie Severino of Judicial Crisis Network. She said her group intended to spend up to $2 million and to target Democratic senators from more conservative states, like Joe Donnelly of Indiana, Joe Manchin III of West Virginia and Michael Bennet of Colorado, who is up for re-election in 2016.Merrick B. Garland is a candidate who had support from Republicans in the past but would still move the court in a progressive direction.The first part of the push will focus on senators back in their home states during the recess that starts next week. MoveOn.org plans a \u201cNational Day of Action,\u201d which organizers say will involve more than 50 rallies on Monday alone, mostly in states where Senate Republicans are up for re-election. Conservatives plan their own events during the recess, although the details are still being worked out.Republicans are likely to focus the debate on the process while Democrats will try to highlight the personal story of Judge Garland.\u00a0Mr. Obama\u2019s decision to select Judge Garland, a white man, has, at least among some liberal activists, deflated their enthusiasm for the fight. \u201cPresident Obama failed to use this opportunity to add the voice of another progressive woman of color to the Supreme Court,\u201d Charles Chamberlain, the executive director of Democracy for America, said in a statement. But Mr. Henderson, who is black and runs a civil-rights group, played down this split, saying President Obama had already appointed a record number of women and minorities as federal judges.The U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the National Association of Manufacturers, so far at least, plan not to play an active role in the fight.But there will still be some major industry groups involved, like the National Federation of Independent Business, which for the first time in its 73-year history has decided to mobilize, citing several continuing cases that its leaders fear could \u201cradically expand the federal government\u2019s control over the economy,\u201d including a court fight over pending clean air and clean water environmental rules.A \u201ccoordinated validator push\u201d is what Amy Brundage, a former Obama White House deputy communications director, called it. She is now at SKDKnickerbocker, a political consulting firm that is helping with the Supreme Court push.R. Bruce Josten, the top lobbyist at the Chamber of Commerce, said that to him, the biggest challenge for both sides was going to be keeping the American public interested in the debate if the Senate holds no hearings and takes no votes.\u201cThey are going to have manufactured something to continue to cause stories to be written,\u201d he said. \u201cThat is a tall order.\u201dGardiner Harris contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

In an appearance on \u201cFox and Friends\u201d on Monday, Mr. Trump joked with the hosts that he wouldn\u2019t get into the \u201cdetails\u201d of the birth, but pointed out that Theodore James Kushner had arrived \u201con Easter, so we have an Easter baby, which is beautiful,\u201d Mr. Trump said. Ms. Trump, even while many months pregnant, was a frequent presence by her father\u2019s side this year in places like Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina during voting contests in those states. Mr. Trump mentioned at countless rallies about how his daughter was about to give birth at any moment, and how great it would be if it happened in whatever state he was in at that moment. Last week, in a speech at the American Israel Public Affairs Conference, Mr. Trump said his daughter, who converted to Judaism, was about to have a \u201cbeautiful Jewish baby.\u201d Steve Eder contributed reporting.\n\t\tFirst Draft provides fast-paced and comprehensive coverage of politics and elections by The New York Times.

{"Headline": "Florida Town Curbs Debauchery, and Pays the Price", "Date": "2016-03-21", "News": "Supported byPANAMA CITY BEACH, Fla. \u2014 The sun was sublime, the flour-soft sand could scarcely have been more tempting and the D.J. music thumped loudly enough to jiggle the beer cups resting on nearby tables. All that was missing were the throngs of booze-soaked, sunburned spring breakers who usually swarm this beach town during March.The scarcity of the party-hard population was no accident. Last year, after a particularly rowdy spring break that saw an alleged sexual assault on a crowded beach in broad daylight (it was recorded and went viral) and gunfire at a house party that injured seven partygoers, local officials clamped down. They passed more than 20 ordinances to curb the debauchery, drinking and violence that they had concluded was marring the town\u2019s image. In response, students sprinted to Facebook, Twitter, Snapchat and Instagram, quickly spreading the news \u2014 using the hashtag #RIPPCB (Rest in Peace Panama City Beach) \u2014 that the party here was over.Amplified through the social media megaphone, the drop was far steeper than even the businesses who opposed the measures had anticipated. Last week, peak time for spring break, scores of bars, restaurants, clubs, hotels, fast-food franchises and taxi companies that typically see their March profits bulge sat forlorn, with some reporting a 90 percent drop in customers.\u201cThere were a lot more unintended consequences than anyone imagined,\u201d said Jack Bishop, the owner of the popular waterfront restaurant and bar Harpoon Harry\u2019s. \u201cWe never dreamed it would be this bad so quickly. This tells you the power of the 24-hour news cycle and social media. I\u2019m down 72 percent for the month.\u201dLast week, Miami Beach dealt with its own rash of bad news: Rowdy spring break brawls on Ocean Drive led to the fatal shooting of a 20-year-old Florida man. The city has now rolled out its own restrictions and stepped up law enforcement. And despite Panama City Beach\u2019s stricter laws, one college student fell to his death from a parking garage balcony last week after drinking all day, and another died from an alcohol and drug overdose.In this small, conservative town with a Southern sensibility, the past year\u2019s debate over spring break has been painful and divisive. Owners and employees of many small businesses have accused politicians of overreach, warning the economy would be badly hurt. But many of the area\u2019s older residents and elected officials argue that spring break here had badly deteriorated, becoming far too raunchy, boozy, dangerous and dirty, and risked turning off families.To fight the problem, officials stepped up law enforcement, and the city and county passed more than 20 ordinances. The new laws, mostly in effect only in March, required bars to close at 2 a.m., banned loitering and scooter rentals in the evening and, most important, made it illegal to drink alcohol on the beach.\u201cIt got out of hand, and I believe it stopped some good people from coming here,\u201d said Mike Thomas, a Bay County commissioner who is now running for Panama City Beach mayor. \u201cI think it reached the point where we were killing ourselves. Our image was being hurt so badly.\u201dMr. Thomas said bars and clubs had been asked to tone down some events that in years past featured heavy drinking and the kind of entertainment he said attracted \u201can element that causes problems.\u201d Businesses, he said, did not cooperate.But business owners said that the vast majority of spring breakers were good people who wanted nothing more than a good time with friends, and that the new laws had gone too far.At Harpoon Harry\u2019s, Mr. Bishop said he did not even bother to open his outdoor bar most nights in March and had hired far fewer employees. The only reminder of the crowds that once flocked here was the row of empty portable toilets. The same story unfolded in business after business. A few had to lay off extra workers.At the Holiday Inn Resort, usually one of the most rollicking spring break hotels, a sprinkling of students lingered in the pool, arms raised high to protect their beers. Just beyond the fence, the town\u2019s world-famous sand beckoned. Choosing beers over the beach, few students ventured out beyond the hotel, though they said they were still having a good time. Students had seen or heard of others being hauled to jail for drinking, a risk most said they were unwilling to take.\u201cIt\u2019s very depressing,\u201d said Nick Jamiszewski, 21, a student at Michigan State University. \u201cI\u2019ve seen six people get handcuffed and taken away.\u201dAt Club La Vela, one of the largest and most popular clubs in town, a small group of students bounced to D.J. music in front of the stage, their fists pumping, as they were sprayed with glow paint. Regulars said the club was usually so packed that students could scarcely walk around. On a recent night, a skateboarder could have made the rounds.\u201cWe\u2019re disappointed,\u201d said Sierra James, 21, a student at Jefferson Community and Technical College in Louisville, Ky., as she stood waiting for friends inside Club La Vela. \u201cWe knew coming down; everyone was telling us P.C.B. is not going to be fun anymore, go to Fort Lauderdale. The people aren\u2019t here because you can\u2019t drink on the beach.\u201dAt Spinnaker Beach Club next door, near where the alleged sexual assault took place last year (two people have been charged), customers could easily be counted one by one. Even at the Beach Bash at Sharkey\u2019s, a major event, the place was only half filled.Colleen Swab, the owner of California Cycles, said her scooter rental business was down 80 percent this month, hurt by restrictions on the number of scooters she could rent and the prohibition on evening rentals. \u201cI ran off 15 customers yesterday,\u201d she said. Then she pointed to a Twitter photo taken the evening before. It showed the main road, usually bumper to bumper, completely empty. \u201cIt\u2019s just sad,\u201d she said. \u201cI never thought it would be like this. It\u2019s a ghost town.\u201dAdvertisement"}

With a firm lead in the race for delegates needed to capture the Democratic nomination, Mrs. Clinton seemed eager to turn to national security to launch her sharpest attacks yet on Mr. Trump and Mr. Cruz.Yet in her own policy prescriptions \u00e2\u0080\u0094 which included an \u00e2\u0080\u009cintelligence surge\u00e2\u0080\u009d to collect more data on the Islamic State, partnerships with Silicon Valley firms that have been suspicious of Washington, and beefing up security on soft targets like airport check-in areas \u00e2\u0080\u0094 Mrs. Clinton resisted calls to distance herself from the Obama administration\u00e2\u0080\u0099s actions, and instead called for an acceleration of the approaches already underway.That reflected how Mrs. Clinton is trying to appear muscular in the fight against terrorism while being cautious not to differentiate herself from her former boss, who remains widely popular among Democrats: Rather than arguing for major policy changes, she advocated moving faster and more dexterously.\u00e2\u0080\u009cWe face an adversary that is constantly adapting and operating across multiple theaters so our response must be just as nimble and far-reaching,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mrs. Clinton said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe need to rely on what actually works, not bluster that alienates our partners and doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t make us any safer.\u00e2\u0080\u009dMrs. Clinton\u00e2\u0080\u0099s remarks tilted heavily to pointed words for Mr. Trump and Mr. Cruz, rather than new policy solutions. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt would be a serious mistake to stumble into another costly ground war in the Middle East,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said, though both men have hedged on whether they would argue for sending American troops. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIf we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve learned anything from Iraq and Afghanistan it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s that people and nations have to secure their own communities.\u00e2\u0080\u009dThat line got to the core of her argument: that as a former secretary of state, she has dealt with such crises before, and knows the importance of steadiness. Mr. Trump and Mr. Cruz have called that a weakness.She portrayed Mr. Trump, whose mastery of Twitter has dominated the presidential campaign, as na\u00c3\u00afve about the Internet and the role it plays in ISIS\u00e2\u0080\u0099s recruitment. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhen other candidates talk about building walls around America, I want to ask them how high does the wall have to be to keep the Internet out?\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mrs. Clinton said, referring Mr. Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s proposal to erect a wall on the Mexican border.She particularly lambasted Mr. Trump over his proposal that the United States rethink its involvement in NATO, the Brussels-based organization that she called \u00e2\u0080\u009cone of the best investments America has ever made\u00e2\u0080\u009d and \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe most successful alliance in history.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00e2\u0080\u009cSo, I know the outer world exists and I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be very cognizant of that,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Trump continued. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBut at the same time, our country is disintegrating, large sections of it, especially the inner cities.\u00e2\u0080\u009dMrs. Clinton staunchly rejected the idea on Wednesday. \u00e2\u0080\u009cTurning our back on our alliances or turning our alliance into a protection racket would reverse decades of bipartisan American leadership and send a dangerous signal to friend and foe alike,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said, arguing that President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia hoped to divide Europe.Mrs. Clinton used the address to highlight her own foreign policy credentials, something that has not been central in the hard-fought nominating contest against Senator Bernie Sanders.On Wednesday, she referred to a counterterrorism effort that allowed the United States to gain flight manifests as \u00e2\u0080\u009can agreement the U.S. negotiated when I was secretary of state,\u00e2\u0080\u009d began a sentence with \u00e2\u0080\u009chaving actually done this\u2026\u00e2\u0080\u009d and joked after an introduction by Michael A. McFaul, a professor at Stanford and former United States ambassador to Russia, \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat happens in Vladivostok stays in Vladivostok.\u00e2\u0080\u009dIn the audience were two leading members of the foreign policy establishment: William Perry, who was secretary of defense for Mrs. Clinton\u00e2\u0080\u0099s husband, and George P. Shultz, secretary of state under President Ronald Reagan. While Mr. Shultz is a lifelong conservative Republican, his presence was bound to be read \u00e2\u0080\u0094 rightly or wrongly \u00e2\u0080\u0094 as a signal about where he thinks his party has veered.Mrs. Clinton\u00e2\u0080\u0099s speech, delivered in the heart of Silicon Valley to an audience that included the Apple co-founder\u00e2\u0080\u0099s widow, Laurene Powell, and technology executives and diplomats, took no hard position on one of the most contentious issues about combating terrorism: Whether to provide law enforcement and intelligence agencies an assured way into the contents of cellphones, or the data they transmit.Rather than embrace proposed legislation that would require such access \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and potentially create an opening in Apple and other products for hackers and foreign powers \u00e2\u0080\u0094 Mrs. Clinton argued for the creation of a commission on encryption, an approach Senator Mark Warner of Virginia has proposed.\u00e2\u0080\u009cThere may be no quick of magic fix,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIn the Apple case, the F.B.I. may have found a workaround, but there will be future cases with different facts and different challenges.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mrs. Clinton was referring to the F.B.I.\u00e2\u0080\u0099s recent effort to postpone its court face-off with Apple, saying it may have found a way to get into the phone of one of the San Bernardino terrorists without the company\u00e2\u0080\u0099s help.Mrs. Clinton, who spent much of the day in Silicon Valley fund-raising, imparted a vague declaration on the audience: \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe tech community and the government have to stop seeing each other as adversaries,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said.\n\t\tFirst Draft provides fast-paced and comprehensive coverage of politics and elections by The New York Times.

{"Headline": "In a Rebel Camp in Colombia, Marx and Free Love Reign", "Date": "2016-03-18", "News": "Supported by10 PhotosIN THE MOUNTAINS OF COLOMBIA \u2014 The rebel camp is a Communist time capsule. An old guerrilla fighter sings songs about Che Guevara on his guitar as a crowd leans in to listen, armed with rifles and grenades.Salaries do not exist here, or even marriage. The fighters believe in free love, saying they are wed only to the revolution. They say life is still possible with Karl Marx in one hand and a Kalashnikov in the other.Now, the two sides are negotiating an end to decades of fighting, the longest conflict in modern history. But the end was nowhere in sight that day.It was around 6 p.m. when the communiqu\u00e9 reached the guerrilla camp \u2014 and the news was not good.The message, read aloud under a tent, came from Rodrigo Londo\u00f1o \u2014 or Timochenko, as he is called here \u2014 the top FARC commander negotiating with the government to lay down arms after so much war.The talks were in a state of collapse, the communiqu\u00e9 warned. The rebels had stormed from the negotiating table in anger.War could be on the horizon once again.\u201cThere may be nothing else than to continue with what we came here 50 years ago to do,\u201d the message concluded, as the fighters in the camp gasped and gripped their weapons tighter.Both sides are saying that the March 23 deadline for a final deal may be missed, leaving little certain now.After the letter was read, a hushed silence fell under the tent. It was broken by a man in a beret with a red star who yelled slogans shouted by guerrillas throughout the ages:\u201cAgainst imperialism,\u201d he shouted.\u201cFor the Fatherland!\u201d the camp roared back.\u201cAgainst the oligarchy,\u201d he shouted.\u201cFor the people!\u201d they replied.The day begins here an hour before dawn. At 5:15, the fighters line up for the day\u2019s tasks: guarding outposts, slaughtering a cow. Breakfast is served out of a thatched-roof hut with ovens built into the ground.The prospect of peace might be a national question in Colombia, but it is a very personal one in this camp. Will the fighters return to the villages they once knew? Will they reunite with children abandoned years ago, children who are now adults themselves?Samy is 28 now, but she was barely 16 when she became a guerrilla.Like many rebels, who used their first names to keep their families safe, her childhood was filled with memories of deadly campaigns waged against peasants by paramilitary groups searching for guerrillas. She remembers six people shot dead in her small village. She decided that taking up arms was the way to survive.\u201cHere, you form another family,\u201d she said.Since then, Samy has seen her mother only once, during a brief meeting in a safe house when she was 21. The two women talked about what Samy had been like as a child, a distant memory that is almost gone. Samy has no plans to go home if the FARC disarms.The group, listed as a terrorist organization by the State Department, once counted some 17,000 fighters in its ranks; now it is down to just 7,000.Many here in the camp are still teenagers. Didier, 15, has barely shot the rifle he was given by the FARC when he joined the group six months ago.He came with two other teenage runaways, ushered away before sunrise on motorcycles by FARC militiamen from a small river port town. He hopes a peace deal will allow him to head home to explain to his father why he left: His family was running out of food.By 1 p.m., it had grown hot. The fighters were washing clothes and swimming in the river. Angela, a girl of about 18 with the nickname \u201cGunpowder,\u201d stepped out giggling in her underwear to escape a group of young men and teenage boys splashing water at her. She picked up her Kalashnikov and left.While marriage is unknown here, relationships among guerrillas are common. The man asks his commander for permission, just as many rural Colombians would ask the father for a woman\u2019s hand. When the two want to have sex, they tell the commander and then slip off into the woods, with palm fronds for bedding.The relations come and go.\u201cHow long did we live together, Andrea?\u201d asked the fighter Samuel, 31.\u201cI don\u2019t even remember,\u201d said Andrea, 26.The two laughed. Both now have children by other partners, civilians living elsewhere in Colombia. They both plan to go raise them if there is a peace deal.Camilo, 19, had a relationship, too, but the woman was killed along with 10 other fighters in an aerial bombing six months ago by the government.\u201cWe are in a war, and that is just how it is,\u201d Camilo said. \u201cThe things you see in a place like this. A leg over there, a foot across the river, and then an arm in some other place.\u201dNight falls, and marches begin into the forest. One squad of fighters heads to a distant part of the jungle. They sling up hammocks between trees next to large spiders and a few tree frogs.Someone whistles, a signal that an airplane is approaching overhead, and the guerrillas turn off their lights so as not to be seen from above.For many in the older generation, the graying fighters of the FARC, the future brings the possibility of a political rebirth. They have abandoned any hope that the guerrillas will topple the government one day, as revolutionaries did in Cuba and Nicaragua. The future in Colombia, they say, will come through joining the system that exists.\u201cWe will get rid of the arms and become politicians,\u201d said Luisito, the camp\u2019s second in command. \u201cBut we will not lose our structure. We will be at the ballot boxes this time.\u201dThe FARC is preparing its rank and file for what life will be like after a peace deal. Most mornings, fighters assemble under the tent for \u201cpedagogy.\u201d Leaders explain the agreement being negotiated in Havana and solicit responses from fighters.Hand-painted signs reinforce the new tone: \u201cIn principal, we are for peace and not for war,\u201d says one sign hanging above a row of Kalashnikovs.Some fighters want to know where they will live after a peace deal. Can they stay in the camp, simply without weapons? How will life be financed if the FARC can no longer levy its \u201ctaxes\u201d in the hinterlands, like the one on the lucrative coca trade?Others want to know if they will even be allowed to live.One fighter with the nom de guerre Te\u00f3filo Panclasta said he had gotten out of a Colombian prison this month after serving two years on rebellion charges. In the mid-1980s, he said, he was part of the FARC\u2019s largest experiment in political participation, the Patriotic Union, a party that the guerrillas formed as part of peace talks at the time. The effort brought part of the FARC out of the shadows.The response of paramilitary groups was brutal. In all, about 3,000 members of the party, from supporters to presidential candidates, were killed in retributive violence.\u201cDon\u2019t think this could not happen all over again,\u201d Mr. Panclasta said. \u201cIf we give up our rifles, our grenades, our pistols, we can only defend ourselves with our words.\u201dMembers of the camp say they came under fire last month when they ran into the Colombian military about 30 miles away. Eight guerrillas were wounded. One commander, Alberto, jumped off a rooftop to take cover. He now hobbles around the camp on crutches.\u201cWe had no idea what it meant was that socialism was coming to an end,\u201d he said.While the model may be ending, the FARC will remain, he insisted. \u201cWe are seeking peace, but we are not demobilizing,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re simply taking a new shape.\u201dMr. Panclasta hoped for the same.He seemed to feel liberated in the outdoor camp, after his years in a prison cell. He was shouting old slogans, slapping shoulders and pouring coffee for the fighters.He cited a phrase from Marx.\u201c \u2018From each according to his ability, to each according to his needs,\u2019 \u201d he said. \u201cThese ideas may be old ones \u2014 but they are the ones which have saved us in the forest here, and the ones that will save us through whatever is next.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Once your data is online, it no longer belongs wholly to you; subject to reposting and comments, the data you generate gets tossed into the Internet\u2019s melting pot.Not only can information circulate beyond intended recipients, but people like Isabel Howe, 33, the executive director of the Authors League Fund in New York, find the one-size-fits-all approach to social networks too unwieldy for their personalities. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t call myself a secretive person,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I do want the freedom to vary my level of self-exposure according to circumstance.\u201dOne can, of course, activate stringent privacy measures, set up alternative accounts for specific relationships (like one that excludes co-workers) or not post anything and simply \u201clurk.\u201d But that\u2019s a headache, and not foolproof; another user can still tag or refer to your avatar in a way that feels more invasive than merely naming you.\u201cIt was making me hate everyone,\u201d Ms. Moshfegh, who closed her Facebook and Twitter accounts before her book came out, said in a phone interview.\u201cI don\u2019t know anybody who comes across in any kind of positive way on social media,\u201d she said. \u201cIt made me feel bad, like there was a standard for living that I didn\u2019t even know about, and that I hated so much that, if I ever had to be in touch with that standard, I was going to kill somebody.\u201dThe blatant desire for recognition is what most irritated her. \u201cIt seemed like everybody wants to be a celebrity,\u201d Ms. Moshfegh said. \u201cAs soon as anybody started to know who I was, being on Facebook was so incredibly tacky.\u201dMs. Moshfegh, though, pointed to some of the pitfalls of being an active social networker. \u201cI remember putting in my name to see what people were saying on Twitter about me a lot, and occasionally finding something negative and being really upset by it,\u201d she said.And not being on social media can, in fact, yield brand-building benefits, especially for an artist.As hoi polloi shamelessly promote themselves, bestow disingenuous praise upon colleagues in hopes of receiving it in return and peck out snarkily hashtagged jokes during awards shows, the person who remains offline accrues mystique and is viewed as nobly intentioned, an elusive object of fascination rather than an accessible subject of self-glorification. Who knows how they\u2019re spending their time? Likely working hard for some transcendent and paradigm-shifting purpose, their online absence suggests.But post a tweet, and everyone knows what you\u2019re doing at that moment: idly looking at a screen, chasing after notice.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Facebook Faces German Antitrust Investigation", "Date": "2016-03-02", "News": "Supported byBRUSSELS \u2014 Facebook became the latest American technology company on Wednesday to face antitrust hurdles in Europe after the German competition authority opened an investigation into whether the company has abused its dominant position in social networking.The move puts Facebook, which is used by many of Europe\u2019s 500 million citizens, alongside other United States technology companies, like Google and Microsoft, which have also faced antitrust investigations into their activities across the region.European officials have taken a tough stance on how American tech giants operate across the 28-member bloc, as many politicians here remain concerned that these companies often dominate many aspects of people\u2019s digital lives, including social networking, online search and e-commerce.As part of the new investigation, German authorities said they were looking into whether Facebook misused its position to collect people\u2019s digital information. That included complicated terms and conditions that individuals had to sign to use the social network, and whether such contracts placed unfair constraints on the company\u2019s users.In response, Facebook said it was confident that it had complied with German law.\u201cWe look forward to working with the Federal Cartel Office to answer their questions,\u201d the company said in a statement.While the German investigation will look into Facebook\u2019s digital practices, it remains unclear whether other European policy makers \u2014 including at the European Commission, the executive arm of the European Union \u2014 will also open antitrust inquiries into the social network.The biggest American tech companies face intensifying scrutiny by European regulators, with \u2014 pressure that could potentially curb their sizable profits in the region and affect how they operate around the world.Several national privacy regulators are looking into how the social network collects data on both its users and those who are not signed up for its online services.Facebook was also at the center of a successful legal challenge in Europe\u2019s highest court over how data was transferred between the European Union and the United States. That led to senior European judges invalidating the so-called safe harbor data-transfer agreement between the two regions, increasing uncertainty over how companies like Facebook could move data across the Atlantic.In an acknowledgment of the growing regulatory challenges now confronting Facebook in Europe, Mark Zuckerberg, the company\u2019s 31-year-old chief executive, traveled to Germany last month to meet with policy makers, local publishers and the company\u2019s users.For Facebook, whose business model is based on selling advertisements targeted at users based on information in their posts, the company\u2019s use of people\u2019s digital data is increasingly putting it at odds with Europe\u2019s tough data protection rules, which view individuals\u2019 privacy rights on a par with rights such as the freedom of expression.European competition authorities are also increasingly looking at how companies like Facebook may hold a dominant position over people\u2019s digital information, which may give them an unfair advantage over rivals.This year, for example, Margrethe Vestager, the European competition commissioner, said the collection of a vast amount of users\u2019 data by a small number of tech companies like Google and Facebook could violate of the region\u2019s tough competition rules.\u201cIf a few companies control the data you need to cut costs, then you give them the power to drive others out of the market,\u201d Ms. Vestager said.\u201cIt\u2019s a business transaction, not a free giveaway,\u201d she added, referring to companies\u2019 use of people\u2019s digital data. \u201cAs consumers, we need to be treated fairly.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Bill Clinton Recalls How the Irish Were Key to His Success in New York", "Date": "2016-03-30", "News": "As Hillary Clinton courted African-Americans in Harlem on Wednesday, across Central Park, in the gilded ballroom at the Metropolitan Club, former President Bill Clinton sipped a pint of Guinness and addressed the Irish, another critical constituency as the Democratic contest descends on New York City.Accepting a lifetime achievement award at the Irish America Hall of Fame luncheon for his role in bringing peace to Northern Ireland, Mr. Clinton, wearing a green tie, didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t mention his wife\u00e2\u0080\u0099s presidential campaign. Instead, he talked about his own 1992 campaign, when, as governor of Arkansas, he tried to learn how to win a New York primary.\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat happened to me \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and it sort of happened to me \u00e2\u0080\u0094 began here in this city, late at night, almost exactly 24 years ago when I was trying to win the New York primary,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Clinton explained.Back then, a group of powerful Irish Americans and sympathizers, including the Clinton adviser Harold M. Ickes and former Representative Bruce Morrison of Connecticut, had assembled to talk to Mr. Clinton about the fighting that plagued Northern Ireland and what the next president could do.\u00e2\u0080\u009cThey were grilling me about all matter of things, and I think they were surprised I was prepared,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said.Mr. Clinton won the bitterly contested New York primary in 1992, catapulting him to the nomination.Years later, after he had helped to broker the Good Friday Agreement in 1998 that effectively ended the conflict in Northern Ireland, his daughter, Chelsea, wrote her senior thesis at Stanford about the history of Irish-American politics.\u00e2\u0080\u009cShe said, \u00e2\u0080\u0098You know, Dad, you didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t care about this when you came to New York. You just wanted the Irish to vote for you,\u00e2\u0080\u0099\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Clinton recalled.\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, not quite, but close enough,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009c\u00e2\u0080\u0098But afterward, you really did care,\u00e2\u0080\u0099\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Clinton said Chelsea told him.Today, the Clintons enjoy some of their most loyal support from Irish-Americans, who remember their role in ending what are known as the Troubles. And that loyalty is likely to bolster Mrs. Clinton in the state\u00e2\u0080\u0099s April 19 primary.As Mrs. Clinton spoke in Harlem alongside Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the annual awards luncheon, hosted by Irish America Magazine, drew influential Irish politicians, business leaders and media personalities. Gen. Martin E. Dempsey, the former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the astronaut Eileen M. Collins and the journalist and essayist Pete Hamill were also among the honorees.As Ireland celebrates the 100th anniversary of the 1916 Easter Rising against British rule, Mr. Clinton delivered a poetic address, praising the Irish for their inclusive government and weaving lines of poetry from W.B. Yeats into his extemporaneous remarks. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThings fall apart, the center cannot hold,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Clinton said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIf the center does not hold, inclusive economics, inclusive societies, all fall to the politics of blame.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00e2\u0080\u009cNorthern Ireland would really get whacked if England left the European Union,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Clinton said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI hope they don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t, because it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s easy to believe that the only solution to the modern world is to hunker down.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a dangerous world out there,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Clinton continued, speaking on a pressing foreign policy issue that Mrs. Clinton has not yet addressed. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s easy to turn away, but it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s better to find a way to move forward because the enemies of freedom, the people who don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t believe in diversity, will always find a way to pierce the walls.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00e2\u0080\u009cWe can never let our hearts to turn to stone, and we can never let things fall apart so much that we cannot build a center where the future of our children counts more than the scars of our past,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Clinton concluded. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThat is the ultimate lesson of every single thing that has happened from 100 years ago since that declaration was issued and all that has happened since 1995.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\t\tFirst Draft provides fast-paced and comprehensive coverage of politics and elections by The New York Times.

{"Headline": "F.B.I. Agent Testifies About Conversation With Suspect in ISIS Case", "Date": "2016-03-02", "News": "Supported byStripped of all context, it sounded like an ordinary request for directions.\u201cI asked, \u2018How do I get there?\u2019\u201d the man testified on Wednesday in Federal District Court in Brooklyn.But the man doing the asking was an undercover agent for the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the man doing the answering was the target of a terrorism investigation. And the destination, never mentioned aloud, only insinuated, was Syria, particularly the section controlled by the Islamic State.Although scores of Americans have been charged with supporting, or trying to support, the Islamic State, Mr. Pugh is one of the first to go to trial.A former member of the United States Air Force, he flew to Istanbul in January 2015, on what prosecutors described as the first leg in a long journey that he hoped would land him inside Islamic State territory.His defense lawyers maintain that while Mr. Pugh fantasized about the Islamic State, there is little evidence that he actually set out to join the group. He traveled to Istanbul, they said, not to find passage to neighboring Syria, but to look for work and relax in Turkish bathhouses.But Mr. Pugh never made it to the bathhouses or the territory of the Islamic State, whichever was his true destination.Instead he was stopped by Turkish authorities at the Istanbul airport and deported, first to Cairo and then to Kennedy International Airport. There, an undercover F.B.I. agent was waiting for him, pretending to be, like Mr. Pugh, a Muslim traveler pulled out of line and held for further questioning.\u201cI was tasked to bump Mr. Pugh, to strike up a conversation and see if he comes across as a radical Muslim,\u201d said the undercover agent, who testified under a pseudonym, Talib Nassib. \u201cI normally portray myself as a Sunni, Salafi male convert,\u201d the agent said, explaining that \u201c90 percent\u201d of his undercover work was in counterterrorism cases.At the government\u2019s request, Judge Nicholas G. Garaufis closed the courtroom to the public and news reporters, who listened to an audio feed of the agent\u2019s testimony in an empty courtroom nearby.Sitting near Mr. Pugh in the airport screening room, the agent said that after an initial \u201cSalaam aleikum,\u201d the two were soon chatting about family and travel. Later, the men talked at a Dunkin\u2019 Donuts kiosk and decided to keep in touch. The conversation took a turn when the agent pulled out his phone and opened Facebook.Mr. Pugh got a look at the agent\u2019s profile page, which depicted black flags of the Islamic State and armed mujahedeen fighters.\u201cHis demeanor toward me changed,\u201d the undercover agent testified, recalling how Mr. Pugh loosened up and smiled. \u201cIt was like: Now I know who you are.\u201dSoon Mr. Pugh told the undercover agent that \u201cwe\u2019re compatible,\u201d according to a recording of the conversation, much of which was muffled and inaudible. The agent said the \u201cswooshing\u201d sounds of the recording were caused by having the recording device under his robes.Although the men talked for about 20 minutes, it is difficult to follow much of what was said. They spoke in tentative, cryptic sentences, which might suggest that this was a guarded conversation about the Islamic State, but could also suggest that there was some confusion about precisely what they were discussing.\u201cYou should definitely go, very soon,\u201d the agent urged at one point, according to a transcript made by the government.Mr. Pugh responded, \u201cGo where?\u201dThe agent testified that he never mentioned Syria or the Islamic State by name, but that it would have been clear to Mr. Pugh what he was getting at. When the agent asked how to get there, Mr. Pugh urged him to shave his beard and wear pants, not a robe. \u201cThe thing is, blend in,\u201d Mr. Pugh said.At one point, Mr. Pugh said that his own mistake was wearing a robe. \u201cI looked like a Muslim,\u201d Mr. Pugh said.But was Mr. Pugh talking about getting across Turkey to Syria, or just about how to evade security at the Istanbul airport, where he had recently been detained? When the undercover agent asked Mr. Pugh about his destination, his answer was hardly incriminating.\u201cI was going to Turkey,\u201d Mr. Pugh said, according to the government\u2019s transcript.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "\u2018The Association of Small Bombs,\u2019 by Karan Mahajan", "Date": "2016-03-15", "News": "Supported byWhen you purchase an independently reviewed book through our site, we earn an affiliate commission.Allow me to skip the prelude to judgment that usually begins a book review, and just get right to it: Karan Mahajan\u2019s second novel, \u201cThe Association of Small Bombs,\u201d is wonderful. It is smart, devastating, unpredictable and enviably adept in its handling of tragedy and its fallout. If you enjoy novels that happily disrupt traditional narratives \u2014 about grief, death, violence, politics \u2014 I suggest you go out and buy this one. Post haste.That done, let\u2019s get to the why of this novel\u2019s excellence, which starts with its brio. After the terrorist attacks in Paris last November, several articles were published about the equally horrifying attacks in Beirut and why few in the West had seemed to care or even to notice. In Beirut, 43 civilians were killed and over 200 injured by ISIS suicide bombers, but the carnage barely registered with the Western press, governments or thousands of people posting on Facebook. Why? Probably because violence in the Middle East and South Asia seems de rigueur for us, the same way mass shootings in the United States are being met with less outrage \u2014 and more apathy \u2014 every day.Another thing most of us don\u2019t care about? The inner lives of the people who commit terrorism, though this seems less problematic. We don\u2019t want to know about a suicide bomber\u2019s diabetic parents and belittling ex-girlfriend. We don\u2019t want to know about his dreams \u2014 his fear and hurt and longing \u2014 because he killed our families and friends. He is a mass murderer, and that\u2019s that. But as part of its mission to agitate these patterns of thought, \u201cThe Association of Small Bombs\u201d (a) \u00adforces us to care about just another terrorist attack in a market in Delhi and (b) insists that we consider \u2014 and possibly even like \u2014 the people for whom terrorism exerts its appeal.This is, needless to say, a gutsy move, especially since the novel begins not with a terrorist but with Deepa and Vikas Khurana, whose boys \u2014 11 and 13 years old \u2014 are killed in a market while fetching their father\u2019s TV from an electrician. Such a stupid reason to die, which is the point: Tragedies are senseless and random unless you are their perpetrator. So the boys die, but their friend Mansoor survives with injuries to his wrist and arm, which thrusts at least some of the novel\u2019s narrative structure into view: It will follow the Khuranas and Mansoor as they slog through the welter of their feelings after the blast.Permutations of grief dominate a good part of the sections devoted to the Khuranas. We watch them grope for each other; repel each other; fight, make love and then decamp from whatever solaces each has to afford the other. Theirs are the most thrilling, tender and tragic parts of the novel, which are also periodically funny. It\u2019s hard to know what to make of the novel\u2019s flirtation with drollery, since it really is just a flirtation; no one would call this a tragicomic narrative. In some way, these moments of levity feel almost grossly misplaced, which has the strange effect of also making them feel just right. Drollery is exceedingly difficult to quote out of context, so you\u2019ll have to trust me that when Deepa \u2014 the boys\u2019 mother \u2014 thinks about her future with her husband but is \u201cin denial too, convinced they would kill themselves,\u201d it\u2019s almost a laugh-out-loud moment. Or that when Mansoor\u2019s mother, Afsheen, thinks about his future, becoming \u201csentimental and hysterical,\u201d one gets the feeling the narrator is gently and lovingly mocking her for her outsize passion.Notably, such moments are confined to the novel\u2019s first 100 pages or so, as if to perch us atop its slide toward fatalism. As the narrative suggests, nothing recovers from a bomb \u2014 not our humanity, our politics or even our faith. Not entirely, in any case, which is best borne out by Mansoor, whose injuries appear relatively cosmetic but come to traumatize his life for the next six years in the form of debilitating carpal tunnel syndrome. He wants to be a computer programmer; you can imagine how good his chances are.Of course, the most insidious effects of violence are psychological, and certainly Mansoor, who was only 12 when the blast went off, has not escaped them. His pain is physical and mental and unrelenting \u2014 the very sort of thing that makes a man vulnerable to persuasion. But not in the way I expected, which is another of the novel\u2019s pleasures: It continued to surprise me. Mansoor adopts a way of life that seems perilously close to what we Westerners \u2014 what this Westerner \u2014 associate with a radicalized form of Islam that will not coexist with competing ideologies. But Mahajan\u2019s take on what it means and how it feels to be a practicing Muslim is entirely more sophisticated and nuanced, which is what keeps Mansoor\u2019s story riveting and sad.Case in point: None of the terrorists in the novel are radicalized Muslims. None of them murder in the misappropriated name of Allah. Instead, they are political activists, some more disaffected than others, in pursuit of independence for Kashmir in one instance and an end to the persecution of Muslims in another (though this is a reductive summary). The violence against Muslims in Gujarat in 2002 \u2014 what many call a pogrom orchestrated by then Chief Minister Narendra Modi \u2014 is a motivating force in the novel for several Muslims seeking justice, or even just peaceful coexistence. But both seem unattainable, the one because mistrust and rancor between Hindus and Muslims are not easily dispatched, and the other because justice doesn\u2019t serve at the pleasure of the bomb. \u201cA bomb was a child,\u201d one terrorist thinks. \u201cA tantrum directed at all things.\u201d And since when does a child get its way?At some point, in thrall to her grief, Deepa begins moaning at night, \u201ca steady sob, like that of a dog.\u201d Vikas, concerned, asks what\u2019s wrong. And what follows is just one of several lovely passages that tell me Mahajan is the real deal:\u201cThe house, closed in by the multiple cells of the relatives\u2019 flats, was scary, lonely, dark. He shook her. Her eyes were open. She was not asleep. The sound was conscious. He was overcome, at that moment, by a panic he had never experienced before \u2014 the panic of a man alone in the world \u2014 and he put his hands on her small shoulders and shook her again. She wrapped her legs around his, still looking at the ceiling. Vikas pulled up her kurta and undid the drawstrings of her pajamas.\u201cSoon, they were making love.\u201dIf \u201cThe Association of Small Bombs\u201d has any weakness, it\u2019s in the way it shuts down at the end, with haste and a somewhat perfunctory nod to its own fatalism. But this doesn\u2019t make the ending any less tragic for all parties \u2014 victims and perpetrators both. This novel is generous without prejudice, which feels at once subversive and refreshing. It also contributes to its sadness. There are no heroes here. Just an association of small bombs ticking away in the guise of average people who feel intensely.Fiona Maazel\u2019s third novel, \u201cA Little More Human,\u201d will be published next year.

Now the company wants to help get more of those customers in the door.On Wednesday, Square announced a new integration with Facebook. Under the integration, small businesses that use Square to process payments can buy and target Facebook advertising using Square\u2019s software. Square will make subscription fees off the new product.Small businesses can benefit from the move because Facebook ads bought through Square\u2019s platform are directly connected to sales activity and data, Square said. That will allow business owners to understand whether their Facebook ads are working to attract new and repeat customers.\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of excitement around buying Facebook ads, but the critical missing link is, if I put down $5, how do I know if it worked?\u201d said Saumil Mehta, Square\u2019s customer engagement lead. \u201cThe ability to track and close the loop from advertisement to sale \u2014 that\u2019s the holy grail.\u201dBut as Square has grown, the company has diversified from that payments processing core, which some analysts and investors have criticized for having overly thin margins.Square now offers cash advances to merchants through Square Capital, scheduling with Square Appointments and food delivery with Caviar. The company has also begun offering other subscription-based products to businesses, like an email marketing service linked to sales history.The new Facebook advertising integration was spurred by an acquisition of talent and technology from a start-up called LocBox a few months ago. Square hired Mr. Mehta and his colleagues from LocBox, which specialized in online marketing for small and local businesses, to work on similar advertising technology at Square.The new lines of business still account for far less revenue than Square earns by processing payments. But Square believes that as more small businesses begin adopting its full array of products, these nascent revenue streams will grow.Advertisement"}

She placed a figure with a laptop on a gray couch across from another figure in a chair near a table. On the table was a pitcher of orange juice and a black notebook. The tan socks of one figure, the gray shoes of the other and the black notebook on the table all blended into the patterned rug.

She usually takes pictures in sections and tiles the results together to get maximum resolution.\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe printed images are very large, up to 6 by 9 feet, allowing the viewer to see various levels of abstraction and details as they move towards the image,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said.\u00e2\u0080\u009cStatic\u00e2\u0080\u009d shows two women \u00e2\u0080\u0094 both played by Ms. Walter \u00e2\u0080\u0094 in black-and-white striped outfits standing on a rug of the same pattern.

{"Headline": "Major Companies Press North Carolina on Law Curbing Protections From Bias", "Date": "2016-03-29", "News": "Supported byDURHAM, N.C. \u2014 The onslaught of criticism, economic sanctions and a lawsuit being leveled at Gov. Pat McCrory of North Carolina grew on Tuesday, as the largest corporation in his state joined the fight against a new law that eliminated anti-discrimination protections for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people.Bank of America, which has its headquarters in Charlotte, N.C., announced late Tuesday on Twitter that its leadership was joining over 80 chief executives, including Timothy D. Cook of Apple and Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook, in objecting to the new law. Earlier in the day, the chief executives published a letter, addressed to Mr. McCrory, on the Human Rights Campaign website, saying, \u201cSuch laws are bad for our employees and bad for business.\u201dMr. McCrory, a Republican, signed the law last Wednesday to create a mandatory statewide anti-discrimination policy that excludes protections based on sexual orientation and gender identity. The bill, created by Republican legislators in an emergency session that same day, was intended to overrule a new municipal ordinance in Charlotte, the state\u2019s largest city, that provided such protections, including allowing transgender people to use bathrooms according to the gender they identify with. It was set to take effect Friday.Condemnation rained down in response. The governors of New York, Washington and Vermont issued bans on most official state travel to North Carolina, as did the mayors of San Francisco, Seattle and New York. The National Basketball Association implied it might move the 2017 All-Star Game from Charlotte. The White House press secretary, Josh Earnest, called the law \u201cmeanspirited.\u201dOn Monday, Lambda Legal, the American Civil Liberties Union, the A.C.L.U. of North Carolina and Equality North Carolina filed a federal lawsuit against Mr. McCrory; the state\u2019s attorney general, Roy Cooper; and the University of North Carolina, challenging the law on behalf of two transgender North Carolinians.Mr. McCrory defended his signature in a testy news conference on Monday, insisting that the new law did not take away existing protections. Fact-checkers at Raleigh\u2019s WRAL-TV rated that statement false.Then on Tuesday, Mr. Cooper, a Democrat who plans to run for governor against Mr. McCrory this fall, held a news conference saying he refused to defend the new law in court, despite being named in the case. \u201cNot only is this new law a national embarrassment, it will set North Carolina\u2019s economy back,\u201d he said.Mr. McCrory accused Mr. Cooper and other critics, including the White House, of taking part in a \u201cvicious nationwide smear campaign\u201d against his state.In a video released by his press office on Tuesday, Mr. McCrory accused the critics of \u201cdisregarding the facts.\u201d\u201cOther politicians, from the White House to mayors and City Council members and, yes, our attorney general, have initiated and promoted conflict to advance their political agenda,\u201d he said.In a separate statement provided to The New York Times, Mr. McCrory\u2019s communications director, Josh Ellis, lashed out at Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo of New York, accusing him of hypocrisy.\u201cSyracuse is playing the Final Four in Houston, where voters overwhelmingly rejected a bathroom ordinance that was also rejected by the State of North Carolina. Is Governor Cuomo going to ask the Syracuse team to boycott the game in Houston? It\u2019s total hypocrisy and demagoguery.\u201dMr. Cuomo\u2019s chief counsel, Alphonso David, rejected that comparison, noting that Syracuse University is private and that the Houston measure was rejected in a referendum, not voided by a state legislature.\u201cThey cannot hide behind what we perceive as nothing more than sheer discrimination and bigotry,\u201d Mr. David said by phone from Albany. Mr. McCrory ran for office as a pro-business moderate but has often gone along with a staunchly conservative Republican legislature whose supporters he needs to win a second term. Bank of America was one of the largest contributors to Mr. McCrory\u2019s 2012 campaign and is a major supporter of North Carolina\u2019s Republican and Democratic Parties, according to the National Institute on Money in State Politics.In the video, Mr. McCrory said the law was meant to \u201cprotect men, women and children when they use a public restroom, shower or locker room.\u201d That is a reference to its best-known requirement: that people use bathrooms that correspond with the gender on their birth certificate, rather than their gender identity. Lawmakers had focused their opposition to Charlotte\u2019s anti-discrimination ordinance on the contention that it might allow men dressed as women to enter bathrooms and commit assaults.The law\u2019s critics say there is no evidence that has happened elsewhere.Threats of boycotts stemming from discriminatory laws have forced governors in Indiana and, this week, Georgia to reject similar laws in those states.The economic pressure is building on North Carolina as well. Another of the signatories on the letter signed by Bank of America was the president and chief executive of PayPal, Dan Schulman, who had announced plans for a $3.6 million global operations center in Charlotte this month.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Trump-Berlusconi Syndrome", "Date": "2016-03-14", "News": "Supported byIn the mid-1980s, when I was covering Italy for The Wall Street Journal, I profiled a brash, bruising, billionaire businessman named Silvio Berlusconi who had made a fortune in real estate and parlayed that into control of an almost unrivaled private television empire.Berlusconi invited me to the book-lined office in his Milan mansion. He\u2019d made his money building a garden city called Milano 2 on the eastern outskirts of Italy\u2019s financial capital. Then he\u2019d made his real money \u2014 billions of dollars \u2014 through TV networks gathered in a controlling company called Mediaset. By the time I met him, a big chunk of Italy\u2019s television advertising revenue was going into his pocket.What I recall is the talk \u2014 a lot of it \u2014 and the voice \u2014 he\u2019d worked as a crooner on cruise ships \u2014 and the self-confidence and the vulgarity (I had the impression that there was nothing inside the leather-bound books on the shelves). Berlusconi whisked me off in his private jet, and as we climbed over Milan he gestured to the urban sprawl beneath him and told me he was by far the \u201crichest man in Italy.\u201d I countered that surely Giovanni Agnelli, then the head of the Fiat group, was richer. Berlusconi scoffed. There was a lot more of his new money than that old money.Within a decade or so, in 1994, Berlusconi was prime minister, at the head of a right-of-center political party he\u2019d concocted the previous year, thrust to power on the basis that he would break with Italy\u2019s dysfunctional politics and that, as a self-made billionaire, he knew how to fix problems. He used television unsparingly to buttress his meteoric rise through the wreckage of Italy\u2019s post-1945 political order, which had recently collapsed with the end of the Cold War.Widely ridiculed, endlessly written about, long unscathed by his evident misogyny and diverse legal travails, Berlusconi proved a Teflon politician. Nothing stuck. He had the gift of the gab. He had a tone. He connected. He owned a soccer club, for heaven\u2019s sake. Many Italians thought they saw in him one of their own. He served three terms and nine years as prime minister before an ignominious downfall.Nobody who knows Berlusconi and has watched the rise and rise of Donald Trump can fail to be struck by the parallels. It\u2019s not just the real-estate-to-television path. It\u2019s not just their shared admiration for Vladimir Putin. It\u2019s not just the playboy thing, and obsession with their virility, and smattering of bigotry, and contempt for policy wonks, and reliance on a tell-it-like-it-is tone. It\u2019s not their wealth, nor the media savvy that taught them that nobody ever lost by betting on human stupidity.No, it\u2019s something in the zeitgeist. America is ripe for Trump just as Italy was ripe for Berlusconi. Trump, too, is cutting through a rotten political system in a society where economic frustration at jobs exported to China is high. He is emerging after two lost wars, as American power declines and others strut the global stage, against a backdrop of partisan political paralysis, in a system corrupted by money. To Obama\u2019s Doctrine of Restraint, Trump opposes a Doctrine of Resurgence. To reason, he counters with rage.In the same way, Berlusconi emerged as Italy ceased to be a Cold War pivot and the Christian-Democrat-dominated postwar political alignments imploded. Everything was in flux as the \u201cmani pulite\u201d (clean hands) investigation started by Milan magistrates in 1992 exposed what everyone knew: that graft and corruption were cornerstones of Italian politics. No matter that Berlusconi was also a target of the investigation: He was new, he talked the talk, he would conjure something!Stille went on to make an important point about how the deregulation of broadcast media in the United States and Italy \u2014 in contrast to Britain or France or Germany where state media companies still \u201cact as a kind of referee for civil discourse\u201d and \u201ccommonly accepted facts\u201d \u2014 has fostered the fact-lite free-for-all of \u201calternate realities\u201d conducive to Trumpism.If elected president, Trump would have his finger on the nuclear button. Berlusconi did not. Trump would also face strong institutions, including judicial institutions. Berlusconi did not. Trump would be the leader of the free world. Berlusconi ruled from a city, Rome, whose lesson is that all power, however great, passes.What Berlusconi teaches is that Trump could go all the way in a nation thirsting for a new politics. The man known as \u201cThe Knight\u201d ended up convicted of tax fraud and paying for sex with an underage prostitute \u2014 but it took 17 years of intermittent scandal and incompetence, from 1994 to 2011, for Italy to rub the stardust from its eyes.Take note, America, before the die is cast.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "$2 Billion Worth of Free Media for Donald Trump", "Date": "2016-03-15", "News": "Supported byThe 2016 RaceOf all the ways Donald Trump has shocked the political system, one of the most significant is how he wins primary after primary with one of the smallest campaign budgets.He still doesn\u2019t have a super PAC. He skimped on ground organization and field offices. Most important, he spent less on television advertising \u2014 typically the single biggest expenditure for a campaign \u2014 than any other major candidate, according to an analysis by SMG Delta, a firm that tracks television advertising.But Mr. Trump is hardly absent from the airwaves. Like all candidates, he benefits from what is known as earned media: news and commentary about his campaign on television, in newspapers and magazines, and on social media. Earned media typically dwarfs paid media in a campaign. The big difference between Mr. Trump and other candidates is that he is far better than any other candidate \u2014 maybe than any candidate ever \u2014 at earning media.No one knows this better than mediaQuant, a firm that tracks media coverage of each candidate and computes a dollar value based on advertising rates. The mentions are weighted by the reach of the media source, meaning how many people were likely to see it. The calculation also includes traditional media of all types, print, broadcast or otherwise, as well as online-only sources like Facebook, Twitter or Reddit.Mr. Trump earned $400 million worth of free media last month, about what John McCain spent on his entire 2008 presidential campaign. Paul Senatori, mediaQuant\u2019s chief analytics officer, says that Mr. Trump \u201chas no weakness in any of the media segments\u201d \u2014 in other words, he is strong in every type of earned media, from television to Twitter.Over the course of the campaign, he has earned close to $2 billion worth of media attention, about twice the all-in price of the most expensive presidential campaigns in history. It is also twice the estimated $746 million that Hillary Clinton, the next best at earning media, took in. Senator Bernie Sanders has earned more media than any of the Republicans except Mr. Trump.Of course, as Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Trump would probably attest, not all media attention is positive. (Mrs. Clinton\u2019s mentions, for example, would include news coverage of congressional hearings on Benghazi; Mr. Trump\u2019s will eventually include articles about violence and fights at his campaign rallies.)The mediaQuant model collects positive, neutral and negative media mentions alike. Mr. Senatori said negative media mentions are given somewhat less weight. The best way to think of the numbers, he said, is as a gauge of which candidates are \u201ctrending\u201d in the earned media market at any given time.The model shows different candidates trending at different times. In February, Senator Ted Cruz of Texas earned almost as much media coverage as Mrs. Clinton, and about as much as Mr. Trump earned last October.But Mr. Trump still dominates. In February, he earned as much media as Mr. Cruz and Mrs. Clinton combined.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "For Vulnerable Teenagers, a Web of Support", "Date": "2016-03-08", "News": "First of two articlesThread identifies students in ninth grade who are facing major life challenges: poverty, homelessness, family breakdown or single parents who are overwhelmed by work, illness or other problems. The students are in the bottom 25 percent of their classes academically and are often chronically absent. Thread connects them with a team of up to five volunteers who commit to support them in any way necessary, 24 hours a day, 365 days a year, for 10 years.The assistance may include wake-up calls or rides to school, food and clothing, child care or legal help, connection to community service opportunities, help finding jobs, tutoring, SAT preparation or college admission guidance. The philosophy is to do whatever it takes to help the teenager develop into an adult who can pursue a fulfilling life. \u00e2\u0080\u009cA volunteer may literally go at 7 a.m. and try to pick the kid up for school, a second person may go at 10 a.m., another person at noon,\u00e2\u0080\u009d explains Sarah Hemminger, a Thread co-founder and the chief executive. Volunteers take students to restaurants and movies; they hang out and talk about life; they go camping; they sometimes provide homes to students.The offer is unconditional support. A student will not get kicked out, no matter how hard he or she tests volunteers.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cThey have to agree to join and their guardian has to agree and sign a lot of paperwork,\u00e2\u0080\u009d adds Hemminger. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe tell students: \u00e2\u0080\u0098Once you are in you cannot get out. This is serious. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not something you can undo. You\u00e2\u0080\u0099re going to want to undo this, but once it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s happened, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s happened.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\u00e2\u0080\u009dEddie Blackstone, 23, a graduate of Paul Laurence Dunbar High School who is now a junior at Towson University, planning to major in psychology, enrolled in Thread in 2007. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIn my ninth-grade year, my mom walked out of my life, my dad had just gotten out of jail, I was in the bottom 10 percent of my class,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he recalled. One day, a teacher told Eddie that a woman would like to speak with him. It was Hemminger. \u00e2\u0080\u009cShe gave us a rundown of the program,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. What initially caught his interest was her offer of free pizza.One of the volunteers he made a strong connection with was Tong Zhang, who was pursuing a Ph.D. in immunology at Johns Hopkins University. \u00e2\u0080\u009cShe wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t overbearing,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Eddie recalled. \u00e2\u0080\u009cShe was like, \u00e2\u0080\u0098I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want to be all up in your business, but I would like to invite you to my house to play video games.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\u00e2\u0080\u009d Later, he grew close with another Thread volunteer, Rose Parkinson, Tong\u00e2\u0080\u0099s friend who was also pursuing a Ph.D. in immunology.\u00e2\u0080\u009cThey are two opposite sides of the same awesome coin,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Eddie recalled: Tong was \u201csoft and loving\u201d; Rose \u201cdamned if I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m going to let you fail.\u00e2\u0080\u009dDuring high school, Eddie and his father were homeless on several occasions for extended periods. Over the years, he has lived with Tong and her husband, and with Rose and her husband. During his senior year, when he was applying for college, he lived in an abandoned house without running water and heat. Rose bought him space heaters and made sure he had a place to do laundry and get showered. When it came to doing homework, applying for college, getting up on Saturday morning to attend SAT practice, staying on track in college, Tong and Rose, and other Thread volunteers, have consistently shown up, encouraged or cajoled or dragged Eddie out of bed, reminding him of his goals and dreams.He has helped them, too. Tong had immigrated from China, and Eddie\u00e2\u0080\u0099s companionship helped ease her loneliness. When Rose\u00e2\u0080\u0099s mother died in 2011, Eddie attended her funeral in Pennsylvania. \u00e2\u0080\u009cHe was really there for me,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Rose said. Now, when they get together, they talk about college and the future. \u00e2\u0080\u009cHe\u00e2\u0080\u0099s going to be uncle Eddie and teach my son all the things he knows,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Rose.There were hard moments, too. \u00e2\u0080\u009cOne day I got into an argument and said something real hurtful to Tong, and she started to cry,\u00e2\u0080\u009d recalled Eddie. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI saw she was crying because she loves me. I had never had that. My mother wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t even willing to cry when she was leaving me for a cocaine dealer. I was like, \u00e2\u0080\u0098This relationship\u00e2\u0080\u0099s real.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\u00e2\u0080\u009dAnother time Rose grew angry with Eddie for saying that he didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t think he was good enough for college. She threw her keys in frustration. Eddie recalled: \u00e2\u0080\u009cShe was like: \u00e2\u0080\u0098Eddie, we know you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re better than everything you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been through in your life! We see it in you. Why can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t you see it?\u00e2\u0080\u0099\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not going to throw your keys at someone you don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t care about,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he added. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt gave me a family feeling \u00e2\u0080\u0094 like a feeling of being wanted.\u00e2\u0080\u009dRose commented: \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s definitely been challenging. Sometimes it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s uncomfortable confronting someone about their work ethic or their behavior. But I think the challenge is one of the benefits. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s really rewarding when you start to see changes, when someone starts to become more self-aware and they see they have control over something they didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t realize they had control over before.\u00e2\u0080\u009dFor Eddie, the value is clear: \u00e2\u0080\u009cIf I wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t in Thread, I would most likely be dead or in jail.\u00e2\u0080\u009dEddie is an impressive person, but his story is not an outlier. He is one of 255 students who are enrolled in, or who are alumni of, Thread, a nonprofit organization with over 800 volunteers, most of them students from Johns Hopkins University. What they and the Thread students are achieving together deserves national attention.Of the 176 students who have been in Thread for less than five years, 97 percent are still attending high school or have graduated. Of the 79 who have been in the program for over five years, 92 percent have graduated high school and 80 percent have enrolled in a two or four year college or certification program. (In Baltimore\u00e2\u0080\u0099s public schools, only 72 percent of students graduate high school within five years.)Read previous contributions to this series.Referring to disadvantaged youths, he added: \u00e2\u0080\u009cA lot of people assert that if you don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t get a child at 3 or 4 years old, or even at 1 or 2 years old, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve lost them. Here is a program that takes a ninth-grade child, not only low income but the poorest performers in their class, and gets them out of high school, which in itself is amazing.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The fact that most go on to college, he added, is a sign that we dramatically underestimate their potential.One of the ideas underpinning Thread is that poverty should be defined as a condition of isolation, not just a lack of money. \u00e2\u0080\u009cRelationships are the key things that bring about real changes,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Sarah Hemminger, who co-founded Thread with her husband Ryan. For the two of them, this insight has personal resonance.As an adolescent growing up in Indianapolis, Ryan\u00e2\u0080\u0099s home life began falling apart after his mother was badly injured in a car accident. She was unable to work, the family lost its home, and Ryan\u00e2\u0080\u0099s parents later became addicted to his mother\u00e2\u0080\u0099s pain medication. Ryan would come home from school not knowing if there would be anything to eat, or if the house would be cold and dark because the heat and electricity had been cut off. \u00e2\u0080\u009cSchool wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t helping me meet my critical needs at the time, which was food, clothing and shelter,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he recalled. In ninth grade he began skipping school and went from being an A student to failing most of his classes.But he was fortunate. A group of teachers, led by Sargent Robert Lanam, the school\u00e2\u0080\u0099s junior R.O.T.C. instructor, came together to help him. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI was the first Thread kid,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Ryan recalled. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThese teachers did everything they could: bought me clothes, paid utility bills, brought food to the house, and made sure I went to school.\u00e2\u0080\u009d He started doing better, graduated, and later enrolled in the Naval Academy. Among other things, he has served as an officer on a submarine, worked as a financial adviser for Morgan Stanley, and now serves as the chief financial officer for the Baltimore City Health Department.One day in 2004, during her first year of a Ph.D. program in biomedical engineering at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Sarah found herself at a stop light in front of Dunbar High School. At school, she\u00e2\u0080\u0099d been feeling disconnected, not feeling she belonged. She imagined that some of the students in Dunbar High were like Ryan \u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00c2\u00a0and she thought she might be able to relate well with them.She met with the principal and persuaded him to give her a list of ninth-grade students who were academically struggling and facing challenges outside of school. She recruited seven volunteers from school to help with tutoring. Today, 80 percent of that initial group \u00e2\u0080\u0094 12 of 15 students \u00e2\u0080\u0094 have completed a four-year degree or professional certification program.\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe powerful things about Thread,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he added, \u00e2\u0080\u009care that they stay with kids over time and get them to adulthood, and the insight to have a group of people do this, so it doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t become an overwhelming commitment for one person. Those are two powerful innovations.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00e2\u0080\u009cThread has become a silent partner for our kids,\u00e2\u0080\u009d explained Gregory E. Thornton, the chief executive of Baltimore City Public Schools. Its community is able to meet the needs of students in a way that high school teachers \u00e2\u0080\u0094 who may teach 150 students \u00e2\u0080\u0094 cannot, he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe only problem with Thread is it needs to be bigger.\u00e2\u0080\u009dThere\u00e2\u0080\u0099s another aspect to the work: What happens when so many diverse individuals and institutions in a city like Baltimore come together around a common mission?Next week: A fuller examination of how Thread\u00e2\u0080\u0099s approach works.More From Fixes \u00bbMore From Private Lives \u00bbMore From Couch \u00bbMore From The Stone \u00bbMore From Moviegoers \u00bbMore From The End \u00bbMore From Draft \u00bbMore From Anxiety \u00bbMore From Menagerie \u00bbMore From Disunion \u00bbMore From Bedside \u00bbMore From The Conversation \u00bbMore From The Great Divide \u00bbMore From Errol Morris \u00bbFollowAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Seeing Slim Chance of Accord, Senate Republicans Table Budget Discussions", "Date": "2016-03-08", "News": "Senate Republicans pounded Democrats for years for not producing a budget, but they are now finding out that it\u2019s not that easy to do in a charged political environment.With the budget stalled in the House, Senator Michael B. Enzi, the Wyoming Republican who leads the Budget Committee, announced on Monday that his panel would be putting off any action on a budget for at least this month and probably beyond.Congress can get by without a formal budget this year since the overall spending levels for 2017 were set in a deal reached last December. But not coming to an agreement when Republicans control the House and the Senate will be an embarrassment, particularly since the leadership has been promising to restore \u201cregular order.\u201d Not to mention the fact that first-year Speaker Paul D. Ryan was once a celebrated Budget Committee chairman. It would also deny Republicans a chance to employ a special filibuster-proof procedure on legislation covering taxes and health care because the process can be initiated only through budget approval.However, passing a budget in the Senate would require members of both parties to cast a series of tough votes in the annual \u201cvote-a-rama,\u201d a marathon of dozens of consecutive votes when both sides try to make vulnerable incumbents take positions that the opposition can turn into political attacks.

{"Headline": "The Ten-Dollar Founding Father Without a Father: Teaching and Learning With \u2018Hamilton\u2019", "Date": "2016-03-24", "News": "Teaching ideas based on New York Times content.Yes, it really is that good.Below, our contribution to what we expect will become a deluge of material: some ways to teach and learn with \u201cHamilton,\u201d via articles, Op-Eds, reviews, archival materials and multimedia from The New York Times. How will you teach with this \u201crevolutionary musical about taking your shot, speaking your mind and turning the world upside down\u201d? Let us know. \u201cAlexander Hamilton,\u201d the opening number, performed at the 2016 Grammy Awards.Overview: \u201cA Story About America Then, Told by America Now\u201dThe genesis of \u00e2\u0080\u0098\u00e2\u0080\u0098Hamilton\u00e2\u0080\u0099\u00e2\u0080\u0099 has already entered theatrical lore. While on vacation in Mexico in 2008, Miranda cracked Ron Chernow\u00e2\u0080\u0099s doorstop biography, \u00e2\u0080\u0098\u00e2\u0080\u0098Alexander Hamilton,\u00e2\u0080\u0099\u00e2\u0080\u0099 which was nominated in 2004 for the National Book Critics Circle Award and won the George Washington Book Prize. A few dozen pages in, Miranda\u00e2\u0080\u0099s new project began leaping to life. In Hamilton, he saw a figure he recognized: a word-drunk firebrand with untrammeled ambition, raw talent, an outsize ego and a lust for combat, verbal and otherwise. Miranda saw a rapper.Mr. Miranda first performed \u201cAlexander Hamilton,\u201d the song that would go on to open the musical, at the White House in 2009.  Sung by Aaron Burr, the song begins:Ms. Rosen writes:The question is a good one. How exactly did Hamilton rise from the deprivations of his childhood in the island backwater of St. Croix to become a storied founding father: an aide-de-camp of Gen. George Washington, the prime mover in the creation of the United States financial system, the first secretary of the Treasury, the author of nearly half of the Federalist Papers, the subject of America\u00e2\u0080\u0099s first political sex scandal, the bane and bugbear of everyone from Burr to Thomas Jefferson and James Madison? But it is the manner in which \u00e2\u0080\u0098\u00e2\u0080\u0098Hamilton\u00e2\u0080\u0099\u00e2\u0080\u0099 poses this question \u00e2\u0080\u0094 in the emphatic cadences of rap, with witty rhymes pouring out over a tolling beat \u00e2\u0080\u0094 that has been electrifying audiences since January, when the show debuted Off Broadway at New York\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Public Theater.\nMr. Miranda says that \u201cHamilton\u201d is \u201ca story about America then, told by America now.\u201d  The \u201cbeef\u201d Hamilton and Jefferson had then are debates we\u2019re still having today. How many connections to our world can your students make as they read, watch and listen?Below, a few ideas to help.Ideas for History, Civics and Social Studies Teachers:Getting to Know the CharactersRon Chernow, who wrote the biography that inspired \u201cHamilton,\u201d discusses the similarities between Washington and Hamilton.\u201cHamilton\u201d takes the dull, virtuous characters students know from history textbooks and reveals them to be complex, contradictory flesh-and-blood human beings.  Hamilton was not only the most brilliant of the Founders, but also the most flamboyant. An orphan raised in the West Indies, he was the only self-made man in a galaxy of patricians. His adulterous affair with Maria Reynolds produced the first great sex scandal in American politics.Then they might \u2026\u2013 Compile a list of the top 10 most interesting facts about this person \u00e2\u0080\u0094 with, of course, proper source-citation.\u2013 Or read on to use some of the other ideas in this post, from rap battles to social-media profiles to their own artistic interpretations of history in the genre of their choice.On a basic level, the American Revolution was driven by words: fiery statements of principle; charges of imperialist oppression; accusations of betrayal; fine points of governance; even wordy obfuscations to gloss over disagreements that could have sabotaged the country at its start. What better musical genre to tell this tale?Here is a selection from the battle:Jefferson:Digging into the Federalist PapersAfter gaining independence from the British in the American Revolution, the young United States adopted the Articles of Confederation to set up its new government. By design, the central government was very weak. After all, the people desperately did not want another King George.But was the new national government too weak? The founding fathers thought so \u2014 and so they met in Philadelphia in the summer of 1787 and drafted a new Constitution that would set up a new framework for a stronger government.Just because they wrote it, though, did not mean the country would adopt it. So Alexander Hamilton, along with James Madison and John Jay, rallied to the cause. In the musical, Hamilton asks Burr to help him write the Federalist Papers, but Burr declines, even as Hamilton argues:What did Hamilton and the other founding fathers write in the 85 Federalists Papers? What arguments did they make in favor of the Constitution? And what was the response from anti-Federalists, the founding fathers who vocalized their concerns with the Constitution?Here are a few possible pairings. We\u2019d love to add more, so please suggest your ideas in the comments.Taking Creative License With HistoryAs Lin-Manuel Miranda says in the video above, some of his choices for the musical are not historically accurate, but made the story stronger dramatically. He also points out that the way \u201chistory\u201d is told depends on who is telling the story. Invite your students to think about questions of historical accuracy and artistic license through exercises like the following:\u2013 What works of art \u00e2\u0080\u0094 whether literature, film, theater or visual arts \u00e2\u0080\u0094 drawn from real events in history or the lives of real people, do you especially admire? How have they shaped how you view that person, time or place? Where and how was creative license taken? Did it strengthen or weaken the work? Why? \u2013 What event in American history would you like to use as inspiration for your own creative piece? What would you do with it? Would you write a scene from a musical or novel, paint a picture, make a video or create a poem? To what extent would you need to take creative license with the facts? Why? \u201cHamilton\u201d and Politics TodayIn one scene Hamilton drops a thick batch of papers several feet to the floor, a screed against John Adams that lands like a punch \u00e2\u0080\u0094 a moment that mirrors Senator Lindsey Graham\u00e2\u0080\u0099s dropping his cellphone from a roof, in a recent video, to mock his rival Mr. Trump for giving out his number. (In another video, Rand Paul takes a chain saw to a stack of papers meant to be the federal tax code.) Ted Cruz, Mike Huckabee, Rick Perry and Mr. Trump have also embraced a call-it-as-I-see-it style of attack that calls to mind one of Hamilton\u00e2\u0080\u0099s slaps at Jefferson: \u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd another thing, Mr. Age of Enlightenment, don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t lecture me about the war, you didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t fight in it.\u00e2\u0080\u009dAt times it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s today\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Republicans who seem more in tune with the blunt Hamilton and bombastic Jefferson of the musical. By contrast the leading Democratic candidate in the 2016 race, Hillary Rodham Clinton, occasionally seems like a kindred spirit of Aaron Burr, the Hamilton nemesis who would probably approve of Mrs. Clinton\u00e2\u0080\u0099s refusals to take a stand on the Keystone XL pipeline and the Pacific trade deal. As Burr puts it in one song:How are the same things at issue?  Who do the characters in \u201cHamilton\u201d remind you of today? What might politicians learn from the show?  And finally, a possible class debate topic: Were partisan politics nastier then or now?The Effects of Nonwhite Casting The founding fathers were white, and many owned black slaves. The cast of \u00e2\u0080\u009cHamilton\u00e2\u0080\u009d is mostly nonwhite. Can you tell me about your thinking as you wrote and cast the show? Odom Jr.:  In the first two minutes of this show, Lin steps forward and introduces himself as Alexander Hamilton, and Chris steps forward and says he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s George Washington, and you never question it again. When I think about what it would mean to me as a 13-, 14-year-old kid, to get this album or see this show \u00e2\u0080\u0094 it can make me very emotional. And I so look forward to the day I get to see an Asian-American Burr. Miranda: That\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be the note that goes with the school productions: If this show ends up looking like the actual founding fathers, you messed up.What classic films, television shows or works of theater might change in interesting and important ways if cast differently than they were originally? How? Burr vs. HamiltonWe stop the press to announce the melancholy intelligence that Gen. Hamilton is dead. He expired about 2:30 o\u2019clock.Who was Aaron Burr? How were he and Hamilton both alike and different? Watch the video above and read the book review to begin answering those questions. How does Mr. Miranda play up their contrasts while exploring the complexities of their relationship?What do you learn from this piece about how Americans viewed Hamilton and Burr in their time? One hundred years later?Immigrants/We get the job doneThe ensemble sings:I didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know Hamilton was an immigrant, and I didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know half of the traumas of his early life. And when he gets to New York, I was like, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI know this guy.\u00e2\u0080\u009d I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve met so many versions of this guy, and it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the guy who comes to this country and is like, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI am going to work six jobs if you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re only working one. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m gonna make a life for myself here.\u00e2\u0080\u009d That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a familiar story line to me, beginning with my father and so many people I grew up with in my neighborhood. So \u2026 every play or work of fiction kind of has to start with you identifying a character and saying, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI know this guy. I could write that guy.\u00e2\u0080\u009d And I kind of ran with that.He points out that right now \u201cimmigrant is used as a dirty word by politicians to get cheap political points.\u201d Go through The Times to find stories about immigrants today that fit the description of the immigrant spirit that Lin-Manuel Miranda describes and \u201cHamilton\u201d illustrates. How are they lending their energy and talents to our nation?Behind Every Great Man Is a Great WomanWhile most students are aware of Aaron Burr and Alexander Hamilton thanks to American history class, they are less aware of the women who also played a role in the revolution. Ask students to nominate a woman to be featured on U.S. currency after reading about the process.  Encourage them to research the women who don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t often receive credit for the work they do \u00e2\u0080\u0094 women like Elizabeth Schuyler.  Ideas for English Language Arts and Performing ArtsThe cast of the Broadway musical performing the number \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe Schuyler Sisters.\u00e2\u0080\u009dWhen students lament that they will never need to know those esoteric vocabulary words, show them some lines from \u201cHamilton\u201d:Have students listen to the lyrics.  What words do they need to look up?  Can they figure out the meanings based on the context?  What language and rhymes do they especially admire? What are your student\u2019s favorite lines? Why? One of the reasons Shakespeare stands above his contemporaries is that he had such a great ear. His characters have individual voices. They don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t all speak in the same patterns, but rather, he defines each speaker by particular quirks and habits \u00e2\u0080\u0094 just as we speak in everyday life. Miranda does the same thing.Read the post to learn how \u201canyone who can understand and enjoy Hamilton can understand and enjoy Shakespeare,\u201d and to see the writer\u2019s analysis of rhetorical patterns in songs like  \u00e2\u0080\u009cStay Alive\u00e2\u0080\u009d  and \u201cSatisfied.\u201d After students have identified the techniques in \u201cHamilton,\u201d ask them to look for similar uses in Shakespeare. What do the two have in common? Lin Manuel-Miranda\u2019s Musical InfluencesThe 35-year-old son of Puerto Rican parents, raised in a heavily Hispanic neighborhood of northern Manhattan and educated at a public school for gifted children on the Upper East Side, Mr. Miranda is an exuberant fanboy who happily tweets mash-ups of lyrics from Drake and \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe Little Mermaid,\u00e2\u0080\u009d knowing that almost no one will get the joke.He recognized early that hip-hop and show tunes, even with their different sounds and audiences, share an emphasis on storytelling \u00e2\u0080\u0094 both musical styles are animated by lyrics that advance narrative, and that understanding shaped \u00e2\u0080\u009cHamilton,\u00e2\u0080\u009d which he conceived, wrote the music and lyrics for, and stars in.Latin music was big in the Miranda home, in Inwood, and in Puerto Rico, where Mr. Miranda spent his summers. But rap and hip-hop were woven into his childhood as well.Hip-Hop History and \u201cHamilton\u201d\u00e2\u0080\u009cBy the second chapter, I was like, \u00e2\u0080\u0098I know this guy,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 \u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Miranda said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cJust the hustle and ambition it took to get him off the island \u00e2\u0080\u0094 this is a guy who wrote his way out of his circumstances from the get-go. That is part and parcel with the hip-hop narrative: writing your way out of your circumstances, writing the future you want to see for yourself. This is a guy who wrote at 14, \u00e2\u0080\u0098I wish there was a war.\u00e2\u0080\u0099 It doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t get more hip-hop than that.\u00e2\u0080\u009dHip-hop is a native tongue to him, but he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s putting it in service of the musical. His hip-hop references are expedient first, winks to those in the know second, and true to the genre\u00e2\u0080\u0099s tenets last. There is a nerd instinct in hip-hop, particularly lyrically minded hip-hop \u00e2\u0080\u0094 it can be collegiate at times. What inspires Miranda is assonance, polysyllabic rhyme, cramming bars full of detail. He\u00e2\u0080\u0099s also someone who understands rapping as a game of one-upmanship \u00e2\u0080\u0094 hence the pair of scenes in which Hamilton and Thomas Jefferson face off, which could have come from \u00e2\u0080\u009c8 Mile\u00e2\u0080\u009d or Scribble Jam.Mr. Caramanica goes on to cite references to Mobb Deep, LL Cool J, Jay Z, and, as he says: Biggie, Biggie, Biggie. For a certain stripe of hip-hop fan, Biggie is the ne plus ultra. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve got all of \u00e2\u0080\u009cReady to Die\u00e2\u0080\u009d and \u00e2\u0080\u009cLife After Death\u00e2\u0080\u009d committed to memory, and I suspect Miranda does, too. \u00e2\u0080\u009c10 Duel Commandments\u00e2\u0080\u009d is, natch, a remake of \u00e2\u0080\u009c10 Crack Commandments,\u00e2\u0080\u009d with its same blend of horror and pathos. And the \u00e2\u0080\u009cif you don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know, now you know\u00e2\u0080\u009d Jefferson drops in \u00e2\u0080\u009cCabinet Battle No. 2\u00e2\u0080\u009d is straight out of \u00e2\u0080\u009cJuicy.\u00e2\u0080\u009dThe piece then points out:Likewise, anyone who follows Mr. Miranda\u00e2\u0080\u0099s lively Twitter feed knows all about his 3-month-old son, his obsession with \u00e2\u0080\u009cLes Mis\u00c3\u00a9rables\u00e2\u0080\u009d and the roster of celebrities and friends seeing his show on a given night. Before lunch, Mr. Miranda tweeted a photo of himself working on his laptop at the tavern, a Revolutionary War haunt of Hamilton\u00e2\u0080\u0099s and Burr\u00e2\u0080\u0099s, and the place where George Washington held a farewell dinner for his officers.Invite students to take the historical or literary figure of their choice \u00e2\u0080\u0094 whether Alexander Hamilton or Katniss Everdeen \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and imagine what his or her social media presence might look like. What would their bios read? What images and status updates would they post? Whom would they follow, friend, retweet or repost? Why? Who Lives, Who Dies, Who Tells Your Story?But the boldest stroke in Miranda\u00e2\u0080\u0099s musical is that he takes on the whole life \u00e2\u0080\u0094 every significant episode. He shows how the active life is inevitably an accumulation of battles, setbacks, bruises, scars, victories and humiliating defeats.He ends the column this way:America changes color and shape, but the spirit Hamilton helped bring to the country still lives. I suspect many people will leave the theater wondering if their own dreams and lives are bold enough, if their own lives could someday be so astounding.\u201c\u00e2\u0080\u0098We could all be dead tomorrow,\u00e2\u0080\u0099\u00e2\u0080\u0099 Miranda says. \u00e2\u0080\u0098\u00e2\u0080\u0098Who tells our story? Will it be told? We have no way of knowing. In essence, that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s what the show is about.'\u201d\u2026\u00e2\u0080\u0098\u00e2\u0080\u0098 \u00e2\u0080\u0098Who lives? Who dies? Who tells your story?\u00e2\u0080\u0099 It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a question for the characters on that stage, and it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s also a question for the audience. It leaves you reckoning with: Wait, who does tell my story? What am I doing with my life? I think that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s why, when I get emails about this show from people in the audience, they usually come at three in the morning. They\u00e2\u0080\u0099re dark-night-of-the-soul emails. Because it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a question we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re all grappling with. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a question that we all pose at the end.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\u00e2\u0080\u0099How would your students answer those questions? How will yours be told?

{"Headline": "Framing Your Digital Art: Meet the eWilner App", "Date": "2016-03-14", "News": "Supported byIn the beginning (i.e., a few decades ago) there was the word, as the Internet enabled anyone with a computer to become a writer and critic.Now dazzling breakthroughs in speed and storage capacity have helped usher in the age of the image, allowing almost everyone to become an artist.In 2006, only a few million photographs were uploaded and shared around the world each day. Today, that ever-growing total stands at well over two billion per day, or tens of thousands per second, according to various estimates.The explosive growth of photo-sharing sites such as Pinterest and WhatsApp (both founded in 2009), as well as Instagram (2010) and Snapchat (2011), are fueling this boom.Eli Wilner, the New York framer of priceless works of art whose clients include the Metropolitan Museum of Art, Sotheby\u2019s and Christie\u2019s, said that he believed that something crucial was missing from this trend: museum-quality frames. \u201cThroughout the history of art, frames have been essential to the presentation of pictures,\u201d he said. \u201cIn the digital age, as more people take and share photographs, it\u2019s important that we not forget how great frames can also enhance pictures from their wedding, honeymoon or bar mitzvah, and make them special.\u201dPeople may cherish shots of their children at the beach, or the sleeping lion they captured on safari in Kenya, but Mr. Wilner knows that few would be able to buy one of his antique or hand-carved frames; they usually sell for $10,000 to $250,000.So he has dropped his price to zero \u2014 albeit for an app that includes free digital copies of four of his signature frames, and a much larger selection for 99 cents each.The iPhone app he just released, eWilner Frames, can instantly place any picture from the phone\u2019s camera roll into one of more than 100 frames in his collection \u2014 including those used for paintings by Picasso, Childe Hassam and Thomas Eakins. With a swipe of the finger, users can breeze through the choices until they have \u201cthat aha moment, where they know they have just the right one,\u201d Mr. Wilner said.Even though the world of fine art and museums still centers on personal encounters with physical objects, curators, dealers and collectors increasingly buy and sell works of art and frames online or based on digital images.Mr. Wilner\u2019s first effort to introduce a framing app fizzled in 2010. The technology then was too cumbersome and slow, forcing users to insert each photo manually into each frame.He also explained that two developments had altered the landscape. Faster processors and cheap cloud computing meant that his bulky app could now be blazing.Still, it remains to be seen whether Mr. Wilner\u2019s frames will have the same appeal to mobile millennials that they do to middle-aged hedge fund managers and museum curators.Does the selfie need a frame? We\u2019ll see.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "A Mix of Beer, Bragging Rights and Horse Races at the Cheltenham Festival", "Date": "2016-03-18", "News": "Supported by9 PhotosPRESTBURY PARK, England \u2014 This is the place where horse stories become myths and the humans around them become legends. It is where horses glide over this soft ground, soaring over undulating hills as if they were big waves before taking flight over hurdles and steeplechase fences.The Cheltenham Festival, which originated in 1860 and has taken place at Cheltenham Racecourse since 1911, is the premier event of England\u2019s steeplechase season. It is held over four days, beginning on March 15 this year, and its start is eagerly counted down the way children anticipate Christmas. It explodes into Mardi Gras, however, as soon as the jumpers pass the grandstand on opening day in the first of 28 races.The Festival usually falls around St. Patrick\u2019s Day, and the Irish come here, about 100 miles west of London, in force to root for their horses against their English rivals\u2019 for a full year\u2019s bragging rights. It is as much a cultural event as it is a celebration of a way of life where horses are more than part of the rural landscape; they are like family. So then it is natural to quaff a pint and put a pound or two on the one you think is the fastest.\u201cIt is about passion and gambling and a whole lot of drinking,\u201d said Michael Dickinson, now a successful thoroughbred trainer in the United States known as the Mad Englishman for his eccentricities, who comes each year for a taste of his heritage. \u201cBut it\u2019s the most knowledgeable crowd in racing. They know and love the horses and know how hard the horsemen work to become successful.\u201dThe Zeus of Cheltenham is the gelding Arkle, who in the 1960s won three Cheltenham Gold Cups \u2014 the meeting\u2019s premier race, held on the final day. He turned North County Dublin into a destination for horse lovers who wanted to see for themselves if, as legend had it, his bucket was a mash-up of bran, dry oats and six raw eggs saut\u00e9ed with two bottles of Guinness.Human feats get their due here as well, whether it is saddling the first five finishers in the Gold Cup as Dickinson did in 1983, with Bregawn on top, or the gambling prowess of a stable hand named Conor Murphy who, in 2012 while working as a groom, turned a $75 bet into a life-changing payout of more than $1.5 million. The winnings allowed Murphy to move to Kentucky and open his own stable.This meeting has elevated an 8-year-old mare by the name of Annie Power into the pantheon and anointed a quiet American godfather of the National Hunt, the circuit for jumpers.His name is Rich Ricci, a former bank executive Fleet Street calls the Fat Cat in the Hat. As he strode into the winner\u2019s enclosure, he looked every bit the part. Ricci prefers bespoke suits \u2014 the bigger the plaid, the better \u2014 and his ever-present trilby is always cocked just so.Ricci shed some tears along with multitudes of the more than 67,000 here after Annie Power captured the two-mile Champion Hurdle Challenge Trophy on Tuesday to finally win a race on what is considered the National Hunt\u2019s most hallowed ground.Annie Power\u2019s only two losses had come on this course, and last year in the Mare\u2019s Hurdle she tore hearts out when she was well ahead of the field but fell on the very last jump. You can guess how the near miss endeared her ever more deeply to her Irish backers.So as Annie Power approached the final jump on opening day, a deafening silence fell over the racetrack with a few \u201cLet\u2019s go Annies\u201d murmured like prayers, only to be shattered with a thunderous roar when she landed safely and cleanly.\u201cFor her to come back is spectacular,\u201d Ricci said. \u201cShe got off the deck to win. You can have all the rest of them.\u201dHer performance instantly became the stuff of Festival legend, but as soon as Annie Power was acknowledged, the party raged on. Last year, according to organizers, 265,000 pints of Guinness were drunk over the four days along with 120,000 bottles of wine.But as Chris Dooley, a columnist for The Irish Times, wrote, civilized behavior does prevail: \u201cBalance requires that it should also be recorded that 45,000 afternoon teas were served to customers over the same period.\u201dMore than a half-billion dollars were bet on the races, no surprise in a country where betting shops are ubiquitous and mobile apps for William Hill and Bet365 are as much the smartphone experience as Twitter or Facebook. Still, on the apron of the racecourse, old-time bookmakers stand on boxes with electronic odds boards behind them and bob like buoys above a sea of gamblers.In their midst was David Power, one of the founders of Paddy Power, among the world\u2019s largest and most successful bookmaking companies. Power is a multimillionaire, but for Cheltenham he stands on a box and writes tickets beneath the banner of Richard Power Bookmaker, the company his grandfather started in 1898. Even though his company has profited from online and exchange wagering, Power prefers clutching a multicolor Bic pen in his fist and keeping track of his money with a scrawl and a rainbow of colors.\u201cThey wheel me out and I go at it,\u201d said Power, 68, as a mob in the bookmakers\u2019 ring pushed his way. \u201cThere\u2019s so much energy for these big meets. It\u2019s in my blood.\u201dThere is no real money to be made in the National Hunt \u2014 the horses are older and are usually geldings, so there really is not a breeding industry to profit from. The money for everyday races are small and purses in the marquee events pale in comparison to flat racing. Annie Power, for example, is quite a ways from earning $1 million despite winning more than 14 races at the National Hunt\u2019s highest level.Ricci, however, was a top executive at Barclays, where his salary and bonuses topped $100 million. His Fat Cat in the Hat moniker was in the headlines after the firm paid a fine of roughly $450 million in 2012 for rigging interest rates and cheating its clients.With time and money on his hands, Ricci spent an afternoon at Sandown Park outside London and fell in love with jumpers.\u201cI just thought it was beautiful how these horses carried themselves and competed so hard,\u201d Ricci said.He teamed with the Ireland-based trainer Willie Mullins and quickly became one of the dominant owners in National Hunt racing. Mullins is a taciturn sort with a face seemingly carved from the cliffs of the Irish coast, but he is emblematic of Irish and English jump racing, where horsemanship is an honor and owning jumpers is a pastime rather than a business.The horses themselves become the stars because they are developed slowly, compete in compact seasons and race until they are age 8, 9, 10 or even older, growing a greater following with each passing year.After Annie Power\u2019s victory, Mullins began laying plans to bring the mare back next year for the Gold Cup. He compared her to Dawn Run, who was trained by his father, Paddy Mullins, and is the only horse in the history of the Festival to win the Champion Hurdle and the Gold Cup, the meet\u2019s two most prestigious races.\u201cWhen I bought Annie Power,\u201d he said, \u201cI thought, This is the closest mare I have seen to Dawn Run.\u201dThe third member of the team, the jockey Ruby Walsh, is the Stephen Curry of jump riders. He has a Festival-record 52 career victories and is perhaps the only man in the world who can part the crowds in Guinness Village, which overflows with revelers from the time the meeting\u2019s gates open to until their close and makes wearing a bit of Ireland\u2019s favorite beer on your sports coat or dress inevitable. With each victory, Walsh stands up in his stirrups and throws a jubilant uppercut into the air with enough force to knock out an elephant to the full-throated appreciation of his raucous fans.Walsh, Mullins and Ricci heard that boisterous chorus three separate times on the Festival\u2019s opening day as they met in the winner\u2019s enclosure with Douvan and Vroum Vroum Mag as well as Annie Power. The trio heard it twice more on Thursday when Vautour won the Ryanair Chase and Limini took the Stud Mares\u2019 Novices\u2019 Hurdle. What could possibly top that?A Gold Cup triumph, of course. Ricci\u2019s horse Djakadam was among the contenders in this renewal of Cheltenham\u2019s gold-plated race on Friday. He could manage only a hard-fought second.But Ricci was hardly discouraged: Maybe next year with Annie Power?In a sport where characters are welcome and flying horses are revered, the Fat Cat in the Hat has found a home.\u201cLook around,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a beautiful place and home to people who worship these athletes. I\u2019m lucky to be a part of it.\u201dBecause of an editing error, an article on March 19 about the Cheltenham Festival, a steeplechase event in horse racing, referred incorrectly to a nickname for the former Barclays executive Rich Ricci, the owner of the mare Annie Power.

{"Headline": "Texas Officer Charged With Murder in Shooting of Teenagers Suspected of Attempted Burglary", "Date": "2016-03-17", "News": "Supported byA Texas police officer has been charged with murder after chasing down and fatally shooting one of two teenagers he suspected of trying to break into his car.An arrest warrant made public on Thursday said the officer, Ken Johnson, was arrested on Wednesday after confronting the two teenagers on Sunday in Farmers Branch, a Dallas suburb, because he believed they were trying to burglarize his car in the parking lot of his apartment complex.The youths fled in a red Dodge Challenger, but the officer gave chase, the teenagers\u2019 vehicle \u201cspun out\u201d of control, and he fired his weapon, the police said.The shootings spurred a protest and left police officials facing questions about how an effort by Officer Johnson, 35, a member of the Farmers Branch Police Department, to stop what he believed to be an attempted burglary had spiraled into a shooting that left one teenager dead, another wounded and the officer facing murder and assault charges.Asked if it was department policy for off-duty officers to chase suspects in their own vehicles, the Farmers Branch police chief, Sid Fuller, said bluntly, \u201cNo.\u201dThe dead teenager was identified as Jose Cruz, 16. Edgar R. Arevalo, whose age was not immediately available, sustained serious gunshot wounds in his hands and head and was taken to a hospital.Officials said they were interviewing witnesses and investigating the shootings. It was unclear whether the two suspects were armed or whether Officer Johnson had identified himself as a police officer. On Thursday, a spokeswoman for the Dallas district attorney\u2019s office said the case would be turned over to a grand jury.According to the arrest warrant and police statements, Officer Johnson was at his apartment on Sunday in Farmers Branch, a city of about 31,000 just 14 miles north of Dallas. Just before 7 p.m., he said he saw two youths who he \u201cbelieved were burglarizing his vehicle\u201d in the parking lot of the complex. When he approached them, they fled in their own car.The officer followed them to an intersection in the nearby town of Addison, where the Dodge \u201cspun out and there was an altercation,\u201d the statement said. \u201cShots were fired. Both young men were hit.\u201dThe arrest warrant said that when Farmers Branch and Addison police officers arrived at the scene, Officer Johnson was standing in the roadway, armed with a semiautomatic pistol. He was placed on administrative leave, arrested late Wednesday and booked into the Dallas County Jail. On Thursday, he was released on $150,000 bond, according to Brittany Dunn, the spokeswoman for the Dallas district attorney\u2019s office.Officer Johnson joined the Farmers Branch Police Department last March, after serving about eight years with the Dallas transit police, Detective David Laisure of the Farmers Branch department said on Thursday.Addison\u2019s police chief, Paul Spencer, said in a statement that he and Chief Fuller met with Mr. Cruz\u2019s family on Tuesday.Ana Henr\u00edquez, Mr. Cruz\u2019s mother, said she had been told that the shooting would be fairly and thoroughly investigated.\u201cI hope what they told me is true,\u201d she said after an emotional meeting with police officials, according to The Dallas Morning News.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Ad Watch: Offering Salvation for Americans Fleeing Politics", "Date": "2016-03-10", "News": "Supported byDuring presidential election years, Americans of varying political persuasions often contemplate moving to Canada. Google queries for Canada spike. Conversations between friends turn to preferred Canadian destinations.On the surface, the website seems like a joke. \u201cMake Canada Even Greater,\u201d the introductory text reads, in a nod to a certain politician\u2019s campaign slogan. Symbols of Canada are everywhere \u2014 a moose, maple syrup, the Canadian flag, a hockey player in a jersey with a maple leaf. There\u2019s even a section on \u201cwhat to expect from your new home\u201d (\u201cCanada is big,\u201d \u201cHigh poutine diets\u201d).\u201cIt\u2019s where the zeitgeist is going,\u201d said Dianne Wilkins, the chief executive of Critical Mass. \u201cWe\u2019re in a unique place to comment on and participate in this public half-comedy, half-serious discussion that\u2019s going on out there.\u201dBut beneath the goofy website is a more serious goal: talent acquisition. Critical Mass, now a global digital agency whose clients include Nissan and Citi, is looking to hire roughly 30 people to work in its Calgary and Toronto offices.The campaign, while timely, also speaks to an underlying fear in the ad industry that talent may be slipping away. For many years, creative types who also wanted a job that paid the bills \u2014 and made their parents proud \u2014 went to advertising agencies. But competition for creative talent is much fiercer today, and agencies are seeing people go instead to companies like Facebook and Google.Critical Mass says the website is already proving successful. Traffic from the site has increased page views on its Toronto careers site by 2,310 percent and on its Calgary careers site by 244 percent, it says. Traffic to the agency\u2019s website has increased 50 percent.The website may be slightly silly, but it could also offend particularly patriotic Americans. It is also trying to capitalize on a cultural moment, which means it could feel stale once the moment passes. And because the campaign is geared more toward the advertising industry than the general public, it might not garner widespread attention.Ms. Wilkins said an employee on the agency\u2019s marketing team in Chicago had the initial idea last week after seeing a BuzzFeed post about moving to Canada after the election. By Monday, the site was live, a stunningly fast turnaround for an industry that seems at times as if it wants to debate and tweak everything ad infinitum.How did Critical Mass get the site up and running so quickly? \u201cWe\u2019re our own client,\u201d Ms. Wilkins said, \u201cwhich helps.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Facebook\u2019s Live Videos Get Lots of Looks but No Money Yet", "Date": "2016-03-30", "News": "Supported byWhen severe weather passed through the Atlanta area early this month, Brad Nitz, a meteorologist for a local television station, WSB-TV, fed viewers live video updates on the station\u2019s website, as he has done for years.But then he did something new: He turned away from the television camera and addressed an iPhone that was streaming him live \u2014 on Facebook. And the station\u2019s social media manager, Jonathan Anker, watched this new Facebook audience swell.At its peak, the stream reached 8,800 viewers at once, and the segment has been played more than 77,000 times in total, far more than the station\u2019s typical online audience.The numbers, Mr. Anker said, were \u201cseriously out of whack, in a delightful way.\u201dExperiences like this have media companies swooning over the possibilities of posting live video to Facebook, a feature made widely available two months ago. For years, companies have searched for ways to unlock three tough questions: How do you attract people to live online videos? How do you reach people on their mobile devices? And how do you get more out of Facebook\u2019s 1.6 billion users?Now, they hope, they have found a key for all three. Yet it is also raising some questions inside the companies about if \u2014 and when \u2014 they will see any meaningful money come from the push.Already, Facebook users can tune in to a daily celebrity news show produced by E!, with anchors sitting behind a broadcast-style desk. TMZ streams daily gossip updates and goes live for breaking news. Local news anchors are broadcasting live from the field and during commercial breaks, or while they apply makeup. Dr. Sanjay Gupta of CNN fielded questions about the Zika virus.\u201cThis feels like a transformative step,\u201d said Liz Heron, the executive editor of The Huffington Post, which recently restructured its video production to favor social media distribution after streaming live video through its website since 2012. \u201cIt\u2019s really the mobile piece that feels different to me.\u201dThe fascination also dovetails with interest inside Facebook itself. The feature, called Facebook Live, has largely lived under the radar so far. But it is one of the company\u2019s highest-priority projects, according to three people directly involved with the initiative, who spoke on condition of anonymity.Internally, Facebook Live is seen as a way to move beyond hosting conversations about television and live events to becoming a venue for both. Mark Zuckerberg, the company\u2019s chief executive, has made Facebook Live one of his pet projects, two of the people said, devoting significant resources and effort to the initiative. Facebook plans to announce a suite of new features and partners in early April and at F8, Facebook\u2019s developer conference in San Francisco later in the month.Facebook declined to discuss details about the announcements.The shows vary widely. Tastemade, a young food media company, streamed a live edition of its \u201cTiny Kitchen\u201d show, in which it prepared a stamp-size hamburger; Martha Stewart spent an hourlong broadcast making pretzels with Seth Meyers. In addition, Facebook has urged celebrities and athletes to use Facebook Live to interact with fans.The Huffington Post has tested live video across many of its 79 Facebook pages, with broadcasts from the campaign trail, celebrity interviews and live music events.\u201cNobody came up to me and said, \u2018you should really be using Live,\u2019\u201d said Ms. Heron, who previously worked at Facebook. \u201cI knew it was something I wanted The Huffington Post to do.\u201dMost of the questions, though, have focused on figuring out how much money the companies will get for video streams viewed on the social network. Live streaming revenue could come from advertising, subscriptions or paid one-time events.Facebook, though, has prioritized getting live video in front of as many users as possible. The company has been eager to talk with media companies about getting started with streaming, but remains vague in conversations about revenue sharing or subscription models.It is pushing a build-first, make-money-later philosophy, one that can be frustrating to media partners, particularly those struggling to navigate broader changes in the online media industry. But whatever the frustrations, they are outweighed by the prospect of reaching Facebook\u2019s huge audience.\u201cIt\u2019s early days, and as with all products at Facebook we build people-first, but we are committed to finding a sustainable monetization model for partners sharing live video on Facebook,\u201d said Fidji Simo, a director of product at Facebook. \u201cIt\u2019s something that we\u2019re thinking carefully about, and it\u2019s important to us to create something that is a good experience for people on Facebook and that works for our partners.\u201dOne of the appeals for media companies has been a sense of regaining control of Facebook\u2019s news feed, the primary source of information on the social network, where posts are sorted based on an opaque computer program. The lack of control has made reaching users \u2014 even those that follow media brands intentionally \u2014 more competitive.So far, putting video on the service can be done only by using a Facebook app on a mobile device. But Facebook is considering letting media partners broadcast live video using their own professional-grade studio recording equipment, according to two of the people with knowledge of the company\u2019s plans. The new efforts could introduce a more polished, professional set of live programming to Facebook\u2019s audiences.Facebook\u2019s ability to convene large audiences will help Live compete with Twitter\u2019s Periscope, an app that helped popularize mobile live streaming last year. Periscope has been growing briskly, the company says. But companies that have used both products say that raw viewer numbers favor Facebook.Donald Alexander, director of social media and audience development at TMZ, the gossip news site, said, \u201cwith Facebook promoting the Live platform so much, at some point I think it could take on a life of its own.\u201dMr. Alexander said TMZ was focusing on Facebook over other platforms, like Periscope. But when asked about specific discussions with Facebook regarding advertising, subscriptions and changes to the tech product, Mr. Alexander responded, \u201cI have to be honest \u2014 they\u2019re keeping it a little to themselves right now.\u201dBecause of an editing error, a picture caption on Thursday with an article about live broadcasting on Facebook misidentified the location of an interview with Wyclef Jean that was aired live by The Huffington Post. Mr. Jean was shown at the Brooklyn Bowl in Brooklyn, not at the one in Las Vegas.Advertisement"}

Starting with a computer company called Sahara, they have built an empire in mining, transportation, technology and media. They own a newspaper and television network which tend to offer favorable coverage of Mr. Zuma and the A.N.C.Some senior party leaders directly criticized Mr. Zuma on Thursday. \u201cTo those people who believe they still need to defend Zuma and have benefited from a close relationship with the Guptas, I appeal to them now to stand back,\u201d Barbara Hogan, a former minister of public enterprises under Mr. Zuma, said in call to a radio station.A day earlier, Mcebisi Jonas, the deputy finance minister, said in a statement that in a meeting with the Guptas in December they had offered him the job of finance minister. Mr. Jonas \u2014 who on Thursday drew statements of support from many high-ranking government officials \u2014 said he immediately rejected the offer.In December, a few days after the alleged offer to Mr. Jonas, Mr. Zuma removed a widely respected finance minister, Nhlanhla Nene, and replaced him with a little-known legislator, a decision that shocked the financial markets, sent the rand plummeting and also drew criticism from senior party members and businessmen. Critics of the decision said that, in appointing a pliable finance minister, Mr. Zuma was seeking to ease financing for public projects that would benefit the Guptas and other allies.Mr. Zuma was forced to reverse himself a few days later by removing his new finance minister and reappointing a well-regarded former finance minister, Pravin Gordhan, who had served from 2009 to 2014. Mr. Gordhan has spent the last three months trying to reassure investors and persuade credit-rating agencies not to downgrade South Africa\u2019s government debt to junk status.But analysts say that continuing doubts about governance in South Africa \u2014 as well as a drought and low commodity prices that have hurt its economy \u2014 will make it difficult for the nation to fend off an eventual downgrade.A day before Mr. Jonas\u2019s statement about the offer of a post, a former A.N.C. lawmaker, Vytjie Mentor, wrote on her Facebook page that the Guptas had offered her the position of minister of public enterprises in 2010. Ms. Mentor wrote that the offer was made in a meeting inside their house, in which Mr. Zuma was also present.The Gupta brothers, all in their 40s, have released statements denying the recent allegations. Mr. Zuma said he had no \u201crecollection\u201d of Ms. Mentor.In Parliament on Thursday, Mr. Zuma said he knew nothing about the alleged offer made by the Guptas to Mr. Jonas.\u201cIf Jonas says he was offered by the Guptas, I think you will be well placed to ask the Guptas, or Jonas,\u201d Mr. Zuma said, as members of his party cheered. \u201cDon\u2019t ask me.

He argued that Mr. Sanders was ducking arguments over his health care plan and other domestic proposals, then kicked his speech up a notch as he accused Mr. Sanders of resorting to name-calling with his tirades against the \u00e2\u0080\u009cestablishment.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00e2\u0080\u009cThat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s killing America, that kind of politics,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Clinton said after describing Mr. Sanders\u00e2\u0080\u0099s rejection of skeptical reports by liberal economists on his Medicare-for-all plan. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s what the Republicans do all the time \u00e2\u0080\u0093 they just call each other names.

{"Headline": "Donald Trump\u2019s Heated Words Were Destined to Stir Violence, Opponents Say", "Date": "2016-03-12", "News": "Supported byIn foreboding conversations across the political world this past year, a bipartisan chorus warned that the 2016 presidential campaign was teetering on the edge of violence.The anger from both sides was so raw, they concluded \u2014 from supporters of Donald J. Trump who are terrified they are losing their country and from protesters who fear he is leading the nation down a dark road of hate \u2014 that a dreaded moment was starting to look inevitable. \u201cI don\u2019t see where that anger goes,\u201d the historian Heather Cox Richardson predicted a few weeks ago, \u201cexcept into violence.\u201dThis weekend it finally arrived.The ugly and chaotic clashes that unfolded on Friday inside a tense Chicago arena between Trump supporters and a coalition of protesters were the culmination of an extraordinarily indignant year in public life in which those on both sides of a widening divide have begun to see their fellow Americans as a fundamental threat to their economic future and basic dignity.By Saturday, it was clear that the past 48 hours were something of a turning point in the presidential race. Demonstrations at Trump rallies persisted, leading to a panicked moment near Dayton, Ohio, when Secret Service agents briefly encircled the candidate after a man leapt over a security barrier and rushed toward the stage. Outside his nighttime rally in Kansas City, police used pepper spray during standoffs with crowds.And Mr. Trump\u2019s rivals in both parties denounced his candidacy as the match that lit the fire, even as they try to harness the same electoral forces that have turned him into the Republican front-runner. \u201cDonald Trump has created a toxic environment,\u201d Gov. John Kasich of Ohio declared. \u201cThere is no place for a national leader to prey on the fears of people.\u201d Senator Marco Rubio, fighting for his political life in Florida\u2019s primary on Tuesday, likened Mr. Trump to a third-world strongman. Hillary Clinton accused Mr. Trump of committing \u201cpolitical arson,\u201d saying that \u201cthe ugly, divisive rhetoric we are hearing from Donald Trump and the encouragement of violence and aggression is wrong, and it\u2019s dangerous.\u201d Inside a campus pavilion at the University of Illinois at Chicago on Friday, a bitter night of pushing, shoving, sign-ripping and yelling left three people injured, the authorities said, and at least four were arrested. Mr. Trump canceled the rally for safety reasons, and on Saturday, sounding annoyed, he called the demonstrators \u201ca disgrace if you want to know the truth,\u201d suggesting it was an organized protest with \u201cprofessionally\u201d made signs. (Activist groups did try to disrupt the event, but many protesters said that they learned of the demonstrations on social media and went of their own accord.)Presidential campaigns have long flirted with the lexicon of violence, as candidates vow to take the country back from the opposing party in the White House and reclaim an endangered vision of America.But this year\u2019s campaign has distinguished itself by the sheer volume of heated words, led primarily by Mr. Trump, and by actual scenes of physical confrontation. Now both Republican and Democratic leaders are predicting a long, grim and pugnacious phase of the presidential race. \u201cI\u2019ve gotta believe it\u2019s only gonna get worse,\u201d said William M. Daley, the son of Chicago\u2019s famed mayor, Richard Daley, who presided over the violent 1968 Democratic convention. \u201cBoth sides are fueling this,\u201d he added.Behind the showdowns is a climate of frustration and fright not seen since the 1960s, or even the 1850s when, in the words of Joanne Freeman, a Yale historian who has studied violence in American politics, \u201ceach side was convinced that the other side was about to destroy America \u2014 or what they believed to be the fundamental essence of America \u2014 and each side totally alienated the other side.\u201dIn Chicago on Friday, such a determination seemed very much in evidence. Michael Joseph Garza, a 27-year-old employee of a Chicago logistics company who is part Mexican and part Italian, had read about the Trump rally on Facebook and, after discussing his candidacy with his wife, felt compelled to protest it to make a point about immigration and tolerance. \u201cEven if Trump just ruins this country for four years, I can\u2019t go to my children and say I did nothing to try to stop him,\u201d Mr. Garza said. It is the kind of deep-seated mistrust and alarm over an unspeakably bleak future that is also expressed by supporters of Mr. Trump like Denise Rubino, 50, a bartender from Concord, N.C. She worries that an America without Mr. Trump at its helm would be \u201ca disaster\u201d and despairs that his enemies within the Republican Party will try to seize the nomination from him, as many have pledged to try.Should that happen, Ms. Rubino said, his voters might not hold back. \u201cI think they\u2019re going to uprise,\u201d she said. \u201cBecause that\u2019s undermining the political process.\u201dIn a testament to how vitriolic the campaign has become, a wide range of figures have pleaded for a lowering of the political temperature and the heated messages, warning it would produce physical altercations, or worse.Mr. Trump\u2019s own team seems highly attuned to the possibility. Mr. Trump ducked his head, grabbing his podium with both hands before backing away.One of Mr. Trump\u2019s personal security guards, who has worked for him for years, was the first to jump on stage. Three other men who appeared to be Secret Service agents leapt on stage, and all formed a ring around Mr. Trump, while other security grabbed the man, tackled him and then escorted him away.Christine Todd Whitman, the former Republican governor of New Jersey and a cabinet member in the administration of George W. Bush, said she has long feared the fury that Mr. Trump\u2019s words could arouse in his supporters and detractors alike. \u201cYou can\u2019t dial back the emotions he\u2019s excited in people easily,\u201d she said in an interview. \u201cThere will be consequences for that.\u201dShe recalled Mr. Trump\u2019s provocative remarks about Mexicans last year. \u201cIf you were told that Mexicans are rapists or criminals and you make assumptions and you are walking down the street and see them in your community,\u201d she said, trailing off. \u201cPeople are going to do things.\u201dReporting was contributed by Julie Bosman, Amy Chozick, Monica Davey, Matt Flegenheimer, Maggie Haberman, Jeremy W. Peters and Marc Tracy.Advertisement"}

After working in Mogadishu in 2012, he realized the only way to make meaningful images was to spend much more time there.But it is expensive for an American photographer to work safely in Mogadishu, and he lacked the money for an extended stay. He was, however, determined to document the Somali people, whom he admired, so he charted a different course: He went to Minneapolis, which is home to some 30,000 Somalis, most of whom came as refugees since 1990.Many people were hesitant to be photographed, he said, assuming immediately that he \u00e2\u0080\u0094 like other journalists \u00e2\u0080\u0094 was there to depict them with \u00e2\u0080\u009ccartoonish stereotypes\u00e2\u0080\u009d as a community of extremists.Mr. Nazaryan began photographing in a charter public high school, which was about 75 percent Somali. Most of the students seemed to have adapted to America \u00e2\u0080\u0094 listening to hip-hop and using social media while staying true to their traditional culture, he said. One day he was photographing Somalis dancing at a graduation party on a boat and the next day they were praying at a mosque. While the young people seemed quite American to Mr. Nazaryan, they tended to hang out with each other, often speaking the Somali language.\u00e2\u0080\u009cThey\u00e2\u0080\u0099re definitely very proud to be Somali,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re deeply religious.\u00e2\u0080\u009dMr. Nazaryan photographed the lifestyles of young Somalis in their 20s as well as at weddings, cultural events, businesses and a Somali independence day festival.Although at first most everyone he met assumed he was there solely because of the ISIS arrests, some warmed to him after they learned he had been to Somalia and knew the places they hailed from. Others just got used to seeing him in their community.Mr. Nazaryan is himself an immigrant from Russia who moved to Hartford with his parents when he was 5. His experience was quite different from that of the Somali youths he photographed. While there were stereotypes of Russians that he had to confront, he said, the Somali immigrants are \u00e2\u0080\u009cdealing with a mountain of stigma.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe most stark difference is the Russian community is not being scrutinized by the F.B.I. and the government in the same way,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThere\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a very active fear of paid F.B.I. informants trying to get Somali kids in trouble. And they are in the age of Donald Trump wanting to bar Muslims from coming to the United States.\u00e2\u0080\u009d"}

He does so with a certain crabby excitement: It requires a $1,500 computer-and-goggles setup that is something of an eyesore, the rig doesn\u2019t fit, and some of the early games don\u2019t feel as if they need this elaborate production.In other words, it feels like the early days in most path-breaking technologies. A little-noticed quality of the future is that it arrives consisting mostly of the past. All innovations consist of things already around us, with a few innovations \u2014 and people, even video game designers, interact with them using the rules they already know.It took about 40 years after the invention of the printing press for paper folding to commonly create smaller, cheaper volumes. In the early days of cars, people drove \u201chorseless carriages,\u201d fearful of travel at a ripping 20 miles an hour. The first web pages looked like cluttered magazines. In every case, it took awhile to learn the rules of the new tech, and then embed them into the product.That seems to be where VR is now, here but not yet at home. Mr. Chen likes what he sees, but is waiting for more content, delivered better, and using features like motion controllers that will show up later this year.If the past is any guide, A.I. will be part of VR, once designers figure out how all this stuff should hang together.

{"Headline": "For Third Time in Four Years, Injury Ends Lindsey Vonn\u2019s Season", "Date": "2016-03-02", "News": "Supported byIn a jarring crash on Saturday, Lindsey Vonn, the women\u2019s overall World Cup leader this season, sustained a hairline fracture in her left knee. Remarkably, even for someone whose career has been marked by dramatic comebacks, Vonn was back racing the next day and led the Alpine combined at the halfway mark of the event in Andorra.Vonn finished 13th in that race, but afterward, still concerned about her knee, she headed to Spain for additional tests. A closer examination revealed three fractures of the leg\u2019s tibial plateau, not one.Vonn continued: \u201cFurther damage to any of the fragments could result in a serious surgery that would risk my future in ski racing. With the world championships in St. Moritz next year and the Winter Olympics in South Korea the following year, I cannot take that risk.\u201dAs the 31-year-old Vonn chases a host of World Cup records and what would be her first appearance at the Winter Olympics in eight years, the question is increasingly whether her often-injured lower body can withstand the rigors of her sport. Moreover, is her racing style suited to staying healthy?Vonn has won 20 World Cup season-long titles, two Olympic medals and 76 World Cup races not only because of her wealth of talent but also because of the way she doggedly attacks every racecourse with a fearlessness that ignores the perils of skiing at 70 miles an hour.Since she was 21, that strategy has led to dominant performances. Vonn is within 10 World Cup victories of the career record set by Ingemar Stenmark, a mark once thought to be all but unassailable.But since 2013, Vonn has torn three knee ligaments, has endured two substantial knee reconstructions, has twice broken her tibia and has broken an ankle.When healthy, in the speed events of super-G and the downhill, she is an almost unbeatable force. Doug Lewis, a two-time Alpine Olympian and longtime World Cup analyst, said before this season began: \u201cThe only thing stopping Vonn, and everyone knows this, is Vonn herself. She is so aggressive and fearless, even in training, she gets hurt.\u201dBecause she is leading the World Cup overall standings, Vonn on Wednesday called her decision to stop racing \u201cone of the toughest\u201d of her career.\u201cWhile I am confident that I\u2019m making the right decision, it still doesn\u2019t make this decision any easier,\u201d Vonn wrote. \u201cThanks to everyone who supported me and stood by me through it all.\u201dVonn becomes yet another ski racing star to exit this season\u2019s competition. Anna Fenninger of Austria, the defending women\u2019s overall champion, injured her knee in October and has missed the season. Aksel Lund Svindal was leading the men\u2019s overall standings when he crashed and tore his anterior cruciate ligament in January. Other stars, like Tina Maze of Slovenia and the American Bode Miller, have chosen to sit out the season.Vonn will unquestionably forge on and mount another comeback next winter. It has always been her approach. At the 2006 Turin Olympics, she limped from her hospital bed to finish eighth in the women\u2019s downhill two days after a harrowing, nearly life-threatening crash.Once her leg fractures heal, she is likely to be back training again, probably by the summer in New Zealand or South America.As Vonn said in an interview in Vail, Colo., her hometown, in November, \u201cI\u2019m the last one standing of my generation of racers.\u201dShe continued: \u201cAfter my second knee surgery, pretty much everyone in my family said, \u2018Lindsey, don\u2019t you want to walk when you\u2019re older?\u2019 And I said, \u2018Don\u2019t worry; there\u2019s going to be some new medical procedure, and I\u2019ll have new knees, and it\u2019ll be no problem.\u2019 It never crossed my mind to retire.\u201dAn earlier version of this story misspelled the surname of the defending women\u2019s overall ski champion.

{"Headline": "Tech Companies, New and Old, Clamor to Entice Cloud Computing Experts", "Date": "2016-03-06", "News": "Supported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Amazon Web Services, a globe-spanning cloud computing network that is part of the online retailing giant Amazon, has rapidly become one of the most powerful forces in technology. It has also become a target for poachers.Last October, at a conference in Las Vegas with thousands of corporate executives and software developers in attendance, A.W.S.\u2019s chief, Andy Jassy, strode before an intentionally poorly disguised image of Lawrence J. Ellison, founder and chairman of the Oracle Corporation. Foot-tall words like \u201cbullies,\u201d \u201cextorted\u201d and \u201cstrong arm\u201d appeared next to Mr. Jassy and the image of Ellision. The logo of Oracle, one of the biggest companies in Silicon Valley, was barely crossed out.\u201cOur marketing team needs work on redaction,\u201d Mr. Jassy joked.Better cloaked was the reason for his enmity: Oracle had been slow to get into the cloud business, but recently made multiple hiring raids on A.W.S. Both Oracle and Amazon declined to comment on Mr. Jassy\u2019s dig.The hunt for the hard-to-find talent that can build and run the massive data centers behind cloud computing is pitting three generations of companies against one another. Old-guard companies like Oracle, tech\u2019s current giants like Amazon and its peers, as well as Bay Area start-ups are offering big salaries and big perks for cloud computing experts.On the social media site LinkedIn, for example, there are over 130 engineering positions available at Oracle Seattle. Many of them are the kind of jobs that now pay $300,000 to $1 million a year, according to Shannon Anderson, who has been recruiting engineers in Seattle and the Bay Area for 25 years.Seattle and its surrounding towns are a hot spot for this kind of tech talent because they are home to A.W.S., which runs the biggest cloud computing service, and Microsoft, which has a large cloud business called Azure. Google also has a cloud computing office in the area. So does Facebook.\u201cSomeone working deep inside Amazon is getting five to 20 recruiting offers a day,\u201d Ms. Anderson said. \u201cCompensation has doubled in five years.\u201d For a recruiter, who is typically paid a percentage of a star engineer\u2019s compensation, \u201cthis is a very good time,\u201d she said.Cloud computing, which powers an increasing number of our devices and services, allows a vast collection of computers \u2014 often spread around the world \u2014 to operate like one giant machine.These computing clouds are being filled with once unimaginable amounts of data from apps, websites and sensors on all sorts of things. Fast-growing online services like Snapchat run on cloud systems. Apple has its own cloud, as does Facebook. Cloud systems even offer the computing muscle needed for things like artificial intelligence.As other tech sectors show signs of slowing, cloud services have created unprecedented demand for highly educated engineers and mathematicians who can build and operate these flywheels of data. Instead of asking about the latest computer coding languages or how to make a web page load faster, the most important question in tech hiring has become: Can you handle petabytes? That is the data in about 13 billion images, or roughly the amount of printed information that would fit in 20 million file cabinets.In the Bay Area, $125,000 a year is not an uncommon salary for someone newly out of graduate school with the expertise to do cloud computing work. With five years of experience, $300,000 along with a range of stock or job opportunities that greatly inflate the value of those paychecks have become the norm.\u201cIt\u2019s an aggressive market,\u201d said Corey Sanders, director of program management at Microsoft Azure. \u201cWe are all data engineers now, and we can convince people that this is the best place to learn that.\u201dThe ability to deal with so much data has also become important to industrial companies like General Electric in figuring out things like jet engine maintenance schedules. G.E.\u2019s pitch to cloud computing experts: We offer a chance to rebuild the industrial world.In the last three years, G.E. has hired 1,500 software developers and systems engineers, and trained a similar number of existing employees to work on cloud systems connected to everything from smartphones to wind turbines and jet engines.\u201cWe\u2019ve hired from every large company, places like Amazon and Google, as well as start-ups, or out of schools,\u201d said William Ruh, the head of G.E.\u2019s cloud business. \u201cWe pay well, with attractive benefits, a life and a chance to work on the mission to remake American industry.\u201dStill, he said, \u201cI\u2019m totally shocked at how fast compensation is moving up.\u201dFor smaller companies, the gold rush is more complicated. In San Francisco\u2019s South Park neighborhood, Tom Chavez runs a company called Krux that scans data from more than three billion devices, creating a trove of seven petabytes of information retrieved by several hundred companies. Many of his 160 or so employees are just the kind of people the giants, along with other start-ups, are looking for.\u201cLinkedIn or Facebook can offer an engineer with a few years\u2019 experience a package close to $1 million,\u201d said Mr. Chavez, who co-founded Krux and is its chief executive. \u201cWe wanted someone out of Stanford for an internship, and Google offered her an annualized $180,000 for the summer,\u201d or about $45,000 for three months.Facebook also wants employees like the people Mr. Chavez has hired. In fact, Vivek Vaidya, a Krux co-founder, calls the steep salaries Krux is compelled to pay \u201cour Facebook tax.\u201dKrux takes up several floors of a brick building at the base of South Park, a onetime place of sweatshops that has filled with start-ups and venture capitalists.On the ground floor, development engineers get daily calls asking if they want to jump ship. A nearby team of data scientists gets 20 or more unsolicited emails a week via LinkedIn. Upstairs, Krux\u2019s recruiter strives to keep people, even as he looks to take from others.\u201cI can\u2019t compete with a $50,000 signing bonus from Google, so I focus on the person, what really motivates them,\u201d said Cade Garrett, who has recruited about 100 people to Krux.Besides offering stock options that could be valuable if the company has initial public offering, a fast-growing start-up can offer younger engineers a crash course in technology \u2014 the kind of training that could one day allow them to start their own companies.\u201cI tell them this isn\u2019t the best-paying job, but they have to think about where things are going: Everything they do here is mission critical,\u201d Mr. Garrett said. \u201cYou go to Google, you can\u2019t be sure that in a couple of years you\u2019ll have a product to show.\u201dMr. Chavez thinks industry titans like Larry Page, the chief executive of the Alphabet holding company that includes Google, are intentionally driving up salaries. \u201cIf I was Larry, I\u2019d do the same thing: throw a few more million at people and cut off everyone else\u2019s oxygen.\u201dEven so, Mr. Garrett tries to keep engineers\u2019 contact information off the Krux websites to foil recruiters. And he is more than happy to do his own poaching. Zenefits, a fast-growing online employee-benefits company currently reeling from the departure of its founding chief and a round of layoffs, is a target.\u201cAbsolutely, I\u2019ll call into any company that is in trouble,\u201d he said.An earlier version of this article misstated the amount Google offered someone out of Stanford for a summer internship. It was $45,000 for three months, not $60,000.Advertisement"}

Trump said he wanted to expand the number of visas available for highly skilled immigrants.His remarks caused shock among some supporters who have seen Mr. Trump as a bulwark against an influx of foreigners taking American jobs.In an immigration blueprint he released in August, in the early days of his surprising charge toward the Republican nomination, Mr. Trump said the visas for highly skilled workers were part of what he called \u201cdisastrous\u201d immigration policies that had \u201cdestroyed our middle class.\u201d He gave detailed proposals on fixing the visa program to protect Americans.But on Thursday, responding to a question from Megyn Kelly of Fox News, one of the debate moderators, Mr. Trump said: \u201cI\u2019m changing. I\u2019m changing. We need highly skilled people in this country, and if we can\u2019t do it, we\u2019ll get them in. But, and we do need in Silicon Valley, we absolutely have to have.\u201dMs. Kelly pressed him on whether he was abandoning his tough criticism of the visas, which are known as H-1B.\u201cI\u2019m changing it,\u201d Mr. Trump said in the debate, \u201cand I\u2019m softening the position because we have to have talented people in this country.\u201dAn interactive delegate calculator simulates how the G.O.P. nomination race might unfold.\u201cOne of the biggest problems,\u201d he said, is that too many foreign students graduating with technology skills from Stanford and other American universities have to leave the United States because they cannot get work visas. \u201cWe absolutely have to keep the brain power in this country,\u201d Mr. Trump said.Alarm quickly spread among those drawn to Mr. Trump because of his early criticism of the H-1B program. American technology workers have faced widespread layoffs in recent years and have often been forced to train their own replacements, many of them from India and in the country on H-1B visas.Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign scrambled to bring the candidate back in line, issuing a statement hours after the debate in which he said, \u201cI remain totally committed to eliminating rampant, widespread H-1B abuse\u201d and pledged to \u201cend forever the use of H-1B as a cheap labor program.\u201d Mr. Trump had promoted his flexibility and deal-making skills during the debate, but being flexible on high-skilled visas could be politically costly, even for a candidate who rarely seems to suffer any damaging blows.At a rally last weekend in Alabama, Mr. Trump was endorsed by Leo Perrero and Dena Moore, two former technology employees of the Walt Disney Company in Orlando, Fla. In testimony last week before the Senate, Mr. Perrero had broken down when he described the humiliation of losing his job and having to train a less-skilled H-1B worker to take over his work.Mr. Perrero and Ms. Moore have sued Disney and two outsourcing companies, accusing them of abusing the visa program. Disney vigorously denies any wrongdoing.The stories of the Disney layoffs resonated with many working- and middle-class Americans with sinking incomes and reduced job security who have flocked to Mr. Trump because of his promises to defend American jobs by deporting illegal immigrants and slashing legal immigration.According to the Associated Press, Donald J. Trump and Hillary Clinton have each won enough delegates to claim their party\u2019s nomination for president.Last week Mr. Trump also won the endorsement of Senator Jeff Sessions, Republican of Alabama, who is a tireless immigration hard-liner and critic of the H-1B program.Many technology workers were baffled by Mr. Trump\u2019s debate reversal.\u201cThe worst case is that this is what he really believes,\u201d Mr. Miano said.In fact, Mr. Trump expressed the same views in October: In a debate on CNBC, he contradicted a moderator, Becky Quick, who noted that Mr. Trump had been critical of Mark Zuckerberg, the Facebook founder, who created an organization to lobby for more high-skilled visas.As Ms. Quick pointed out, Mr. Trump\u2019s own campaign website had described his rival, Senator Marco Rubio of Florida, as \u201cMr. Zuckerberg\u2019s personal senator.\u201d (The Trump website also said that Mr. Rubio\u2019s proposal to increase the number of H-1Bs would \u201cdecimate women and minorities.\u201d)But Mr. Trump told Ms. Quick he was \u201cnot at all critical\u201d of Mr. Zuckerberg and was \u201call in favor of keeping these talented people here so they can go to work in Silicon Valley.\u201dOn Friday, Mr. Perrero said he was not troubled by Mr. Trump\u2019s latest remarks. Mr. Trump, he said, was drawing a distinction between foreign workers with exceptional skills and the younger, less-skilled immigrants from India who Mr. Perrero said replaced him in his job.But Mr. Trump also unapologetically made a similar argument about filling labor shortages with foreigners on guest-worker visas when he parried attacks from Mr. Rubio and another rival, Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, over the foreign waiters and hotel workers he has hired at his resort in Palm Beach, Fla.\u201cIt\u2019s very, very hard to get people\u201d in the winter high season, Mr. Trump said. \u201cIt\u2019s part of the law. We take advantage of it. There\u2019s nothing wrong with it.\u201dAdvertisement"}

A congressional investigation \u00e2\u0080\u0094 led by Senators Rob Portman, Republican of Ohio, and Claire McCaskill, Democrat of Missouri \u00e2\u0080\u0094 found that the website, Backpage.com, changed some of its adult classified ads to conceal the fact that the advertisements were for sex with minors. The two lawmakers, who lead the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, subpoenaed documents that Backpage refused to turn over, they said. Carl Ferrer, the chief executive, was subpoenaed by a Senate subcommittee in October to answer questions about reported child sex-trafficking ads, but he did not attend.

{"Headline": "Sony PlayStation VR Will Cost $399 When It Arrives in October", "Date": "2016-03-15", "News": "Supported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Sony Computer Entertainment is hoping to ride the coattails of its top-selling game console, the PlayStation 4, to gain traction in a new market: virtual reality.On Tuesday, the company said its PlayStation VR, its virtual reality headset that connects with a PlayStation 4, would cost $399 when released in October. The PlayStation VR includes a 5.7-inch screen and multiple sensors for 360-degree head tracking, or the ability to follow where the viewer looks.In order to use the virtual-reality accessory, consumers will also have to buy the PlayStation Camera, which costs $44. When combined with the price of a PlayStation 4, which is $349, the total cost of owning a PlayStation VR system would be roughly $800. Some consumers may also buy the Move, Sony\u2019s motion-based controller, which costs $40, to use with the new device.\u201cWe leveraged our expertise across engineering and industrial design to create a VR system with the most compelling experiences,\u201d said Andrew House, the chief executive of Sony Computer Entertainment, on stage at the Game Developers Conference in San Francisco.Sony\u2019s device \u2014 even when bundled with the PlayStation 4 and other elements \u2014 also undercuts the price of the Oculus and HTC headsets. Oculus is selling its Oculus Rift headset for $599, or $1,500 when combined with a computer. The Vive from HTC costs $800 for the headset, and a computer that supports it would cost more than $1,000.John Koller, a Sony executive, said the company left the camera out of the VR package because many PlayStation owners already have one. He noted that the Move controllers were only required for some games.\u201cWe wanted to make sure we had an accessible price for the gaming community,\u201d Mr. Koller said about the PlayStation VR\u2019s price tag. \u201cHaving low barriers to entry and having as many games as possible is really critical to us.\u201dAnother advantage for Sony will be marketing the device, said Jan Dawson, an independent technology analyst for Jackdaw Research. The most obvious application for virtual reality is hard-core gaming, so it will be easier for Sony to market the devices to its gaming customers than it will be for Oculus and HTC to start from scratch, he said.\u201cSony has a huge edge over others,\u201d Mr. Dawson said.At the event on Tuesday, Mr. House said more than 230 developers were creating content for PlayStation VR. He said the company was planning to release the device in October as more compelling games are expected to be available then.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Tenure Voting Could Shift the Balance of Corporate Power", "Date": "2016-03-01", "News": "Supported byDeal ProfessorA great divide exists in the voting power of shareholders in the United States.The majority of American companies have one share, one vote, but more and more companies are going public with a dual-class stock structure. Here, the voting power rests in the hands of the founders or another group of shareholders.It\u2019s time to consider an alternative: \u201ctenure voting,\u201d a system in which shareholders accumulate more votes the longer they hold stock.Dual-class stock, which must be adopted in the initial public offering stage, is all the rage and is not just found at Google and Facebook. Pure Storage, First Data and Square have all gone public with dual-class stock. Last year, some 13.5 percent of I.P.O.s included some type of dual-class stock, according to DealogicThe difference comes down to the value of a vote.In the case of dual-class stock, either your vote is worth nothing or everything. The founders essentially control the company and wield influence more or less with impunity. This insulates the company from shareholder activism and indeed from the other shareholders. The other shareholders, meanwhile, have worthless votes.In the rest of corporate America, shareholders have one vote for every share. This has the same flaws as American democracy. Too often your vote doesn\u2019t count and many shareholders don\u2019t bother to vote. Everyone also has the same kind of voting power, from an index fund that can hold a stock for decades to day traders who care only about the next five minutes.In other words, neither model works in all cases. In addition, this binary world does not reflect an increasingly complicated reality. Today, founders reflexively go about adopting dual-class stock whether it is good or bad for the company. Dual-class stock may work well at Facebook, but whether it does at Fairway Group Holdings, the struggling grocery store chain that appears to be heading for default on its loans, is another story.The one-share, one-vote companies, meanwhile, are vulnerable to being pushed into quick fixes at the expense of the business long term. Activist hedge funds press companies to enact spinoffs, big share buybacks or other financial engineering tricks to generate a pop in the stock price. And then the activists walk away. This can be a real problem.The charge is heatedly disputed by the activists, who contend that they are simply making companies more efficient. They have a point: Activists have successfully overhauled many staid companies like Darden Restaurants, owner of Olive Garden, where the chief executive was accused of spending several months a year serving on other boards while his own business declined.There is, however, a potential middle ground in shareholder voting \u2014 a system that diverts power from founders while allowing companies to reward longer-term shareholders.In tenure voting, more votes are given to shareholders the longer they hold shares. So for example, if you hold shares for three years at the company you will have three votes per share.The award of more votes for a longer holding period is intended to empower those shareholders who stick with the company. They will presumably have a greater stake in the welfare of the company.It can also provide a counterweight in a dual-class setup. The founders may still have a larger voting bloc, but the power held by long-term institutional investors would grow over time. That would allow some measured shareholder activism, while limiting founder power.The beauty of tenure voting is that it is devised to address short-termism while rewarding all shareholders. Blockchain technology can make it easier to track ownership of everyone\u2019s shares to ensure they are given the right number of votes. (Blockchain technology, which is used by Bitcoin, would create a public ledger of all transactions.)Will long-term shareholders value their new voting power? It is possible that such shareholders may become like sheep, never complaining and never trying to influence the company. They will hold and hold and sell only when the news is very bad.Still, there are some indications that shareholders value the power to vote: Google\u2019s \u201cno vote\u201d shares, for example, trade at a small discount to its one-vote shares.Tenure voting is not a cure-all, to be sure. It may turn out that one share, one vote is best and we should simply reward whoever has the most shares.Yet American companies are in a straitjacket because of the current Wall Street obsession on short-term methods and results. They dare not give shareholders any more voting power if they can help it. Otherwise, though, there are no checks on founders and management.A middle path \u2014 tenure voting \u2014 seems worth trying.Advertisement"}

Will you now have to show a birth certification to claim a stall?Business interests have already signaled their displeasure with the bill.Earlier this month, Republican lawmakers in Georgia pushed through a so-called Religious Liberty Bill. As Reuters put it:\u201cThe Georgia bill, reworked several times by lawmakers amid criticism that earlier versions went too far, declares that no pastor can be forced to perform a same-sex wedding. The bill also grants faith-based organizations \u2014 churches, religious schools or associations \u2014 the right to reject holding events for people or groups of whom they object. Faith-based groups also could not be forced to hire or retain an employee whose beliefs run counter to the organization\u2019s.\u201dGeorgia\u2019s governor has yet to sign the legislation, but as Reuters pointed out: \u201cMore than 300 large corporations and small businesses, including Delta Air Lines and Coca-Cola, have signed a pledge decrying the Georgia legislation and urging the state lawmakers to drop it.\u201dWhen Republican officials aren\u2019t being infantile, they\u2019re being archaic.The future of this country bends toward more inclusion and acceptance, regardless of our occasional regression. This country needs a president who doesn\u2019t pout or get lost in puerile protestations.I understand that Republican voters are filled with an insatiable anger stemming from unbridled electoral enthusiasm that still failed to halt unremitting social change, or elect their hopelessly unimpressive recent presidential candidates. But they are allowing themselves to be led out of the mainstream, over a cliff and into oblivion.America is watching the Republican Party demonstrate its headstrong desire to self-destruct. I\u2019m guessing most of America is not amused.Advertisement"}

In some instances, he said in a recent interview, \u201cI might have to physically appear in more than one place on the same day.\u201dAsif Nazrul, a law professor at the University of Dhaka, said the legal cases would further weaken Bangladesh\u2019s civil society.\u201cThese cases are a strong signal to not just Mahfuz Anam but to all media that if you go beyond the limits that have been set, then you too can be prosecuted for sedition,\u201d he said.Pressure on the two newspapers began to build last fall. After Prothom Alo and The Daily Star published a report in August on the killing of five men by army troops in the Chittagong Hill Tracts, a former conflict area where the military has a large presence, a series of major private advertisers abruptly withdrew from the two newspapers, and advertising revenues for both publications dropped steeply.One executive said the advertisers had come under pressure from the government. Tor Odland, a vice president with the Norwegian company Telenor Group, said in a statement at the time that the Bangladesh telecommunications company Grameenphone, which is part of Telenor, \u201chas, along with several other large corporations, received an instruction from the authorities to stop advertisements in two leading newspapers in Bangladesh.\u201d Press officers for the government denied giving any such instruction.Grameenphone has since placed occasional one-time advertisements in The Daily Star.Tension returned last month when The Daily Star celebrated its 25th anniversary. In response to a question on a televised talk show, Mr. Anam expressed regret for a decision he made in 2007, when the country was led by a military-backed caretaker government, to publish uncorroborated allegations provided to the newspaper by military intelligence officials. The corruption allegations were the basis for the arrest and 11-month detention of Ms. Hasina, who was out of power at that time (her first tenure as prime minister lasted from 1996 to 2001). Her rival, the Bangladesh Nationalist Party leader Khaleda Zia, was also detained.Sajeeb Wazed, Ms. Hasina\u2019s son, reacted immediately, writing on Facebook that he wanted \u201cMahfuz Anam behind bars and on trial for treason.\u201dThe defamation cases began to be filed after Mr. Wazed\u2019s post, sometimes at a rate of five or more per day. Hasanul Haq Inu, Bangladesh\u2019s information minister, said the government had not orchestrated the cases.\u201cThis is not the government against Mahfuz Anam. This is the people against Mahfuz Anam,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cThe Daily Star continues to publish, and has written pieces critical of the government since the cases were filed. The government has no problem with that. There is freedom of the press here.\u201dHe added, however, that Ms. Hasina and her son \u201chave every right to want\u201d Mr. Anam to face prosecution.Mr. Anam described himself as \u201cflabbergasted\u201d at the cases filed against him, noting that the material published in 2007 was \u201cnational news, covered by everybody.\u201d Even today, he said in an interview, journalists are under pressure to uncritically publish material provided by military officials, among them accounts of civilians killed in confrontations with police or military officials.\u201cDo we have a chance to verify that actually what is being told to us is substantiated by facts?\u201d he said. \u201cWe don\u2019t have that.\u201dMostafizur Rahman, an assistant public prosecutor who filed the first sedition case against Mr. Anam, said the newspaper\u2019s reporting was an attempt to \u201ctry and wipe out that family, in order to put this country under the thumb of an evil force by printing falsehoods.\u201dAsked about reporting on high-level corruption, he held up his hands, palms outward, as if to show that no such reporting should be necessary. He invoked Ms. Hasina\u2019s father, Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, Bangladesh\u2019s first leader, using an affectionate nickname.\u201cYou are asking what if someone from Bangabandhu\u2019s family does something illegal?\u201d he said. \u201cHis family could never do something like that. Such a family would not be Bangabandhu\u2019s family.\u201dAn article on Monday about a barrage of litigation against a Bangladeshi newspaper publisher at a time when criticism of the government has become risky referred incorrectly to the political leader Sheikh Hasina, whose 2007 arrest on corruption allegations was covered by the newspaper.

(3) She\u2019d expressed unpopular opinions.\u201dSome of these opinions, which become infamous on YouTube, are on why women should be leery of working for tech companies. \u201cAll these crazy young ones are lining up to burn in their very own Shirtwaist Factories, screaming that they\u2019re empowered by the very technology that\u2019s set them aflame,\u201d Adeline says, in her goofy trans-Atlantic accent, which makes her sound like \u201ca drugged out Diana Vreeland.\u201dSome of these opinions are complaints about the fantasies of fame and power in the songs, videos and social media of today\u2019s pop stars. \u201cA wide range of humanity believed that Beyonc\u00e9 and Rihanna were inspirations rather than vultures,\u201d we read. \u201cAdeline had spit on their gods.\u201d Adeline barely knows what Twitter is. Attack Bey and RiRi? She\u2019s about to find out about its self-righteous side.Adeline\u2019s story sits alongside that of a younger woman, Ellen, whose life is destroyed after an old boyfriend\u2019s pictures of her, taken during sex, are splashed across the web. Each of these women, in Mr. Kobek\u2019s hands, is interesting and sympathetic. But \u201cI Hate the Internet\u201d is fundamentally a platform for the author\u2019s slashing social criticism.New definitions? Comics, here, are \u201csubtle pornography for the mentally backward.\u201d Comic-book conventions are \u201can excuse for people to dress up like the intellectual properties of major corporations.\u201d Money is \u201cthe unit by which people measured humiliation. What would you do for a dollar?\u201dAmazon: \u201can unprofitable website dedicated to the destruction of the publishing industry.\u201d Instagram: \u201cthe first social media platform to which the only sane reaction was hate.\u201d Then there\u2019s this about George W. Bush\u2019s paintings: \u201cLike peering into the shattered mind of a suicidal beagle that\u2019s lost depth perspective.\u201dThis is a shaggy and quite entertaining novel of ideas. The two most prominent of these are: Why are humans so eager, on sites like Twitter and Facebook, to give away their intellectual property to wealthy white men? And: What has happened to political activism? Do people think typing 140-character morality lectures is pushing society forward?A majority of these tweeted opinions, he notes, are smug and hypocritical when not utterly inane. Take Twitter and racism, which brings out the worst in almost everyone. \u201cExpressing concern about racism was a new religion,\u201d Mr. Kobek writes, \u201cand focusing on language rather than political mechanics was an effortless, and meaningless, way of making sure one was seen in a front-row pew of the new church.\u201dLike all jeremiads, \u201cI Hate the Internet\u201d is far better at posing questions than formulating answers. You will sometimes wish that a woman, or an African-American, had composed these acid observations about feminism and race.At times the author loses his focus; at other times you will sense a bit of halitotic spittle striking your chin. Yet this book has soul as well as nerve. It suggests that, as the author writes, \u201cthe whole world was on a script of loss, and people only received their pages moments before they read their lines.\u201dMy advice? Log off Twitter for a day. Pick this up instead.I Hate the InternetA Useful NovelBy Jarett Kobek280 pages. We Heard You Like Books. $15.95.Advertisement"}

Proponents of the current overhaul contend that much has been done. Regulators have been stringent in enforcing rules. Big banks have higher levels of capital compared with 2008, and they are also safer because they make less use of short-term borrowing, which can evaporate in a crisis, causing a run.  Criticisms have also been raised over the complexity of regulations with some saying they have been too clever by half. Mr. Kashkari suggests making the banks hold more equity capital at the outset, rather than relying on the debt component.

It came after a four-year federal investigation that began after Reuters revealed in 2012 that Chesapeake had discussed with Encana, a rival Canadian energy giant, how to suppress land lease prices in Michigan.

{"Headline": "Man Suspected of Killing Roommate at Harlem Shelter Is Found Dead, Police Say", "Date": "2016-03-17", "News": "Supported byThe badly decomposed body, which was found floating on Wednesday morning near 145th Street in Manhattan, has been tentatively identified by the police as that of the suspect, Anthony White. Police officials said on Thursday that investigators thought the remains were Mr. White\u2019s because of an identification card found on the body. But the police were awaiting confirmation from the New York City medical examiner\u2019s office, which had not yet made a determination of the cause or the manner of death, officials said.Mr. White was accused of killing Deven Black on Jan. 27 at the Boulevard Homeless Shelter, at Lexington Avenue and 124th Street, in a crime that revived concerns about the safety of the city\u2019s homeless shelters as well as its ability to handle people with severe mental illness who are living on the streets.Until 2015, Mr. Black was employed by the city\u2019s Education Department, first as a special-education teacher and then as a librarian. He was honored in 2013 by the Academy of Education Arts and Sciences for his exceptional work as a school librarian.But just a year later, he lost his permanent teaching position and then was arrested and charged with bank fraud. His $76,706 salary was suspended, and he ended up in the shelter in Harlem.He was sharing a room with Mr. White, who the police said had a history of psychiatric problems.Mr. Black, residents said, was polite and largely kept to himself. A slight man, he liked to watch basketball and was not known as someone to cause trouble. He was killed on his third night in the shelter, officials said.He had a history of mental illness, his family said, but his behavior had become erratic and unpredictable only in recent years.Mr. White, too, had a history of mental health problems, and he had lately been prone to angry outbursts, his family said.Even so, police officials described his criminal record \u2014 one misdemeanor assault charge \u2014 as practically insignificant, and his family said they doubted that he was capable of such a gruesome crime.At the time of Mr. Black\u2019s death, Leonard McCaffrey, a resident at the shelter, said Mr. White\u2019s temper had worsened in recent weeks.He had become so convinced that people were robbing him that staff members at the shelter gave him a replacement lock for his locker, residents said.Mr. White, who some residents said was known to use K2, a form of synthetic marijuana, would often tell those who bothered him that he would \u201cgive them a 150,\u201d Mr. McCaffrey said, meaning 150 stitches across the face.\u201cHe would fly off the handle,\u201d Mr. McCaffrey said.On Jan. 24, Mr. White was sent from the shelter to Metropolitan Hospital Center, where he was given a shot of medication, kept overnight and then sent back.Kareema Folks, 38, another shelter resident, said she learned to give Mr. White a wide berth.\u201cHe was very angry, very aggressive, verbally abusive, shouting, putting his hands in people\u2019s face, walking down the street shouting, going crazy,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s a sad thing that happened. I feel bad.\u201dOn the day of the attack, Mr. Black and Mr. White clashed.Mr. White was angry about a missing cellphone, according to other residents.He ranted and screamed, and a friend from a neighboring room, Kenneth Ricks, said he tried to calm him down by giving him a pair of Timberland boots he had recently received.But shortly after midnight, a security officer opened the door to the room the two men shared to find Mr. Black\u2019s bloody body, his throat slit.Mr. White was able to flee. A video recorded his exit.Mayor Bill de Blasio, a Democrat whose administration has been battered by questions about conditions in the city\u2019s homeless shelters and who has promised to take steps to improve them, vowed to find the killer and fix the troubled shelter system.\u201cIt\u2019s deeply disturbing,\u201d Mr. de Blasio said soon after the killing. \u201cSomething went wrong. We\u2019re going to do a full investigation to find out how this was possible. But we\u2019re very committed going forward, in that shelter and every other shelter, to making sure they have whatever it takes: the technology, the personnel to keep people safe.\u201dIn a post on Facebook shortly after the attack, Mr. Black\u2019s son, Jonas, said both his father\u2019s death and the story of the man who took his father\u2019s life stemmed from the same problem: a systemic failure to help people with mental illness.\u201cAlthough he had struggled with mental illness for many years,\u201d he wrote of his father, \u201che was unable to get the treatment he needed, and he fell through the cracks of a severely broken system.\u201d\u201cIt is hard not to hate the man who took my father away from me, but ultimately I see my father\u2019s killer as another victim,\u201d he wrote. \u201cHad there been adequate mental health infrastructure in place, this tragedy would not have happened.\u201dKim Barker, Rick Rojas and Nate Schweber contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trial of Veteran Accused of Trying to Join ISIS May Hinge on Unsent Letter", "Date": "2016-03-06", "News": "Supported by\u201cI will escort you into Paradise and when you see the home paid for by my blood and your tears you will know it was worth it,\u201d reads the letter, typed on his computer in January 2015. In it, he pledged to \u201cuse the talents and skills given to me by Allah to establish and defend the Islamic State.\u201dDays after writing those words, Mr. Pugh boarded a plane for Istanbul. Prosecutors say he was on his way to neighboring Syria to present himself to the Islamic State.But Mr. Pugh never got that far. He was detained upon landing in Istanbul and deported to New York, where the Federal Bureau of Investigation was waiting. Last week, he became one of the first American citizens to stand trial on Islamic State-related charges.The testimony in Federal District Court in Brooklyn has shown Mr. Pugh to be a skilled airplane mechanic and a convert to Islam who drifted across the Middle East, finding work at small airlines flying in and out of military bases on Pentagon contracts.But Mr. Pugh\u2019s increasingly radical views had begun to alienate his co-workers and supervisors. One of his managers, Aamer Aslam, now a pilot for United Airlines, testified last week that Mr. Pugh had once claimed that the Islamic State was seeking skilled airplane mechanics. This seemed to hint at Mr. Pugh\u2019s own desire to join the Islamic State.The January letter to his wife, Misha, however, is the clearest declaration of any intentions to join the militant group. It is the perfect piece of incriminating evidence, except for one thing: Mr. Pugh does not seem to have actually sent the letter. It appeared to be just a draft, raising the question of why he never sent it.Did the letter explain his intentions at the time he flew to Istanbul? Did he avoid sending it because he and his wife had previously argued about jihad? His lawyers have claimed that while Mr. Pugh had dark internal fantasies about jihad, his purpose in flying to Istanbul was only to relax and search for a new job.The draft letter perfectly captures the larger question that the jury will have to consider this week as it decides Mr. Pugh\u2019s fate: where (and how) to mark the precise moment when a man\u2019s fantasies become plans and his planning crosses over into concrete action.It is a question that courts and juries are likely to be grappling with in similar cases in the years to come. Since 2013, the Justice Department has charged at least 85 people in cases related to foreign terrorist groups or homegrown violent extremism. Some three-quarters of these cases are connected to the Islamic State, a Justice Department spokesman, Marc Raimondi, said.Terrorism and national security cases traditionally featured clandestine meetings of secret cells and oaths of loyalty. By contrast, the Islamic State has drawn in recruits from afar, in part by bombarding the world with propaganda and scenes of carnage, available to anyone with an Internet connection. Mr. Pugh\u2019s trial is presenting an early case study of how juries will sort through the Islamic State propaganda, online messages and travel itineraries that are likely to account for much of the evidence in such cases.Over several days last week, the jury listened to testimony on topics ranging from Mr. Pugh\u2019s Internet searches and the propaganda he viewed (which included scenes of beheadings and crucifixions under the Islamic State), to the type of clothing Mr. Pugh packed in his backpack (\u201call-terrain sandals,\u201d an F.B.I. agent testified about his footwear), as the prosecution made its case that Mr. Pugh was destined for Syria.For the prosecution, by the time Mr. Pugh flew to Turkey \u2014 a common entrance point to Syria for foreign fighters \u2014 he had taken steps to join the Islamic State, committing a federal crime: attempting to support a foreign terrorist organization. Evidence from his computer showed that he had researched the most common border crossings between Turkey and Syria.But defense lawyers pointed out that he was also searching websites for a new aviation job in the region after being fired from one in Kuwait. And some of his last Internet searches, on TripAdvisor, were for Turkish baths in Istanbul, a detail that is turning into the cornerstone of his defense.At the outset of the trial, one of his lawyers, Eric M. Creizman, even claimed that Mr. Pugh went to Istanbul \u201cto clear his head,\u201d as though the heat of the bathhouses might have cleansed him of his jihadist fantasies.As each side sought to convince jurors of what Mr. Pugh intended to do upon landing in Istanbul, the contents of his two backpacks loomed large. Some items seemed to support the prosecution\u2019s claim that Mr. Pugh was Syria-bound: a black ski mask, a small solar-powered cellphone charger and two compasses. But there were alternative interpretations as well: Istanbul was bitterly cold when Mr. Pugh landed; a solar-powered cellphone charger might be useful to an itinerant airplane mechanic; and compasses could help a Muslim in an unfamiliar city orient himself toward Mecca during prayer.Mr. Pugh is not expected to testify, his lawyers have said. Yet the jury has caught snippets of his innermost thoughts, from his Google searches to his efforts to communicate with his wife, an Egyptian woman who spoke little English, while Mr. Pugh spoke no Arabic. Apart for long periods, they corresponded by recruiting strangers on Facebook to translate their messages between English and Arabic, a laborious process that produced as much frustration as understanding.At one point, they apparently argued about Mr. Pugh\u2019s visions of martyrdom and she had brought up divorce, according to Facebook messages. \u201cI am on a mission for the pleasure of Allah,\u201d Mr. Pugh wrote in one message, less than four months before he left for Istanbul. \u201cI delayed for 2 years because of your selfish behavior. I will not allow you or anyone to get in my way.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Letting (Some of) India\u2019s Women Own Land", "Date": "2016-03-22", "News": "This month, 600 women gathered under a huge blue-and-yellow-striped tent in Baripada, a small city in Odisha, a state in India\u00e2\u0080\u0099s east. They were among India\u00e2\u0080\u0099s most neglected people. Widowed, abandoned or divorced, many had ended up living like servants in the households of their fathers, brothers or in-laws.But on March 5, each woman clutched a single light-green sheet of paper that would change her life: a patta, or title to a small plot of land.The women were among 1,800 getting pattas that day across the district. The documents were hard-won. The battle for women\u00e2\u0080\u0099s land rights in India pits progressive law against oppressive culture \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and the culture has largely prevailed. But the pattas show that small victories for law are also possible.The consequences are enormous. Without title, female farmers acting on their own don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have access to credit, subsidies, government programs for seeds, irrigation or fertilizer. They cannot get loans and do not invest to improve their yields. They live in fear that someone more powerful \u00e2\u0080\u0094 which is everyone \u00e2\u0080\u0094 can kick them off their land.When women\u00e2\u0080\u0099s incomes suffer, so do their children. More than 40 percent of all children under 5 in India are malnourished. And India\u00e2\u0080\u0099s agricultural productivity is needlessly diminished.Landlessness also raises the risk of domestic violence, said Bina Agarwal, a longtime professor at the Institute of Economic Growth at the University of Delhi, and now a professor of development economics and environment at the University of Manchester in Britain. In 1994, Agarwal wrote \u00e2\u0080\u009cA Field of One\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Own,\u00e2\u0080\u009d arguing that landlessness is the single most important factor in the second-class citizenship of women in India.\u00c2\u00a0The book became the founding document of the women\u00e2\u0080\u0099s land-rights movement. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIf a woman owns land, the husband would know that the woman has an alternative place to go. It hugely increases women\u00e2\u0080\u0099s bargaining power within marriage,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cShe knows she has an exit option that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s credible.\u00e2\u0080\u009dLandlessness is both a cause and a product of women\u00e2\u0080\u0099s subjugation. In most of India, a bride becomes part of her husband\u00e2\u0080\u0099s family, living in his parents\u00e2\u0080\u0099 house. Her possessions pass to them. A son, by contrast, brings his wife to his parents\u00e2\u0080\u0099 house. So if parents want to keep property in the family and reward the child who supports them in their old age, they leave land to their sons. (Paying dowry to the daughter\u00e2\u0080\u0099s new family is the customary substitute for leaving her land.)Agarwal said that women owned a higher percentage of the land in places where local culture permitted a woman to bring her husband into her family, marry a cousin, or marry inside her village and stay there. That way, a daughter\u00e2\u0080\u0099s land stays in the family, or at least nearby.India\u00e2\u0080\u0099s attitudes toward women and land remain a bewildering mixture of progress toward modern standards and centuries of discrimination.Some land records don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t even have a place to enter a woman\u00e2\u0080\u0099s name, said Patnaik.To the state, these women were invisible. And there were a lot of them. Rajesh Patil, the administrative chief of Odisha\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Mayurbhanj district, said they turned out to be about 12 percent of the district\u00e2\u0080\u0099s population of rural women. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThey survive on the mercy of their in-laws or parents,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Patil. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt is a substandard life.\u00e2\u0080\u009dThen the government and Landesa established desks in local government buildings. They were called Women Support Centers, run by trained officials \u00e2\u0080\u0094 women, usually.About 5,200 of these invisible women so far have gotten pattas, mostly in ceremonies like the one March 5.\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0 And there are now 76 Women Support Centers.The program has helped to raise political awareness about these women, said Patil.\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe district is seriously thinking now about policies for single women,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s been possible because this program highlighted the issues.\u00e2\u0080\u009dHaving a patta brings the women into formal India. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt is a historical document for their residence in that locality,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Patil. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt is a residence certificate, a caste certificate. They can take out loans against the land to develop it.\u00e2\u0080\u009d They can start the process for a pension. School attendance increases among their children.Perhaps most important, the land gives them social status, autonomy and self-esteem. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThey have something of their own,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Patil.Read previous contributions to this series.Shilpa Vasavada, a longtime leader who is the organization\u00e2\u0080\u0099s convener, said that when the group conducted workshops with village women, \u00e2\u0080\u009c99 percent agreed there was no option of women owning land. Legally they had the right, but nobody knew about it.\u00e2\u0080\u009d That was relatively easy to solve. Much harder: Even when they knew, they were afraid to try.The group began training village women with at least a fifth-grade education to work as paralegals, to tell women about their rights and help them with their cases.\u00e2\u0080\u009cOriginally, we assumed that we\u00e2\u0080\u0098d have to work with the men to change their perception,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Vasavada. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThat was true. But it turned out we also had to work with rural women to change their perception.\u00e2\u0080\u009dIn Landesa\u00e2\u0080\u0099s three-state study, women wanted to own land. But they didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want to inherit it from their parents, because they didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want to incur the hostility of their brothers, whose help they might need if their marriages fell apart.Vasavada said that women often signed their land rights over to a brother.

{"Headline": "Making Technology Easier for Older People to Use", "Date": "2016-03-11", "News": "Supported byRetiringINTIMIDATED by digital technology? So was Marian Goldberg, 70, until she went to a Senior Planet Exploration Center in Manhattan, which teaches older adults how to become more comfortable being online.Now, she has learned to use Pinterest, send messages on Facebook and embed emoji in her emails. Ms. Goldberg, who has a part-time beaded jewelry business, said she had mastered enough tools to reframe herself as a digital entrepreneur.\u201cSenior Planet gave me courage,\u201d said Ms. Goldberg, a retired social worker.Across the country, older adults who grew up in a predigital age are finding more help to navigate the wired world. Senior centers, retirement communities and advocacy groups like AARP are offering more free courses for older adults. And simpler devices and apps, which are better designed for aging hands and eyes, are trickling into the marketplace.Many older people already use laptops and tablet computers, studies show, but use of newer mobile gadgets like smartphones is lagging among the 60 and older cohort. In part that is because mobile devices typically have smaller screens and complex menus that may be harder to navigate.\u201cThe digital divide is closing but still relevant,\u201d said Terry Bradwell, chief enterprise strategy and information officer at AARP. \u201cAs long as tech changes, there will always be a divide of some sort.\u201dBut even for those who only partly close the gap, rewards await. Learning new technology skills helps lessen isolation, gerontologists say, keeps the brain active with games like Lumosity and allows older people to monitor their own health more closely. A robust digital toolbox can even jump-start new careers, as in Ms. Goldberg\u2019s case.Big cities like San Francisco and New York offer free classes. The Brooklyn nonprofit group Older Adults Technology Services (OATS), which runs Senior Planet, has defined its mission as helping older adults harness technology. The Bay Area initiative SF Connected also provides free computer training.Digital groups provide safety, too. \u201cWhen people learn alone, they\u2019re more apt to be victimized,\u201d said Tom Kamber, executive director of OATS. \u201cAnd they\u2019re often targeted for financial fraud. So they need intensive support.\u201dAARP offers workshops, videos and even online safety tips through its TEK Academy, which stands for Technology, Education and Knowledge. But now the advocacy group wants to go further. It has teamed up with J.P. Morgan Asset Management to start a $40 million Innovation Fund to spur the invention of new, senior-friendly digital tools for aging in place, with other health care aids.\u201cThe tide is starting to turn,\u201d Mr. Bradwell said.Tablet computers, which have bigger screens and are often easier to use than smartphones or laptops, are becoming popular devices for people over 75.That has prompted the creation of the grandPad, a digital tablet with its own private, curated system. With this device, older people tap a photo to make a video call or tap a button to send a voice email. Their relatives download the app to communicate with them.Scott Lien, grandPad\u2019s chief executive, created the tablet after hearing loss made it difficult for his mother to talk on a standard phone. Navigating Skype was equally frustrating for her, he said.\u201cThis problem was nagging me,\u201d Mr. Lien said. \u201cIt needed to be solved.\u201d Remembering passwords and installing updates can be equally daunting for older people, so grandPad was designed without them, he said.Bernadine Winter\u2019s daughter introduced her to a grandPad. Now Ms. Winter, 85, has weekly video calls with her children and grandchildren, posts photos and listens to country music. She also plays her favorite games, solitaire and blackjack, on the grandPad.Ms. Winter, who lives in Greenwald, Minn., has an iPhone. But after forgetting her passwords, she could not use most of its features. \u201cNow I just use it for texting and making calls,\u201d she said.Many apps were not designed with older adults in mind, either. So they can be hard to read or even download.By contrast, Pillboxie uses color coding and simple menus to help older people remember to take their medications. EyeReader turns a smartphone into a magnifying glass. And the Silver Surf app was designed for people over 50 to read small print with zoom control.Mr. Bradwell likes the Tile app, which is a tracking device for finding lost keys, wallets and other easily misplaced items. \u201cThere are more apps for geo-locating,\u201d he said.Tomas Posker, the chief executive of Oscar Senior, is also on a mission to offer an age-friendly app. Mr. Posker watched his grandmother struggle to use Skype for video conversations.\u201cShe had difficulty learning it, and so she kept calling me,\u201d he said. \u201cUnderstanding a computer environment is especially hard for the elderly.\u201dThe Oscar Senior app turns a tablet into a remote-controlled device. Features are more limited, but users can get medication reminders and have video chats with family members who download their own version of the app.The key for any device is keeping older adults connected.The Jitterbug Touch, by GreatCall, is a simple smartphone with a brightly colored screen that makes it easy to make calls, send text messages or email, or get emergency help.\u201cBeing disconnected leads to isolation and depression,\u201d said Colin Milner, the chief executive of the International Council on Active Aging. \u201cSo there\u2019s a significant incentive to getting people connected.\u201d He cited a World Health Organization study that argued that by 2020, the second-leading cause of death globally would be depression, behind heart disease.Better digital skills can even improve dating choices. Once older adults are connected to children and grandchildren, the next step is reconnecting to old friends, said Hal Spielman, 88, co-author with Marc Silbert of \u201cSuddenly Solo,\u201d a lifestyle guide for widowed or divorced men.\u201cThe electronic media is a wonderful way to connect,\u201d said Mr. Spielman, a widower who interviewed more than 1,600 people to find out how they coped with being single. \u201cYou can try out senior dating sites, reconnect with people you knew in the past or join a meetup. It opens up a whole new social world.\u201dMs. Goldberg is busy using her new digital skills to campaign for Senator Bernie Sanders using an electronic call system.\u201cI was terrified of my smartphone,\u201d Ms. Goldberg said. \u201cNow I have an intimate relationship with it.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misspelled the name of a brain game. It is Lumosity, not Luminosity.Advertisement"}

He attended events in Kuala Lumpur marking the first anniversary of the flight, and after meeting with families of missing passengers, he decided to pursue his own investigation.\u201cI\u2019m intrigued by mysteries that need to be solved and am also touched by the families who have had two years with almost no answers at all,\u201d Mr. Gibson said by telephone from Bangkok, where he had flown en route to Kuala Lumpur for an event Sunday marking the second anniversary of the disappearance.\u201cI had some spare time and spare money, so I decided to travel to a few places to get an idea of what may have happened,\u201d he said.Mr. Gibson, 58, said that his travels were part of a lifelong desire to visit all of the world\u2019s countries, and that he tried to investigate mysteries along the way. He traveled to Russia in the early 1990s to investigate the so-called Tunguska event, in which a meteor is believed to have struck a Siberian forest in 1908. He has volunteered on archaeological projects in Belize and Guatemala to study the collapse of the Maya civilization. And he visited Ethiopia on a quest to find out what happened to the Ark of the Covenant.\u201cI was going to some monasteries and at the same time traveling in an interesting and beautiful country,\u201d he said of his Ethiopia trip. \u201cI love to travel, but I like to have some sort of reason. Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 is another one of those.\u201dHe joined a Facebook discussion group on the missing flight, which spurred his interest in researching its fate. He went to East Africa in February, after an Australian oceanographer told him that debris from the aircraft could eventually wash ashore in Mauritius, Madagascar and Mozambique. Mozambique became the 177th country he has visited, he said. After touring Maputo, the capital, he went to the beach town of Vilankulo, where he hired a boat to take him any place where debris from the open ocean washed ashore.On the morning of Feb. 27, he sailed with Suleman Valy, who is known as Junior and runs a local beach hotel and guide service, and a boat captain to a sandbar called Paluma.\u201cWe landed on an island with, like, no vegetation and walked around, up and down,\u201d Mr. Gibson said. \u201cMost of the stuff there was just regular beach junk that I always see \u2014 plastic bottles, sandals, cigarette lighters. Suddenly Junior calls out.\u201dThis animation shows where floating debris from Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 could have drifted if experts are correct about where the plane went down.Mr. Gibson returned to Maputo and handed over the object to the authorities there. Officials in Australia, which has been coordinating the Indian Ocean search, said it would be sent there for testing.Like the officials, Mr. Gibson expressed caution about concluding that the object he found is from Flight 370. The sooner \u201cit gets to Australia and they determine it\u2019s one thing or another, the better,\u201d he said.As for his personal quest to discover what happened to the plane, he is still far from drawing a conclusion.\u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s sufficient evidence to support any theory,\u201d he said. \u201cI try to look at the evidence, try to find evidence rather than come up with a theory.

{"Headline": "In One-Party Vietnam, Independents Vie for Assembly Seats", "Date": "2016-03-21", "News": "Supported byMs. Mai Khoi, 32, is among a group of around two dozen Vietnamese activists and celebrities who are running as independents this month for the authoritarian state\u2019s rubber-stamp National Assembly \u2014 and effectively daring the ruling Communist Party to not put them on the ballot. Analysts say it is the first time that more than two or three activists have run for office.Ms. Mai Khoi said her growing interest in social justice and youth issues \u2014 expressed through her songs \u2014 would make her an appealing candidate for many young Vietnamese who are not otherwise interested in politics.She already has thousands of supporters, she said after the concert between puffs of a cigarillo, \u201cbecause they already see what I\u2019m doing in my music.\u201dVietnam first allowed independent candidates in 2002, and just seven of a few hundred have won seats in the National Assembly in three elections since, according to an analysis by the United Nations Development Program. These independents have typically been businesspeople or academics who are party members or have deep connections to the government, and most have been weeded out well before voting began by a complex vetting process that the party controls, analysts said. Ms. Mai Khoi, like many other independents this year, is not a party member.The activist candidates this year mainly come from Hanoi, the capital, and Ho Chi Minh City, the country\u2019s business hub, and include writers, lawyers, educators and even a stand-up comedian.\u201cBefore, the National Assembly wasn\u2019t so much part of the national consciousness,\u201d but this year\u2019s crop of independents draws from a far wider cross-section of society, said Edmund J. Malesky, a Vietnam specialist and a professor of political economy at Duke University.Professor Malesky said that the independents were younger than ever and that many were discussing their platforms with a degree of openness that is rare in the one-party state. Debates in the National Assembly have become livelier in recent years, he said, and the rise of nontraditional candidates like Ms. Mai Khoi may reflect a growing interest among ordinary Vietnamese in domestic politics.The candidates do not have a uniform political ideology. Some, like Ms. Mai Khoi, do not consider themselves dissidents. Others, like Nguyen Trang Nhung, describe their candidacies as a direct challenge to a government that often faces heavy criticism from international human rights groups over its jailing of political dissidents.\u201cWe have a one-party regime; I would like to have a multiparty one,\u201d said Ms. Nhung, 34, a businesswoman and activist in Ho Chi Minh City. \u201cIf we have many parties, we can choose which one makes things work better.\u201dOne of the best-known independent candidates is Nguyen Quang A, a Hanoi businessman and activist who tried, and failed, to establish Vietnam\u2019s first independent research institute in 2007. In recent weeks, he said, he has collected 5,000 signatures from a diverse group of supporters that includes government officials, even though that was not technically required.\u201cWe\u2019re trying to expand our space, too,\u201d he said of the activist candidates.But Mr. Quang A conceded that his own bid had almost no chance of succeeding.\u201cThe electoral system is designed to be controlled by the party,\u201d he said.Reached by telephone on Friday, Nguyen Si Dung, the deputy secretary general of the National Assembly, said he was unavailable for comment.Vietnam initially allowed independent candidates as part of broader changes that were partly intended to allow the Communist Party to check the power of the prime minister, said Paul Schuler, a professor of political science at the University of Arizona who is writing a book about the National Assembly.Professor Schuler said that it would be interesting to see how the candidates fared and that if Mr. Quang A made the ballot, it would signal a noticeable \u201cbreak from the past.\u201d But he added that independents did not represent a fundamental challenge to Vietnam\u2019s political system because the Communist Party\u2019s candidate-vetting process still granted senior officials significant power to decide who could run for office.\u201cIf they don\u2019t control the process, then it\u2019s no longer a single-party regime, and I think they\u2019re firmly aware of that,\u201d he said.Danh-Quy Nguyen, the managing editor of the Vietnamese edition of Elle Magazine, said that as a pop singer, Ms. Mai Khoi had a reputation for being outspoken and freethinking, and that over the years, critics had accused her of being \u201ctoo opinionated.\u201d She is a vocal supporter of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender issues and a critic of domestic violence, and society websites have gossiped about her revealing attire.Ms. Mai Khoi is unapologetic about her public persona and political aspirations. But she has been careful to play by the government\u2019s rules as she vies for a seat in the National Assembly.The law bars her from holding political events, for example, so her campaign debut, such as it was, was a quiet meeting with a handful of journalist friends. And the visual centerpiece of her campaign is a digitally created billboard, featuring her face and slogan, that she has posted on Facebook. (The only physical version hangs on a wall in her Ho Chi Minh City apartment, just above her piano.)On Thursday, Ms. Mai Khoi\u2019s bid for the National Assembly passed an initial procedural hurdle, she said. The next test will be meeting with a group of Communist Party-approved voters in her hometown, the southern city of Cam Ranh. She would also need the approval of the Fatherland Front, a powerful Communist Party organization, to run for office in May.But Ms. Mai Khoi said that her campaign, which officially began on March 11, was meant to bring young people into the political process and that she would consider it successful even if she never made the ballot.\u201cI just want to make politics more public,\u201d she said.The crowd at her show on Friday night, at the venue Saigon Outcast, included supporters of her nascent campaign.Huynh Thanh Nguyet Anh, 24, a receptionist at a Porsche dealership here, said that she would vote for Ms. Mai Khoi if the singer is permitted to run and that it would be the first vote of her life.\u201cIt\u2019s got to be someone I can trust,\u201d she said.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "New Brussels Attack Suspect Is Charged, Prosecutors Say", "Date": "2016-03-26", "News": "Supported byThe man was identified by the authorities as Fay\u00e7al C. and in the Belgian press as Fay\u00e7al Cheffou, an independent journalist.Eric Van der Sijpt, a spokesman for the Belgian federal prosecutor\u2019s office, said Saturday that the authorities were trying to determine if Mr. Cheffou was the man caught in a surveillance photograph on Tuesday right before the bombings at Brussels Airport.The man, shown wearing a white coat and a dark hat and pushing a luggage cart, is believed to have escaped around the same time that two accomplices detonated their explosives.The police found no weapons or explosives during a search of Mr. Cheffou\u2019s home.Mr. Cheffou appears to have made a video in July 2014 in which he stood in front of a detention center for refugees and asylum seekers in Steenokkerzeel, near Zaventem, where Brussels Airport is. In the video, Mr. Cheffou criticized the government for serving Muslim refugees meals before the end of the daily fast during the month of Ramadan.He was taken into custody on Thursday, and the judge in charge of the case issued a formal arrest warrant on Friday in keeping with Belgian law, which requires a hearing before a judge and a warrant to be issued within 24 hours to keep a suspect in detention.Three other men were detained in Brussels for further questioning, the prosecutor\u2019s office said. One was identified as Rabah N., who was mistakenly identified as Salah A. in a previous news release, the prosecutor\u2019s office said.Rabah N. is accused of being connected to Reda Kriket, the suspect detained on Thursday near Paris by the French authorities. The French interior minister, Bernard Cazeneuve, said on Thursday that Mr. Kriket was in the advanced stages of planning an attack in France.Although details of the plot involving Mr. Kriket have not yet emerged, the authorities have said that so far it has not been linked to the Nov. 13 attacks in Paris or the attacks in Brussels last week.He was also linked to an Afghan and Pakistani network that was suspected of training would-be jihadists in the forest of Fontainebleau near Paris and in the French Alps. In 2007, Mr. Ameroud, an illegal Algerian immigrant, was also convicted of being part of a terrorist enterprise.Mr. Ameroud\u2019s lawyer at the time of his trial, Isabelle Coutant-Peyre, said Saturday in an interview that he was \u201ca really nice, sweet and polite person\u201d who was singled out because he was an illegal immigrant in France. She said she had never been convinced of his guilt.\u201cHe was on trial with six other people at the time and none of them seemed to know each other,\u201d Ms. Coutant-Peyre said. \u201cHe was accused of having been to Afghanistan before Massoud\u2019s death but it was based on notes from French intelligence and nothing really substantial.\u201d Mr. Ameroud was sentenced in 2005 to seven years and served his time in a prison at Fleury-M\u00e9rogis in a Paris suburb and at Prison de la Sant\u00e9, which is in Paris. Ms. Coutant-Peyre said she believed that he had been deported to Algeria after serving his sentence. Mr. Ameroud was shot by the police on Friday and subdued at a tram stop in the Schaerbeek section of Brussels. Specific charges have not been filed yet, but the police said they were keeping him for an additional 24 hours for questioning.The fourth man who the prosecutor said Saturday was being held and charged with participation in a terrorist group is named Aboubaker A. A man detained with him in a car was released.The investigating judge in charge of these cases released a second person on Saturday, Tawfik A., who was detained Friday for questioning.In Brussels, organizers canceled a \u201cmarch against fear\u201d planned for Sunday after the Belgian authorities urged people not to gather, citing the threat level and worries that the police would be stretched too thin to protect the march while continuing to investigate the attacks. \u201cWe invite citizens not to demonstrate tomorrow and to postpone their march to a later date,\u201d the Brussels police said in a statement after a news conference held by the interior minister and the mayor of Brussels. \u201cWe understand that everybody wants to express their emotions in these circumstances,\u201d the statement added. On a Facebook page set up by the organizers of the march, some users said they understood the need to cancel the event, but others disagreed. \u201cBy canceling we are showing them that we are afraid and they will have won,\u201d said a user named Aurore Vandenborre. \u201cI will be at the Bourse tomorrow,\u201d she added, referring to the pedestrian square in front of Brussels\u2019 19th-century stock exchange building, where people have gathered around makeshift memorials since the attacks. The Belgian federal crisis center published a brochure on Saturday titled \u201cTerrorist Attack: What Next?\u201d It provided guidelines for those with questions like \u201cHow do children react to traumatic events?\u201d and \u201cWhat can you do for someone who survived an attack or someone who lost a loved one?\u201dBrussels Airport said Saturday that it would remain closed until at least Tuesday.The security on Saturday at Brussels\u2019 biggest train station, known as Bruxelles-Midi, seemed back to normal on Saturday except that there were now police officers and soldiers stationed at doors on either end, and some side doors were blocked. But the police and soldiers were checking neither bags nor backpacks, and their presence seemed to be aimed mostly at instilling confidence in passengers and passers-by. Since December, rail travelers from Paris to Brussels have had to go through metal detectors and a scanner set up at the lead car before boarding their trains.Although most trains here were on time, some with international destinations, in France or the Netherlands, were running late for unexplained reasons.After passengers boarded a train to Paris, three police officers passed through every car, methodically asking each person to present a passport or identity card and then scrutinizing the document.Aurelien Breeden contributed reporting from Paris, and Kimiko de Freytas-Tamura and Lilia Blaise from Brussels.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Father, a Son, a Disease, and a Camera", "Date": "2018-01-18", "News": "After the tsunami\u00e2\u0080\u0099s dark waves receded from the Japanese city of Kesen, leaving destruction in their wake, the Satos huddled together on what remained of their family plot. Naoshi and Teruko Sato\u00e2\u0080\u0099s son, Shoichi, a firefighter who had raced toward the sea to rescue the stranded, was missing. Shoichi\u00e2\u0080\u0099s wife, Mio Sato, was sick with worry.Their stoicism in the face of adversity made a deep impression on Hiroko Masuike, a photographer who chanced upon the family in the weeks after the 2011 disaster and who has documented the family\u00e2\u0080\u0099s recovery ever since.Except they didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t recover.The Satos\u2019 misery over losing Shoichi consumed them. They are now in the midst of a painful separation after 56 years of marriage. And they have cut their grief-stricken daughter-in-law out of their lives entirely.Harder to measure, and less frequently documented, is the deep, long-term toll that natural disasters have on family life and relationships.\u00e2\u0080\u009cI wanted to keep going back,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Ms. Masuike, a New York-based photographer who works for The New York Times and who has returned to Kesen as often as twice a year. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want to be that journalist who just parachutes in to report a story, then leaves forever.\u00e2\u0080\u009dNestled on a narrow bay on Japan\u00e2\u0080\u0099s northeast coast, Kesen, once known for the beauty of its traditional tiled town houses, is starting to rebuild. But progress has been slow. Ms. Masuike\u00e2\u0080\u0099s goal had been to return periodically to Kesen until its main Buddhist temple was rebuilt, a milestone that would signal the community\u00e2\u0080\u0099s recovery, she said. Five years later, reconstruction on the temple has not yet begun.\u201cI didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want to be that journalist who just parachutes in to report a story, then leaves forever.\u201dThe Satos\u00e2\u0080\u0099 progress has been equally slow. Early on, they had seemed to be weathering the travesty together: Naoshi, 82, a gregarious logger; Teruko, 77, a chatty dance and kimono teacher; and Mio, 47, their shy daughter-in-law.But the loss of Shoichi, whose body was found a week after the tsunami, destroyed the delicate dynamics that had bound the family together, Mio said. Disagreements broke out. Naoshi was determined to stay put at the site of their damaged home, spending the cold nights in a tiny barn. Teruko soon moved into evacuee housing provided by the prefectural government.Mio, meanwhile, resented Naoshi and Teruko for preventing her from seeing her husband\u00e2\u0080\u0099s dead body. When Ms. Masuike finally drove Mio to the morgue a full month after the tsunami, she broke down.\u00e2\u0080\u009cOpen your eyes!\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mio pleaded, throwing herself at her husband\u00e2\u0080\u0099s coffin.\u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll never forget that moment for as long as I live,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Ms. Masuike said.Naoshi has rebuilt the family house, where he spends his days alone. His wife has refused to return to the home they shared for so many years. He told Ms. Masuike that the task of rebuilding had so overwhelmed him that he had forgotten to tend to Teruko\u00e2\u0080\u0099s emotional needs. Only when she left him did he realize that his wife had felt abandoned and angry.Mio, who has moved away from Kesen, has not spoken with her in-laws for more than three years. She quit her job at a computer chip manufacturer in October and lives on modest government handouts. Only her dog, Noa, a shiba inu, cheers her up.While she is estranged from her in-laws, it is her deceased husband who remains ever-present in Mio\u00e2\u0080\u0099s daily routine. Every morning, she makes an offering of coffee and cigarettes at the Buddhist altar she erected in her home. Shoichi\u00e2\u0080\u0099s fire helmet sits on a small table next to it.Ms. Masuike says that photographing the Satos has made her grow closer to her own elderly parents. When she flew to Japan to cover the tsunami, she had not returned to the country of her birth for a decade. Now, she visits them each year in Osaka, in western Japan.The Satos, through their struggles, taught her the importance of family ties, Ms. Masuike said.\u00e2\u0080\u009cThey may have grown apart as a family, but they saved mine,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cFor that, I am grateful.\u00e2\u0080\u009d"}

However, all was not rosy for Mr. Trump: He won some states by a plurality of less than 35 percent of the vote, suggesting that there was still room for someone to try to stop him.So the race will carry on, even as that window is dwindling. Mr. Cruz, who won in Oklahoma and his home state of Texas, emerged as the candidate in the best position to slow Mr. Trump. Senator Marco Rubio of Florida won Minnesota but came up empty everywhere else, and he failed to clear the threshold in some states for the allocation of delegates. It will now be harder for him to make the case that he is the person to support: So far, he has been graded on something of a curve by donors and pundits. In public polls, he is behind Mr. Trump by double digits.For his part, Mr. Trump seemed mindful that the last several days of news cycles, which were dominated by his declining to disavow the former Ku Klux Klan leader David Duke, were less than ideal.

The rabbis plan to hold a prayer service outside the room where the Republican presidential candidate is delivering his remarks.Mr. Trump has drawn some backlash from American Jews before, because he said that he would like to remain neutral when starting negotiations between Israel and the Palestinians if, as president, he were trying to broker peace in the Middle East.

{"Headline": "A Father, a Son, a Disease, and a Camera", "Date": "2018-01-18", "News": "The Zika virus has hit Venezuela at the worst possible time. The country needs anything and everything people require to live, including food, water and medicine. Hospitals are dangerously short of basic supplies, including gauze and needles.\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe access to information in Venezuela is very complicated because the government thinks every journalist wants to do propaganda against it,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Mr. Quintero, who specializes in documenting social and environmental issues. \u00e2\u0080\u009cSo we must find our own way to get access.\u00e2\u0080\u009dTrying to document a public health crisis that the government has yet to proclaim as such is beyond challenging. The Venezuelan socialist government does not release epidemiological data, in the same way that it refuses to release basic statistics on crime or inflation. (It didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t even report its first Zika case until November, and then only to the W.H.O., not the public.) Brazil, which first detected Zika in May 2015, estimates that 1.5 million people have been infected; Colombia has registered close to 43,000 actual cases. Venezuela\u00e2\u0080\u0099s official estimate remains at 5,000 cases, a tiny percentage of the more than 400,000 cases that researchers at the Venezuelan Society of Public Health, a group openly critical of the government, have estimated.When Mr. Quintero set out to document Zika, he had to ask a doctor friend to sneak him into a hospital ward. Even then, he had only 10 minutes to interview and photograph patients.The government says Venezuela has no cases of babies born with microcephaly, and Mr. Quintero did not see any. (In contrast, Brazil has put the world on notice, releasing photos and videos of new mothers holding babies born with the devastating syndrome.) But what Mr. Quintero did see underscores how dangerous and unpredictable Zika or any other illness can be in a nation whose infrastructure is collapsing.Mr. Quintero documented a man with Guillain-Barr\u00c3\u00a9 syndrome, a rare disorder in which the immune system attacks the nervous system, causing temporary paralysis and possibly death.Guillain-Barr\u00c3\u00a9 syndrome is rising in the same countries where Zika is spreading, and researchers suspect the mosquito virus is to blame. The patient Mr. Quintero saw had his mother by his side because if he needed any tests, the hospital was not equipped to administer them. The patient\u00e2\u0080\u0099s mother remained at his bedside 24 hours a day to find or even administer whatever her son might need, including X-rays and sterile needles.To the public in Caracas, where teams of state workers have been spraying vegetation with much fanfare, Zika remains mysterious and scary. But it is also competing with daily crises for attention. Waiting in line, for example, for whatever a store or black-market business happens to score, maybe milk, maybe bread, maybe both, has become a day\u00e2\u0080\u0099s work. Worrying about contracting Zika is on the back burner.Research scientists whom Mr. Quintero photographed remain both concerned and hopeful, he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cSometimes, they can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t do a procedure or experiment because they haven\u00e2\u0080\u0099t the supplies or money to send tests to another country,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said.

{"Headline": null, "Date": null, "News": "AdvertisementMarch 19, 2016Melissa MurrayJamal GreeneNo one should need convincing that our Supreme Court appointments process is broken. Justices strategically time retirements so that they may choose the ideology of their replacements.  Partisans on both sides dissemble without shame. Character assassination of distinguished public servants is routine. Confirmation hearings are a kabuki dance in which the nominee\u2019s goal is to disclaim creativity or intellectual curiosity.A fixed term of office for Supreme Court justices would not eliminate these problems but it would make some of them smaller. We need look no further than the current episode. Justice Scalia\u2019s sudden death has created the prospect of a justice being replaced by his ideological opposite. A rare event that might not happen again for decades, it has driven Senate Republicans to madness.Justices typically choose when to retire and therefore which president gets to choose their indefinite successor. Chief Justice Roberts\u2019s seat has been in Republican hands since 1969. Justice Ginsburg\u2019s seat has been in Democratic hands since 1962. The stakes of every appointment feel astronomical because forever, as they say, is a mighty long time.A fixed term of office would not only lower the stakes \u2014 and therefore the temperature \u2014 of fights like the current one but would also bring the United States in line with the rest of the universe. All of the world\u2019s major democratic countries except ours, and each of the 50 states save Rhode Island, have fixed terms, a mandatory retirement age, or both for their high court judges. This is not an exceptionalism we should be proud of. There is a name for a political system in which unelected elites hold indefinite power, and it is not democracy.Since Justice Scalia\u2019s death, the role of justices\u2019 life tenure in amplifying the politicization of the nomination process has been getting more consideration.  When judicial seats are less likely to turn over, the importance of each appointment may seem especially acute. Term limits, which most state high courts use, would assure that Supreme Court vacancies would become available at a predictable pace, perhaps avoiding the politicking and gridlock that has accompanied the nomination process in recent years.  While all of this sounds appealing, there are other concerns to weigh.  As an initial matter, replacing life tenure with term limits would likely require a constitutional amendment, by itself a daunting and difficult process.  Leaving aside the difficulties of the amendment process, there are ethical concerns that counsel against term limits.  Term-limited justices might aspire to other political offices, or positions in business, and these post-term aspirations might shape their judicial decision-making on the court.  For all its problems, life tenure was intended to insulate judges \u2014 and their decisions \u2014 from these pressures.  If, as Martin and Quinn argue, juridical drift is the rule, rather than the exception, the assurance of life tenure may mean that a justice will be able to take a longitudinal approach to her decisions, steadily evolving over time.  In a term-limited environment, justices might feel immediate pressure to identify and enact a distinct interpretative approach, stymieing the deliberative and organic growth that lengthier tenures could afford.  Term-limited justices undoubtedly will recognize that their time on the court \u2014 and their time with a particular group of justices \u2014 is finite. This too may shape their decision-making.  Eager to initiate a doctrinal shift or reverse a particular precedent, but worried about the changing composition of a term-limited Court, justices may be inclined to make lurching shifts from left to right and back again within a relatively short period of time. This kind of jurisprudential volatility is completely at odds with our precedent-based legal system and its vision of slow and steady doctrinal development."}

{"Headline": "Silicon Valley Looks to Artificial Intelligence for the Next Big Thing", "Date": "2016-03-27", "News": "Supported byBitsSAN FRANCISCO \u2014 As the oracles of Silicon Valley debate whether the latest tech boom is sliding toward bust, there is already talk about what will drive the industry\u2019s next growth spurt.The way we use computing is changing, toward a boom (and, if history is any guide, a bubble) in collecting oceans of data in so-called cloud computing centers, then analyzing the information to build new businesses.The terms most often associated with this are \u201cmachine learning\u201d and \u201cartificial intelligence,\u201d or \u201cA.I.\u201d And the creations spawned by this market could affect things ranging from globe-spanning computer systems to how you pay at the cafeteria.\u201cThere is going to be a boom for design companies, because there\u2019s going to be so much information people have to work through quickly,\u201d said Diane B. Greene, the head of Google Compute Engine, one of the companies hoping to steer an A.I. boom. \u201cJust teaching companies how to use A.I. will be a big business.\u201dThis kind of change is what keeps Silicon Valley going. When personal computers displaced mainframe computers, it opened the door not just for Apple, but for companies making PC software for business, games and publishing. In the networking and Internet revolutions, venture capitalists invested in these new computing styles, and another generation of companies was born.Over the last decade, smartphones, social networks and cloud computing have moved from feeding the growth of companies like Facebook and Twitter, leapfrogging to Uber, Airbnb and others that have used the phones, personal rating systems and powerful remote computers in the cloud to create their own new businesses.Believe it or not, that stuff may be heading for the rearview mirror already. The tech industry\u2019s new architecture is based not just on the giant public computing clouds of Google, Microsoft and Amazon, but also on their A.I. capabilities. These clouds create more efficient and supple use of computing resources, available for rent. Smaller clouds used in corporate systems are designed to connect to them.The A.I. resources Ms. Greene is opening up at Google are remarkable. Google\u2019s autocomplete feature that most of us use when doing a search can instantaneously touch 500 computers in several locations as it guesses what we are looking for. Services like Maps and Photos have over a billion users, sorting places and faces by computer. Gmail sifts through 1.4 petabytes of data, or roughly two billion books\u2019 worth of information, every day.Handling all that, plus tasks like language translation and speech recognition, Google has amassed a wealth of analysis technology that it can offer to customers. Urs H\u00f6lzle, Ms. Greene\u2019s chief of technical infrastructure, predicts that the business of renting out machines and software will eventually surpass Google advertising. In 2015, ad profits were $16.4 billion.\u201cIn the \u201980s, it was spreadsheets,\u201d said Andreas Bechtolsheim, a noted computer design expert who was Google\u2019s first investor. \u201cNow it\u2019s what you can do with machine learning.\u201dHe added: \u201cBetter maps and photos is just the start. It\u2019s going to be in life sciences, automobiles, everything.\u201dA number of start-ups are already aimed at the new architecture. A Mountain View, Calif., outfit called Mashgin uses \u201ccomputer vision\u201d to automate retail checkout. Up Highway 101 in San Mateo, a company called Alluxio is creating ways to make cloud-based A.I. work better. Last week, a San Francisco company called Mesosphere, which makes a way to operate among various corporate and public clouds, raised $73.5 million.Microsoft and Amazon are racing Google to dominate the new architecture.This week, Microsoft will kick off a conference in San Francisco that is expected to focus on ways machine-based intelligence can be used to analyze, among other things, \u201cthe Microsoft graph,\u201d or all the data companies already have in the Microsoft products they\u2019ve owned for decades.Amazon last year announced its own machine-learning services, and it is amassing its own large repository of corporate data.Hewlett Packard Enterprise, an older company struggling to find its way in the new landscape, was one of the investors in Mesosphere.\u201cWhen you are building predictive data, you don\u2019t know what you are going to need next,\u201d said William Hilf, a senior vice president at H.P.E. \u201cIf someone makes a bet in machine learning on Microsoft or Google, they may need to come down to their old data systems, too. We are building platforms to bridge among all of them.\u201dTo Ms. Greene, all of the activity so far, along with the size and sophistication of computing, is small compared to what will happen when the world\u2019s biggest businesses start leaning on the new A.I. technology.\u201cWe may build an A.I. system to figure out all the ways businesses can use this,\u201d she joked. \u201cThe relationship between big companies and deep machine intelligence is just starting.\u201dAdvertisement"}

There is something awesome and otherworldly about it.\u00e2\u0080\u009dAs we spoke about the myths attached to a number of his images, Mr. Dodds paused.Most people would agree that unicorns are not real. But as Mr. Dodds writes on his website, the beasts \u00e2\u0080\u009care so common in Scotland that people don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t notice them.

And this is for the people of Phoenix, Arizona: We\u2019re going to win at the border.\u201dProtesters carrying American and Mexican flags blocked a road to a Donald J. Trump campaign event in Phoenix, where he was campaigning with Sheriff Joe Arpaio.In New York, several hundred protesters gathered at Columbus Circle outside the Trump International Hotel there. One brandished a sign that read, \u201cNo Wall Around the Land of the Free.\u201d Another sign suggested a wall be built around Mr. Trump. Gina Rodriguez, 28, of Harlem, said, \u201cWhen Trump talks, I feel like he is targeting my community.\u201dThe first conflicts took place just after 1:30 p.m. as the crowd sought to cross 59th Street and head south at the Avenue of the Americas. They chanted, \u00e2\u0080\u009cDump Trump\u00e2\u0080\u009d and \u00e2\u0080\u009cDon\u2019t give into racist fear.\u00e2\u0080\u009d A line of police officers, scooters and barricades blocked their way as some protesters shouted that they had the light. Then, after a countdown, a mass of protesters surged forward, with those behind digging their heels into the sidewalk and pushing with their shoulders against the demonstrators in front of them.The police pushed back, and for about 10 minutes, the two sides formed a heaving scrum with metal barricades being used as fulcrums and both police officers and protesters losing their footing and tumbling to the ground. At one point, a stream of pepper spray came from the ranks of the police officers, sending protesters reeling back and rubbing their eyes.A few moments later, the march toward Trump Tower resumed, with protesters chanting, waving signs and beating drums and occasionally darting into the roadway. They were followed by police officers in cars and on foot, including one carrying an acoustic device that issued recorded warnings that blocking vehicles could lead to arrest.At least two protesters were grabbed by police officers and placed into handcuffs. When the crowd made it to Trump Tower, the police tried to herd them into a protest zone, but instead the protesters quickly moved on, with many of them heading back to Columbus Circle, where they resumed their chants.\n\t\tFirst Draft provides fast-paced and comprehensive coverage of politics and elections by The New York Times.

{"Headline": "How a Tapestry of Care  Helps Teens Succeed", "Date": "2016-03-15", "News": "Second of two articlesThe organization works with public high school students who are struggling academically and facing major difficulties including poverty, homelessness and family breakdowns. Students enroll during ninth grade, and are matched with five volunteers; as they mature, and move on to college or jobs, the volunteer-to-student ratio declines. Thread is modest in size \u00e2\u0080\u0094 it has worked with 255 students from three Baltimore high school \u00e2\u0080\u0094 but its graduation and post-secondary enrollment rates are so impressive that the model warrants serious attention.I discovered that, in the 12 years in which Thread has evolved from an early mentoring initiative, these issues have come up multiple times, and the organization has developed ways to manage them. This has helped build a remarkable culture that holds the tapestry together.The culture is built on many details. For instance, when Thread staff members or volunteers first interview students, they show the relationships are two-way. \u00e2\u0080\u009cFor every question we ask them, they ask us one,\u00e2\u0080\u009d explains Sarah Hemminger, a co-founder and the chief executive of Thread. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll ask, \u00e2\u0080\u0098Have you ever been homeless?\u00e2\u0080\u0099 Or \u00e2\u0080\u0098Has someone passed away who was important in your life?\u00e2\u0080\u0099\u00e2\u0080\u009dStudents often return the same questions. They\u00e2\u0080\u0099re surprised when a volunteer says that he or she is dealing with a relative\u00e2\u0080\u0099s death, or has used illegal drugs, or has had to rely on food stamps. It creates an opening. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe want students to know, \u00e2\u0080\u0098We\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not here to fix or save you or invade your privacy,\u00e2\u0080\u0099\u00e2\u0080\u009d adds Hemminger. \u00e2\u0080\u009c\u00e2\u0080\u0098This is not a tutoring or mentoring program. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099re here to stand by your side for a decade and figure out this stuff together.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\u00e2\u0080\u009dAt a welcoming ceremony in February, students meet the five volunteers who will become their \u00e2\u0080\u009cThread family,\u00e2\u0080\u009d and they meet\u00c2\u00a0 their \u00e2\u0080\u009chead of family,\u00e2\u0080\u009d or point person. When students arrive, their family is waiting, with food, balloons, cake and little presents related to things students mentioned liking in their interviews. It could be Pokemon cards, a favorite candy or a notebook with a team logo. Together, volunteers and students do exercises to get to know one another. Drawing a diagram of the important people in her life, a student or volunteer might say: \u00e2\u0080\u009cThis circle is my mom and she lives away from me and I miss her so much,\u00e2\u0080\u009d or \u00e2\u0080\u0098This is my brother and he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the one who always has my back.\u201dThe goal in the first six months is to establish trust. Volunteers connect through enjoyable and purposeful activities. Thread also organizes a day for parents, and volunteers reach out to families to build rapport.Teenagers tend to be influenced by short-term rewards, so offering a student a ride, bringing breakfast or just showing appreciation that he or she got out of bed can tip the decision to go to school that day. For bigger decisions, teenagers evaluate the likelihood of future rewards. When an adult says \u00e2\u0080\u009cIf you study hard and go to college, you can get a job and one day earn $100,000 a year,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the student does a little mental calculus: \u00e2\u0080\u009cHave I seen this happen?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou\u00e2\u0080\u0099re never going to delay gratification for a reward you don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t believe is going to come,\u00e2\u0080\u009d says Hemminger. A big part of Thread\u00e2\u0080\u0099s work involves changing the mental calculus by exposing students to new \u00e2\u0080\u009cdata points\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u0094 volunteers in college, people pursuing goals, and increasingly, Thread\u00e2\u0080\u0099s older students and alumni.Consistency is everything. Thread tracks \u00e2\u0080\u009ctouch points,\u00e2\u0080\u009d every interaction between a volunteer and a student. More than any other factor, the consistency of touch points predicts students\u00e2\u0080\u0099 success. Last week, I wrote about Eddie Blackstone, now a junior at Towson University. Thread\u00e2\u0080\u0099s data indicate that during the first three months of Eddie\u00e2\u0080\u0099s senior year in high school \u00e2\u0080\u0094 a critical period for college applications \u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00c2\u00a0volunteers had 47 interactions with him, representing 112 hours of contact time, or about 9 hours a week.To maintain consistency, volunteers need support. Most are students at Johns Hopkins University. They get stressed and homesick; they have conflicts with friends and family; they fail exams. Rejections from a Thread student can add to self-doubts or loneliness; a phone call or hug can brighten their outlook.Volunteers receive coaching from experienced \u00e2\u0080\u009cheads of family\u00e2\u0080\u009d or \u00e2\u0080\u009cgrandparents.\u00e2\u0080\u009d They gather monthly to talk about challenges and strategies, disappointments and pleasant surprises. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat drives whether the volunteer has contact with the student is whether the coach has contact with the volunteer,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Hemminger explains.Thread doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t permit volunteers to switch students. When tensions arise, the staff uses them as opportunities to deepen relationships. Once, a volunteer who cared deeply about a student, but was frustrated by his recent behavior, sent text messages like \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s wrong with you?\u00e2\u0080\u009d and \u00e2\u0080\u009cIf you don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t change, you won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t amount to anything.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The staff brought together the volunteer, the student and the student\u00e2\u0080\u0099s mother to talk. At the meeting, the volunteer cried. He acknowledged that he was applying pressure the way his parents had pressured him.Another student\u00e2\u0080\u0099s mother threatened to file a restraining order if volunteers continued to show up at 7 a.m. to offer her son lifts to school. The volunteers backed off but continued to leave groceries on the porch each Friday. One day the student disappeared and the mother called Thread. They helped find him, the mother was grateful, and the relationship was transformed.\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t one of the brightest things I could\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve done,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he told me. His thinking at the time, he said, was \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099d rather have it and not use it than not have it and be the target.\u00e2\u0080\u009d One day, policemen approached him. He ran, but was caught and tasered; his nose was broken, he lost four front teeth, and he was put on two years of probation.Raekwon loves working with his hands and taking care of plants, and has dreamed of leaving the city. In Thread, he loved camping trips. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099d never slept outside, built a fire, didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know how to swim, or kayak, or go canoeing,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThey said, \u00e2\u0080\u0098Oh, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re going to teach you.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\u00e2\u0080\u009dRead previous contributions to this series.\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhen I first met Raekwon, he was a little bit shy,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Harvey said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cHe had a great smile and I hired him right away. He\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a smart man, a hard worker, and he can carry a strong message to young men and women.\u00e2\u0080\u009dWorking outdoors planting dogwoods, maples and spruces, and constructing ponds and waterfalls, Raekwon is getting used to tranquility. \u00e2\u0080\u009cFor me in the city, noise is all I know,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cOut there, you hear the trees whishing and lashing, but you don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t hear police sirens. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not used to that. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m always looking over my shoulder \u00e2\u0080\u0094 but then it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a deer or a groundhog.\u00e2\u0080\u009dRecently, Raekwon met with Baltimore\u00e2\u0080\u0099s police commissioner to urge him to send officers to one of Thread\u00e2\u0080\u0099s camping trips. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhy take something bad that happened to you and leave it as a bad?\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIf you take it and build a relationship with the police, then it forms a little bit of trust, a little bit of safety.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The police department had been planning to expand its Police Youth Challenge partnership with the local Outward Bound affiliate and Johns Hopkins School of Public Health. Now, one of its new partners will be Thread.How much can Thread grow? In an analysis last year, the organization determined that in Baltimore they could reach 7,000 volunteers, who could help 300 new students each year, with 3,000 students enrolled at any one time. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s about 5 percent of incoming high school freshmen in the city. At that scale, the network of volunteers, board members, students, alumni and family members would number about 20,000 adults.I have been struck by the excitement Thread generates \u00e2\u0080\u0094 among volunteers, people in Baltimore, and even readers who wrote comments about last week\u00e2\u0080\u0099s column (always a tough audience). Thread seems be responding to a widely felt need. Can we change the way we relate to one another?Jan Houbolt, the other Thread chairman, told me: \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099m about to turn 70 years old, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been on probably 20 boards and three or four citywide government commissions and run a few nonprofits \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and this has been by far the most exhilarating and transformative experience.\u00e2\u0080\u009dIf your city has an organization that is building social connections in interesting ways, please tell us about its program.More From Fixes \u00bbMore From Private Lives \u00bbMore From Couch \u00bbMore From The Stone \u00bbMore From Moviegoers \u00bbMore From The End \u00bbMore From Draft \u00bbMore From Anxiety \u00bbMore From Menagerie \u00bbMore From Disunion \u00bbMore From Bedside \u00bbMore From The Conversation \u00bbMore From The Great Divide \u00bbMore From Errol Morris \u00bbFollowAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Michigan Poll Shows John Kasich Gaining Ground on Donald Trump", "Date": "2016-03-07", "News": "Donald J. Trump is holding a double-digit lead in Michigan ahead of the state\u2019s primary election on Tuesday, but there are signs that Gov. John Kasich is gaining strength.While Mr. Trump\u2019s lead is significant, there were indications that Mr. Kasich is making a late push. Across four days of polling, Mr. Trump was dominant during the first two days, but the Ohio governor came within 6 points during the final two days.\u00e2\u0080\u009cAfter this past weekend\u00e2\u0080\u0099s mixed bag of results, Trump appears positioned for a win in Michigan, but the race may be tightening in the final hours.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Patrick Murray, director of the Monmouth University Polling Institute, said in a statement. \u00e2\u0080\u009cTrump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s support may be dropping, while Kasich\u00e2\u0080\u0099s star could be rising.\u00e2\u0080\u009dA separate Monmouth poll shows Mr. Trump also leading in Florida, which holds its primary on March 15. Of likely Republican voters, 38 percent back Mr. Trump and 30 percent support Mr. Rubio, while Mr. Cruz and Mr. Kasich lag behind. (The poll had a margin or error of plus or minus five percentage points.)That poll shows Mr. Rubio doing better than other surveys that have found him trailing by as many as 20 points, however there are signs that some Florida voters are starting to lose faith in their senator. Much of Mr. Rubio\u00e2\u0080\u0099s strength in his home state comes from voters who have already cast their ballots, while those who have yet to vote are leaning heavily in favor of Mr. Trump.Michigan is the biggest prize on Tuesday, when Hawaii, Mississippi and Idaho also hold elections.Mr. Trump is leading among Michigan voters across income groups and with those who call themselves \u201csomewhat conservative,\u201d the Monmouth poll showed. He is tied with Mr. Cruz among evangelical Christians and trails the Texas senator among very conservative voters.One worrying sign for Republicans is that just 71 percent of the party\u2019s voters in Michigan said they would vote for Mr. Trump in a general election if he is their nominee, and 9 percent said they would instead vote for Hillary Clinton.On the Democratic side, Mrs. Clinton also holds a 13-point lead in her race against Senator Bernie Sanders, topping him by a margin of 55 percent to 42 percent.Mr. Sanders continues to do better with younger voters, but as Mrs. Clinton continues to rack up delegates, half of Mr. Sanders\u2019s supporters expect that she will ultimately be the nominee.Monmouth\u2019s poll in Michigan had a margin of error of plus or minus five percentage points for Republicans, and plus or minus six points for Democrats. \n\t\tFirst Draft provides fast-paced and comprehensive coverage of politics and elections by The New York Times.

But that is why this is happening,\u201d Mr. Suleiman said.Once a staunch Sisi supporter, Mr. Okasha has fired several stinging broadsides against the government in recent months, accusing it of incompetence and tampering with Parliament.That accusation brought sharp criticism, and Mr. Okasha was forced to quit his television show for a time. He later apologized and was allowed back on the air, only to resume the attacks.After the shoe-throwing episode, Mr. Koren told Israel\u2019s Channel 10 television in a telephone interview that he had spoken with Mr. Okasha, who assured him that he was undeterred.\u201cWe will meet again soon,\u201d Mr. Koren reported Mr. Okasha as saying.Mr. Koren noted that he had met with Mr. Sisi and other Egyptian officials and that relations between the two countries were \u201cvery good.\u201dNour Youssef contributed reporting from Cairo, and Isabel Kershner from Jerusalem.Advertisement"}

It looks like someone knows about an important flaw in Apple\u2019s flagship product, and won\u2019t tell its chief executive what it is.That announcement appears to have at least stalled what many saw as a seminal case on privacy, encryption and the rights of the state in the age of computer communications.And it may serve as an wake-up call to Apple about how it safeguards its products.One reason may be Apple\u2019s iconic reputation for making a safer, better-built computer. Indeed, for many years Apple computers had far fewer attacks than machines running Microsoft Windows, but experts said this had as much to do with the relative attraction of trying to find flaws in Windows, which had much more of the market. If you did find a flaw, there were more computers to exploit.Now that Apple has a huge market presence, a robust underground market in selling knowledge of flaws in Apple software has sprung up. Apparently, flaws in the Safari browser are worth $100,000, and knowledge of iPhone issues can command 10 times as much.That may become a new market that Mr. Cook will want to attack, dominate \u2014 and shut down.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Pittsburgh\u2019s Youth-Driven Food Boom", "Date": "2016-03-15", "News": "Supported by21 PhotosPITTSBURGH \u2014 It hits you as soon as you get to town.Everybody seems so young. And everybody\u2019s talking about restaurants. If there are scholars who hope to study how a vibrant food culture can help radically transform an American city, the time to do that is right now, in real time, in the place that gave us Heinz ketchup.Kelly Sawdon, an executive with the Ace chain, said the company spent years trying to raise money to convert a torn-and-frayed Y.M.C.A. into a hip hotel because the \u201cenergy\u201d of the city suggested a blossoming marketplace. Food, she said, has been the catalyst.For decades, Pittsburgh was hardly seen as a beacon of innovative cuisine or a magnet for the young. It was the once-glorious metropolis that young people fled from after the shuttering of the steel mills in the early 1980s led to a mass exodus and a stark decline.\u201cWe had to reinvent ourselves,\u201d said Bill Peduto, Pittsburgh\u2019s mayor.No one can pinpoint whether it was the artists or techies or chefs who got the revitalization rolling. But there\u2019s no denying that restaurants play a starring role in the story Pittsburgh now tells about itself. The allure of inhabiting a Hot New Food Town \u2014 be it Nashville or Richmond, Va., or Portland (Oregon or Maine) \u2014 helps persuade young people to visit, to move in and to stay.That\u2019s good news for tourism; 2,800 hotel rooms have been added in Pittsburgh since 2011. \u201cWe\u2019re really using the food scene as a driver of that,\u201d Mr. Davis said. \u201cThere\u2019s a reason to come to the city.\u201dIt is also good news for business and culture leaders who seek out young employees and customers. When job candidates arrive, the new wave of restaurants is brandished as a selling point.\u201cThe food scene in Pittsburgh is actually responsible for our landing some best-in-the-world types of people,\u201d said Andrew Moore, the dean of the School of Computer Science at Carnegie Mellon and a founder of Google\u2019s first office in the city.Google\u2019s presence has since expanded considerably \u2014 and almost in sync with the restaurant surge. Pittsburgh\u2019s mayor said the food boom had played a pivotal role in restoring neighborhoods, evidence of an \u201centrepreneurial attitude throughout the city.\u201d\u201cTen years ago, you had some visionaries, some young people who had a dream of owning their own restaurants,\u201d Mr. Peduto said. \u201cThey took a risk \u2014 they really did believe the place had this amazing potential.\u201dIn the early days of Piccolo Forno, Mr. Branduzzi was warned that Pittsburghers weren\u2019t likely to take a chance on old-school items like rabbit or wild boar. \u201cPeople thought it was crazy and that it would never sell,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd now I can\u2019t take rabbit off the menu.\u201dBeing shielded from crushing rent increases allows Pittsburgh chefs to take risks and cook the way they want to cook without constantly fretting about going under.This is not to say that creating Cure was easy. Lawrenceville still has its fair share of graffiti and abandoned storefronts, but \u201cyou should\u2019ve seen that neighborhood five years ago,\u201d Mr. Severino said. \u201cI got to know the prostitutes who worked the corner. I got to know the drug dealers who hated my guts.\u201d He was always calling the police; thieves broke into Cure repeatedly.Through it all, he stuck to his philosophy: \u201cI\u2019m just going to do what I want to do without regard for what people say they want.\u201dMr. Mantica and Mr. Benson see Smallman as a way to cater to the tastes of the young employees of Apple, Uber and Google who are starting to occupy new apartments in the area. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen this huge demographic shift in Pittsburgh, and now it\u2019s a matter of, \u2018What do those people want?\u2019\u201d Mr. Benson said.Mr. Hilty grew up near Pittsburgh, and said he had plans to leave for New York or Oregon after college, but \u201cI had too much debt. So I slowly figured out what my contribution would be to the city.\u201d He is glad he stayed. Lawrenceville, he said, is \u201cvery youthful and it\u2019s full of unbridled enthusiasm for this stuff.\u201dBut there is ambivalence as well. Young restaurateurs know how gentrification works; they\u2019ve witnessed it in Brooklyn and San Francisco. Rents rise. People get squeezed out. \u201cWe all see where it\u2019s going to be in five years,\u201d Mr. Hilty said. \u201cThe barrier to entry\u2019s going to be so high.\u201dMs. Thackray added, \u201cIt\u2019s really cool \u2014 and then the bubble bursts.\u201dLike winning the lottery, being crowned a Hot New Food Town can complicate things. Despite his trailblazing, Mr. Severino has noticed how Lawrenceville\u2019s newer inhabitants view him as something of a square. \u201cMost of those hipsters hate me,\u201d he said with a laugh. \u201cThey\u2019ll go out of their way to tell me what a yuppie I am.\u201dSome of the more thoughtful leaders of Pittsburgh\u2019s cultural youthquake find themselves vexed \u2014 worrying that the city they wanted to live in could turn, over time, into its glossy and expensive opposite, a place that evicts older residents and prices out younger ones.The present is exciting in Pittsburgh. The future? That depends.\u201cWe just have to stay vigilant in how Pittsburgh\u2019s redevelopment takes place,\u201d Mr. Shuck said, \u201cfostering the conversation and pressuring government and private capital to work together to do it right.\u201dIf You Go ...An earlier version of this article misstated the titles of the Whitfield chefs Bethany Zozula and Casey Shively. Ms. Zozula is the executive chef, not the pastry chef. Ms. Shively is the pastry chef, not the chef. An earlier version of a picture caption also misstated Ms. Zozula\u2019s title.Because of an editing error, a map last Wednesday with an article about Pittsburgh\u2019s booming food scene misstated the address of a Primanti Brothers restaurant. It is 1832 East Carson Street \u2014 not 2100 Wharton Street, which is the address of the corporate office.Advertisement"}

He is also poised to meet with Republican officials and potentially some members of Congress, many of whom have taken some time to warm to his candidacy. Later, he will hold a news conference. And finally, he\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll deliver a speech before the Aipac conference, several hours after Mrs. Clinton delivers hers.For Mr. Trump, the speech is an opportunity to address his remark about staying \u00e2\u0080\u009cneutral\u00e2\u0080\u009d in negotiations between Israelis and Palestinians, which worried some Republicans.

A same-size Nantucket Nectars Cranberry has 15 teaspoons. Imagine putting that in your coffee.Here\u00e2\u0080\u0099s another question: Would you be less likely to buy one for your kid if the amount was on the front of the bottle, measured in teaspoons?But there are other ways to encourage people to drink less soda. Perhaps the most direct is to tell them what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s in it, in a way that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s easy to understand.Jeffrey Dinowitz, a member of the New York State Assembly from the Bronx, introduced a bill requiring sugar-sweetened beverages to show these words on the front of the bottle or can: \u00e2\u0080\u009cSAFETY WARNING: Drinking beverages with added sugar contributes to obesity, diabetes and tooth decay.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Lawmakers in California and Washington State have introduced similar bills, and San Francisco passed a law last July that would require, starting in July 2016, that outdoor display ads for sugar-sweetened drinks  carry the warning over at least 20 percent of the poster. It quickly came under challenge by a lawsuit, not yet resolved, from the beverage industry.\u00e2\u0080\u009cEvery study I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve seen indicates that diabetes and obesity costs the U.S. 100 billion dollars a year,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Dinowitz. The Assembly\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Consumer Affairs committee approved the bill along party lines: all Democrats for, all Republicans against. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe chairman was very supportive \u00e2\u0080\u0094 that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s me,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Dinowitz. Even though it came out of committee, it hasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t passed the Assembly. He\u00e2\u0080\u0099s introduced it before, and will no doubt do so again and again. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s an uphill battle,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said.The American Beverage Association wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t grant me an interview, but provided a statement. Here\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the relevant part: \u00e2\u0080\u009cConsumers want factual information to help make informed choices that are right for them, and America\u00e2\u0080\u0099s beverage companies already provide clear calorie labels on the front of our products.\u00e2\u0080\u009cA warning label that suggests beverages are a unique driver of complex conditions such as diabetes and obesity is inaccurate and misleading.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The A.B.A. cites evidence that consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages is dropping just as diabetes and obesity are rising. The soda makers\u00e2\u0080\u0099 suggestion: Get more exercise.Exercise is great. But the evidence shows that diet is far more important in preventing obesity and diabetes. The A.B.A. has set a goal to reduce Americans\u00e2\u0080\u0099 calorie consumption from beverages by 20 percent in 2025, and in response to consumer pressure, manufacturers are moving toward lower or no-sugar drinks.Do our current front-of-the-package labels, which only state calories, allow consumers to \u00e2\u0080\u009cmake informed choices that are right for them?\u201d \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe calories per bottle is not shocking,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Christina Roberto, an assistant professor of medical ethics and health policy at the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the amount of sugar.\u00e2\u0080\u009d A 16-ounce Coke has three quarters of the calories of a single-pack Twix bar \u00e2\u0080\u0094 but more than twice the sugar. For context, the Food and Drug Administration recommends that adults consume a maximum of 50 grams of added sugar per day. The World Health Organization recommends half that. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s for adults; for kids, the limit is much lower. But of course, that information is not on the soda bottle.Yet, the numbers say something different. Let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s look at 16-ounce bottles:Coke \u00e2\u0080\u0094 52 grams of sugar.Snapple Kiwi Strawberry \u00e2\u0080\u0094 51 grams of sugar.Nantucket Nectars Big Cranberry \u00e2\u0080\u0094 65 grams of sugar.MinuteMaid Cranberry Apple Raspberry Juice \u00e2\u0080\u0094 57 grams of sugar.\u00a0Or 11.3-ounces bottles or pouches:Sunny D \u00e2\u0080\u0094 19 grams of sugar.Arizona Tea \u00e2\u0080\u0094 34 grams of sugar.Capri Sun \u00e2\u0080\u0094 33 grams of sugar.\u00a0Or 20-ounce bottles:Gatorade \u00e2\u0080\u0094 34 grams of sugar.Vitamin Water \u00e2\u0080\u0094 32 grams of sugar.\u00a0In general, the industry has been able to make nutritional labels as feeble and confusing as possible. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hard to tell what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a little and what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a lot.And why are we talking about grams? \u00e2\u0080\u009cAmericans use teaspoons,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Jim O\u00e2\u0080\u0099Hara, the director of health promotion policy at the Center for Science in the Public Interest in Washington. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve argued they should put it in teaspoons.\u00e2\u0080\u009dThe pro-soda tax argument that captured the Mexican public was called the \u00e2\u0080\u009c12 spoonfuls\u00e2\u0080\u009d campaign. One ad simply showed a soda with 12 teaspoons of sugar next to it. Another showed a hand offering a soda to a child, accompanied by text: Would you give your child 12 spoonfuls of sugar? Then why would you give him a soda?\u00e2\u0080\u009dA television spot showed parents trying to get their disgusted sons and daughters to eat a bowl of sugar: A father makes helicopter noises as spoon approaches mouth, and a mother pleads \u00e2\u0080\u009cthink about the starving African children.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00e2\u0080\u009cWe know consumers struggle mightily with numbers,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said David Hammond, an associate professor of public health at the University of Waterloo in Ontario, Canada. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThey struggle with calorie numbers, never mind grams of sugar. The easier you make it to comprehend, the more likely that information will be influential.\u00e2\u0080\u009dRead previous contributions to this series.Conveying information is not the only purpose of labels. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe other way they work is serving as a reminder in the moment,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Roberto. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAlmost every national survey says half the population wants to lose weight at any given time. The label is a reminder they are making choices.\u00e2\u0080\u009dRoberto is now testing the effects of graphic images of teaspoons of sugar or piles of sugar cubes.Health warning labels on consumables are not new, and we can learn from how well they\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve worked. Alcoholic drink bottles carry a dense block of text, all in capital letters (which can be harder to read than lowercase) warning of the risk of birth defects, impaired driving and \u00e2\u0080\u009chealth problems.\u00e2\u0080\u009dThese labels are terrible, said Matthew L. Myers, president of the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids, who has been working on the issue of warning labels since 1981. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThey\u00e2\u0080\u0099re invisible, lengthy and confusing. People in ad agencies just roll their eyes. If you were going to write a warning label not to work, the traditional alcohol warning label fits that bill.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00e2\u0080\u009cIn marketing and warning labels, the message needs to be simple, clear and delivered in a way that prompts individuals to notice it and think about it,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Myers. \u00e2\u0080\u009cGraphic warning labels do all of the above. Printed warning labels do none of the above.\u00e2\u0080\u009dDo we have graphic warning labels in the United States? No. Instead, we have four different blocks of text on the side of the pack \u00e2\u0080\u0094 text unchanged since 1985. Why? Here\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a clue: In 2009, Congress mandated graphic warning labels covering 50 percent of the pack. Cigarette manufacturers sued \u00e2\u0080\u0094 as they always do \u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00c2\u00a0claiming that the law violated their right to free speech. The industry won the case in December 2012. The next move was for the F.D.A. to go back to the drawing board and come up with new versions of graphic labels.A half century after the surgeon general\u00e2\u0080\u0099s report on smoking and health revealed the dangers of smoking, we still don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have labeling for cigarette packages that truly communicate the risk. Let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s do it differently this time.More From Fixes \u00bbMore From Private Lives \u00bbMore From Couch \u00bbMore From The Stone \u00bbMore From Moviegoers \u00bbMore From The End \u00bbMore From Draft \u00bbMore From Anxiety \u00bbMore From Menagerie \u00bbMore From Disunion \u00bbMore From Bedside \u00bbMore From The Conversation \u00bbMore From The Great Divide \u00bbMore From Errol Morris \u00bbFollowAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Teenage Drivers? Be Very Afraid", "Date": "2016-03-19", "News": "Supported byThis LifeSpend enough time having parenting conversations, as I\u2019ve done personally and professionally for the last dozen years, and certain patterns emerge. In nine out of 10 cases, if you\u2019re talking about highly motivated parents, the message to Mom and Dad is: back off, chill out, park the helicopter.Whether you want your children to be independent, resilient, creative; whether you\u2019re talking to teachers, psychologists, grandparents; whether you\u2019re discussing homework, food, sports; the recommendation, time and again, is relax.Recently, I stumbled onto a topic in which the advice was the exact opposite.Among the people who know what they are talking about, the unanimous message to parents is: You\u2019re not worried nearly enough. Get much more involved. Your child\u2019s life may be in danger.What\u2019s the topic? Teenage driving.Among this age group, death in motor vehicle accidents outstrips suicide, cancer and other types of accidents, Dr. Morris said. \u201cCars have gotten safer, roads have gotten safer, but teen drivers have not,\u201d she said.How to address this problem is not as simple as it seems, especially as technology has taken over teenagers\u2019 lives.One father I know bought his son a manual-transmission car because it required him to use two hands, to eliminate the option of using a cellphone. I recently overheard a conversation between my sister and her 16-year-old son in which she reminded him not to text while driving, and he replied, \u201cBut I\u2019m using Google Maps, and the text pops up automatically on the screen.\u201dSo what\u2019s a parent to do, especially one who knows teenagers are always one step ahead of any rules they try to impose?Most states have what are called \u201cgraduated driver\u2019s licenses,\u201d meaning some combination of learner\u2019s permit, followed by a six-month or so intermediate phase, followed by a full permit. Restricting the number of passengers who are not family members is among the most common regulations in the early phases, but Dr. Morris said most parents disregard the rule once that time expires.That\u2019s a huge mistake, she said. \u201cEven if your state drops the non-familiar-passenger restriction after six months, parents should make it their own rule,\u201d Dr. Morris said.Distraction is highest when boys ride with other boys, she said, whereas boys actually drive safer when girls are in the car. Altogether, passengers are a greater threat than cellphones, she believes. \u201cYour cellphone isn\u2019t encouraging your teen to go 80 in a 50, or 100 in a 70,\u201d she said.Dr. Klauer has done three studies, in which she places video cameras in cars and monitors drivers for a year. Even when teenagers know they\u2019re being monitored, they still use their telephones for texting, talking or checking Facebook at least once every trip, including ones only a few blocks.\u201cTeens\u2019 prevalence for engaging their devices is higher than other age groups,\u201d she said, \u201cand their risk for being involved in a crash when they do is higher.\u201dEven if the phone is tucked away in a pocket or backpack, enticing beeps or ringtones make it hard to resist. Dr. Klauer recommends blocking all notifications before even getting in the car. \u201cYou\u2019re more likely to do it if you\u2019re sitting calmly at home,\u201d she said. \u201cIn the moment, it\u2019s really hard not to look at the screen.\u201d\u201cThe real enemy is taking your eyes off the forward roadway,\u201d Dr. Klauer said. \u201cAnything more than two seconds is extremely dangerous. The longer you look away, the worse it gets.\u201dThough she\u2019s skeptical young drivers actually need navigation for most trips, Dr. Klauer said audible turn-by-turn directions are preferable to paper maps, because there\u2019s less rustling in your lap. Similarly, streaming music has advantages over flipping radio channels, as long as the driver is not selecting each individual song.Dr. Morris encouraged parents to adopt as many of the safety features as possible. \u201cI did not grow up in a wealthy family,\u201d she said. \u201cI drove a $3,000 car when I was in high school. But if the idea is that these bells and whistles aren\u2019t necessary for teens, I would argue against that. I know it\u2019s expensive for parents, but any advanced safety feature is well worth the money and peace of mind.\u201dDr. Klauer said that in her studies she would send video snippets to parents when their children violated the law. When parents looked at the results and discussed them with their teenagers, results improved. The only problem: Half the parents never even looked at the warnings. \u201cI know you trust your child,\u201d Dr. Klauer said. \u201cBut if you\u2019re not paying attention, chances are they\u2019re not driving as safely as you think they are.\u201dThe bottom line: Teenage driving may be that rare outlier when it comes to parenting. As soon as you give your children the keys to the car, it may be time to pull the helicopter out of the hangar for a spell and follow them down the road.Bruce Feiler is the author, most recently, of \u201cThe Secrets of Happy Families.\u201d Follow him on Twitter @brucefeiler. \u201cThis Life\u201d appears monthly.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Millennial Days", "Date": "2016-03-25", "News": "Supported byAuthor\u2019s NoteIt\u2019s an argument I\u2019m only too familiar with. When I tell people I\u2019ve written a memoir, they laugh. I\u2019m too young, they say (I\u2019m 31). I wait for the laughter to fade before I tell them what my book is about. Five years ago, my ex-boyfriend died in a motorcycle accident, just days after stabbing a man in a gas station parking lot in Little Rock, Ark., during what I\u2019ve guessed was a manic episode. I\u2019d shaped my life around this troubled, intensely charismatic man, and I didn\u2019t know how to mourn him. My book grapples with this thorny kind of grief.But however complicated my experiences or however many years I\u2019ve dedicated to apprenticing myself to the craft of memoir, I\u2019m still a young woman. If I write about myself, I become a cog in what Slate calls \u201cthe first-person industrial complex,\u201d in which women reveal their most traumatic experiences in personal essays published on the Internet, only to risk public backlash. Why is it so distasteful or indulgent for young women to confess to the darkest times in their lives? Why isn\u2019t it considered literary?These questions aren\u2019t new. After Anne Sexton\u2019s suicide, her daughter discovered that she carried in her wallet a clipping of James Dickey\u2019s scathing review of her first book. \u201cIt would be hard to find a writer who dwells more insistently on the pathetic and disgusting aspects of bodily experience,\u201d Dickey wrote. \u201cMiss Sexton\u2019s work seems to me very little more than a kind of terribly serious and determinedly outspoken soap opera.\u201dWhile time and distance can add depth to personal narratives, the assumption that the young memoirist is too na\u00efve to know she must wait to tell her story excludes one key possibility: She is choosing to capture a story through the lens of youth. One fine example of this zoomed-in perspective is Dani Shapiro\u2019s \u201cSlow Motion,\u201d a memoir about a tragic car accident that altered the author\u2019s life when she was 23, written in the present tense. Shapiro didn\u2019t need to wait to conjure up her mixed-up feelings; she can evoke her swerves from self-pity to grandiosity in the moment and without the intrusive interjections from an older and wiser self.Young writers are not only primed to evoke emotions with vivid immediacy, they are also experts on the digital interfaces where so many rites of passage (first love, first heartbreak, first grief) now occur. I am writing for other millennials, who have grown up flirting through texts and breaking up over email. The seed of my memoir was an essay I wrote about mourning on Facebook, where memorial rituals are quickly evolving but without an etiquette rule book. After my ex died, I watched as everyone who\u2019d ever loved him changed their profile pictures to one of them with him, and I realized that I had no pictures of the two of us together. Unable to participate, I felt invisible.I read the essay at a reading series, and afterward, a young woman approached me. She told me she\u2019d just lost her best friend and kept lurking on this dead girl\u2019s Facebook page, unable to confess to anyone else the hours she spent there. We talked about the strangeness of mourning in our 20s and isolation of these online vigils.In her memoir of her mother\u2019s death, \u201cThe Long Goodbye,\u201d Meghan O\u2019Rourke describes grief as universal and also \u201cexquisitely personal.\u201d What\u2019s changing in our lifetime is the landscape against which these universal yet personal experiences are played out, a realm so often described with fear or contempt. The critic Sven Birkerts and the psychologist Sherry Turkle have recently published books about how technology negatively impacts the way we interact and consume information. Their arguments take for granted \u201cdigital dualism,\u201d a term coined by the social media theorist Nathan Jurgenson, to describe the idea that what happens online isn\u2019t \u201creal life.\u201d I wonder if the reason the young woman I met was only able to tell me about her obsession on Facebook is because she feared others might not validate her grief as genuine. The \u201cdeficit in perspective\u201d Howey notices is real but perhaps it\u2019s most prevalent in a generation that discounts the experiences of young writers and chooses to remain oblivious to the distinct digital society in which so many now come of age.Leigh Stein is the author of three books, including the memoir \u201cLand of Enchantment,\u201d to be published in August.

{"Headline": "\u2018American Girls,\u2019 by Nancy Jo Sales", "Date": "2016-03-25", "News": "Supported byWhen you purchase an independently reviewed book through our site, we earn an affiliate commission.In the 12 years since the founding of Facebook, young people\u2019s use of social media has been the subject of fear \u2014 kids are rotting their brains and ruining their ability to form friendships! \u2014 and then a backlash: Don\u2019t worry, savvy parents, social media is just another way for kids to connect.The journalist Nancy Jo Sales isn\u2019t convinced by such reassurances. In \u201cAmerican Girls: Social Media and the Secret Lives of Teenagers,\u201d she offers a sort of third wave of social-media criticism. After talking to girls between the ages of 13 and 19 in 10 states, she believes we should be very worried indeed.Too often, discussions of teenagers exclude teenagers themselves, and it\u2019s clear that Sales has gone to great pains to listen to her subjects and to earn their trust. These girls have a lot to say not just about the apps on their phones but also about beauty, gender, race and class, and the book is at its most fascinating when they chat among themselves, sometimes as though Sales isn\u2019t even there. For most of them, social media is a necessary evil. It\u2019s an inextricable part of daily life \u2014 \u201cGirls our age live on their phones,\u201d one 16-year-old says \u2014 but also a source of anxiety and jealousy and a tool for harassment and abuse.Thirteen-year-old Cassy (Sales changed her teenage subjects\u2019 names) says boys her age \u201cblackmail\u201d girls for nude pictures: \u201cThey say, Oh, I have embarrassing pictures of you, if you don\u2019t send nudes I\u2019ll send them all out on social media.\u201d If a girl relents, boys may share the nude picture with others, or post it to an Instagram account devoted to such images. Says Cassy, \u201cEveryone winds up having it.\u201dAnecdotes like this make a persuasive case that social media has ratcheted up the pressure girls have long faced to appear both desirable and chaste. Less clear from \u201cAmerican Girls\u201d is what anyone can do about it.Well versed in the contemporary literature on social media and adolescence, Sales disagrees with those who say adult worries about teenagers and social media stem from \u201cmoral panic\u201d or fear of adolescent sexuality in general. \u201cWhat this point of view fails to acknowledge,\u201d she writes, \u201care the ways in which the sexual behavior of teenagers actually is being changed and shaped by thoroughly new technology, smartphones and social media, not to mention the influence of online porn. What\u2019s being avoided are the hard questions about whether these behaviors are in fact healthy or abusive or even legal, from the perspective of the age of consent.\u201dThese are indeed hard questions, but Sales provides few satisfying answers. She tells the story of Padma, whose Facebook pictures showing her in \u201ccasual clothes\u201d and hanging out with friends garnered few likes. One day, Padma began posting pictures of herself in more revealing clothing \u2014 and getting lots of likes, as well as comments like \u201csexy\u201d and \u201c#pornstar.\u201d Sales draws a connection between Padma\u2019s new style and a period several years earlier when another girl bullied Padma on Facebook. \u201cWas this part of how girls become hypersexualized, first by having their self-esteem destroyed?\u201dMaybe \u2014 but it\u2019s just as likely that Padma began posting more \u00adsexually charged photos of herself as she grew older, and kept doing it because she got positive reinforcement. The question of whether she can make that choice freely in a society that vigorously polices her appearance and sexual expression is a valid one. But such questions have been asked many times before, and Sales doesn\u2019t bring much that is new to the debate.Nor does she have much to say about social media\u2019s more positive applications. While new platforms have opened up new avenues for harassment, they have also enabled new forms of activism, and young people have often been the first to adopt them. Kira, one of the only black girls in her graduating class at a Manhattan private high school, points out that social media has helped fuel the Black Lives Matter movement. \u201cSome people are using social media to promote themselves,\u201d she says. \u201cBut other people are using it as a way to try and really change our society for the better.\u201dShe is one of the few girls in the book to make this point, and Sales could have delved deeper into the ways girls use social media to push back against the pressures they face, online and off. I wanted to hear more from the \u201cfeminist girls\u201d one 17-year-old describes: \u201cThey express themselves, they stick up for themselves and they, like, put feminist things on social media.\u201dSales wrote a Vanity Fair story last year on the effect of Tinder and other dating apps on contemporary sexuality. In it, college women complained that men their age had no interest in courtship or even basic politeness \u2014 \u201cTinder has destroyed their game.\u201d And 20-something male Tinder aficionados made a variety of repellent comments suggesting women are disposable and interchangeable: \u201cIf you had a reservation somewhere and then a table at Per Se opened up, you\u2019d want to go there,\u201d one of them said.In \u201cAmerican Girls,\u201d Sales argues that the same problem affects even young teenagers. She writes of \u201cboys who never want to make a definite plan; who seem to be leaving all their options open; and who seem to assume that girls are waiting with bated breath for boys to appear at their door, or at least to text them.\u201dBut social media didn\u2019t create boys like this \u2014 as Amanda Marcotte at Slate put it in response to the Vanity Fair story, \u201cgross dudes were not invented by apps.\u201d Sales does point out real double standards for male and female sexual behavior, which have been far slower to change than technology. (While she talks to gay teenagers \u2014 one girl says friends of her ex-girlfriend harassed her on social media after the two broke up \u2014 most of her discussions of dating and sexuality focus on heterosexual kids.) But there\u2019s something exhausting about hearing, yet again, that boys and young men can\u2019t be bothered to be boyfriends; critics of hookup culture have been repeating that claim since some of Sales\u2019s subjects were in diapers.\u201cAmerican Girls\u201d is also limited by its single-gender focus. While Sales talks to some older boys and young men, male voices are largely absent from the sections dealing with younger teenagers. The choice makes sense in a way \u2014 girls seem to suffer sexualized harassment and shaming on social media more frequently than boys do. But excluding boys\u2019 perspectives gives readers an incomplete view of the problem and its potential solutions.Do boys, too, feel pressure to present a certain image \u2014 maybe that of a player who\u2019s talking to lots of girls? What do they think when their friends demand nude pictures from girls or harass them online? Do they ever feel guilty about how they treat girls on social media? What, if anything, might get them to change?Sales\u2019s conversations with male college students hint at some answers to these questions. One of them, Ethan, is intriguingly conflicted about his social-media-enabled sex life. He boasts of \u201ca scoring average higher than Kobe Bryant\u201d and says he has no problem cheating on girls: \u201cMy friends are like, She\u2019s not gonna find out \u2014 you can have the main course and some appetizers, too.\u201d But, Sales writes, \u201che\u2019d been cheated on; he still didn\u2019t seem over it.\u201d And Ethan says he wishes he lived \u201cwhen you had to go knock on the door and ask the dad for permission.\u201dThis time (which Ethan somewhat amusingly puts \u201cin the \u201970s\u201d) wasn\u2019t necessarily a happy one for women \u2014 many jeremiads about today\u2019s sexual freedoms forget the oppressiveness that came before. But Sales doesn\u2019t probe Ethan\u2019s odd and possibly illuminating mixture of bravado and romanticism. And while she does mention the lack of female representation in Silicon Valley, she doesn\u2019t spend much time discussing what tech companies could do to fix some of the problems she identifies. The effect is to make apps like Facebook and Twitter seem static and unchangeable, when in fact they change all the time, and their corporate owners could modify them to protect younger users.It feels a bit strange to call for more talk of boys and big corporations in a book about girls. But when it comes to dating and sex, teenage girls are already subject to near-constant scrutiny, and they\u2019re too often considered in isolation, as though the dangers and injustices they face are entirely theirs to solve. By focusing almost exclusively on how girls suffer, Sales repeats the usual unhelpful and defeatist refrain: It\u2019s a terrible world out there, and girls have to navigate it all on their own.Anna North is a staff editor for The Times\u2019s opinion pages.

No posts about their frustration with their homework. That victory picture after the soccer game? Maybe. The frustrated rant about the fight you just had over laundry? No way.The answers revealed \u00e2\u0080\u009ca really interesting disconnect,\u201d said Alexis Hiniker, a graduate student in human-centered design and engineering at the University of Washington who led the research. She, along with researchers at the University of Michigan, studied 249 parent-child pairs distributed across 40 states and found that while children ages 10 to 17 \u00e2\u0080\u009cwere really concerned\u201d about the ways parents shared their children\u00e2\u0080\u0099s lives online, their parents were far less worried. About three times more children than parents thought there should be rules about what parents shared on social media.With the first babies of Facebook (which started in 2004) not yet in their teens and the stylish kids of Instagram (which started in 2010) barely in elementary school, families are just beginning to explore the question of how children feel about the digital record of their earliest years. But as this study, although small, suggests, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s increasingly clear that our children will grow into teenagers and adults who want to control their digital identities.\u00e2\u0080\u009cAs these children come of age, they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re going to be seeing the digital footprint left in their childhood\u00e2\u0080\u0099s wake,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Stacey Steinberg, a legal skills professor and associate director of the Center on Children and Families at the University of Florida Levin College of Law. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhile most of them will be fine, some might take issue with it.\u00e2\u0080\u009dSome children and teenagers question both past and present sharing. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI really don\u2019t like it when my parents post pictures of me on their social media accounts, especially after finding out that some of my friends follow them,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Maisy Hoffman, 14, an eighth grader who lives in Manhattan. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI worry more about my dad. He doesn\u2019t always ask if he can post things, so I immediately turn away and ask if he\u2019s going to post it. Or I\u2019ll find out later because my friend saw something of me on his Instagram and I\u2019ll have to ask him to take it down.\u00e2\u0080\u009dOther parents can also present a problem for the child who prefers to control how she appears online. Wendy Bradford, a mother of three elementary-school aged children in Manhattan, said that when parent chaperones took pictures during a third-grade field trip to the zoo, her daughter \u00e2\u0080\u009chid when she saw the phones because she didn\u2019t want the pictures to be posted on Facebook with her in them.\u00e2\u0080\u009dIsabella Aijo, 15, a high school sophomore in Natick, Mass., said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI definitely know people who have parents who post things they wish weren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t out there. There was a girl in my eighth grade class whose mom opened a YouTube account for her in the fourth grade to show off her singing,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she wrote to me in an email. \u00e2\u0080\u009cFinally, on one of the last months of middle school, a peer played the song in class and almost the entire class laughed hysterically over it.\u00e2\u0080\u009dThose early posts from parents linger, not just online, but in our children\u00e2\u0080\u0099s memories \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and the topics may be things we don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t see as potentially embarrassing. The son of a friend (who asked that I not use her name) still brings up things she wrote about his picky eating when he was younger \u00e2\u0080\u0094 years ago, she says.But that kind of sharing \u00e2\u0080\u0094 about food issues, potty training and tantrums \u00e2\u0080\u0094 is exactly the kind of sharing that can be valuable. \u00e2\u0080\u009cChildren benefit from the community created when parents have the ability to share their stories,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Ms. Steinberg. Those posts about picky eating might have helped my friend find solutions, or a fresh wellspring of patience for a behavior her child would eventually outgrow.When parents share those early frustrations, they don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t see themselves as exposing something personal about their children\u00e2\u0080\u0099s lives, but about their own. As a society, says Ms. Steinberg, \u00e2\u0080\u009cwe\u00e2\u0080\u0099re going to have to find ways to balance a parent\u00e2\u0080\u0099s right to share their story and a parent\u00e2\u0080\u0099s right to control the upbringing of their child with a child\u00e2\u0080\u0099s right to privacy.\u00e2\u0080\u009cParents often intrude on a child\u00e2\u0080\u0099s digital identity, not because they are malicious, but because they haven\u00e2\u0080\u0099t considered the potential reach and the longevity of the digital information that they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re sharing,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Ms. Steinberg.In general, said Sarita Schoenebeck, an assistant professor at the University of Michigan School of Information, who co-authored the research, both children and parents considered positive images, events and news more appropriate to share than negative ones. Parents can consider, too, the searchability and reach of the format (although those are always evolving). A frustrated tweet about a child who won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t eat her cereal because it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not in a red bowl is a lot less likely to resurface than a YouTube video of the resulting tantrum. Looking for advice or sympathy about a behavioral problem? Skip both the image, and your child\u00e2\u0080\u0099s name, in a post to limit later searches.At our house, I sometimes see the hesitation in my oldest son, who is 14, when I bring out the camera at a goofy moment, but we have a whole house rule: no sharing images of anyone else without their consent, ever. That trust means I get my candid shots, and he keeps his digital identity, whatever he eventually wants it to be, intact.Your health questions answered by Times journalists and\u00a0experts.Get Well's Running email for practical tips, expert advice, exclusive content and a bit of motivation delivered to your inbox every week to help you on your running journey.

Trump for President attacks his rival Marco Rubio, saying he presented one image but \u00e2\u0080\u009clived by different rules.\u00e2\u0080\u009dThe ad is one of the most brutal of a campaign season defined by negative ads, and it goes on the air seven days before the state\u2019s Republican primary. Portions of it sound as if they were written by Mr. Trump himself. \u201cCorrupt Marco Rubio has spent years defrauding the people of Florida,\u201d the narrator says in the spot. \u201cAs a legislator he flipped on a key vote after making a quick $200,000 from selling his house to the mother of the bill\u2019s lobbyist.\u201d The narrator goes on: \u201cHe used the Republican Party\u2019s credit card to pave his driveway and to live it up in Las Vegas, and when he got caught, he said he had used the wrong credit card. But he had used the same Republican Party card for six flights between Miami and Tallahassee, then billed the state for the same airline tickets and pocketed the cash until, once again, he got caught.\u201d One part of the ad sounds particularly derivative of Mr. Trump\u2019s past attacks on Mr. Rubio: \u201cOn top of it all, Rubio\u2019s been a total no-show in the U.S. Senate with the worst voting record of all,\u201d the narrator says, concluding that Mr. Rubio is \u201canother corrupt, all-talk, no-action politician.\u201d Mr. Trump is the subject of more than $10 million in negative ads from outside groups, with much of that money being spent in Florida. If Mr. Rubio loses the primary there next week, his campaign is most likely over.Joe Pounder, a spokesman for Mr. Rubio, pointed out the similarities between the new Trump spot and the type of claims that Charlie Crist, then the governor of Florida, made against Mr. Rubio in their 2010 Senate race. \u00e2\u0080\u009cFirst, Donald Trump gave big bucks to Charlie Crist in 2010, and now he\u2019s recycling the same false and negative attacks about Marco.

{"Headline": "WhatsApp Encryption Said to Stymie Wiretap Order", "Date": "2016-03-12", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 While the Justice Department wages a public fight with Apple over access to a locked iPhone, government officials are privately debating how to resolve a prolonged standoff with another technology company, WhatsApp, over access to its popular instant messaging application, officials and others involved in the case said.No decision has been made, but a court fight with WhatsApp, the world\u2019s largest mobile messaging service, would open a new front in the Obama administration\u2019s dispute with Silicon Valley over encryption, security and privacy.WhatsApp, which is owned by Facebook, allows customers to send messages and make phone calls over the Internet. In the last year, the company has been adding encryption to those conversations, making it impossible for the Justice Department to read or eavesdrop, even with a judge\u2019s wiretap order.As recently as this past week, officials said, the Justice Department was discussing how to proceed in a continuing criminal investigation in which a federal judge had approved a wiretap, but investigators were stymied by WhatsApp\u2019s encryption.The Justice Department and WhatsApp declined to comment. The government officials and others who discussed the dispute did so on condition of anonymity because the wiretap order and all the information associated with it were under seal. The nature of the case was not clear, except that officials said it was not a terrorism investigation. The location of the investigation was also unclear.To understand the battle lines, consider this imperfect analogy from the predigital world: If the Apple dispute is akin to whether the F.B.I. can unlock your front door and search your house, the issue with WhatsApp is whether it can listen to your phone calls. In the era of encryption, neither question has a clear answer.Whether the WhatsApp dispute ends in a court fight that sets precedents, many law enforcement officials and security experts say that such a case may be inevitable because the nation\u2019s wiretapping laws were last updated a generation ago, when people communicated by landline telephones that were easy to tap.\u201cThe F.B.I. and the Justice Department are just choosing the exact circumstance to pick the fight that looks the best for them,\u201d said Peter Eckersley, the chief computer scientist at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a nonprofit group that focuses on digital rights. \u201cThey\u2019re waiting for the case that makes the demand look reasonable.\u201dA senior law enforcement official disputed the notion that the government was angling for the perfect case, and said that litigation was not inevitable.This is not the first time that the government\u2019s wiretaps have been thwarted by encryption. And WhatsApp is not the only company to clash with the government over the issue. But with a billion users and a particularly strong international customer base, it is by far the largest.But in late 2014, the company said that it would begin adding sophisticated encoding, known as end-to-end encryption, to its systems. Only the intended recipients would be able to read the messages.The iPhone case, which revolves around whether Apple can be forced to help the F.B.I. unlock a phone used by one of the killers in last year\u2019s San Bernardino, Calif., massacre, has received worldwide attention for the precedent it might set. But to many in law enforcement, disputes like the one with WhatsApp are of far greater concern.For more than a half-century, the Justice Department has relied on wiretaps as a fundamental crime-fighting tool. To some in law enforcement, if companies like WhatsApp, Signal and Telegram can design unbreakable encryption, then the future of wiretapping is in doubt.\u201cYou\u2019re getting useless data,\u201d said Joseph DeMarco, a former federal prosecutor who now represents law enforcement agencies that filed briefs supporting the Justice Department in its fight with Apple. \u201cThe only way to make this not gibberish is if the company helps.\u201d\u201cAs we know from intercepted prisoner wiretaps,\u201d he added, \u201ccriminals think that advanced encryption is great.\u201dBusinesses, customers and the United States government also rely on strong encryption to help protect information from hackers, identity thieves and foreign cyberattacks. That is why, in 2013, a White House report said the government should \u201cnot in any way subvert, undermine, weaken, or make vulnerable generally available commercial encryption.\u201dJames B. Comey, the F.B.I. director, told Congress this month that strong encryption was \u201cvital\u201d and acknowledged that \u201cthere are undoubtedly international implications\u201d for the United States to try to break encryption, especially for wiretaps, as in the WhatsApp case. But he has called for technology companies and the government to find a middle ground that allows for strong encryption but accommodates law enforcement efforts. President Obama echoed those remarks on Friday, saying technology executives who were \u201cabsolutist\u201d on the issue were wrong.That view is one reason government officials have been hesitant to rush to court in the WhatsApp case and others like it. The legal and policy implications are great. While no immediate resolution is in sight, more and more companies offer encryption. And technology analysts say that WhatsApp\u2019s yearlong effort to add encryption to all one billion of its customer accounts is nearly complete.Eric Lichtblau contributed reporting from Washington and Katie Benner from San Francisco.Advertisement"}

It\u2019s located closer to Miami. American hotel chains are already circling, or pouncing.The world has sped up since the mid-1990s, when Vietnam embarked on the opening that has fast-forwarded its economy over the past two decades. Like China, it has demonstrated that nothing fires up capitalism quite like Communist political control in 21st-century guise.Why should Ra\u00fal Castro\u2019s Cuba be different? Money trumps liberty, which can be cumbersome and erratic. Give Havana a mere decade and it will be well down the Ho Chi Minh City road.Over all, that\u2019s good for Cubans, yet the homogenizing effect of global commerce has become so familiar that it\u2019s difficult to look at images of President Obama strolling the streets of Old Havana with his family and not feel \u2014 along with the thrill of this needed breakthrough \u2014 a twinge of ambivalence.It is a wonderful thing to have an American president in Cuba for the first time in almost nine decades, and equally wonderful to see the thawing of a half-century of American-Cuban hostility that had become anachronistic and pointless.But by now we know enough of how development can look \u2014 and how it can race ahead without accompanying political liberalization \u2014 to rejoice with some reserve. Cuba is certain to lose a fraction of its soul as money works its fascination. All the new malls may do nothing for the miserable fate of dissidents with democratic obsessions.Vietnam has been a remarkable success story. Annual trade with the United States has soared from a mere $220 million in 1994 to $29.6 billion in 2013. Four decades after the napalm, commerce has overcome enmity. America is a hedge against China; the temporary enemy has become a partner of sorts against the eternal enemy.The Vietnamese, their lives improving, express overwhelmingly positive views of America. Obama is expected here later this year to cement a new partnership important to the future of the United States as a China-offsetting power in Asia.It would be surprising if the Cuba opening did not produce similar rapid development and steady rapprochement with the United States. The Cuban revolution had its achievements, not least in education and medicine, but lost its raison d\u2019\u00eatre long ago. It was a generator of misery and paralysis on an epic scale \u2014 lives wasted, hopes quashed, youths reduced to idleness and inertia.The possibilities about to emerge for millions of Cubans are reason enough to say that, while it\u2019s no panacea, the Obama-Castro entente is cause for celebration.\u201cI was almost alone on a Sunday morning in Cuba\u2019s capital city of 2.2 million people. A couple of cars a minute passed, often finned \u201950s beauties, Studebakers and Chevrolets, extravagant and battered. Here and there, a stray mutt scrounged. Washing flapped on the ornate ironwork balconies of crumbling mansions. Looking out on the ocean, I searched in vain for a single boat.\u201dGoodbye to all that. The imprisoning sea off Cuba will be imprisoning no more; it will grow dense with container ships and the masts of yachts before long. New buildings will rise and the old will be torn down. That is good, of course it is. Yet the global mall and tourist destination do leave something to be desired.You never know, as Vietnam and Cuba demonstrate. America loses a war against Communism in Southeast Asia, and in time capitalism triumphs.\u201cThe white man is finished in Asia,\u201d said Ho Chi Minh. Well, not quite, as it transpired.\u201cA revolution is not a bed of roses,\u201d said Fidel Castro. Nor is the end of the revolution.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "E.U. and U.S. Release Details on Trans-Atlantic Data Transfer Deal", "Date": "2016-02-29", "News": "Supported byAmerican and European officials released details on Monday about a new trans-Atlantic data transfer agreement, prompting a new round of debate about how companies like Google move digital information between the two regions.As part of the new agreement \u2014 known as the E.U.-U.S. Privacy Shield \u2014 companies will face stricter rules over how they move people\u2019s digital data from the European Union to the United States. American officials have also agreed to new limits on the powers of the country\u2019s intelligence agencies to gain access to Europeans\u2019 online information when it is transferred to the United States.\u201cThe U.S. has different structures to Europe, but both sides offer robust privacy protections,\u201d Penny Pritzker, the United States commerce secretary, said in an interview in February. \u201cThe challenge was to show Europe how our system works, because we don\u2019t have a single overriding privacy law.\u201dThe European Commission, the executive arm of the European Union, also gave its official backing on Monday after it released a so-called adequacy decision, an official text required to turn the data transfer pact into law.The biggest American tech companies face intensifying scrutiny by European regulators, with \u2014 pressure that could potentially curb their sizable profits in the region and affect how they operate around the world.Though the agreement still needs to be ratified by European Union member states, that is not expected to be contentious and is likely to happen in the coming months.\u201cRestoring trans-Atlantic trust is crucial to businesses,\u201d said John Higgins, director general of DigitalEurope, a technology trade group whose members include Google and Microsoft. \u201cWe welcome progress towards the adoption of the E.U.-U.S. Privacy Shield Adequacy Decision.\u201dDespite the agreement, privacy campaigners have been quick to balk at the deal, saying that it does not offer Europeans sufficient protections when their data is moved across the Atlantic.Several groups have already said that they will challenge the pact in court, and Europe\u2019s increasingly powerful national data protection authorities have yet to give their approval.\u201cThe new Privacy Shield framework appears to amount to little more than a re-marketed version of the pre-existing safe harbor decision, offering little more than cosmetic changes,\u201d said Jan Philipp Albrecht, a German politician who has favored stronger privacy rules, in reference to the old data-transfer agreement known as \u201csafe harbor.\u201dTo assuage such concerns, American officials released several documents on Monday that outlined the new checks on both companies and government agencies that wanted to gain access to Europeans\u2019 digital footprints.In a letter to Vera Jourova, the European justice commissioner, Secretary of State John Kerry explained how a new ombudsman would act as a first point of contact for Europeans if they believed American government agencies had misused their data. The role would apply to the new Privacy Shield agreement, as well as to other mechanisms used to move European data to the United States, Mr. Kerry added.American intelligence agencies will also face stricter limits on the digital information that they can retrieve on Europeans, while the data transfer agreement provides new legal powers for European citizens who believe either companies or United States government agencies have misused their digital information, according to the American documents released on Monday.Ms. Jourova added, however, that the European Commission would continue to monitor the new deal to ensure that Europeans\u2019 privacy rights \u2014 which are viewed as being equal to other rights, such as freedom of expression \u2014 would be upheld in the United States.That monitoring would include an annual meeting between Europe and the United States to review the new data. The first meeting is expected to be held in the summer of 2017.\u201cRules on paper are essential, but they also must be fulfilled,\u201d Ms. Jourova said in an interview in February. \u201cWe need ways to check that this works.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Five Big Questions After a (Shockingly) Civil Debate", "Date": "2016-03-11", "News": "Supported byWhen and why did an alien gain control of Donald Trump\u2019s body?The Trump who usually causes us to gasp and gape didn\u2019t show up in Miami on Thursday night. There was, to be sure, a bright, brassy pouf of hair that looked familiar, and a man below it who pursed his lips and shook his head in a distinctly Trumpian fashion.But he didn\u2019t bray like Trump. Didn\u2019t interrupt like Trump. Didn\u2019t redden like Trump, turning crimson when challenged, scarlet when corrected. No, this interloper was unflappable, and he remained a whiter shade of male.When other candidates took jabs at him, he didn\u2019t mock them with demeaning nicknames\u2014no \u201clittle Marco\u201d for Rubio, no \u201clyin\u2019 Ted\u201d for Cruz\u2014or tell them how puny their poll numbers were. When moderators tried to provoke him, he didn\u2019t bellow about the injustice of it all.He bit his tongue. Waited his turn. Maintained his dignity.That resistance is from Republican traditionalists and power brokers who have been trying to build opposition to him and have been organizing attacks, including negative ads, against him. In their eyes, he\u2019s dangerous \u2014 partly because he\u2019s not even-keeled or adult, let alone presidential.He finally sought to show them otherwise, and the effort fascinated me all the more because just hours beforehand, the Republican strategist Alex Castellanos had told me that a demonstration of calm was the one great favor that Trump could do himself in the debate.\u201cCan Trump discipline his impulses?\u201d Castellanos asked, identifying this as the question on many Republicans\u2019 minds. \u201cThere are a lot of Republicans who agree with him and think he can win a general election, but he scares them. I don\u2019t think we know if Donald Trump can discipline himself. Will we see that tonight? Can he make it comfortable for Republicans? Can he let them love him?\u201dWith those holdouts in mind, Trump placidly made the case that he\u2019s the party\u2019s savior, not its destroyer, and began the evening with a mention of the high turnout of voters for the Republican primaries. He emphasized that many of these voters were new ones, drawn to \u2014 and by \u2014 him.\u201cWe\u2019re taking people from the Democrat Party,\u201d he said in his opening statement. \u201cWe\u2019re taking people as independents.\u201d He added that \u201cthe Republican establishment, or whatever you want to call it, should embrace what\u2019s happening. We\u2019re having millions of extra people join. We are going to beat the Democrats. We are going to beat Hillary or whoever it may be.\u201dHe closed the evening with a nearly identical appeal, casting himself as electable, not outrageous. \u201cSo I just say: Embrace these millions of people that now, for the first time ever, love the Republican Party, and unify,\u201d he said. \u201cBe smart and unify.\u201dHow alien.Which Cruz did viewers focus on?Never has the Tao of Ted been on display as vividly as it was Thursday night.He was brilliant in his way. He was obnoxious as only he can be. He was both within a span of minutes. And he was shameless in extremis, again characterizing his career in Washington as one of selfless service to voters when it\u2019s really about boundless promotion of his ambitions.He has this oxymoronic habit of crowing about self-effacement, and it sired the night\u2019s best moment, when he perfectly skewered Trump\u2019s transparent, transcendent vanity. (Takes one to know one?)\u201cWe need to nominate and elect a president who remembers he works for the people,\u201d Cruz said in that hyper-solemn manner that he has practically trademarked. \u201cYou know, at Donald\u2019s rallies recently, he\u2019s taken to asking people in the crowd to raise their hand and pledge their support to him.\u201d\u201cTo me,\u201d he continued, \u201cthat\u2019s exactly backwards. This is a job interview. We are here pledging our support to you, not the other way around. And the only hand-raising I\u2019m interested in doing is on January 20th, 2017.\u201d That date would be his inauguration, and as he envisioned such a glorious fate, he extolled the Bible, the Constitution and his unwavering fidelity to both.\u201cThank you, Senator,\u201d said CNN\u2019s principal moderator, Jake Tapper, who looked like he was using every muscle in his head and even a few in his neck to keep his eyes from rolling.And then there was Cruz\u2019s finale, when he nodded to the paternity of, in order, Rubio, Kasich, himself and Trump. \u201cWhat an incredible nation we have,\u201d he said, \u201cthat the son of a bartender and the son of a mailman and the son of a dishwasher and a successful businessman can all stand on this stage, competing and asking for your support.\u201d\u201cBusinessman\u201d didn\u2019t fit. It wasn\u2019t meant to. That was his point, and it was undeniably clever, inimitably snotty and quintessentially Cruz.What about Rubio?Everything old is new again. Rubio took a fresh approach that reprised his former approach: voice of hope, vessel of optimism, personification of the American dream. He\u2019d tried meanness, only to watch his support decline rather than increase. So he was back to mirth, for what it was worth.And it was worth something on Thursday night, when he had a debate that was confident, precise, tactical. His slender hope of staying in this race rests on winning Florida on Tuesday, and he never lost sight of that, making proclamations bound to please the state\u2019s Republican voters, tailoring his lines to the hometown crowd and reminding everyone that he and his parents have lived most of their lives in Florida.After Trump blabbered vaguely about demanding some kind of great deal with Cuba before restoring full diplomatic relations, Rubio ticked off the exact terms.\u201cCuba has free elections, Cuba stops putting people in jail for speaking out, it kicks out the Chinese listening station, it stops helping North Korea evade U.N. sanctions, and they take the fugitives from justice, including the cop killer and send her back to the United States \u2014 that\u2019s a good deal,\u201d he said. The crowd exploded in applause.Rubio repeatedly filled in the blanks of what Trump was saying or used the specifics and details in his own answers to expose the lack of both in Trump\u2019s. Instead of explicitly dressing Trump drown, he implicitly showed Trump up.At one point Trump, defending his vilification of Muslims, said, \u201cYou can say what you want, and you can be politically correct if you want. I don\u2019t want to be so politically correct. I like to solve problems.\u201dRubio responded: \u201cI\u2019m not interested in being politically correct. I\u2019m interested in being correct.\u201d And that meant not trafficking in the kind of blanket condemnations that could leave the United States without Muslim allies in the fight against Islamic extremists, he said.\u201cWe\u2019re going to have to work with the Jordanian kingdom,\u201d Rubio added. \u201cWe\u2019re going to have to work with the Saudis. We\u2019re going to have to work with the Gulf kingdoms. We\u2019re going to have to work with the Egyptians to defeat, for example, ISIS.\u201dIt was sensible. It was mature. And it was probably much too late.Do endorsements matter?Trump used the debate to revel in the news that Ben Carson was about to endorse him. But who else would Carson endorse? Rubio is fading, John Kasich never caught fire and Cruz stole some of Carson\u2019s Iowa votes. Trump was the last possibility standing, though Carson\u2019s talent for confusion is such that he could easily have endorsed Rand Paul, forgetting that he quit the race more than a month ago.This is not an election cycle in which voters have any interest in being told what to do, in conforming to expectations or in perpetuating the status quo. Endorsements are as much death knells as catalysts.And now I\u2019m haunted by visions of a Trump/Carson or a Cruz/Fiorina ticket. Trump/Christie is looking better and better all the time.Will Kasich be denied a disparagement of his very own?I\u2019ve alluded already to Trump\u2019s putdowns of Bush (\u201clow energy\u201d), Rubio (\u201clittle Marco\u201d) and Cruz (\u201clyin\u2019 Ted\u201d). He\u2019s obviously fond of descriptors with the letter \u201cl,\u201d perhaps because it\u2019s the start of \u201cluxury,\u201d \u201clibido\u201d and \u201clucre.\u201d That\u2019s Trump in an alliterative troika.But Kasich lacks a Trump-given sobriquet and may never get one. Time is running out.On Thursday night he shamed the shameful billionaire, who once mused \u2014 with seeming admiration \u2014 about the \u201cpower of strength\u201d that the Chinese government exhibited decades ago in Tiananmen Square.\u201cI think that the Chinese government butchered those kids,\u201d Kasich said, bluntly. \u201cAnd when that guy stood in front \u2014 that young man stood in front of that tank \u2014 we ought to build a statue of him over here.\u201dNah, we just want to build a ginormous border wall. And Kasich is a \u201clost cause.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Shame Culture", "Date": "2016-03-15", "News": "Supported byIn 1987, Allan Bloom wrote a book called \u201cThe Closing of the American Mind.\u201d The core argument was that American campuses were awash in moral relativism. Subjective personal values had replaced universal moral principles. Nothing was either right or wrong. Amid a wave of rampant nonjudgmentalism, life was flatter and emptier.Bloom\u2019s thesis was accurate at the time, but it\u2019s not accurate anymore. College campuses are today awash in moral judgment.Many people carefully guard their words, afraid they might transgress one of the norms that have come into existence. Those accused of incorrect thought face ruinous consequences. When a moral crusade spreads across campus, many students feel compelled to post in support of it on Facebook within minutes. If they do not post, they will be noticed and condemned.Some sort of moral system is coming into place. Some new criteria now exist, which people use to define correct and incorrect action. The big question is: What is the nature of this new moral system?Crouch argues that the omnipresence of social media has created a new sort of shame culture. The world of Facebook, Instagram and the rest is a world of constant display and observation. The desire to be embraced and praised by the community is intense. People dread being exiled and condemned. Moral life is not built on the continuum of right and wrong; it\u2019s built on the continuum of inclusion and exclusion.This creates a set of common behavior patterns. First, members of a group lavish one another with praise so that they themselves might be accepted and praised in turn.Second, there are nonetheless enforcers within the group who build their personal power and reputation by policing the group and condemning those who break the group code. Social media can be vicious to those who don\u2019t fit in. Twitter can erupt in instant ridicule for anyone who stumbles.Third, people are extremely anxious that their group might be condemned or denigrated. They demand instant respect and recognition for their group. They feel some moral wrong has been perpetrated when their group has been disrespected, and react with the most violent intensity.Crouch describes how video gamers viciously went after journalists, mostly women, who had criticized the misogyny of their games. Campus controversies get so hot so fast because even a minor slight to a group is perceived as a basic identity threat.The ultimate sin today, Crouch argues, is to criticize a group, especially on moral grounds. Talk of good and bad has to defer to talk about respect and recognition. Crouch writes, \u201cTalk of right and wrong is troubling when it is accompanied by seeming indifference to the experience of shame that accompanies judgments of \u2018immorality.\u2019\u201dHe notes that this shame culture is different from the traditional shame cultures, the ones in Asia, for example. In traditional shame cultures the opposite of shame was honor or \u201cface\u201d \u2014 being known as a dignified and upstanding citizen. In the new shame culture, the opposite of shame is celebrity \u2014 to be attention-grabbing and aggressively unique on some media platform.On the positive side, this new shame culture might rebind the social and communal fabric. It might reverse, a bit, the individualistic, atomizing thrust of the past 50 years.On the other hand, everybody is perpetually insecure in a moral system based on inclusion and exclusion. There are no permanent standards, just the shifting judgment of the crowd. It is a culture of oversensitivity, overreaction and frequent moral panics, during which everybody feels compelled to go along.If we\u2019re going to avoid a constant state of anxiety, people\u2019s identities have to be based on standards of justice and virtue that are deeper and more permanent than the shifting fancy of the crowd. In an era of omnipresent social media, it\u2019s probably doubly important to discover and name your own personal True North, vision of an ultimate good, which is worth defending even at the cost of unpopularity and exclusion.The guilt culture could be harsh, but at least you could hate the sin and still love the sinner. The modern shame culture allegedly values inclusion and tolerance, but it can be strangely unmerciful to those who disagree and to those who don\u2019t fit in.Advertisement"}

Trump expressed his solidarity with Israel in passionate terms on Monday, promising a gathering of the American Israel Public Affairs Committee that as president he would always stand up for\u00c2\u00a0it against its\u00c2\u00a0enemies in the Middle East.The Republican presidential candidate, who has been criticized for saying that he would like to remain neutral in negotiations between Israelis and Palestinians, made clear in no uncertain terms that Israel had his unbridled support. He assailed the United Nations and the Obama administration for failing to side with Israel and promised to take a hard line against Iran.\u201cI speak to you today as a lifelong supporter and true friend of Israel,\u201d Mr. Trump said.Drawing several rounds of standing ovations, Mr. Trump thundered against the Iran nuclear deal and made clear that he was not, in fact, on the fence\u00c2\u00a0when it came to brokering a deal with Israel and the Palestinians.\u201cThe Palestinians must come to the table, knowing that the bond between the United States and Israel is absolutely and totally unbreakable,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cThey must come to the table willing and able to stop the terror being committed on a daily basis against Israel.\u201dLast year Mr. Trump drew jeers for fumbling a question on the sensitive issue of whether the American embassy should be moved to Jerusalem from Tel Aviv.

{"Headline": "Transcript of the Democratic Presidential Debate in Miami", "Date": "2016-03-10", "News": "Supported bySALINAS (through translator): Now, we\u2019re going to welcome the protagonists of this debate. First, former Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton.(APPLAUSE)And Senator from Vermont Bernie Sanders.(APPLAUSE)Welcome to both of you. Thank you for being here.(SPEAKING IN SPANISH)SALINAS (through translator): Welcome to both of you.RAMOS (through translator): But before we continue, we want to welcome Sebastian de la Cruz (ph) who is going to sing the national anthem.Sebastian, welcome. Good evening.(STAR SPANGLED BANNER)(APPLAUSE)(COMMERCIAL BREAK)SALINAS (through translator): Thank you for being with us. The Washington Post and Facebook, these are the results of this debate that the candidates have accepted. They will have 90 seconds to answer each question. When their rival mentions them in an answer, they will have 30 seconds to answer and another 30 seconds to answer questions, follow-up questions that we ask.RAMOS (through translator): We will make our questions in English and they will be translated simultaneously into Spanish for our viewers. And right now, each one of them has one minute for your initial words. We begin with Secretary Clinton.(APPLAUSE)And tonight I am looking forward to the opportunity to discuss how we knock down the barriers that stand in the way of people getting ahead and staying ahead, starting with the economic ones. My focus is on more good paying jobs with rising incomes for families and how we prevent corporations from taking jobs out of our country by imposing an exit tax, making them pay back any tax breaks they\u2019ve gotten.But we also need to be having a positive agenda for manufacturing. for small businesses and entrepreneurs, for more clean energy jobs. And I also look forward to discussing comprehensive immigration reform with a path to citizenship that will be one of my priorities in my first 100 days as president. And I will also be talking about education, every child deserves a good teacher and a good school.Together we\u2019re going to have to overturn this disastrous Citizens United Supreme Court decision. (APPLAUSE)And here in Miami...(APPLAUSE)First question, Secretary, you have been starting to sound like the nominee lately, but many voters are saying, not so fast. Where did you fail last night in Michigan?So this is a marathon, and it\u2019s a marathon that can only be carried out by the kind of inclusive campaign that I\u2019m running, a campaign that reaches out to everybody, a campaign that offers real positive solutions to the problems that we face, a campaign that is based on how together we can make progress, because I am a progressive who likes to get things done.So I\u2019m excited about the upcoming contests, including right here in Florida. And we\u2019ll continue to work as hard as I can to earn the vote of every single voter.(APPLAUSE)(APPLAUSE)And I think in the coming weeks and months, we are going to continue to do extremely well, win a number of these primaries, and convince superdelegates that Bernie Sanders is the strongest candidate to defeat Donald Trump.(APPLAUSE)That goes against a memo that you personally sent to your employees in 2011 directing all of them to use official email, precisely because of security concerns. So it seems that you issued one set of rules for yourself and a different set of rules for the rest of the State Department.So who specifically gave you permission to operate your email system as you did? Was it President Barack Obama? And would you drop out of the race if you get indicted?And some other parts of the government, we\u2019re not exactly sure who, has concluded that some of the emails should be now retroactively classified. They\u2019ve just said the same thing to former Secretary Colin Powell. They have said, we\u2019re going to retroactively classify emails you sent personally.CLINTON: Now I think he was right when he said this is an absurdity. And I think that what we have got here is a case of overclassification.(APPLAUSE)(APPLAUSE)When he was engaging in rhetoric that I found deeply offensive. I said basta (ph), and I am pleased that others... (APPLAUSE)(APPLAUSE)I\u2019m not going to engage in the kind of language that he uses. I think we can make the case against him if he is the nominee, by pointing out what he has said. What he claims to believe in The values he\u2019s promoting and I think that\u2019s a better way for the American people to draw their conclusions.(APPLAUSE)(APPLAUSE)(APPLAUSE)Maria Elena?So, are you flip-flopping on this issue? Or are you pandering to Latinos, what some would call Hispandering?(LAUGHTER)I think our best chance was in 2007, when Ted Kennedy led the charge on comprehensive immigration reform. We have Republican support. We had a president willing to sign it. I voted for that bill. Senator Sanders voted against it.Just think, imagine where we would be today is we had achieved comprehensive immigration reform nine years ago. Imagine how much more secure families would be in our country, no longer fearing the deportation of a loved one; no longer fearing that they would be found out.So I am staunchly in favor of comprehensive immigration reform and have been so over the course of my public career.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)(END VIDEO CLIP)(CROSSTALK)Of course, that type of (inaudible) leads to a race to the bottom for all of our people. And I worked very hard on that issue. And of course, I supported the 2013 immigration reform bill. And what I believe right now is not only that we need comprehensive immigration reform, if the Congress does not do its job, as president of the United States I will use the executive powers of that office to do what has to be done, to do what President Obama did, and expand on that.(APPLAUSE)... if you\u2019re saying that you would expand on the executive actions, how do you that they\u2019re not going to end up in a legal battle just like Obama\u2019s executive actions?But to your point, we have to do the best we can. I applaud President Obama for his efforts on DAPA and DACA. And I think we have got to expand those efforts.(APPLAUSE) You know, I think it\u2019s very hard to make the case that Ted Kennedy, Barack Obama, me, La Raza, United Farmworkers, Dolores Huerta, leaders of the Latino community, would have supported a bill that actually promoted modern slavery. That was one of the many excuses used not to vote for the 2007 bill.And I will go back to what I said. If we had been able to get that passed, we would be so much further along now. I\u2019m committed to defending DAPA and DACA. I\u2019m committed to going even further to get more people deferred action, to go as far as I can under the law. And I am committed to introducing comprehensive immigration reform with a path to citizenship in the first 100 days of my presidency.SALINAS: Secretary Sanders (sic). Senator, would you like to respond?(APPLAUSE)When we talk about immigration, the secretary will remember that one of the great tragedies, human tragedies of recent years is children came from Honduras where there\u2019s probably more violence than almost any place in this country, and they came into this country. And I said welcome those children into this country, Secretary Clinton said send them back. That\u2019s a difference.First of all, that is something that is not fair about what I said. I did say we needed to be very concerned about little children coming to this country \u2014 on their own, very often \u2014 many of them not making it. And when they got here, they needed, as I have argued for, legal counsel, due process, to make a decision. We need to end private detention, we need to end family detention.And in 2006, when Senator Sanders was running for the Senate from Vermont, he voted in the House with hard-line Republicans for indefinite detention for undocumented immigrants, and then he sided with those Republicans to stand with vigilantes known as Minute Men who were taking up outposts along the border to hunt down immigrants.So I think when you were running for the Senate, you made it clear by your vote, Senator, that you were going to stand with the Republicans. When you got to the Senate in 2007, one of the first things you did was vote against Ted Kennedy\u2019s immigration reform which he\u2019d been working on for years before you ever arrived.(APPLAUSE)(APPLAUSE)And I went there on my own. Wasn\u2019t an issue really for the state of Vermont to expose the horrendous working conditions and the semi slavery, if you like, that those workers lived under. And the result of that hearing and the work that many, many people did was to significantly improve the wages and working conditions of those workers.(APPLAUSE)RAMOS (through translator): So this is the moment of talking about deportations. We\u2019re going to immigrants.SALINAS (through translator): (inaudible) Facebook page (inaudible). Tell us what you think of the debate in the comment section. We will come back after the break.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)RAMOS (through translator): We\u2019re back to the Democratic debate.Secretary Clinton, the last time we talked in January, in Iowa, I asked you if you could be the next deporting chief. And you told me, no, that you wouldn\u2019t be the next deporter in chief. However, you refused two times to say you would not deport children. This is what you said.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)(END VIDEO CLIP)(APPLAUSE)(APPLAUSE)Secretary Clinton did not support those children coming into this country. I did.Now I happen to agree with President Obama on many, many issues. I think he has done a great job as president of the United States. He is wrong on this issue of deportation. I disagree with him on that.(APPLAUSE)(APPLAUSE)When I was secretary of state, I worked to try to support many different approaches to ending the violence in Central America. I was there meeting with leaders, security leaders, and others. And I think the Congress should support the president\u2019s request to fund programs that would protect people and change the culture of criminality and violence in Central America, helping people be able to stay safely in their homes and countries.(APPLAUSE)And I worked very hard in improving the guest worker provisions so that in 2013 a bill I strongly supported, people who were in the guest worker program in America would not be treated like slaves. (APPLAUSE)They have proven to be right in the succeeding years. I only hope that we can put together a coalition to pass comprehensive immigration reform in the next Congress. And as I said earlier, in 2006, Senator Sanders supported indefinite detention for people facing deportation...So look, I think the goal here is to elect a Democratic Senate, elect a Democratic president and get to work immediately to get comprehensive immigration reform.(APPLAUSE)No, I did not oppose the bailout or the support of the automobile industry. No, I do not support vigilantes, and that is a horrific statement, an unfair statement to make.(APPLAUSE)I will stand (inaudible) of my career, political career fighting for workers, fighting for the poorest people in this country. Madame Secretary, I will match my record against yours any day of the week. (APPLAUSE)A month later, in January, a new piece of legislation was offered that contained the money that would be used for the auto rescue. Then President-elect Obama \u2014 before he\u2019d even been sworn in \u2014 sent word to all of us that he really hoped we would support it. He was still in the Senate, I was still in the Senate.And I voted for it. It was a hard vote. I\u2019ll tell you, it was a hard vote. A lot of the votes you make are hard votes. But the fact is the money that rescued the auto industry was in that bill.(APPLAUSE)(APPLAUSE)And I find it interesting that when Secretary Clinton, who was the former senator of New York, of course, when she defended her vote, she said, well, it\u2019s going to help the big banks in New York. Those are my constituents. And then you go to Detroit and suddenly this legislation helps the automobile workers. There was an article just yesterday...(APPLAUSE)Next question. Secretary Clinton, you recently said instead of building walls we need to tear down barriers. However, last November in New Hampshire, you openly said that as senator you voted numerous times to build the wall with Mexico. What\u2019s the difference between what you did, voting to build the wall, and what Donald Trump wants to do now?Apprehensions coming across the border are the lowest they\u2019ve been in 40 years, which just strengthens my argument that now it\u2019s time to do comprehensive immigration reform. CLINTON: The Republicans, the opponents no longer have an argument. And certainly, we hear a lot coming from the Republican side that is absolutely out of touch with reality. We raised money through the congressional appropriations process. We enhanced the border security. That part of the work is done.Everybody that I know has looked at it said, okay, we have a secure border. There\u2019s no need for this rhetoric and demagoguery that\u2019s still \u2014is carried out on the Republican side. You\u2019ve run out of excuses. Let\u2019s move to comprehensive immigration reform with a path to citizenship. And I think that makes a very strong argument in favor of doing it.(LAUGHTER)Right? A beautiful tall wall. The most beautiful tall wall, better than the Great Wall of China, that would run the entire border. That he would somehow magically get the Mexican government to pay for. And, you know, it\u2019s just fantasy. And in fact, if he cared to know anything about what members of Congress, like the senator and I have done, where it was necessary, we did support some fencing.Where it was necessary, we did add border patrol agents. We have done what by any fair estimate would have to conclude is a good job, quote, \u201csecuring the border\u201d. So let\u2019s get about the business of comprehensive immigration reform.(APPLAUSE)But to answer your question, the essence of what we are trying to do is to unite families, not to divide families.(APPLAUSE)That is beyond comprehension and policies that should not be allowed to exist. So, ma\u2019am, I will do everything that I can to unite your family. Your children deserve to be with their mother.(APPLAUSE)You are doing your very best to support your children. But it is time to bring families together. And I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any doubt that we must do more to let stories like yours be heard more widely so that more Americans know what the human cost of these policies are.And I will do everything I can to prevent other families from facing what you are facing. And I will do everything I can to pass laws that would bring families back together. And I hope that your children are all either citizens born in this country or eligible for the programs that President Obama has put into place, DACA and DAPA, because I will defend those and I will absolutely protect your children, yourself, and try to bring your family back together.(APPLAUSE)Secretary Clinton, they are U.S. citizens (inaudible).(APPLAUSE)Thank you.Now let\u2019s go back to Karen.Secretary Clinton, a Washington Post poll just yesterday found that only 37 percent of Americans consider you honest and trustworthy. Now, when you\u2019ve been asked about this in the past, you have said that this is the result of many, many years of Republican attacks upon you. But Americans have also had 25 \u2014 more than that \u2014 years to get to know you for themselves.Is there anything in your own actions and the decisions that you yourself have made that would foster this kind of mistrust?And I also have, you know, very much committed to the best of my ability my energies and efforts to helping people. That\u2019s something that I care deeply about. And I will continue to do that, to demonstrate by my past actions and my present levels of commitment and plans that people can count on me.That is certainly what happened to me in New York, where people got to know me. They saw me in action. And they did.Look, I have said before and it won\u2019t surprise anybody to hear me say it, this is not easy for me. It\u2019s not easy to do what I think is right, to help people, to even the odds, to hear a story like the woman\u2019s story we just heard. And to know that I can make a difference and I want to in every way possible.I am not a natural politician, in case you haven\u2019t noticed, like my husband or President Obama. So I have a view that I just have to do the best I can, get the results I can, make a difference in people\u2019s lives, and hope that people see that I\u2019m fighting for them and that I can improve conditions economically and other ways that will benefit them and their families.(APPLAUSE)Senator Sanders, you have demanded that Secretary Clinton release the transcripts of her paid Wall Street speeches. Why is this important? Do you have reason to believe that she says one thing in private and another in public?SANDERS: Well, what I have said is that when you get I believe it is $225,000 for giving a speech, and she gave several speeches to Goldman Sachs, one of the Wall Street financial institutions whose greed and illegal behavior helped destroy our economy a number of years ago, when you get paid $225,000, that means that that speech must have been an extraordinarily wonderful speech.(APPLAUSE)(LAUGHTER)(APPLAUSE)(CROSSTALK)(APPLAUSE)Now, the secretary says it doesn\u2019t influence her. Well, that\u2019s what every politician says who gets money from special interests.(APPLAUSE)(APPLAUSE)I went to the Orlando area during the \u201908 campaign to make the same case, visiting with families who had been defrauded by mortgages, these subprime mortgages that put them and their homes at risk.(APPLAUSE)(APPLAUSE)(APPLAUSE)(BOOING)(CROSSTALK)(LAUGHTER)(APPLAUSE)(APPLAUSE)But they did just put up a little video praising you for being the only Democrat who stood with the Republicans to try to eliminate the Export/Import Bank, which has helped hundreds and hundreds of companies here in Florida be able to export their goods and employ more Floridians. So from my perspective, you sided with the Koch brothers.(APPLAUSE)(APPLAUSE)(BOOING)(BOOING)(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)(END VIDEO CLIP)I and everybody in the administration, all the people she named, the president, the vice president, Susan Rice, we were scrambling to get information that was changing, literally by the hour. And when we had information, we made it public. But then sometimes we had to go back and say we have new information that contradicts it.So I testified for 11 hours.(APPLAUSE)And this is not the first time we lost Americans in a terrorist attack. We lost 3,000 people on 9/11. We lost Americans serving in embassies in Tanzania and Kenya when my husband was president. We lost 250 Americans, both military and civilian, when Ronald Reagan was president in Beirut.And at no other time were those tragedies were they politicized(APPLAUSE).(APPLAUSE)We have captured one of the lead terrorists and he admits it was both a terrorist attack and it was influenced by the video. This was fog of war. This was complicated. The most effective, comprehensive reports and studies demonstrate that.Look, as I said in the beginning, I deeply regret that we lost four Americans.And I wish that there could be an easy answer at the time, but we learned a lot, and the intelligence kept...Gadhafi was a brutal dictator, there\u2019s no question. But one of the differences between the secretary and I is I\u2019m not quite so aggressive with regard to regime change. I voted against the war in Iraq because I had a fear of what would happen the day after.(APPLAUSE)And Secretary Clinton talks about Henry Kissinger...(APPLAUSE)We\u2019re taking a break. (through translator) We\u2019ll continue with topics that are of interest to Spanish (inaudible) education, what to do with student debt. Two topics that we will deal in a moment in the Democratic debate.RAMOS (through translator): We remind you that you can download (inaudible) and we\u2019ll come back with the Democratic presidential debate.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)(UNKNOWN) (through translator): And we continue now, connected with Univision for you to send us (inaudible) first Democratic debate focusing in Hispanic topics. I have (inaudible) that supported (inaudible).Good evening, good evening.We heard a lot about immigration, about the deportations and race. In your opinion, who (inaudible) better and who presented the immigration proposal?The six months \u2014 that we have seen as immigration is concerned, and we see that they\u2019re moving towards. The community needs to not only immigration reform, but the raids have to stop. Families that we have seen that are suffering, they have to be reunited.(UNKNOWN) (through translator): We heard very emotional testimony of a mother that was brave enough to come here with her five children. How did you feel when you heard her story? And do you think that the candidates had empathy with the story?And this is what we see that is happening, that Republicans are doing not \u2014 by not approving a migratory reform, but also President Obama. So we need \u2014 we need not only words, but plans as well. And we need as a community to both stand up and support women as her.(UNKNOWN) (through translator): Thank you, Gabby (ph), and now the debate \u2014 the Democratic debate continues with Jorge Ramos and Maria Elena Salinas. Thank you.We\u2019ll continue with the debate now.Senator Sanders, you call your opponent Hillary Clinton an establishment politician. You yourself are a career politician. Why should voters prefer a career politicians over an establishment politician?I don\u2019t take money from the pharmaceutical industry because I believe they are ripping off the American people and charging us the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs.(APPLAUSE)I don\u2019t take money from the fossil fuel industry because they are destroying \u2014 they are destroying this planet through their emissions of carbon and creating the terrible climate change that we are seeing.So I think it is true that I have served in Congress for many years. But if you check my record, it is a record of strength for the environment, for workers, for seniors. Unlike the secretary, I believe we should expand Social Security benefits. It is a record of achievement for veterans, working with Republicans, helping to craft the most significant veterans healthcare bill passed in many decades.So I think the point is look at the record, and it\u2019s a record that I am proud of.(APPLAUSE)So, last week you tweeted that for the GOP, the economy is an after thought. Well, many Latinos feel that they are an after thought. Do you understand what the specific needs of Latinos are to improve their living conditions?And there are several things that need to be addressed. We do have to do more infrastructure spending. That will put many Americans to work. It\u2019s a good job that gets you on the ladder to the middle class. We need to improve the conditions for manufacturing in our country and punish those companies that want to export jobs. We need them to be incentivized to create jobs right here in America.We also do have to combat climate change, and no state has more at stake in that than Florida. And the best way to do that is not only enforcing the laws we have, but also the clean power plan that President Obama has put forth that I support, and the Paris agreement that I think was a huge step forward in the world, that Senator Sanders said was too weak, but I helped to lay the groundwork for that.CLINTON: But we need more clean energy jobs and we have to do more to help small businesses. You know, the fastest-growing segment of small businesses are minority and women-owned small business, and we need to help businesses get started.The very distinguished congresswoman from New York who\u2019s been on the Small Business Committee, Congresswoman Velasquez, knows exactly what we need to be doing to create more small businesses. We do need to raise the minimum wage and we have to guarantee equal pay for women.(APPLAUSE)Every child deserves a good teacher in a good school, regardless of the zip code that they live in. Following behind that is health care and how important it is to continue to build on the Affordable Care Act and provide access to health care. And then there are a number of other issues \u2014 comprehensive immigration reform certainly at the top.(LAUGHTER)One of the points that I\u2019ve been making, and media does not seem to pick up on it, is that we have a real crisis not only with real unemployment in America being close to 10 percent, but youth unemployment in this country.If you look at Latino kids between 17 and 20 who graduated high school, 36 percent of them are unemployed or underemployed...(APPLAUSE)We have got to raise the minimum wage to $15 an hour. The United States has got to join the rest of the industrialized world in guaranteeing health care to all people as a right.(APPLAUSE)We need to rebuild our crumbling infrastructure. And when we do that, under my plan, we create 13 million decent-paying jobs.(APPLAUSE)(APPLAUSE)We have got to go beyond first grade to 12th grade when we talk about public education.(APPLAUSE)So I do believe we should make public colleges and universities tuition-free, and I don\u2019t believe we should punish millions of young and not-so-young people with outrageous levels of student debt.The point is we are going to get to Donald Trump by raising the taxes on the top 1 percent and our millionaires and billionaires. But all of our people, in my view, regardless of income, should have a right to get a higher education. I want children in the third grade to know that if they study hard, no matter what the income of their families, my family didn\u2019t have any income, my parents didn\u2019t go to college, they didn\u2019t have good income. I want every kid to know if you do your school work, study hard, yes, you will be able to get a college education. (APPLAUSE)(APPLAUSE)And you can refinance your house to get a lower interest rate. You can refinance your car. Corporations can refinance their debt. Under my plan, you will be able to also lower your debt, move into a program to pay it back as a percentage of your income and more than that, my plan for debt-free tuition at public colleges and universities will eventually eliminate any student debt.But for people who have it, I\u2019m going to put a date certain that after a certain number of years, you no longer have to pay anything. The government has to quit making money off of lending money to young people to get their education.(APPLAUSE)(APPLAUSE)You know how I\u2019m going to pay for it? I\u2019m going to pay for it by imposing a tax on Wall Street speculation.(APPLAUSE)So, the Treasury was out nothing. Now that will no longer happen because we have Dodd-Frank and we will break up banks that pose a systemic threat to our economy.(APPLAUSE)And a lot of the answers say that this is going to be much more expensive than anything Senator Sanders is admitting to. This is going to increase the federal government dramatically. And, you know, my dad used to say, if it sounds too good to be true, it probably is.(APPLAUSE)(APPLAUSE)You may not think the American people are prepared to stand up to the insurance companies or the drug companies. I think they are. And I think we can pass...(APPLAUSE)But I just respectfully disagree. Between the Republicans trying to repeal the first chance we\u2019ve ever had to get to universal health care, and Senator Sanders wanting to throw us into a contentious debate over single-payer, I think the smart approach is build on and protect the Affordable Care Act. Make it work. Reduce the cost.(APPLAUSE)Many of you may have insurance, but you have outrageously high deductibles and co-payments. One out of five Americans cannot afford the prescription drugs their doctors prescribe. Elderly people are cutting their pills in half.I do believe that we should do what every other major country on earth does, and I think when the American people stand up and fight back, yes, we can have it, a Medicare for all health care system.(APPLAUSE)(APPLAUSE)Senator Sanders, is it possible to move forward on this issue if you do not get a bipartisan consensus, and what would you do?(APPLAUSE)(APPLAUSE)(APPLAUSE)You can see already what\u2019s happening in Miami, particularly in Miami Beach with tides rising. So we do have to invest in resilience and mitigation while we are trying to cut emissions and make up for the fact that this is clearly man-made and man-aggravated. CLINTON: And there are certain things that the president has done through executive action that I will absolutely support. All the Republican say they will, if they\u2019re elected, heaven forbid, repeal all of those executive actions. I will maintain them and act on them.The clean power plan is something that Senator Sanders has said he would delay implementing, which makes absolutely no sense. We need to implement all of the president\u2019s executive actions and quickly move to make a bridge from coal to natural gas to clean energy.That is the way we will keep the lights on while we are transitioning to a clean energy future. And when I talk about resilience, I think that is an area we can get Republican support on.(CROSSTALK)(CROSSTALK)(APPLAUSE)(CROSSTALK)(APPLAUSE)Let\u2019s be clear. You\u2019re looking at the senator who introduced the most comprehensive climate change legislation in the history of the United States Senate.(APPLAUSE)Now, I hope that Secretary Clinton would join me if we are serious about climate change, about imposing a tax on carbon on the fossil fuel industry and making massive investments in energy efficiency and sustainable energy. And by the way, while we are on the subject of energy, I hope you\u2019ll join me in ending fracking in the United States of America.(APPLAUSE)(CROSSTALK)Three of the last four Treasury secretaries appointed by Democratic presidents had ties to Citigroup. Do you agree with Elizabeth Warren\u2019s criticism that both your husband\u2019s administration and President Obama\u2019s have relied too heavily on advisers who represent the world view of the big banks?But I think it\u2019s important also to look at what we want to accomplish. You know, in the debates we\u2019ve had \u2014 maybe this is the seventh or so \u2014 Senator Sanders is always criticizing the two recent Democratic presidents \u2014 President Clinton and President Obama. And that\u2019s fine, but I wish he would criticize and join me in criticizing George W. Bush, who I think wrecked the economy and created the conditions for the great recession. You know, at the end of the \u201990s, we had 23 million new jobs. Incomes went up for everybody. We were talking earlier about what needs to be done for Latinos and African Americans. Well, we were doing it by the end of the \u201990s. Median family income went up 17 percent. For minorities, it went up even more.Along came the Republicans, trickle-down economics \u2014 one of the worst ideas since snake oil \u2014 was put back into place. And we ended up with the great recession. President Obama had to rescue the economy. And I don\u2019t think he gets the credit he deserves for doing that.(APPLAUSE)(LAUGHTER)Or followed my work in the Congress as very few people stood up to George W. Bush whether it was the war in Iraq or any other of his policies.(LAUGHTER)Now, when we talk about the policies of the 1990s, I worked closely and supported President Clinton. And obviously, I have worked very closely in supporting President Obama, who has taken our economy a very long way from where Bush left us.SANDERS: But when you go back to the 1990s, let\u2019s remember, that\u2019s when Wall Street deregulation took place.(APPLAUSE)(COMMERCIAL BREAK)(UNKNOWN) (through translator): We continue with the Democratic debate.Secretary Clinton and Senator Sanders, it will be my welcome to Miami question. So it goes as follows. President Barack Obama is going to Cuba in two weeks. Forty percent of Cuban Americans supporting to uphold \u2014 oppose a new White House policy towards Cuba.If you were president, would you meet with the dissidents in Cuba? Would you meet with Fidel Castro? And would you consider Raul Castro a president or a dictator? Welcome to Miami.So the more that we can have that kind of movement back and forth, the more likely we are to be able to move Cuba toward greater freedom, greater respect for rights.You know, I\u2019m looking forward to following the president\u2019s trip. I do think meeting with dissidents, meeting with people who have been voices, tribunes of freedom and opportunity is important.The Cuban people deserve to have their human rights respected and upheld, they deserve to be able to move towards democracy where they pick their own leads. And I think both Castros have to be considered authoritarian and dictatorial because they are not freely chosen by the people that are in Cuba.(APPLAUSE)I hope someday there will be leaders who are chosen by the Cuban people, and I hope that democracy will be deeply rooted in Cuban soil and that the people of Cuba will have every opportunity to fulfill their own dreams in their own country. That is my hope.(APPLAUSE)I believe that we should move towards full and normalized political relations with Cuba. I think at the end of the day, it will be a good thing for the Cuban people. It will enable them, I think when they see people coming into their country from the United States, move in a more democratic direction, which is what I want to see. So right \u2014 I\u2019m sorry.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)(END VIDEOTAPE)Throughout the history of our relationship with Latin America we\u2019ve operated under the so-called Monroe Doctrine, and that said the United States had the right do anything that they wanted to do in Latin America. So I actually went to Nicaragua and I very shortly opposed the Reagan administration\u2019s efforts to overthrow that government. And I strongly opposed earlier Henry Kissinger and the \u2014 to overthrow the government of Salvador Aliende (ph) in Chile.I think the United States should be working with governments around the world, not get involved in regime change. And all of these actions, by the way, in Latin America, brought forth a lot of very strong anti-American sentiments. That\u2019s what that was about.(APPLAUSE)...on the other hands, it would be wrong not to state that in Cuba they have made some good advances in health care. They are sending doctors all over the world. They have made some progress in education. I think by restoring full diplomatic relations with Cuba, it will result in significant improvements to the lives of Cubans and it will help the United States and our business community invest.(APPLAUSE)And what we see in Puerto Rico now is a lot of suffering. We see schools being closed, we see health care being denied and we see a thousand Puerto Rican families a month moving to the United States, mostly to Florida.Puerto Ricans are citizen of America.(APPLAUSE)I just couldn\u2019t disagree more. You know, if the values are that you oppress people, you disappear people, you imprison people or even kill people for expressing their opinions, for expressing freedom of speech, that is not the kind of revolution of values that I ever want to see anywhere.(APPLAUSE)And many of the bonds that they are paying off were purchased by vulture capitalists for 30 cents on the dollar. And what I have said in talking to the leaders of Puerto Rico, we\u2019ve got to bring people together. And it\u2019s not the people of Puerto Rico, or the children or the schools.Secretary Clinton, there is a vacancy on the supreme court at a very crucial moment. Among other things, the court is considering the most significant abortion restrictions in a generation.So I would like to share with you a question that we got from Facebook from Joshua Dansby, a law student in Washington, D.C. who wants to know what specific forms of qualifications you would look for in a Supreme Court justice?(APPLAUSE)(APPLAUSE)(APPLAUSE)And understand the balance of power that their decisions can disrupt one way or the other. So clearly, I would look for people who believe that Roe v. Wade is settled law and that Citizens United needs to be overturned as quickly as possible. (APPLAUSE)(CROSSTALK)SALINAS (through translator): We go to a commercial. And when we come back, conclusions (inaudible).RAMOS (through translator): (inaudible) which has heads of space and it\u2019s the candidates to the presidents (inaudible) that are the (inaudible).(COMMERCIAL BREAK)SALINAS (through translator): We come back with the Democratic debate, sponsored by Univision, Washington Post and Facebook. We are reaching the end, asking the candidates to give their last words.Secretary Clinton, you\u2019re first.So I am going to take on those economic barriers. I have a plan to create jobs and raise incomes. I\u2019m going to take on the education barriers that often leave too many children behind even after they have completed schooling. I\u2019m going to take on the healthcare barriers.I\u2019m going to do everything I can to make sure that we unite our country. I will find common ground, just as I have as first lady, as senator and secretary of state. I will also stand my ground wherever matters of principles are at stake.CLINTON: I would be honored to have your support in the upcoming primary on Tuesday, and hope to have the great honor of serving you as your president.(APPLAUSE)Is it acceptable that Wall Street and billionaires are spending hundreds of millions of dollars trying to buy elections? Is that democracy or this that oligarchy? Which is why I believe we\u2019ve got to overturn Citizens United and move to public funding of elections.Is it right that in the greatest, wealthiest country in the history of the world, so many of our young people can\u2019t even afford to go to college or leave school deeply in debt, in the wealthiest country in the history of the world? If we stand up, fight back, we can do a lot better. That\u2019s why I\u2019m running for president.(APPLAUSE)(APPLAUSE)RAMOS (through translator): We want to use these last moments, it\u2019s very important to go out and vote, remember next Tuesday, March 15th is elections in Florida, Illinois, Missouri, North Carolina, Ohio, all these states \u2014 in all these states the Hispanic vote is crucial (INAUDIBLE). Talk about the importance of Hispanic votes, how in very close races it is the Hispanic vote that can choose the next president of the United States. This is Hispanic power, but the only way that this can happen is if we all go out and vote.So you know it perfectly, who does not vote doesn\u2019t count.SALINAS (through translator): And as you know, nobody can reach the White House without the Hispanic vote. Remember, don\u2019t let others decide for you. The power is in your hands, you have to participate, you have to vote. Thank you for being with us this evening and thank you for trusting in Univision. Good evening.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "A Father, a Son, a Disease, and a Camera", "Date": "2018-01-18", "News": "The sun showed no mercy, yet the asparagus workers kept bending, squatting and digging as if their lives depended on it.All hailed from other countries; Poland and Romania, mostly. In classic migrant-worker tradition, after the picking season they would go home or move on to the next country. Also traditional: the lousy pay, 27 to 57 cents per kilogram of asparagus. As Mr. Villegas chatted with the workers, taking photos with no particular end in mind, one scene, one image, \u00e2\u0080\u009cmarked\u00e2\u0080\u009d him.The photo captures a group of workers in an asparagus field, bare-chested in the blistering heat, with one in the foreground stripped down to his briefs. It demonstrates the grit and determination of these laborers, who put in 10-hour days, seven days a week, no matter what, all season long. The photo also touches the viewer and raises questions.\u00e2\u0080\u009cSince that photo,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Villegas said, \u00e2\u0080\u009ca concern for those people started, a wanting to know more about them.\u00e2\u0080\u009dSix years later, Mr. Villegas used that image to begin \u00e2\u0080\u009cWorking Far Away,\u00e2\u0080\u009d which documents the public and private lives of seasonal workers in several countries and continents. He has followed asparagus workers in several towns in Germany and found their families in towns and cities in Romania. He has also documented Polish sheep shearers and olive workers from Morocco, Senegal and other countries working in several towns in Spain. Next on his list: France and Finland.It took six years to start the project, said Mr. Villegas, who lives where he studied photography, in Hannover, to establish himself. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI needed to start a life in Germany,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cSo I set aside that topic but always with that photo in my mind, knowing one day I would pick up the subject.\u00e2\u0080\u009dPhotographers have been documenting the plight of seasonal workers for decades. Yet any attention the workers receive tends to be quickly forgotten. Immigrant workers, especially, who leave their countries for backbreaking work that few in the host countries is willing to do, remain in society\u00e2\u0080\u0099s peripheral vision. At best, they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re ignored. At worst, they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re vilified as criminals. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWorking Far Away\u00e2\u0080\u009d aims to dispel the stereotypes.\u00e2\u0080\u009cI think that mainly I aim to shatter that idea of \u00e2\u0080\u0098We don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t need immigrants in our country, they steal our job opportunities,\u2019\u200a\u00e2\u0080\u0099\u00e2\u0080\u0099 Mr. Villegas said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cFor instance, in Germany, there are few locals that apply for the asparagus season. For them it represents a big physical effort that is not worth the payment. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s why there are only immigrants in the fields.\u00e2\u0080\u009dThe seasonal workers in Spain are having a harder time. The country\u00e2\u0080\u0099s recession has led desperate local residents to take farm jobs they once shunned. A striking image of a Senegalese worker, drenched in sweat, as he hauls nets used for olives in Jaen reminds us that luck is relative. This worker, the father of three girls, has managed to secure a contract during the harvest for eight years.The unluckiest brave the long and dangerous journey to Spain only to find the work no longer exists. One man sits at a train terminal, saddled with bags and luggage and weariness as he waits for uncertainty in the next town.\u00e2\u0080\u009cWorking Far Away,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Villegas expects, will take years to complete. \u00e2\u0080\u009cSeasonal workers are everywhere,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cand my original purpose was to document as many countries as I could in different continents. But one thing at a time. This is a very difficult project to carry out, financially speaking.\u00e2\u0080\u009dHe plans spend to finish the European part of the project by the end of this year. Then, \u00e2\u0080\u009cideally,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI would like to continue in America.\u00e2\u0080\u009d"}
{"Headline": "SXSW Addresses Online Harassment of Women in Gaming", "Date": "2016-03-13", "News": "Supported byBitsAUSTIN, Tex. \u2014 Brianna Wu, a prominent video game developer, is no stranger to threats against her life.In a panel at the South by Southwest conference here on Saturday, she held up a picture of an Internet troll in a skeleton mask. This person, whose identity remains anonymous, sent Ms. Wu a message claiming he wanted to end her life by putting a drill to her forehead.\u201cThe abuse that I\u2019ve undergone has been extreme,\u201d she said, adding that her husband and dog had both been threatened as well.The experiences of Ms. Wu, who works for the gaming studio Giant Spacekat, are not an anomaly. Other women in the gaming community have faced similar online harassment, which, they say, goes far beyond name calling and has moved into the realm of violent threats and rampant misogyny.Much of it has centered on the games industry and is associated with a grass-roots movement called \u201c#GamerGate,\u201d a term used by a group of people who are fighting against what they say are unfair portrayals of video game enthusiasts as anti-feminists and misogynists.But, paradoxically, people associated with the movement have systematically targeted and attacked women online, including women like Ms. Wu and Anita Sarkeesian, a feminist cultural critic who focuses often on video games and game culture.At the summit\u2019s 15 panel discussions in the Hyatt Regency Austin downtown, security guards checked attendants\u2019 bags on the way into each room. A half-dozen police officers milled about in the hours before the events started, scanning the crowds for any potential problems. Each session was attended by a police officer who sat at the back of the ballroom surveying the crowd and looking for unattended bags.As part of a panel discussion called \u201cIs a Safer, Saner and Civil Internet Possible?\u201d Ms. Wu said she has had over 200 death threats in the past few years.She criticized some of the technology companies that acted as meeting hubs for GamerGate supporters \u2014 particularly YouTube and Reddit, the online message board \u2014 for not doing enough to take down offensive content when it was posted. Reddit does not require users to register real names or any other identifying information to use the site. It is a regular congregation spot for GamerGate activists.\u201cI can\u2019t say this clearly enough: Reddit is failing women in every marginalized community spectacularly,\u201d Ms. Wu said.Given the scale of these services, policing harassment is a mind-bogglingly large task. Some 1.6 billion people regularly use Facebook, while YouTube users upload about 400 hours of video every minute. Reddit, which has raised tens of millions of dollars in venture capital, sees hundreds of millions of regular monthly users and relies primarily on its users to police themselves.What is difficult for the companies is toeing the line between free speech \u2014 a value that many companies in Silicon Valley strongly support \u2014 and harassment, which can make the users of these networks feel unwelcome, unsafe or worse.Monika Bickert, Facebook\u2019s head of global policy management, says Facebook tries to distinguish between generalized vitriol and vitriol that is directed at a specific person.\u201cIf someone says, \u2018This country is terrible,\u2019 that\u2019s O.K.,\u201d she said. \u201cIf somebody says, \u2018The people of this nationality are evil,\u2019 that we will remove.\u201dBut beyond general harassment, a recurring theme across all the sessions \u2014 told through chilling anecdotes and statistics \u2014 was the extent to which online hatred is disproportionately directed toward women.And, indeed, women made up many of the attendees and panelists. They included video game developers, executives at companies like Google and Facebook as well as politicians like Representative Katherine Clark, Democrat of Massachusetts, and Wendy Davis, the former Texas state senator who ran as the Democratic candidate for governor in 2014.Representative Clark said she was proposing legislation that would increase training for law enforcement officials on investigating and prosecuting online harassment of women.The day\u2019s event ended without incident, but the issues were far from settled. While tech companies have tried much harder to tackle issues of online harassment than in the past \u2014 driven largely by the awareness of the GamerGate movement \u2014 they all still have a long way to go, Ms. Wu said.\u201cThere is this very wide discrepancy between what tech companies say they do and what the outcome is,\u201d she said.Conor Dougherty reported from Austin, Tex., and Mike Isaac from New York.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Bracing for Further Side Effects of an Increasingly Toxic Mix", "Date": "2016-03-28", "News": "In the past week, the Republican presidential primary has gone from the sober to the surreal. There is now a little over a week before a pivotal contest in Wisconsin, and the candidates will be focusing more and more attention on the state governed by Scott Walker, one of their former rivals. A week ago, four presidential candidates \u00e2\u0080\u0094 all except Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont \u00e2\u0080\u0094 gave speeches at the American Israel Public Affairs Committee meeting in Washington, pledging fealty to Israel. That was the sober moment. Within days came the surreal, as the focus of the Republican race shifted to Donald J. Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s attacks on the wife of his rival Ted Cruz, with a threat to \u00e2\u0080\u009cspill the beans\u00e2\u0080\u009d about her. Mr. Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s threat, posted on Twitter, came after a \u00e2\u0080\u009csuper PAC\u00e2\u0080\u009d that was created to stop Mr. Trump used an image in an ad in Utah of his wife, Melania, a former model, posing nude on his jet. Mr. Trump insisted that the group behind the ad was tied to Mr. Cruz, and criticized him for not disavowing the spot \u00e2\u0080\u0094 but the group is not tied to Mr. Cruz, and he did disavow it. Mr. Trump also resent a Twitter post of a side-by-side comparison featuring an unflattering photograph of Mrs. Cruz against one of Mrs. Trump. That type of broadside on a political spouse is unusual in any campaign, let alone one for president, and it left Republicans fearful, once again, of the harm that their front-runner\u00e2\u0080\u0099s comments about women could cause up and down the ballot in the fall. The week ended with Mr. Cruz denying a National Enquirer report that he had had affairs with five different women, and blaming Mr. Trump for the story. Mr. Trump denied that claim in his lone television interview on Sunday. All of this sets up a toxic mix for a race that was already tense. Elsewhere, Mr. Sanders had the best day of his presidential campaign, winning three caucuses and bringing his total in the week to five. Caucuses have been fertile territory for Mr. Sanders against Hillary Clinton, but there are only two such contests left on the calendar.The Republican race seems destined to get nastier this week, as the candidates take part in a town-hall-style event on CNN on Tuesday night and Mr. Trump faces new questions about his foreign policy views. On the Democratic side, Mr. Sanders has been pressing for an additional debate in New York, a wish that Mrs. Clinton\u00e2\u0080\u0099s team seems deeply reluctant to grant in a contest in which the senator has, mathematically, fallen far behind.\n\t\tFirst Draft provides fast-paced and comprehensive coverage of politics and elections by The New York Times.

{"Headline": "Republican Turmoil Has Historians Straining for Parallels", "Date": "2016-03-03", "News": "Mitt Romney\u00e2\u0080\u0099s political assault on Donald J. Trump on Thursday was so savage that historians strained to recall any precedent in American politics, with a major party\u2019s former nominee blistering his party\u00e2\u0080\u0099s leading presidential candidate in such a personal and sweeping fashion.Al Smith, who in 1928 was the governor of New York and the Democratic presidential nominee, later turned on Franklin D. Roosevelt during the New Deal and warned, much as Mr. Romney did on Thursday, that Roosevelt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s liberal policies would lead toward totalitarianism. In a high-profile 1936 speech before the American Liberty League, an anti-New Deal group, Smith offered a \u00e2\u0080\u009csolemn warning\u00e2\u0080\u009d that Americans must realize \u00e2\u0080\u009cthere can only be one capital \u00e2\u0080\u0093 Washington or Moscow.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00e2\u0080\u009cThere can only be one atmosphere of government, the clear, pure, fresh air of free America or the foul breath of communistic Russia,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Smith said.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cThere can be only one flag, the Stars and Stripes, or the red flag of the godless union of the Soviet.\u00e2\u0080\u009dSuggesting, much like Mr. Romney did of Mr. Trump, that Roosevelt was tarnishing a great party, Mr. Smith said of the president\u00e2\u0080\u0099s administration: \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt is all right with me if they want to disguise themselves as Norman Thomas or Karl Marx or Lenin, or any of the rest of that bunch, but what I won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t stand for is allowing them to march under the banner of Jefferson, Jackson or Cleveland.\u00e2\u0080\u009dBut for all his scorn, Mr. Smith avoided harsh personal attacks in 1936 against Roosevelt, his successor as New York governor and the man who placed Mr. Smith;\u2019s in nomination at the 1924 and 1928 Democratic presidential conventions.The closest comparison may be the sort of mean-spirited language Theodore Roosevelt used against William Howard Taft when the two Republicans and former friends ran against each other for president in 1912, a year that bought a party rupture some Republicans fear will happen again this year. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThere probably hasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t been this level of personal invective by one Republican nominee against another leading candidate ever, perhaps not even in 1912 when T.R. went after Taft,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said David Greenberg, a historian at Rutgers University.  Theodore Roosevelt, running a third-party campaign to reclaim the White House, attacked his hand-picked successor, Taft, the Republican nominee, as \u00e2\u0080\u009ca fathead\u00e2\u0080\u009d and \u00e2\u0080\u009ca dimwit\u00e2\u0080\u009d who had \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe brains of guinea pig.\u00e2\u0080\u009d But, Mr. Greenberg added, \u00e2\u0080\u009cit\u00e2\u0080\u0099s harder to gauge because we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re living in different times now and the discourse is different.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u201cYou would never see a four-letter word in the 1912 New York Times,\u201d he said.Michael Beschloss, the presidential historian, said Mr. Romney\u00e2\u0080\u0099s indictment was substantially more far-reaching and vicious than any he could recall.\u00e2\u0080\u009cMitt Romney\u2019s multi-front attack on Donald Trump\u2019s character, policies and career was far more eviscerating than earlier complaints against Presidential aspirants by earlier nominees of their party, such as Al Smith\u2019s against Franklin Roosevelt when Roosevelt ran for reelection in 1936 and Harry Truman\u2019s against John Kennedy two weeks before the 1960 Democratic convention,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Mr. Beschloss.Before Democrats convened in Los Angeles in 1960 to determine their nominee, Truman, the most recent Democratic president at the time, delivered a speech in which he appealed to Kennedy, who was then just 43.\u201cSenator, are you certain that you are quite ready for the country or that the country is ready for you in the role of president in January 1961?\u00e2\u0080\u009d asked Truman, adding: \u00e2\u0080\u009cMay I urge you be patient?\u201dTruman also indicated that he would not attend the convention because it looked like Kennedy supporters had made it a \u201cprearranged affair.\u00e2\u0080\u009dBut, as Mr. Beschloss noted, after Kennedy was nominated, Truman endorsed him and campaigned for him and the Democratic ticket that fall.    \u00e2\u0080\u009cTruman said that for him personally, a Democratic convention\u2019s decision constituted \u00e2\u0080\u0098the law,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 and that he would abide by it,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Beschloss recalled.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe vehemence of Romney\u2019s speech suggests that he is not likely to follow Truman\u2019s example.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\t\tFirst Draft provides fast-paced and comprehensive coverage of politics and elections by The New York Times.

He had been held overnight at a provisional detention center in S\u00e3o Paulo, awaiting transfer to the northeastern state of Sergipe.The federal police said the arrest was made because Facebook, which owns WhatsApp, repeatedly failed to comply with judicial orders.After the arrest, the company filed a habeas corpus petition that was reviewed and granted by a judge in Sergipe\u2019s highest state court early Wednesday, leading to Mr. Dzodan\u2019s release.That judge, Ruy Pinheiro, said he considered the arrest of Mr. Dzodan to be \u201can extreme measure,\u201d according to a court statement.Judge Pinheiro noted that the Facebook executive was not part of the police investigation. He said that \u201cno concrete proof\u201d existed that Mr. Dzodan had blocked or impeded the investigation.Wednesday\u2019s ruling in no way signals an end to the challenges Facebook and other Internet companies face here.Judge Pinheiro ruled only on whether it was appropriate to arrest and detain Mr. Dzodan, not on the merits of the larger judicial case for seeking user information from the company, according to a Sergipe court spokesman. The orders still stand, and Facebook could continue to face fines if it does not comply with them.Facebook continues to contend that it is not able to provide the requested information because WhatsApp does not store users\u2019 messages. It also increasingly has end-to-end encryption.In a statement, Facebook said, \u201cDiego\u2019s detention was an extreme, disproportionate measure, and we are pleased to see the court in Sergipe issue an injunction ordering his release.\u201dThe company called the arrest \u201ccapricious\u201d but said it was willing to cooperate with officials. \u201cWe remain willing to address questions Brazilian authorities may have,\u201d it said.Advertisement"}

On the Democratic side, Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont\u00e2\u0080\u0099s aides were vocal about plans to keep marching on, even after Hillary Clinton added significantly to her delegate lead with her four wins. His team insisted that there was still a path to the nomination and that the coming states would be stronger for him than for her.Privately, some of Mr. Sanders\u00e2\u0080\u0099s allies expressed frustration with the timing of President Obama\u00e2\u0080\u0099s announcement of his nominee to fill Justice Antonin Scalia\u00e2\u0080\u0099s seat on the Supreme Court.

{"Headline": "Silicon Valley Has Not Saved Us From a Productivity Slowdown", "Date": "2016-03-04", "News": "Supported byEconomic ViewAmerican middle class wages haven\u2019t been rising as rapidly as they once were, and a slowdown in productivity growth is probably an important cause.In mature economies, higher productivity typically is required for sustained increases in living standards, but the productivity numbers in the United States have been mediocre. Labor productivity has been growing at an average of only 1.3 percent annually since the start of 2005, compared with 2.8 percent annually in the preceding 10 years. Without somehow improving productivity growth, living standards will continue to lag, this widely held narrative concludes.Still, not everyone views the situation this way. For instance, Marc Andreessen, the Silicon Valley entrepreneur and venture capitalist, says information technology is providing significant benefits that just don\u2019t show up in the standard measurements of wages and productivity. Consider that consumers have access to services like Facebook, Google and Wikipedia free of charge, and those benefits aren\u2019t fully accounted for in the official numbers. This notion \u2014 that life is getting better, often in ways we are barely measuring \u2014 is fairly common in tech circles.Professor Syverson notes that a slowdown has come to dozens of advanced economies, more or less at the same time, which indicates it is a general phenomenon. Furthermore, the countries with smaller tech sectors still have comparably sized productivity slowdowns, and that is not what we would expect if a lot of unmeasured productivity were hiding in the tech industry.An additional problem for the optimistic interpretation is this: The productivity slowdown is too big in scale, relative to the size of the tech sector, to be plausibly compensated for by tech progress. Basically, under a conservative estimate, as outlined by Professor Syverson, the productivity slowdown has led to a cumulative loss of $2.7 trillion in gross domestic product since the end of 2004; that is how much more output would have been produced had the earlier rate of productivity growth been maintained. To make up for this difference, Professor Syverson estimates, consumer surplus (consumer benefits in excess of market price) would have to be five times as high as measured in the industries that produce and service information and communications technology. That seems implausibly large as a measurement gap.Keep in mind that while Facebook is free to its users, much of the tech industry consists of services that are measured and at least partly incorporated into G.D.P. For instance, the free Uber app arranges paid transportation. Even Facebook, Google and Wikipedia have a lot of their value expressed in G.D.P. figures, albeit indirectly. Those services make people eager to pay for smartphones, broadband connections and iPads, and those purchases are recorded as part of G.D.P.From this standpoint, the measurement problem isn\u2019t all that serious. It\u2019s like going to an all-you-can-eat restaurant buffet. The chicken may be free, but the presence of so many quality items induces customers to pay more for the overall bundle, and that registers as a sale, regardless of the price of the individual items you put on your plate. Also, some of the value of Google and Facebook comes from the advertisements, which induce many purchases, which again are recorded in the national statistics. Consumers pay for many apps as well.Or look at it this way: The tech economy just isn\u2019t big enough to account for the productivity gap. That gap has caused measured G.D.P. to be about 15 percent lower than it would have been otherwise, yet digital technology industries were only about 7.7 percent of G.D.P. in 2004. Even if the free component of the Internet has become more important since 2004, it\u2019s hard to imagine that it is so much better now that it accounts for such a big proportion of G.D.P.None of these remarks should be taken as a lack of appreciation for information technology. Arguably the Internet brought its biggest gains in the mid- to late 1990s, and in those years measured economic productivity was in fact very high. Information technology is still one of the most dynamic sectors of the American economy, and it probably will remain so, and grow yet more influential, even if its absolute impact is not as large as the optimistic revisionists suggest.That still leaves us with a big productivity problem. We need to acknowledge that while many Internet entrepreneurs are economic heroes, statisticians are also pretty good at what they do, and we may simply need to accept some of the lessons embedded in their numbers. America\u2019s productivity crisis is real and it is continuing. While information technology remains the most likely source of future breakthroughs, Silicon Valley has not saved us just yet.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Top Start-Up Investors Are Betting on Growth, Not Waiting for It", "Date": "2016-03-13", "News": "Supported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 For the last few years, the spotlight in start-up investing has largely shone on those who poured money into a company when it was already well along on a growth path. It turns out that spotlight may have been misdirected.While some investors are throwing giant sums into more mature start-ups like Uber and Airbnb at soaring valuations, it is the venture capitalists who identify a promising company at its infancy and bet on its growth who often come out on top.CB Insights generated the list using criteria such as how big a return an investor was able to produce when his or her investments went public or were acquired. CB Insights focused on the performance of investors since 2008 for the list.The idea that early-stage investors can generate much larger returns has long been a core principle of venture capital: Get in early and grab a bigger stake in a company, with more opportunity for a larger return later, the thinking goes.Early-stage investments have accounted for the lion\u2019s share of the venture industry\u2019s gains since 1994, according to Cambridge Associates, a research firm that studied the quarterly financial reports of dozens of venture firms. Since the dot-com boom of the late 1990s, between two-thirds and three-quarters of the industry\u2019s returns have been generated by early-stage investments in any given year.\u201cWhen you write bigger checks, it\u2019s more natural that people will notice,\u201d said Anand Sanwal, chief executive of CB Insights. In contrast, early-stage investing tends to involve smaller checks and puts an investor into just one of scores of start-ups, making it harder to stand out immediately.Rebecca Lynn, a managing director and co-founder of Canvas Ventures who is on the CB Insights list, said early-stage investments generally pay off more because \u201cinvestors can get more of an ownership stake and you\u2019re also part of the team.\u201dTo identify today\u2019s top venture investors, CB Insights, a research firm that tracks the venture capital industry, created a data-driven list.Yet there is more risk in early investing, since unproven start-ups can easily fail.Early-stage investing has changed in recent years. The top-returning venture-capital investments in any given year were once dominated by just a handful of brand name, early-stage venture firms. That has shifted: Over the last decade, new venture firms have contributed to an increasing share of the best investments, according to Cambridge Associates.From 2000 through 2012, 70 venture capital firms were each involved in at least one of the 10 deals that created the most value for investors. Before 2000, only 25 firms had invested in at least one top 10 deal, according to Cambridge Associates.Mr. Rimer said there was \u201cno question\u201d that \u201cthere are more folks putting money to work at earlier-stage investments than, say, 10 years ago.\u201dNew players have been successful partly because they have been more willing to put money into companies outside Silicon Valley, especially in China, where start-up success stories have been abundant over the last decade, Cambridge Associates said in a report last fall.That has benefited venture capitalists including Ms. Lee and Neil Shen of Sequoia Capital, who made names for themselves by investing early in Chinese start-ups that went public: Ms. Lee in the social network YY.com, and Mr. Shen in the Internet security company Qihoo 360. Mr. Shen is also on CB Insights\u2019 list of top 20 investors.\u201cThe tech market has massively expanded, and tech is now far more accessible all around the world,\u201d said Theresa Hajer, a managing director at Cambridge Associates.As more venture firms have snagged pieces of the top deals, more have also taken pieces of the return pool, lowering the overall gains for the venture industry as a whole. Before the dot-com bust of the early 2000s, huge returns of 25 times the original investment amount were the norm for the top investments. Since that period, it has been much rarer for the top investments in any given year to yield a 25-fold return, according to Cambridge Associates data.For the foundations, endowments and pension funds that have poured billions into venture capital funds, finding the right early-stage investor remains a challenge. Scott C. Malpass, the chief investment officer at the University of Notre Dame, said he could count on two hands the number of venture investors who could successfully identify which young start-ups would make the transition to lasting companies.\u201cI just want to be in the top two to three companies, not the top 100, because that\u2019s where the next Google or LinkedIn will be,\u201d Mr. Malpass said about his philosophy of working with early-stage venture capitalists. \u201cIt\u2019s still a home run game.\u201dNeal Graziano, director of investments at the W. K. Kellogg Foundation, an $8 billion nonprofit foundation that places money with venture investors, says three-quarters of his venture portfolio is invested with people who put money into companies at their earliest stages.\u201cYou see some of your worst performers in the early stages, but this is where you get your biggest investment returns,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Privacy and the iPhone", "Date": "2016-03-19", "News": "Supported byLettersReaders discuss the security issues raised in the clash between Apple and the government.The fact that Apple has won over much of the public \u2014 the same public that seems perfectly happy to have its daily activity, interests, opinions and contacts accessible to all the world \u2014 as well as most privacy advocates, who seem to have done little to stem the increasing corporate invasion of privacy, makes Apple\u2019s efforts to block access to Syed Farook\u2019s phone look like the marketing exercise that the Justice Department claims it is. And like most of Apple\u2019s marketing campaigns, it is a highly successful one. We have become a nation of sheep, and Silicon Valley is our shepherd.SAMUEL REIFLERRhinebeck, N.Y.To the Editor: When President Obama says \u201cI\u2019m confident this is something that we can solve,\u201d what he really means is \u201cI don\u2019t have a clue how to solve this.\u201d Neither do I. But here are three things I do know:1. Dear intelligence community: You reap what you sow. Maybe we would be more trusting if you hadn\u2019t broken the law by conducting sweeping data collection of American citizens and then lying to our faces about it. Just sayin\u2019.2. The F.B.I.\u2019s conduct in every aspect of the San Bernardino case has been rife with incompetence. If you\u2019re dumb enough to lock yourself out of the phone by changing the password, you\u2019re too inept to be trusted with an encryption key. Not to mention that you would eventually find a way to use it to spy on civil rights leaders. Again.3. Barack Obama\u2019s claiming to be a fierce defender of civil liberties is a knee slapper of epic proportions. But I doubt that all the journalists and whistle-blowers threatened with jail find it as funny as I do.EDWARD CRAFTWeston, Conn.To the Editor: The F.B.I. director, James Comey, has tried to frame this confrontation with Apple as a moral argument, but the National Security Agency, the F.B.I. and the C.I.A. have overdrawn that account, leaving the public to see that those agencies have no moral authority. Directors of those agencies have repeatedly lied to Congress and the American people about the extent of their interception of telephone calls and email. They have used Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act courts to get their requests rubber-stamped and then sequestered as secret.The federal agencies requesting access to private information have proven themselves reckless with the information they can access and gluttons for every bit they can find, whether useful or not. Thank goodness for Edward Snowden\u2019s disclosures and Timothy Cook\u2019s steadfast refusal to abet further intrusions into the privacy of American citizens.RON D\u2019ARCY-CLARKEShaker Heights, OhioTo the Editor: The debate over iPhone security really contains at least three separate questions.The first is the question that President Obama addressed last weekend: Can any information be outside the reach of duly warranted law enforcement? The answer to this must be no. Otherwise, every child pornographer and terrorist will have a safe haven in his iPhone, and Apple will become the host and protector of all the world\u2019s criminal communications.Next is the question of what degree of privacy law-abiding citizens can expect. The Fourth Amendment guarantees our privacy, but in a post-9/11, post-Snowden world, private citizens have reason to doubt that guarantee. We need to develop new law for our new circumstances, to give the government the power to maintain our security, while also ensuring our privacy.The most novel question is whether Apple should be enlisted to give the government access to iPhone data. This should be done only if the government is unable to reach it by its own devices. With today\u2019s extremely sophisticated coding, it may be that private companies will always remain a step ahead of government. The answer to this question may involve a partnership between government and private industry that the authors of the Fourth Amendment never foresaw.RON L. MEYERSNew YorkTo the Editor: The government is trying to make this all about the phone, but let\u2019s approach it from another angle. What about the guns the San Bernardino shooters used? Where would we be if those guns had all been registered, their movements tracked from factory to point of sale? What if we had better checks on buyer backgrounds? The government wants to get into my phone \u2014 but how about focusing on the guns?LARRY ROTHRavena, N.Y.To the Editor: Many people\u2019s reaction to the iPhone-encryption debate is to comfort themselves by thinking \u201cthe authorities aren\u2019t interested in me.\u201d This is largely true. But even if one has nothing to hide, pervasive surveillance is dangerous because we all need whistle-blowers. It\u2019s not about ordinary people with ordinary stuff on their phone; it\u2019s the chilling effect when an informant won\u2019t call a newspaper because he or she fears that the government is listening.We have repeatedly seen that surveillance always overreaches, from the F.B.I. spying on the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. to the revelations of Edward Snowden. Whenever the veil is pulled back, we see the government using any loophole to gather as much information as it technically can. President Obama\u2019s defense of surveillance boils down to \u201cyou can trust us not to abuse this power.\u201d History shows otherwise. And even if we can trust Mr. Obama\u2019s respect for the Constitution, his successors may not be so scrupulous.Until we have a transparent and clearly limited process for the government to break encryption, Americans should not accept the assurances of Mr. Obama or any president. Mr. Obama would do the country a service by proposing a protocol for surveillance that could be trusted. Pardoning Edward Snowden and welcoming him home as a patriot and privacy adviser would be a very good start.WILLIAM S. KESSLERSeattleTo the Editor:The government wants Apple to design a utility to hack Syed Farook\u2019s iPhone, while Apple is refusing to do so. I agree with Apple that building a tool to bypass iPhone security can jeopardize the privacy of all iPhone users.Besides the issues of data security and privacy, there is an issue of how much control we want the government to have. According to the American Civil Liberties Union, the government\u2019s law enforcement agencies are \u201casking the public to grant them significant new powers that could put all our communications infrastructure at risk.\u201dSome argue that unlocking Mr. Farook\u2019s iPhone would not set a wider precedent, but this back door could be used by hackers if not by the government.ALYSSA HANSRAJChicagoThe writer, a sixth grader at Hawthorne Scholastic Academy, a literacy magnet school, wrote this letter as part of a class study of the Apple case.Advertisement"}

The insult cases have rarely resulted in jail sentences, although some defendants have received suspended sentences. And many have wound up in pretrial detention.Still, the pursuit of such cases has had a chilling effect on speech, activists and lawyers say. \u201cThis is intimidation,\u201d said Ozgur Urfa, a lawyer who has defended more than two dozen people in insult cases.Many cases revolve around slogans chanted at demonstrations, Mr. Urfa said in an interview on Wednesday.

Erdogan!\u201dKerem Altiparmak of the Ankara University Human Rights Center said that with the prosecution of the insult crimes, the authorities are able to squelch unflattering remarks about the president and general politics. \u201cIt creates a chilling effect, and I believe they are very successful at that,\u201d he said.Turkey has never had a wide regard for freedom of expression, and in previous times the judicial system aggressively targeted those who insulted Mustafa Kemal Ataturk, modern Turkey\u2019s founding father, as well as those insulting \u201cTurkishness\u201d or the Turkish nation. It has also long had a law on its books making it a crime to insult the president, although it was rarely enforced before Mr. Erdogan became president in 2014.The insult cases, critics say, have become a prominent element of a full-scale assault on freedom of expression. Dozens of journalists have lost their jobs because of coverage considered critical of the government. The state took control of an opposition television channel and newspaper, and the country\u2019s antiterrorism laws have been used to silence critical voices.In one high-profile case, two editors for the newspaper Cumhuriyet \u2014 Can Dundar and Erdem Gul \u2014 are facing the possibility of life in prison on espionage charges for reports that Turkey\u2019s intelligence service had provided weapons to rebels in Syria.In a rare victory for freedom of expression and judicial independence, Turkey\u2019s highest court recently ordered the release of the two editors from pretrial detention, saying their rights had been violated.

Trump\u2019s rally here Saturday night, just 24 hours after confrontations between his supporters and demonstrators led to the cancellation of a Chicago event.Cellphone video posted on social media appeared to show as many as four cans of spray being used at one point as protesters confronted police officers on foot and on horseback.Andrea Tunks, 19, said she and several other protesters had locked arms and faced down two police horses and numerous officers in front of the theater where the rally took place.She said she believed the police were preparing to have the horses walk toward them. At that point, she said, she was sprayed.Darin Snapp, a spokesman for the Kansas City Police Department, said officers used pepper spray outside Mr. Trump\u2019s rally in an effort to \u201cprevent protesters from taking over the street in an attempt to fight with rally supporters.\u201dHe said no one was injured outside the rally, but two people were arrested \u00e2\u0080\u0094 one on charges of throwing a bottle at the theater, and the other on a disorderly conduct charge for his \u201crefusal to stay out of the street.\u201dThe police department and its chief also defended use of the spray on Twitter.We had to use pepper spray 2 times outside Trump rally and arrested 2 people who refused to follow law. (1/2)During the event, inside a grand old theater with inlaid carvings, a chandelier, a mezzanine and upper deck, Mr. Trump, notably hoarse, called on the police to arrest people who were merely demonstrating.

On Friday night, however, hundreds of demonstrators made it into an arena in Chicago where their confrontations with Trump supporters led to the cancellation of the event.Mr. Smith and his fellow protesters got in Saturday night, and when they spoke up, they tried to hold on to a railing as security workers came to take them away.He said he believed they were destined for a \u201cback room\u201d but were instead taken out through the front door and not arrested.\n\t\tFirst Draft provides fast-paced and comprehensive coverage of politics and elections by The New York Times.

In order to relate his family\u00e2\u0080\u0099s experiences to what has been convulsing his country, Mr. Mart\u00c3\u00adnez looked inward, producing a series of images that are quiet, personal and haunting: of empty rooms bathed in shadows, parents whose faces are etched with grief, portraits of loved ones looking at times lost, other times in pain.\u00e2\u0080\u009cI wanted to show the emotional and psychological fractures that come with such losses,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Mart\u00c3\u00adnez said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThere is fear and impotence because you can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t get an answer. There is frustration. You can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t sleep. The routine of your life has been shattered. You can never be the same after that.\u00e2\u0080\u009dThe death and disappearances in his family happened before the 43 students were kidnapped, even though many people had known about situations like these for years. Beto had been arrested in February 2013 for carrying marijuana and was jailed for six months before his death. The other two brothers vanished within days of each other in early May: Ignacio was seen being hauled into a van in Iguala\u2019s city center; David went out one day and did not come home, not unusual as he liked to party, Mr. Mart\u00c3\u00adnez said.Their parents filed reports with the police, Mr. Mart\u00c3\u00adnez said, but nothing happened.\u00e2\u0080\u009cMy mother-in-law never got a response from the police,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt was only after the 43 students were kidnapped that they started to investigate things. A lot of people after that started raising their voices demanding answers.\u00e2\u0080\u009dMr. Mart\u00c3\u00adnez\u00e2\u0080\u0099s own response to the family tragedy was to let his in-laws\u00e2\u0080\u0099 sorrow stand in for similar tragedies in so many other families. What he chronicled showed a family torn asunder by events out of their control, with questions that have yet to be answered.His mother-in-law stayed in Taxco, about a half-hour from Iguala, convinced her two sons are alive, somewhere. She has even provided the authorities with a sample of her DNA to help with any possible identification of the bodies that have been found in numerous graves since the student kidnappings. Every Tuesday, Mr. Mart\u00c3\u00adnez said, she checks in with the authorities to see if anyone has been found.\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhen we lost Beto and buried him, that hurt,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Mart\u00c3\u00adnez said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBut it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s difficult for the ones who disappeared because you cannot close the circle of life and death and let that person go. My mother says they are still alive. Sometimes she says maybe no. I go outside with my wife and she\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll see someone who looks like one of her brothers. They live with this anxiety. They want to hold on to that hope and keep to alive.\u00e2\u0080\u009dMr. Mart\u00c3\u00adnez chose to make these quieter images, rather than resort to more traditional photojournalistic approaches. You will not find empty graves or blood-streaked walls. He says that by looking at these small, personal moments in the aftermath of loss, he can begin to shed light on what so many other families are enduring in his country.\u00e2\u0080\u009cI am glad to see more opportunities for Latin American photographers,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe can tell our stories our way. We can represent ourselves and tell the stories that we are living. That work is more honest and totally different from what is usually shown.\u00e2\u0080\u009dThe grant will allow him to continue to work on the project, \u00e2\u0080\u009cBroken Roots,\u00e2\u0080\u009d which has begun to include other families who have experienced such losses.\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt is important to have this testimony,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIf not, impunity will continue. This worries me. How do we find a way out of this situation? The panorama is so dark.\u00e2\u0080\u009dMr. Mart\u00c3\u00adnez and his wife found one way: Soon after the brothers died and disappeared, he and his wife decided to have a second child. Her name is Zuria Citlali. She will turn 1 next week.\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou try to put your feet on the ground and find another path,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAfter the loss, my wife felt the need to start over. To see another aspect of what we are living through, the darkness and light.\u00e2\u0080\u009d"}

Coming soon.Adding a little dark chocolate to a training diet may effortlessly improve endurance performance, according to a new study of sports nutrition. The findings provide ammunition both for athletes looking for an edge and those hoping for an excuse to indulge.Epicatechin is known to prompt cells that line blood vessels to release extra nitric oxide, a substance that has multiple effects in the body. Nitric oxide slightly increases vasodilation, or a widening of the veins and arteries, improving blood flow and cardiac function. It also gooses muscle cells to take in more blood sugar, providing them with more energy, and it enhances the passage of oxygen into cells.Because of its many physiological effects, each of which can aid physical performance, athletes long have looked for ways to increase the amount of nitric oxide in their bloodstreams. Some down supplement pills, although the benefits of nitric oxide supplements are unproven. Others swallow beetroot juice, a beverage that contains a hefty dose of nitrates, which then break down in the body into nitric oxide and other substances. There are questions, however, about the safety of nitrates and also, as anyone who has tried beetroot juice will tell you, the palatability of a beverage that tastes distinctly like liquid dirt.Surprisingly, athletes and scientists have devoted relatively little attention to the potential of dark chocolate as a way to up natural nitric oxide and subsequent performance, perhaps in part because chocolate can cause weight gain and also seems neither medicinal nor unpleasant, two attributes often associated with ergogenic aids.But researchers at Kingston University in England suspected that dark chocolate might be a potent performance enhancer, if the chocolate were deployed carefully.The cyclists first, however, visited the researchers\u00e2\u0080\u0099 lab for tests of their fitness and oxygen uptake during moderate rides and all-out sprints on a stationary bicycle.Then the scientists provided half of the cyclists with 40 grams (1.4 ounces, or about one and a half squares) per day of Dove brand dark chocolate, which has been found in past tests to contain an above-average amount of epicatechin.The cyclists were told to replace one of their normal snacks or desserts with the chocolate, to avoid weight gain.The other cyclists were provided with 40 grams of white chocolate, as a control.They all ate their chocolate every day for two weeks, then returned to the lab to repeat the tests.Then each group was provided with whichever type of chocolate, white or dark, they had not eaten before and sent off for another two weeks.They returned and repeated the cycling and oxygen uptake tests again.The results were beguiling. Each of the cyclists performed better in most of the physical tests after two weeks of supplementing with dark chocolate, compared to baseline results and after they had eaten white chocolate. The riders utilized less oxygen to ride at a moderate pace, a change that would generally allow them to ride longer or harder before tiring; and they covered more distance during a two-minute, all-out time trial, meaning that their anaerobic, sprinting ability had been enhanced.The researchers did not directly measure nitric oxide in their volunteers\u00e2\u0080\u0099 blood, but believe that the chocolate ramped up production of the substance, improving oxygen delivery to riders\u00e2\u0080\u0099 cells.Performance gains were not huge. The riders who had eaten dark chocolate covered an additional tenth of a mile during the two-minute time trial compared to when they had white chocolate. But that extra mileage occurred, the scientists point out, even though the riders otherwise followed the same dietary and training regimens during each of the two-week sessions.The upshot of these findings would seem to be that \u00e2\u0080\u009crecreational athletes who would like to improve their performance\u00e2\u0080\u009d might consider swapping a daily cookie or soda for a square or two of dark chocolate, said Rishikesh Kankesh Patel, a graduate student at Kingston University who led the study.But he cautioned that scientists do not yet know the ideal dosage of dark chocolate for athletes, and that more than 40 grams is unlikely to be helpful, so put away the rest of that bar. Cocoa and epicatechin levels also vary widely from bar to bar, he said, which makes precise dosing of the performance-enhancing content tricky.Related:Your health questions answered by Times journalists and\u00a0experts.Get Well's Running email for practical tips, expert advice, exclusive content and a bit of motivation delivered to your inbox every week to help you on your running journey.

{"Headline": "New York Legislators Plan to Introduce Measure on Carried Interest Tax", "Date": "2016-03-06", "News": "Supported byA coalition of progressive groups is starting a state-level campaign to close the so-called carried interest loophole, which allows fund managers to pay a substantially reduced federal tax rate on much of their income.Two New York State assemblymen plan to introduce a bill on Monday that would raise taxes on state residents who benefit from the lower rate, to precisely offset the tax savings they receive at the federal level.In addition to correcting what its members see as a glaring inequity in the tax code, the coalition hopes to generate revenue that could be spent on public investments in areas like schools and economic development.\u201cPeople from Buffalo, when they work, they pay their taxes,\u201d said Assemblyman Sean Ryan, one of the two Democratic legislators who are sponsoring the bill. \u201cWe don\u2019t have a lot of hedge funds in Buffalo, but we do have a need for state assistance.\u201dThe bill would make the tax increase contingent on the passage of corresponding legislation in Massachusetts, New Jersey and Connecticut, so that fund managers could not avoid the tax by simply moving to a nearby state. Those who helped draft the bill estimated that it could raise roughly $3.7 billion a year in New York if the tax increase were to go into effect.The name of the so-called loophole refers to a feature of the compensation of many fund managers, who frequently receive a management fee equivalent to 2 percent of their fund\u2019s assets, as well as 20 percent of the fund\u2019s profits (sometimes contingent on reaching a certain profit threshold). The latter is known as \u201ccarried interest.\u201dDespite this growing support, however, Congress has repeatedly declined to make the change.\u201cIt is not just ridiculous and unfair, it is the kind of thing that has led to the rise of Donald Trump,\u201d said Whitney Tilson, a hedge fund manager and member of the Patriotic Millionaires, who has long opposed the tax provision despite personally benefiting from it.\u201cWhen you tell the average person what\u2019s going on here, it makes them so mad they can\u2019t see straight,\u201d he said. \u201cThey turn to someone like Trump who confirms to them that the whole system is corrupt.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s absolutely modeled on that,\u201d said Michael Kink, a leader of the Hedge Clippers who helped write the legislation that will be introduced in New York. \u201cA lot of people around the country are demanding action, and there\u2019s absolutely no action in Congress.\u201dAs written, the legislation does not include a provision to end the state-level tax if Congress were to change the federal law. But Assemblyman Ryan said he would insist on that being the case, and some of the bill\u2019s supporters said it would be critical.Assemblyman Jeffrion L. Aubry, the lead sponsor of the forthcoming bill in New York, noted that legislators in Albany were engaged in the annual budget process, a time when many of their priorities frequently go by the wayside for lack of revenue. He suggested that the ample revenue the bill would generate could help build support for it.Still, enacting the tax appears to be a long way off, and supporters concede that the effort is as much about raising public awareness about the issue as it is about changing tax rates.\u201cHow many people know what the word \u2018carried interest\u2019 is?\u201d asked Randi Weingarten, president of the American Federation of Teachers. \u201cThat\u2019s part of why they\u2019re so successful. They create names for things that no one understands.\u201dUnder the current law, the federal government treats carried interest as long-term capital gains, which are mostly taxed at a rate of 20 percent for the wealthy, rather than as ordinary income, which would generally be taxed at a rate of 39.6 percent for this group. (An additional tax of 3.8 percent also typically applies to capital gains and to most other forms of income above $200,000 for individuals and $250,000 for couples.)Opponents of this approach say that carried interest is simply compensation for services rendered \u2014 in this case, managing other people\u2019s money \u2014 not investment gains. That is because the share of profits that fund managers receive through carried interest does not derive from money they have personally invested. As such, opponents say, it should be taxed as ordinary income.\u201cI\u2019m sorry, you\u2019re selling a service; that means it\u2019s labor income,\u201d said Senator Elizabeth Warren, a Democrat from Massachusetts who is a longtime opponent of the current approach.Representatives of industries in which fund managers earn carried interest deny that this tax treatment amounts to a loophole. They say that even if the managers\u2019 share of their funds\u2019 profits is not a return on money they have personally invested, it is compensation for the \u201csweat equity\u201d they invest in building their businesses.They say their situation is analogous to sales of Facebook stock by the company\u2019s founder, Mark Zuckerberg. He pays the capital gains rate, even though outside investors provided most of the company\u2019s capital. Private equity fund managers should also pay the capital gains rate, they say, on profits from the sale of a portfolio company, even though others provided most of the capital for purchasing it.\u201cPrivate equity fund managers are more than money managers,\u201d said James Maloney of the Private Equity Growth Capital Council, an industry group. \u201cThey hire executives, sit on boards, develop strategic plans.\u201dBut many tax experts say even that logic is a stretch. The argument for taxing Mr. Zuckerberg at a lower rate \u201cis that there\u2019s an undersupply of entrepreneurs, and the world needs more Zuckerbergs,\u201d said Victor Fleischer, a professor at the University of San Diego School of Law, who writes occasionally for The New York Times and has advised the coalition on its revenue estimates. \u201cYou can\u2019t make the argument that there\u2019s an undersupply of venture capitalists or private equity fund managers.\u201dAdvertisement"}

All week, Mr. Trump has slowly escalated a war of words on Twitter against Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, his main competition in the Republican race, based on an ad by a \u00e2\u0080\u009csuper PAC\u00e2\u0080\u009d started by people who want to stop the New York developer from getting the nomination. The spot featured an old nude photo shoot of Mr. Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s wife Melania Trump, a former model, posing on his jet.  Mr. Cruz has no affiliation with the super PAC, and he has denounced the ad. But Mr. Trump has continued to express disbelief.

{"Headline": "At Yale, Basketball Success Collides With Sexual Misconduct Case", "Date": "2016-03-09", "News": "Supported byNEW HAVEN, Conn. \u2014 This should be the Yale Bulldogs\u2019 crowning moment \u2014 after a 54-year wait, the men\u2019s basketball team brought an unshared Ivy League title home and with it an invitation to the N.C.A.A. tournament.Instead, the team finds itself at odds with many students here over its continued support for its captain, a senior who left the university last month without a public explanation from anyone associated with Yale\u2019s athletics department or its administration.The departure of the player, Jack Montague, 22, was in connection with a sexual misconduct accusation, according to two people with direct knowledge of the case who spoke on condition of anonymity because of the confidential nature in which it was handled.With protests on campus against the Bulldogs increasing, the team on Wednesday issued a statement apologizing for its public shows of support for Montague, which had included wearing shirts with his name and number during a game and making hand gestures signifying his number.Asked by ESPN about the missing captain after the team had clinched its tournament berth on Saturday, Coach James Jones said: \u201cWe love him. He\u2019s a great young man, and we love him.\u201dIn its statement Wednesday, the team said it \u201csupports a healthy, safe and respectful campus climate where all students can flourish.\u201dThe statement continued: \u201cOur recent actions to show our support for one of our former teammates were not intended to suggest otherwise, but we understand that to many students they did. We apologize for the hurt we have caused, and we look forward to learning and growing from these recent incidents. As student representatives of Yale, we hope to use our positions on and off the court in a way that can make everyone proud.\u201dThe details of the episode and whether Montague was deemed guilty of the accusation remain unclear, but his father, while declining to discuss the case in detail, said in an interview that his son had been expelled. The team and the university acknowledged that Montague left school Feb. 26 but, citing federal confidentiality laws, have declined to comment on the reasons.In a statement, a university spokesman, Tom Conroy, wrote that in accordance with the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act, a federal law on the privacy of student records, \u201cYale policy is to not release identifiable information from a student\u2019s educational record to the public unless a student requests that the information be disclosed.\u201dAs rumors around the accusation have percolated across campus, the case and its unanswered questions have caused tension. On Wednesday, members of a student advocacy group, Unite Against Sexual Assault Yale, gathered in the center of campus to host a rally against sexual assault.About 450 students and faculty members wrote messages in chalk on the concrete in front of Yale\u2019s largest library throughout the day, some of them directed at the team.The comments included \u201cThe only team I\u2019m cheering for are survivors @ Yale \u2014 dismantle men\u2019s athletic privilege\u201d and \u201cImagine if Yale men cared as much about ending rape culture as they care about sports. Be an ally.\u201dMontague\u2019s father, Jim, said representatives of his son would soon clarify why he had left school.\u201cWe have been holding our tongue and waiting,\u201d he said, \u201cand when we put our story out there, people are going to say, \u2018Why was this boy expelled?\u2019 \u201dStudents said their frustration stemmed from a lack of public information. The mechanism Yale has put in place to handle sexual misconduct complaints stresses confidentiality to make students feel comfortable coming forward. If the students choose, the matter can also be settled without the involvement of law enforcement.Outside investigators are assigned to each case, and the cases are heard by members of the Yale professional community. The dean of a student\u2019s college makes the final decision. The findings remain confidential and are protected by the privacy law.But the process, and the absence of a public record or accounting, lends itself to accusations of a lack of transparency.\u201cThe shirts and the team\u2019s statements support a campus climate I don\u2019t agree with,\u201d she said. \u201cWe should all feel safe and believe we are being heard.\u201dOthers said the mystery around the case had made it hard to have a constructive dialogue over whether the university and the team had acted properly.She added, \u201cIn the absence of facts confirmed by an administrative body, people will continue to weigh in on public conversation.\u201dAs Yale awaits its tournament seeding and word of where it will play its opening-round game, the conversation over Montague and the team has threatened to overshadow the Bulldogs\u2019 on-court achievements.Yale administrators have struggled to address the rancor without divulging information on the case.Jonathan Holloway, the dean of Yale College, sent an email to all undergraduate students Saturday morning, saying that he understood many were \u201cupset and angry\u201d about the team\u2019s actions but asked that they \u201ctreat each other civilly.\u201dNot long after, Fish Stark, a columnist at The Yale Daily News, posted an edited version of Holloway\u2019s message on a Facebook group, Overheard at Yale, a popular stop among the more than 8,000 members of the university community. Stark said the dean should have come out in support of Yale women and a safer sexual climate.Calls for the team to apologize ratcheted up as well.Team members had remained resolute.After Saturday\u2019s victory over Columbia and the team\u2019s demonstration of support for Montague, the Bulldogs\u2019 star player, Justin Sears, said he and members of the team had communicated with Montague via Facebook before the game. Sears said Montague had told them to win the game for him, and the team members told Montague they expected to see him at the site of Yale\u2019s first-round game, to be announced Sunday.\u201cHe\u2019s still our captain,\u201d Sears said. \u201cHe\u2019s my brother; he\u2019s all of our brothers. He\u2019s back at home smiling, having a beer right now.\u201dAthletic Director Tom Beckett said the team had acted on its own when it donned the supportive shirts before a game.\u201cThe university had no knowledge of the shirts,\u201d he said. \u201cWe were not a part of that decision.\u201dRegarding the nationally televised comments by Jones about Montague, Conroy, the Yale spokesman, said in an email that \u201cthe coach was expressing his personal feelings about a student no longer on the team in answer to a question immediately following the team winning the Ivy League championship for the first time in 54 years.\u201dSexual misconduct and assaults on college campuses have become a focus of the news media and higher-education policy makers, especially after a recent study, one of the largest of its kind, showed that more than one in four undergraduate women at a large group of leading universities said they had been sexually assaulted by force or when they were incapacitated.The survey, released last fall by the Association of American Universities, showed that about 27 percent of female college seniors reported that since entering college they had experienced some kind of unwanted sexual contact \u2014 anything from touching to rape.Yale\u2019s handling of sexual assault has come under particular scrutiny in recent years. The university has taken a number of steps to address how such cases are handled in the aftermath of an investigation by the Education Department\u2019s Office for Civil Rights into a complaint filed by 16 students and recent graduates, accusing the university of violating Title IX, the federal gender-equality law, by failing to eliminate a hostile sexual environment on campus.Nicole Narea contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

Those spring break pictures on Facebook will be the first thing the Senate Judiciary Committee sees when it\u2019s deciding whether to approve their nomination.At least, that\u2019s what I grew up believing.

Oh, right: Mr. Trump is obviously better qualified to run our country, because his wife was a professional model.In this strangest of primary seasons, women exist primarily in terms of their relationships to the men they marry or question or critique. They can either be beauties or beasts or \u201cthe love of my life.\u201d They can be \u201ccrazy\u201d or \u201closers,\u201d \u201cfat pigs\u201d or \u201cdogs.\u201d They can be mothers and daughters. They can be the currency with which you buy voters\u2019 belief in your machismo and alpha-maleness, or they can be the sand you kick in the face of a \u201cNew York bully.\u201d In every case, whether they are assets or liabilities, they are objects. In no case are they people.What\u2019s the political significance of a naked lady? When the Utah ad went public, it wasn\u2019t long before the predictable calls to leave candidates\u2019 families out of the fray were joined by charges of slut-shaming, and the insistence that a grown woman can pose as she wishes; that as long as it\u2019s her choice, it\u2019s empowering.Melania Trump might have chosen to pose for GQ, but there\u2019s nothing empowering about the way her husband\u2019s opponents have repurposed her modeling portfolio as revenge porn. Which is precisely what Mr. Trump has done with Megyn Kelly\u2019s GQ shots. Neither woman deserves to suffer for having made the choice to get in front of a camera.MY guess is that neither one will. Twenty years ago \u2014 or even as recently as 2004, when the Federal Communications Commission fined CBS $550,000 after Janet Jackson\u2019s Super Bowl halftime \u201cwardrobe malfunction\u201d \u2014 to be female and naked was to be afraid. But now, our biggest reality TV star is Kim Kardashian, a woman who spun a sex tape into gold, a woman who posts nude selfies, then twirls on her haters, while her fans come roaring to her defense, claiming that she has subverted the male gaze because she\u2019s the one creating the image and she\u2019s the one sharing the shot.When a collection of naked celebrity pictures were spirited out of the cloud, then leaked to the public in 2014, it was the hacking that shocked people, not the existence of the pictures. Not even a Disney princess like Vanessa Hudgens had her career derailed by repeated leaked nudes.The would-be first ladies will survive nudity, and mockery, but both of them have been diminished, stripped of their personhood and reduced to objects. They have been flattened into human baseball cards, to be rated and traded, compared and assessed, and their worth depends not on who they are or what they do, but on how good they look and how much their husbands love them.It\u2019s enough to make a liberal feminist, a mere spectator to the Republican debates, long for the days of Carly Fiorina. At least then the Republican primary could boast one woman who was a candidate, not just a wife and a mother, or a face and a figure \u2014 a person, instead of a thing.Advertisement"}

They accused him of undermining Islam and of having a \u00e2\u0080\u009cWestern ideology and perspective,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Fatemi said. Similar emails were sent to his photo agency, and its website was blocked in Iran. At the time, Mr. Fatemi was visiting a photo festival in San Diego, and it quickly became clear to him that it would be too dangerous to return to Iran.The stories the participants \u00e2\u0080\u0094 four men and four women from different parts of the country \u00e2\u0080\u0094 chose focused on the place of women in Iranian society, university students, drought and a disabled war veteran. Mr. Fatemi did not tell them to take any particular point of view or political position.\u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00c2\u00a0just want them to be free and take the pictures they need to,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI chose a subject that would not cause them to be arrested or get into any trouble if they were published. There are many subjects that could force photographers to leave the country as I did.\u00e2\u0080\u009dMr. Fatemi arranged and led virtual workshops throughout Iran to teach his students how to be better visual storytellers and \u00e2\u0080\u009cto have an open-minded viewpoint.\u00e2\u0080\u009d At times, local government officials banned his workshops because they included men and women together and because a critical documentary viewpoint was politically unacceptable.The project lasted 14 months, including training and photographing under the supervision of Mr. Fatemi and Panos Pictures, with the assistance of Maryam Athari. The photographers included Zahra Ostadzadeh, Bahar Aslani, Hossein Heidarpour, Hamid Akhlaghi, Negin Kiani, Saeed Zeidi, Mahya Rastegar and Ali Tajik.Ms. Ostadzadeh, who has a master\u00e2\u0080\u0099s degree in sociology, concentrates on women\u00e2\u0080\u0099s issues in her photography and video work. For the project, she documented an all-girls boarding school in Kerman Province where, she said, the girls were \u00e2\u0080\u009csatisfied by what they have,\u00e2\u0080\u009d even though in the larger society women are sometimes seen as inferior.\u00e2\u0080\u009cI wanted my photos to improve their life,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cMy approach wasn\u2019t looking down at them. I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want my photos to only show poverty. Instead I want to show life\u00e2\u0080\u0099s happiness and the great goals they envision. I want to show that despite all the poor conditions and poverty that should be changed they are still content.\u00e2\u0080\u009dFor Mr. Fatemi, receiving the award from POYi was a little bittersweet. Although he cannot return to Iran for now, he has forged a new way forward \u00e2\u0080\u0094 with his students. The \u00e2\u0080\u009cJourney Inside\u00e2\u0080\u009d project was, he said, another way to get at the truth.\u00e2\u0080\u009cIran is a very complex and complicated country,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe photographers think that through this kind of photography we can understand ourselves, our beliefs and our viewpoints.\u00e2\u0080\u009d"}

John Kasich in Ohio\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Republican primary on Tuesday.In a low-key speech to the Republican Party of Butler County, meeting here in his hometown, Mr. Boehner avoided any mention of the front-runner for the nomination, Donald J. Trump, nor did he allude to the anti-establishment uprising roiling the party nationally or in Ohio, where Mr. Kasich, despite his popularity, is fighting for his political life.\u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not really interested in getting in the middle of all this,\u00e2\u0080\u0099\u00e2\u0080\u0099 Mr. Boehner said. He went on to say that he had voted for Mr. Kasich, casting an early ballot, based on their years of friendship, including 18 years overlapping in Congress.Mr. Kasich, a two-term governor who enjoys high approval ratings in Ohio, has called out nearly the entire Republican apparatus in the state to support his candidacy.Mr. Boehner has kept a low profile since he stunned Republicans last year by announcing he would step down from the House, averting a possible government shutdown and breaking with elements of his party that rejected any deals with Democrats.Paradoxically, the no-compromise wing of the Republican Party helped fuel the rise of Mr. Trump, whose supporters believe that only a total Washington outsider can end government dysfunction.Deborah McGillvary, who attended a Trump rally on Saturday outside Dayton, said Mr. Boehner had disappointed her. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI think he became very weak in his attempt to try to pacify everybody,\u00e2\u0080\u0099\u00e2\u0080\u0099 she said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cHe just let down the entire Republican Party.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\u00e2\u0080\u0099The race to succeed Mr. Boehner in Ohio\u00e2\u0080\u0099s eighth district, which includes suburban Cincinnati and rural communities, has more than a dozen candidates who will be on the primary ballot on March 15.

{"Headline": "A Father, a Son, a Disease, and a Camera", "Date": "2018-01-18", "News": "Andy Warhol once predicted that in the future, everyone would be famous for 15 minutes. In the 21st century, with its endless and absurd string of viral phenomena, his words seem more prescient than ever. Stephen Shore, who got his start as a teenager photographing at Warhol\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Factory, says he thinks Warhol would approve of platforms like Instagram, which can make anonymous photographers famous, courtesy of the proper hashtag.\u00e2\u0080\u009cI think generally he was fascinated by contemporary culture, in whatever form it took,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Shore said in a recent interview.\u00e2\u0080\u009cI can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t help but think he would be fascinated with this.\u00e2\u0080\u009dMr. Shore is highly invested in Instagram, having lectured about it at the Photo London festival in 2015, and judged an audience participation competition for the social media platform, too. Surprisingly, he is in a career phase where his Instagram feed is the main photographic outlet.\u00e2\u0080\u009cTo be honest,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthis is my primary work now.\u00e2\u0080\u009dHe shoots regularly, using Instagram like a sketchbook, posting one picture daily, always something made within the past week. (Except for the occasional #ThrowbackThursday.)Both Mr. Shore and Mr. Boling, another longtime color photographer, were attracted to the platform\u00e2\u0080\u0099s spontaneity \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and the fact that it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s fun. They were also enamored of its social aspects, as neither had become attached to Facebook or Twitter. Both artists reported meeting people in the real world with whom they had corresponded only via Instagram, and feeling as if they already knew the person. It allowed them to build community, and stay connected, two hallmarks of the social media revolution.That connection between the digital and the real drove Documentum to summon pictures out of the digital sphere and into the physical world. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThey were created digitally,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Boling said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cto exist in a digital world. They\u00e2\u0080\u0099re the ultimate virtual reality image. Here we are, digging them out of the VR, and sticking them back into real life, the RL.\u00e2\u0080\u009dThe decision to produce the project as a broadsheet was also intentional. Mr. Shore felt newsprint echoed Instagram, in that it wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t too precious.\u00e2\u0080\u009cNewspapers are dying left and right,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Boling elaborated. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt occurred to me one day that what I really like about the [Sunday] New York Times is just the look and feel of it. I like seeing that I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve got a little ink on my fingers when I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m done. Because it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s rarer, now, as a publication. I think it acts a speed bump. It slows you down, and causes you to look at what you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re seeing in maybe a different way.\u00e2\u0080\u009dBecause the feedback loop is central to social media, Mr. Boling said they hoped to include audience work in the future. And for all the photographers out there who obsess about their likes and followers \u00e2\u0080\u0094 even if you won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t admit it \u00e2\u0080\u0094 you are not alone.When Mr. Shore was asked whether he pays attention to likes from his 62,900 followers, he admitted that he does.\u00e2\u0080\u009cYeah, I pay attention to it,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAs a percentage of followers, I think I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t get a lot of likes.\u00e2\u0080\u009d"}

Her reference to the siren call of a Lower East Side street vendor hawking codfish fritters and firecrackers struck me as having all the ingredients for a Fourth of July party (just add Bacardi). My second reaction was nervousness \u00e2\u0080\u0094 given the area\u00e2\u0080\u0099s devastation from poverty and drugs during the 1970s and 1980s, how would the photographer portray this world?With love and humor, it turns out.She documented birthday parties in spotless living rooms (with chairs sheathed in plastic slipcovers); whole pigs roasting on a spit in an empty lot; religious services and funerals, first communions and parades. Her camera also singled out critical, if sometimes overlooked, cultural figures like Jorge Brandon, considered to be the father of Nuyorican poetry. In more than a few images, she has Miguel Pi\u00c3\u00b1ero, the poet, playwright, addict and criminal whose life was as complicated as it was short. Most of the images were from the Lower East Side \u00e2\u0080\u0094 Loisaida \u00e2\u0080\u0094 although she also took some in Brooklyn and the Bronx, as well as along the Fifth Avenue route of the Puerto Rican Day Parade.Ms. Gottfried\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ability to connect to communities of color is something she credits to her family having stayed in Crown Heights, Brooklyn, even after many of her white neighbors fled during the 1960s. She became friends with the newcomers.By the 1970s, her mother had moved to the Lower East Side \u00e2\u0080\u0094 where she herself would live in the 1990s \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and she visited often. Looking beyond the jarring landscape, she found the people to be welcoming. She ended up taking pictures for years, not with any specific project in mind.In some cases, she would be struck by what she encountered, like the procession of girls about to make their first communion, walking down the street past televisions perched on cars and connected by extension cords to lampposts. Or the time someone told her to keep walking down the street.\u00e2\u0080\u009cWait until you see what you find down the block,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she recalled being told. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd there was this pig roast. You get exposed to all that being outside. It was a lot of fun.\u00e2\u0080\u009dHer pictures reflect that, including touches of humor and warmth familiar to anyone who grew up during that time, when residents often had only each other for support.\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe humor comes from being with the people,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Ms. Gottfried said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cPart of it is how I see life. You know, the humanity. There was openness, and I felt really comfortable. It was a mixture of excitement, joy and warmth. There was this striking beauty the people had.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt was a big mixture of people involved in all kinds of things,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI used to enjoy having conversations with people and bumping into people you knew. The musicians and the actors, there was a lot of theater going on at the cafe and other places. We could go to Henry Street Settlement and there would be a free Tito Puente concert.\u00e2\u0080\u009dMs. Gottfried would go on to other projects, other assignments. The area would undergo a major transformation, attracting newcomers to renovated tenements and luxury buildings. Some pockets of the old world remain, which makes her feel sentimental.\u00e2\u0080\u009cMoney came in and changed everything,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBut it was an experience I had and others didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t. I was able to go to places other people would only see in pictures.\u00e2\u0080\u009dAnd not all change was unwelcome. Over the years, she had photographed Johnny Cintron, looking rough and covered with tattoos. She even visited him in jail and took a picture of him there. She always remembered him as a smart guy who went astray.Two years ago, Mr. Cintron tracked her down on Facebook. The two decided to meet at Tompkins Square Park.\u00e2\u0080\u009cWalking through there, I was bumping into people I knew,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Ms. Gottfried recalled. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI was sitting there thinking, how will I recognize Johnny? Then, I saw a man standing with his back to me. I recognized him from behind, how he stood. There he was. He\u00e2\u0080\u0099s all cleaned up, married, looking good and doing well.

Trump that drew the attention of the Secret Service and led to the cancellation of his student visa, according to law enforcement officials and his lawyer.Emadeldin Elsayed, 23, posted an article on Facebook last month about Mr. Trump\u2019s proposal to bar Muslims from entering the United States. \u201cI literally don\u2019t mind taking a lifetime sentence in jail for killing this guy, I would actually be doing the whole world a favor,\u201d he wrote, according to his lawyer, Hani Bushra.After the Secret Service investigated his comments, Mr. Elsayed was expelled from flight school, which made him ineligible to continue studying in the country on a visa, even though prosecutors decided not to charge him. Rights advocates say they are alarmed by his case and see it as another sign of the U.S. government using the immigration system as a punitive tool against people, particularly Muslims, who are perceived as threats.An immigration judge last Friday granted Mr. Elsayed a voluntary departure, a form of repatriation that spares him a formal deportation but returns him to Egypt escorted by federal agents, said Virginia Kice, a spokeswoman for Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Lawyers said it would be difficult for him to return.Mr. Bushra said that his client \u201cthought Trump was hating on Muslims\u201d when he read the article he posted and put \u201cno thought\u201d into his threatening comment. \u201cHe isn\u2019t very involved in politics,\u201d the lawyer said.Caitlin Sanderson, a lawyer with the A.C.L.U. of Southern California, said that Mr. Elsayed\u2019s comment on Facebook would have been \u201ca very difficult case to prosecute.\u201d It seemed to be an example of a young person mouthing off online, she said, not threatening an actual murder.The United States attorney\u2019s office in Los Angeles declined to file criminal charges against him, but a spokesman did not explain the rationale. The legality of his remarks became a moot point, once his visa was revoked and the deportation process began.\u201cThis is not how our system should work,\u201d Mr. Bushra said. \u201cTheir mentality is \u2018whatever we can use to get this guy out of the country we can use.\u2019\u200a\u201dClaude Arnold, a retired Special Agent in Charge of I.C.E. Homeland Security Investigations in Los Angeles, described the matter in similar terms. Mr. Arnold said law enforcement had to take remarks like Mr. Elsayed\u2019s seriously and deporting him instead of prosecuting him \u201cmakes sense\u201d because it is more efficient. \u201cIf you can accomplish the same thing another way\u201d he said, \u201cneutralizing the potential threat by removing someone from the country, why wouldn\u2019t you do that?\u201dThe authorities learned of Mr. Elsayed\u2019s Facebook post when the owner of his flight school, Universal Air Academy, in El Monte, Calif., called the F.B.I., court documents show. Soon the Joint Terrorism Task Force, the State Department and the Secret Service, which provides security to Mr. Trump, were alerted as well.A Secret Service spokesman confirmed that an investigation took place but declined to discuss specifics. Court documents show that the State Department canceled the student\u2019s entry visa, but for him to be in violation of his immigration status he had to be expelled from school.In a statement submitted to the court, the school\u2019s owner, Alex Khatib, said Secret Service agents came to his office after business hours on Feb. 11 and made the \u201csuggestion\u201d that he expel the student because \u201cit was better for Mr. Elsayed to leave the country.\u201dHe complied with their request, and when Mr. Elsayed arrived at school the next day he was arrested by ICE agents.Judge Kevin Riley denied Mr. Elsayed\u2019s request to be released on bond at two deportation hearings last week. He has been jailed since his arrest and will remain in custody until he is escorted to Egypt, Ms. Kice said.Now, Mr. Bushra said, \u201cHe is just anxious to leave and get home as fast as possible.\u201dMr. Elsayed will arrive in Egypt to some notoriety. Relatives in Cairo have appeared on evening talk shows where hosts point to his detention as a sign that America respects neither free speech nor Muslims.In a statement submitted to the court, Mr. Elsayed called his threat a \u201cfoolish post\u201d and said he wanted to return to school.With his visa canceled, $40,000 in tuition lost, a Secret Service investigation and a month in immigration detention haunting his past, Mr. Bushra said his client\u2019s dream of working as an airline pilot seems dashed.\u201cHe is devastated and he is smart enough to know that he is going to pay for this mistake for a long, long time,\u201d Mr. Bushra said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Living With Cancer: Being Erased", "Date": "2016-03-10", "News": "Susan Gubar writes about life with ovarian cancer.While I recover from a fractured pelvis, I have time to remember the day after a less ruinous fall two years ago. No bones broken then, but I quickly developed a shiner and then slowly an insight into the color of cancer.  A bluish-purple humdinger bloomed beneath my right eye, spreading its tendrils down my cheek. Leaning over or a deep breath hurt. With too many cancer-related hospitalizations, I was determined to avoid the emergency room.  Learn from the pain, I instructed myself, and prepare your dish for the potluck:  The word tugged me back to the 1970s.  I had slipped on the way to the bathroom at 4 a.m. A thud \u00e2\u0080\u0094 my body hitting the hardwood floor \u00e2\u0080\u0094 woke my husband who immediately supplied towels to sop up the bleeding from my forehead.  Was that fall a consequence of the targeted medication of a clinical trial, a sliver of Ambien, the neuropathy in my feet from past chemotherapies, or all the above?  Still, food needed to be prepared for the gathering I was supposed to attend that evening of retired faculty women from Indiana University.  The company would consist of compatriots on all sorts of committees over the course of some 40 years.  We were the ones who arrived at the university to integrate the mostly male faculty.  Many of these people had consoled me when cancer treatments necessitated my retirement. I had already blanched the asparagus and started a dressing. As I assembled the dish, I rehearsed parries to the concerned comments my black eye was sure to elicit.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou should see the other guy,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I would tell my former colleagues.  Or \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a counter-irritant; it takes my mind off cancer.\u00e2\u0080\u009dAfter finding my way to the dinner, I joined some 25 variously frail and hale retired faculty women who had brought quiches and salads for a communal meal. They were filling their plates and sitting in small groups.With only a spasm of pain, I settled on a couch next to a friend and started to launch into one of my usual shticks:  that she should participate in the oral history project to document her work establishing gender studies and African-American studies at our university.  But she interrupted me.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cDo you realize that I am the first black woman to retire here since I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know many years ago?\u00e2\u0080\u009d Then we were off and running down memory lane:  recalling E.S., a pioneering scholar, and C.M., a brilliant teacher.  Careers blindsided, people lost to us.  What had happened to them?  Gone without a trace.  Did their isolation in a Midwestern college town depress them and had their depression further isolated them?  Were they pigeonholed as representative African-Americans and erased as unique human beings?  Although the administration tried various retention strategies, somehow the environment remained inhospitable.   \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s still a hard place to be a black woman,\u00e2\u0080\u009d my friend sighed.  While driving home I had worried and wondered why E.S. and C.M. did not, could not navigate their way to that evening\u00e2\u0080\u0099s event and whether newly hired African-American women would find the path as hazardous now as it had been then.  At my front door, though, a more self-regarding thought stopped me in my tracks.  How odd that not one person had mentioned my black eye! \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou look great,\u00e2\u0080\u009d one and all had volubly exclaimed at my coming and then at my going.  Did my friends assume that oncologists routinely punch their patients in the face?  Or were they exhibiting some version of Midwestern niceness?  Or are cancer patients invisible as individuals, visible only as cancer patients who must be perpetually bolstered and boosted?  My colleagues had seen Susan with cancer, not Susan who arrived in their midst with a black eye.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cPeople who have had cancer are treated as a kind of minority group,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the prostate cancer survivor Michael Korda believes, \u00e2\u0080\u009cas if the most important thing about them is their cancer, much as many people still treat African-Americans, as if the only thing that matters about them (or to them) is that they are black.\u00e2\u0080\u009d During the following months, I mulled over the hyper-visibility of categorized cancer patients and African-Americans, on one hand, and their invisibility as individuals, on the other.  Only this year, since it takes me quite a bit of muddling to learn anything, did Michael Korda\u00e2\u0080\u0099s insight make me realize how very few cancer memoirs we have from people of color, despite exceptions like those produced by Audre Lorde and Robin Roberts.  The experiences of minorities remain strikingly marginal in cancer literature:  not only in memoirs but also in blogs, diaries, essays, stories, plays, novels, movies and television series.  Since these genres generally express the perspectives of individuals, we are impoverished in our understanding when what we read and see excludes the reactions of patients from various economic and ethnic and racial backgrounds. Mortality statistics and drug advertisements notwithstanding, the cancer patients many of us imagine \u2014 as individuals enmeshed in their own stories \u2013 are white.  In the prize-winning book \u201cCitizen:  An American Lyric,\u201d Claudia Rankine describes taking a few steps back when someone with multiple degrees said to her, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know black women could get cancer.\u00e2\u0080\u009dRelated:Your health questions answered by Times journalists and\u00a0experts.Get Well's Running email for practical tips, expert advice, exclusive content and a bit of motivation delivered to your inbox every week to help you on your running journey.

{"Headline": "Trump's New World Disorder", "Date": "2016-03-28", "News": "Supported byGoodbye to all that. Now we know that Donald Trump would rip up the post-1945 world order, trash an \u201cobsolete\u201d NATO, lean toward a Japan with nukes rather than the \u201cone-sided agreement\u201d that leaves the United States responsible for Japanese defense, tell Saudi Arabia that it \u201cwouldn\u2019t be around for very long\u201d without American protection, and generally make clear that \u201cwe cannot be the policeman of the world.\u201dSo much for Pax Americana; it was a bad deal, you see, and in the Trump universe the deal is everything. American power and far-flung American garrisons may have underwritten global security and averted nuclear war for more than seven decades, but they cannot be sustained by the \u201cpoor country\u201d the United States has become. Why? Because, he insists, the whole postwar setup is a scam.That Trump could be the next president of the United States is no longer a fanciful notion. Americans don\u2019t want business as usual; Trump is not business as usual. He\u2019s ranting and schmoozing his way to the White House as the man who, through some alchemy, will make an anxious America proud again. The world \u2014 already more combustible than at any time in recent decades \u2014 may be about to become a much more dangerous place.Bottom line of Trump foreign policy: \u201cWe will not be ripped off anymore\u201d because \u201cwe don\u2019t have any money.\u201d He would like to see the United States \u201creally starting to go robust,\u201d as it did around 1900.A lot of what Trump said was just plain wrong. He declared that he was \u201call for Ukraine, I have friends that live in Ukraine,\u201d but those friends don\u2019t seem to have explained what\u2019s going on. He is irked because countries like Germany \u201cdidn\u2019t seem to be very much involved\u201d when Russia got \u201cvery confrontational\u201d (a.k.a. annexed Crimea and started a war in eastern Ukraine), and so the burden fell on the United States.In fact, Germany has taken a central role in orchestrating sanctions against Russia and, unlike the United States, is at the table in the Minsk peace process for Ukraine. Perhaps it\u2019s unsurprising that Trump dismisses Germany\u2019s role in that he believes Europe\u2019s most powerful nation by far is \u201cbeing destroyed\u201d by \u201ctremendous crime\u201d (presumably on the part of unmentioned Muslim refugees) and by Chancellor Angela Merkel\u2019s \u201cna\u00efvet\u00e9 or worse\u201d (presumably in letting said Syrian refugees in). He also believes that the United States is \u201cobsolete in cyber,\u201d a view Iran would not share, and that \u201cour country doesn\u2019t have money\u201d (it does have some).But that Trump and facts are uneasy partners is already well known. What was not so apparent before these interviews was how radical a President Trump would be in dismantling the architecture of postwar stability \u2014 unless, of course, he changed his mind to demonstrate the unpredictability he prizes.To say NATO is obsolete \u2014 a view Moscow has been pressing since the end of the Cold War as a means to get the United States out of Europe \u2014 at a time when President Vladimir Putin is determined to assert Russian power is dangerous folly. Ask the Baltic States that have been spared Putin\u2019s aggression only because they are now NATO members. NATO remains the pillar of the trans-Atlantic cooperation that forged a Europe whole and free from the ruins and divisions of 1945.To countenance a nuclear-armed Japan at a time when China\u2019s rapid rise and designs in the East China Sea have sharpened tensions between the two countries is also to play a high-risk game. The presence of the United States as an Asian power offsetting China\u2019s rise and reassuring smaller nations in the hemisphere is a principal reason that rise has been peaceful.As for the disintegration of Saudi Arabia, which Trump seems ready to accept if the Saudis don\u2019t step up to the plate financially and militarily, it may well make Syria look like a playground.Trump is right about one thing. The world of 2016 is not that of 1945 or 1990. The United States is relatively weaker, power is shifting, there are pressing domestic priorities. But his version of \u201cAmerica First\u201d \u2014 which interestingly converges with the views of many on the left who are convinced that the United States should stop policing the world \u2014 looks like a recipe for cataclysm.War in Estonia or the East China Sea could end up being a very bad deal indeed, a real rip-off for all humanity.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Testing for Joy and Grit? Schools Nationwide Push to Measure Students\u2019 Emotional Skills", "Date": "2016-02-29", "News": "Supported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 The fifth graders in Jade Cooney\u2019s classroom compete against a kitchen timer during lessons to see how long they can sustain good behavior \u2014 raising hands, disagreeing respectfully and looking one another in the eye \u2014 without losing time to insults or side conversations.A recent update to federal education law requires states to include at least one nonacademic measure in judging school performance. So other states are watching these districts as a potential model. But the race to test for so-called social-emotional skills has raised alarms even among the biggest proponents of teaching them, who warn that the definitions are unclear and the tests faulty.And there is little agreement on what skills matter: Self-control? Empathy? Perseverance? Joy?But teaching social-emotional skills is often seen as a way to move away from a narrow focus on test scores, and to consider instead the whole child. It may seem contradictory, then, to test for those skills. In education, however, the adage is \u201cwhat\u2019s measured gets treasured\u201d; states give schools money to teach the subjects on which they will be judged.The biggest concern about testing for social-emotional skills is that it typically relies on surveys asking students to evaluate recent behaviors or mind-sets, like how many days they remembered their homework, or if they consider themselves hard workers. This makes the testing highly susceptible to fakery and subjectivity. In their paper published in May, Dr. Duckworth and David Yeager argued that even if students do not fake their answers, the tests provide incentive for \u201csuperficial parroting\u201d rather than real changes in mind-set.Here\u2019s a sample of the Grit Scale, developed to identify traits that might predict success.Students might be tested on performance, as in the \u201cmarshmallow test,\u201d in which children were told they could have a sweeter reward if they waited. Those who waited scored higher in self-control. But those tests are too time-consuming to use on a large group of students.Other researchers have proposed calling or texting students at regular intervals to check their behavior and frame of mind, or monitoring Facebook or Twitter to observe patterns of behavior. But privacy concerns would almost certainly disqualify those.The districts tested 10,000 students in 2014, and nearly 500,000 students last year, surveying things like how many days the students had come to school prepared (self-management), and whether they believed it was more important to be talented or to work hard (growth mind-set).Just two years ago in her classroom in a trailer here at Visitacion Valley Elementary School, Ms. Cooney struggled with the kind of management problems that often confront young teachers.Her students, mostly poor and living in a nearby housing project, were bouncing around the classroom, playing with their phones instead of paying attention, fighting out interfamily beefs. Even if they wanted to learn, they were not.On a recent day, students took notes on their reading as Ms. Cooney moved with a kind of Zen bustle around the classroom, grading papers and consulting one-on-one while she watched for things she would compliment the class on later \u2014 keeping bodies still, focusing on the task \u2014 and quietly noted bad behavior.For every 1,000 minutes of good behavior earned, the children win 15 extra minutes of recess.\u201cI\u2019m really saving minutes that would be lost to transitions, settling disputes and behavior problems,\u201d Ms. Cooney said. It can be exhausting, but not nearly as much as teaching before. As she said, \u201cWould you rather put out fires, or prevent them?\u201dSocial-emotional learning will count for 8 percent of a school\u2019s overall performance score; no teacher will lose a job for failing to instill a growth mind-set.Noah Bookman, the chief accountability officer for the districts, said he understood the concerns about testing. But, he said, \u201cThis work is so phenomenally important to the success of our kids in school and life. In some ways, we worry as much if not more about the possibility that these indicators remain on the back burner.\u201dAn article on Tuesday about a nationwide push to test the emotional skills of students misidentified a school in New York that is discussed in the book \u201cHow Children Succeed,\u201d which extols the efforts to teach such skills. It is Riverdale Country School, not Horace Mann.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "A Heated Debate Along a Growing Republican Divide", "Date": "2016-03-04", "News": "So that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s what a civil war looks like on a debate stage. For two hours in Detroit, Donald J. Trump and the three men who want to stop him from getting the Republican nomination battled over his pronouncements on foreign policy, his business record and his past views on overseas wars. It was not a strong debate for Mr. Trump, who was on the defensive throughout. And yet, that has never mattered before. On the one hand, Mr. Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s affirmative case for himself began with a veiled joke about his genitalia, and never really went far from there. On the other hand, Senator Ted Cruz of Texas and Senator Marco Rubio of Florida spent almost all of their time making a case against Mr. Trump rather than herald their candidacies. The Republican Party fractured onstage, making the bitter Democratic primary fight of 2008 between Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama seem tame. It was hard to keep track of all the invective hurled at Mr. Trump, and it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s why the speech that Mitt Romney made against him hours earlier might have been more effective. Mr. Cruz, Mr. Rubio and the three moderators offered a jumble of attacks and criticisms against Mr. Trump, creating a lot of noise. The issue that seemed likeliest to stick was the continuing lawsuit over Trump University, which, in a surreal moment for a major candidate, Mr. Trump called a \u00e2\u0080\u009cminor civil case.\u00e2\u0080\u009d  Gov. John R. Kasich of Ohio declined to join in the mudslinging, and insisted that he had a positive vision for the country. But he also repeatedly declined to directly answer what was asked of him, shifting to a topic he preferred.

For Mr. Rubio, who is struggling not to lose his home state of Florida on March 15, it could be a dangerous statement.In the meantime, four more states will vote on Saturday, with a primary in Louisiana and caucuses in Maine, Kansas and Kentucky, states where Mr. Cruz could perform well.  \n\t\tFirst Draft provides fast-paced and comprehensive coverage of politics and elections by The New York Times.

{"Headline": "\u2018House of Cards\u2019 Season 4, Episode 7: Rock Star Candidate", "Date": "2016-03-08", "News": "Supported byHouse of CardsWe\u2019ve heard Will Conway\u2019s name a few times and images of the Republican presidential candidate have flashed by in TV commercials over the course of the season. But in this episode, the New York governor (Joel Kinnaman) and his family finally come into full view.This chapter is a study in the contrasts between two candidates, a look at how they function politically and how they live. On almost every metric, President Frank Underwood seemingly falls short of Conway, who is young (at roughly 39, he meets the age requirement for a presidential candidate, but just barely), savvy when it comes to social media, and a happily married family man. In short, as one of the president\u2019s advisers puts it, he\u2019s a rock star.Conway and Frank even start their days in what feel like different universes. Conway enjoys spirited \u201cgood morning\u201d sex in the bathroom with his beautiful, British wife, while Frank stands alone in front of a bathroom vanity filled with medications as his wife peeks in from a cautious distance. After the quickie with his spouse, Conway goofs around with one of his adorable moppet children; meanwhile, a subdued Frank and Claire discuss the importance of staying focused on their political agenda instead of worrying about their personal relationship. \u201cFind your steel, Claire,\u201d he tells her, foreshadowing the steel she\u2019ll later hold in her hand while advocating for tougher gun-control measures.This is the Season 4 episode when most people will be tempted to see the Underwoods as stand-ins for Bill and Hillary Clinton, assuming they haven\u2019t already. Unlike the Conways, Frank and Claire appear to derive their earthly pleasures from coaching each other toward professional success. In a pair of deftly edited sequences we first see Frank advising Claire about how to hone her message during a meeting with the head of the National Rifle Association, then, later, Claire helping Frank perfect his approach to an important conversation about who should be his running mate. Everything they lack in romantic passion, they make up for in their strategic synchronicity, a quality that, true or not, many have always imagined is core to the Clintons\u2019 relationship as well. (Notably, as the episode progresses, Claire and Frank inch closer to each other in terms of physical proximity until, by the end, they\u2019re in the same bedroom, albeit not the same bed.)The notion of tapping into Americans\u2019 personal information is a hot-button issue and \u201cHouse of Cards\u201d uses it to further accentuate the differences between the candidates. While Conway seeks to gain intel about voters\u2019 preferences using technology that takes advantage of willingly shared information, Frank wants to just take it by way of a federal court ruling that allows for widespread domestic surveillance, justified by airstrikes against ICO, the \u201cHouse of Cards\u201d version of ISIS. It\u2019s the stuff of Edward Snowden\u2019s most extreme nightmares, and Frank has the good judgment to abort both the military mission and his plan. Still, one wonders if he\u2019ll find another way to tap, wire or otherwise, into the minds of voters and in the process, perhaps find out that Tom Hammerschmidt is still investigating Lucas Goodwin\u2019s claims about him.There\u2019s another important quality that Conway and Frank don\u2019t share and that\u2019s ruthlessness. As Claire notes, the Underwoods are willing to go farther than anyone, including the Conways, to get what they want. If there was any thought that, post-surgery, Frank might soften, this episode puts an end to that notion. His overdramatic, fourth-wall-breaking monologues, easily the most irritating of the \u201cHouse of Cards\u201d signature stylistic flourishes, are back in full force. And his insistence, with Claire\u2019s agreement, that \u201cwe are going to destroy\u201d the Conways suggests things are going to get very ugly in the remainder of the season.While watching that video of the 2012 New Year\u2019s Eve party, both the president and first lady realize they have something to hold over their rival\u2019s head. What it is, exactly, remains unclear. Which is maddening; these two talk to each other the way some people \u201cvaguebook\u201d on Facebook.But surely that\u2019s intentional on the part of the writers. As the first Netflix original series and one whose success relies, in part, on its binge-worthiness, \u201cHouse of Cards\u201d knows there\u2019s as much value in keeping things mysterious as there is in all that Pollyhop metadata.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "\u2018The End of Karma,\u2019 by Somini Sengupta", "Date": "2016-03-18", "News": "Supported byWhen you purchase an independently reviewed book through our site, we earn an affiliate commission.In November 1949, India had been independent for slightly more than two years, and through that duration, a drafting committee labored to devise a constitution for the new nation. The work was nearly finished, but critics grumbled about how long it had taken; one pundit thought the panel ought to have been called the \u201cdrifting committee.\u201d B.\u2009R. Ambedkar, the Columbia-educated lawyer heading the group, defended his colleagues. Their task was difficult. The constitution incorporated 395 articles and 2,473 amendments, a density that reflected India\u2019s complications \u2014 its iniquities of caste, its poverty, its various languages and faiths. India already had political democracy (one vote per citizen), but the constitution also needed to foster social democracy. \u201cHow long shall we continue to deny equality in our social and economic life?\u201d Ambedkar said in a speech. \u201cWe must remove this contradiction at the earliest possible moment, or else those who suffer from inequality will blow up the structure of political \u00addemocracy.\u201dThe lives of India\u2019s poor and its lowest castes have improved in many ways, but the country remains riddled with inequality; in fact, over the last 35 years the gulf between the wealthiest and the most impoverished has widened. In \u201cThe End of Karma,\u201d Somini Sengupta delivers a portentous warning that echoes Ambedkar\u2019s, updated for the present. A quarter of India\u2019s 1.25 billion people are younger than 15; every month, until 2030, nearly a million Indians will turn 18, raring for more education and employment prospects. The size and energy of such a work force is a nation\u2019s dream \u2014 the celebrated \u201cdemographic dividend.\u201d But the state\u2019s failure to supply these young people with schools, universities and jobs, and to help them climb into prosperity, will tug India into perilous waters, Sengupta writes. \u201cIn the coming years, India can thrive because of its young. Or it can implode. Or both. There\u2019s little time left.\u201dSengupta, a reporter for The New York Times, served as the newspaper\u2019s New Delhi bureau chief from 2005 to 2009. She had first left India 30 years earlier, when her father decided, in the teeth of a nationwide crackdown on civil liberties, to move the family to Canada and thence to the United States. Now, returning to a transformed nation \u2014 its economy in bloom, its cities abuzz \u2014 she sensed a fresh impatience of aspiration. Sengupta refers to the Hindu notion of karma, a preordained destiny based on the virtues and sins of previous lives, a psychic past that is impossible to escape. The invocation is loose. She avoids making the unwise argument that Hindu fatalism had, in earlier years, persuaded Indians to be resigned to their hardscrabble times. It is only that, right now, \u201cthe demands of India\u2019s young are pushing India to break free of its past. They are no longer willing to put up with their lot.\u201d\u201cThe End of Karma\u201d shifts in and out of three modes of narrative. The weakest involves Sengupta\u2019s recollections of a childhood in India and North America, as well as her decision, during the stint in New Delhi, to adopt a baby girl. Her interest in India\u2019s youth, she suggests, was quickened by this entry into her life by her daughter, a bona fide member of these restless generations, a unit of India\u2019s demographic dividend. But much of this feels tenuous, the sort of material an editor commonly asks for, reproaching a writer because her manuscript is Not Personal Enough. The book\u2019s second mode is expository \u2014 summations of news, history and statistics, which Sengupta delivers in cool, swift language. Two pages about Laloo Prasad Yadav, a powerful politician in the state of Bihar, are a marvel of economy, laying bare his background, his machinery of caste politics, his wrecking of Bihar, and his folksy charisma.In the book\u2019s most vibrant sections, Sengupta profiles seven young Indians, shadowing some of them over years. All grew up in poor or lower-middle-class homes \u2014 the socioeconomic brackets that hold a majority of India\u2019s populace \u2014 and their lives illustrate the ways in which the state is failing its youth.A young woman named Rakhi from one of West Bengal\u2019s numerous underdeveloped villages joins a Maoist insurgency after her family slides suddenly into penury. She can list the people she has killed: \u201cEach leaves a vivid memory,\u201d Sengupta writes. \u201cThe time of day, the season of the year, the name of the victim.\u201d Near Mumbai, the police, provoked by a right-wing mob, arrest two girls who complained, on Facebook, that the city had come to a grinding halt just to accommodate a politician\u2019s funeral cortege. In Gurgaon, a 17-year-old named Varsha thirsts for more education, so that she can become a cop. Her father, who drives an auto rickshaw, has to be cajoled out of his reluctance: Schools cost money and pull his daughter too far out of the orbit of their world. \u201cHe loves her, but he also sabotages her. .\u2008.\u2008. She keeps pushing the bounds, and he has to figure out how far to let her go.\u201dSengupta\u2019s finest profile is of Anupam Kumar. In Patna, Bihar\u2019s capital, Anupam grew up in a tiny brick house with a corrugated tin roof; pigs prospected in a trash dump next door. His father, like Varsha\u2019s, drove an auto rickshaw. His mother, recognizing brightness in Anupam, scoured the neighborhood for affordable private schools and tuition classes, short-circuiting the abysmal, erratic government schools. \u201cThe latest survey results, from 2014, showed that most Indian children in Class 5 are functionally illiterate,\u201d Sengupta writes. \u201cMore than half cannot subtract.\u201dAnupam studied hard, entered the most competitive engineering school in the country, lost his way there, switched colleges, then got an M.B.A. and began working for India\u2019s equivalent of the Securities and Exchange Commission. \u201cAnupam is no Horatio Alger. His country is not a country of Horatio Algers,\u201d Sengupta notes carefully. His story gains its potency by hinting at the reserves of talent and intelligence within India, but also by revealing how close India is coming to squandering it all, content to watch only the prodigious few burst free of the gravitational field of their past.Samanth Subramanian is the India correspondent for The National.

{"Headline": "Time to Cuddle with Cruz?", "Date": "2016-03-06", "News": "Supported byJust when you think it can\u2019t get any worse for the sober-minded, cool-headed traditionalists in the Republican Party, it does. They see their gold-plated gate crasher taken down a peg, only to find themselves faced with the prospect of kissing up to Ted Cruz.On Saturday he matched Donald Trump\u2019s two victories, in Louisiana and Kentucky, with two of his own, in Kansas and Maine. He got substantially more delegates from the four contests overall than Trump did.And it was like the cosmically mischievous twist in an O. Henry story. The prayers, pleading and plotting of G.O.P. elders were answered: A rival candidate indeed gathered some steam, restrained Trump\u2019s momentum and staked an equal claim to at least one news cycle\u2019s headlines. But that candidate was a creature they find every bit as loathsome as the crass billionaire, if not more so.And then there was Marco Rubio.What in the world ever happened to Marco Rubio?To the Rubio who was supposed to be the party\u2019s savior and hope, I mean. The Rubio who made donors\u2019 hearts beat faster. The Rubio they kept foisting on Republican voters, except that the donors didn\u2019t see it as foisting. They saw it as benevolent instruction in which candidate was really best for all involved, which candidate could deny Democrats a third consecutive term in the White House.Rubio is essentially the Christmas fruitcake of the 2016 cycle: presented as a gift, received as something neither appetizing nor especially nutritive.With just four Republicans left in the race for the party\u2019s nomination, he notched three third-place finishes on Saturday and one fourth-place finish. In none of the contests did he beat Cruz. In none did he come close to Cruz \u2014 or even to 20 percent of the vote.It was a performance so poor, particularly in terms of the expectations that once swaddled Rubio, that Trump called on him to end his campaign, saying that the race was effectively down to two men, so why not make that the formal reality?Rubio will stay. His home state of Florida votes on March 15th, and he is betting everything on it, just as John Kasich, who finished fourth in three states on Saturday and third in one, is counting on Ohio, which he governs, and which also votes that day.At this point neither Rubio nor Kasich can hope for a majority of delegates or even, really, a plurality of them. They\u2019re after enough of them to prevent Trump from getting a majority himself.Trump\u2019s lead, on paper, isn\u2019t mammoth. After Saturday\u2019s contests, he had 378 delegates to 295 for Cruz.The states ahead of Cruz are less favorable to him, all in all, than the states behind him. Barring the implosion of Trump, he doesn\u2019t have a promising path to the nomination. Saturday\u2019s results didn\u2019t change that. They just solidified his standing as the most successful \u2014 so far \u2014 of the Republican candidates doing battle with Trump.And how exactly might Trump implode? It\u2019s harder than ever to imagine.With his tantrums, his apostasies, his vulgarity, his abundant flip-flops and his transparent lies, he has certainly done all he can to sabotage himself. It hasn\u2019t worked. And his Saturday victories came after a triumphantly odd debate performance on Thursday night and several days of increasingly impassioned anti-Trump appeals from an all-star Republican cast.There\u2019s another debate this coming Thursday. If Trump and Rubio continue their puerile trajectory, one of them will almost certainly give the other a wedgie, and the 2016 road to the White House will swerve yet again into uncharted and previously unimaginable terrain.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Politics of the Hoodie", "Date": "2016-03-02", "News": "Supported byOn ClothingOn a recent night, shopping online for a light jacket or a cotton sweater \u2014 some kind of outerwear to guard my body against a springlike breeze \u2014 I clicked on the \u2018\u2018new arrivals\u2019\u2019 page of the website of a popular retailer and encountered, unexpectedly, another instance of the complex oddity of race. Here, projecting catalog-model cordiality in the sterile space of an off-white backdrop, was a young black man in a hoodie.On the street, a black guy in a hoodie is just another of the many millions of men and boys dressed in the practical gear of an easygoing era. Or he should be. This is less an analysis than a wish. The electric charge of the isolated image \u2014 which provokes a flinch away from thought, a desire to evade the issue by moving on to check the sizing guide \u2014 attests to a consciousness of the hoodie\u2019s recent history of peculiar reception. In a cardigan or a crew neck, this model is just another model. In the hoodie, he is a folk demon and a scapegoat, a political symbol and a moving target, and the system of signs that weighs this upon him does not make special distinctions for an Italian cashmere hoodie timelessly designed in heather gray.At the computer, prodded out of the rhythm of browsing, I tried to imagine the meetings that led to this catalog model being placed in this hoodie, in the vacuum of commercial space. Beyond the usual earnest discussion of the styling of his pushed-up sleeves and the asymmetrical dangle of his drawstrings, there had to have been delicate conversations, informed by H.R. policy and P.C. etiquette, straightforward aesthetic concerns and knotty social ones. It is impossible that the production designers were ignorant of the ghost of Trayvon Martin, the unarmed 17-year-old fatally shot four years ago while wearing much the same thing. Did the model present a distraction from the reality on the streets? Did the art director start feeling somehow guilty for even considering such a question? The choice to put the kid in the picture must count as a modest political act, given the rich absurdity of the codes pertaining to a harmless piece of clothing.1968Members of the New York JetsWhich brings you to the transcript of the 911 call made by Trayvon Martin\u2019s killer. Dispatcher: \u2018\u2018Did you see what he was wearing?\u2019\u2019 George Zimmerman: \u2018\u2018Yeah. A dark hoodie, like a gray hoodie.\u2019\u2019 Triv\u00adial details can bear serious import. Surely there would have been demonstrations after the killing and the killer\u2019s acquittal regardless of what the victim wore. As it happened, those demonstrators \u2014 legislators on chamber floors, marchers in the street \u2014 picked up the sweatshirt as an emblem, donning hoods in solidarity. Instantly a symbol aggrieved at having to be one, the hoodie was jolted into a curious space: Where the basic hoodie means to defend against the elements, the protest hoodie seeks to offend the right people. In the paranoid view of stodgy shopkeepers, the hoodie is to be feared for extinguishing individuality; in its politicized life, it mutes identity to signal alliance, not unlike a resistance group\u2019s uniform.All that potential subtext is attached to a generally evocative item of clothing. The white working-class hoodie still glows with the Rocky Balboa ideal of grit and tenacity. The yoga-class hoodie is sold on a promise of snuggly virtue that may explain why in Saskatchewan they call the thing a \u2018\u2018bunny hug.\u2019\u2019 The tech-sector hoodie made default by Facebook\u2019s Mark Zuckerberg carries on the garment\u2019s proud juvenile tradition of informality and defiance. Once perceived as an affront to professionalism, it has since settled in as a convention.You must have seen a sitcom or TV commercial in which black actors wear hoodies in new millennial colors \u2014 mustard, maroon \u2014 to portray coders. In a current General Electric ad, for example, the costume functions as characterization, and the cheery color of the cotton somehow trumps that of the skin in terms of mass iconography. But the ascent of casual wear does not quite disguise the unchanging strictness of social codes, and the hood continues to frame matters of class and race in ways that tend to satisfy the interest of power. The lingering question of the hoodie is simply: Who enjoys the right to wear one without challenge?Troy Patterson is a contributing writer for the magazine.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Tairod Pugh, Ex-U.S. Serviceman, Is Found Guilty of Trying to Aid ISIS", "Date": "2016-03-09", "News": "Supported byA federal jury on Wednesday found a former United States serviceman guilty of trying to travel to Syria to join the Islamic State, the first such case involving the terrorist group to reach a verdict in a United States courtroom.The former serviceman, Tairod Pugh, 48, hung his head momentarily after the jury foreman in Federal District Court in Brooklyn announced the guilty verdict on the top charge, trying to support a foreign terrorist organization.Mr. Pugh, a skilled airplane mechanic from his time in the Air Force about 25 years ago, had been drifting across the Middle East in the year before his arrest in January 2015, finding work at small American airlines that flew in and out of far-flung military bases on Pentagon contracts.The jury rejected that defense, convicting Mr. Pugh of crimes that carry a potential 35-year sentence. In addition to the terrorism-related charge, he was also found guilty of obstruction of an official proceeding, for destroying several flash drives that the government claimed contained evidence against him.After the conviction, Robert Capers, the United States attorney for the Eastern District of New York, said in a statement that Mr. Pugh \u201chas now been held accountable for his crimes by a jury and will not reach the terrorist group he sought to support.\u201dAn 11-page complaint that sets forth the United States\u2019 charge that Tairod Nathan Webster Pugh attempted \u201cto provide material support and resources\u201d to ISIS.Some aspects of Mr. Pugh\u2019s case remain a mystery. When he landed in Istanbul in January 2015, the Turkish authorities quickly detained him before ultimately deporting him, through Cairo, to Kennedy International Airport, where the Federal Bureau of Investigation was waiting for him. It was unclear whether the Turkish authorities had grown suspicious of Mr. Pugh on their own, or had been alerted to his possible intentions by the United States government.It also emerged at trial that Mr. Pugh, a solitary figure drifting between jobs in places like Kuwait and Dubai, had cultivated a network of like-minded strangers on Facebook, including a Queens woman, Noelle Velentzas, who was mentioned in passing at the trial. Three months after Mr. Pugh was arrested, Ms. Velentzas was arrested in Queens on charges related to plotting a terror attack.Mr. Pugh did not testify and showed little emotion during the trial. After the verdict was read, he peered briefly past a row of reporters into the audience, to where his father and aunt sat, then quickly turned away.Mr. Pugh\u2019s father, Horace Pugh, said the entire case had been a shock to him, from the moment his son was arrested. \u201cI love him; he\u2019s my son,\u201d he told a group of reporters trailing him as he left the courthouse.Mr. Pugh\u2019s lawyers, Eric Creizman and Zachary Taylor, said that Mr. Pugh had demanded a trial from the start, insisting on his innocence. The lawyers said they intended to appeal the verdict on a number of grounds. In particular, they noted that the judge, Nicholas G. Garaufis, had allowed the jury to see the draft letter Mr. Pugh had addressed to his wife, as well as Facebook exchanges between them. Those communications, Mr. Taylor said, should have been excluded as privileged marital communications.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Hillary Clinton Starts Big Push to Win New York", "Date": "2016-03-30", "News": "Hillary Clinton presented herself as the quintessential hometown candidate on Wednesday afternoon as she kicked off her campaign for New York\u00e2\u0080\u0099s presidential primary on April 19, a contest that Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont is also determined to win in their battle for the Democratic nomination.Mrs. Clinton used a rally at the Apollo Theater in Harlem to recall her efforts on behalf of New Yorkers as one of their senators for eight years. In doing so she contrasted her concrete actions, like fighting for health care aid for emergency workers after the Sept. 11 attacks, to the ambitious promises of Mr. Sanders and the harsh language used by the leading Republican candidate, Donald J. Trump.Recalling her work in Harlem to combat a childhood asthma crisis when she was senator, Mrs. Clinton took an implicit shot at Mr. Sanders and his unabashedly liberal agenda, saying that she was focused on working with doctors and community leaders to get results.\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t about making a point. It was about making a difference,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mrs. Clinton said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cSome folks may have the luxury to hold out for the perfect, but a lot of Americans are hurting right now, and they can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t wait for that. They need the good, and they need it today.\u00e2\u0080\u009dMr. Sanders, who plans to hold a rally in the Bronx on Thursday afternoon, has developed a strong following among New York Democrats because of goals like a $15 minimum wage, free public colleges and Medicare-for-all universal health insurance. He spent Wednesday campaigning across Wisconsin, which holds its primary on Tuesday; Mrs. Clinton campaigned there on Monday and Tuesday, but her current schedule, through Sunday, does not have her returning there.The senator is far behind Mrs. Clinton in their race to accumulate the 2,383 delegates needed to win the Democratic nomination. He is counting on victories in Wisconsin and especially New York to pick up delegates and deal setbacks to Mrs. Clinton. It would be a humiliating blow for her to lose the New York primary, given her history and ties in the state; while it might not significantly affect her delegate lead, it would inevitably trigger questions about the strength of her candidacy and her appeal among liberals.As Mr. Sanders crisscrossed Wisconsin, he attacked Mrs. Clinton for supporting what he characterized as \u00e2\u0080\u009cdisastrous\u00e2\u0080\u009d trade policies that led to thousands of Wisconsin jobs being shipped overseas and several factories closing or scaling back across the state. He also criticized her for voting as a senator to authorize American military action in Iraq.At the Harlem rally, both Mrs. Clinton and Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, who introduced her, repeatedly invoked her history as a New Yorker \u00e2\u0080\u0094 she moved to the state to run for the Senate in 2000 \u00e2\u0080\u0094 to distinguish her from Mr. Sanders, even though he was born and raised in Brooklyn. Mr. Schumer, in a nod to Mr. Sanders\u00e2\u0080\u0099s thick Brooklyn accent, said of Mrs. Clinton, \u00e2\u0080\u009cshe may not always \u00e2\u0080\u0098tawk\u00e2\u0080\u0099 like we Brooklynites talk, but when she speaks out, she changes minds, she changes hearts, she moves to action and she changes outcomes.\u00e2\u0080\u009dMrs. Clinton said that she was as ambitious as any New Yorker but that Mr. Sanders\u2019s plans would never be realized because Congress would oppose them or because \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe numbers don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t add up.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00e2\u0080\u009cMy opponent says we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re just not thinking big enough,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, this is New York. No one dreams bigger than we do, but this is a city that likes to get things done, and that is what we want from our president, too.\u00e2\u0080\u009dMrs. Clinton had tougher words for Mr. Trump, saying he \u00e2\u0080\u009cplays coy with white supremacists\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u0094 Mr. Trump was slow to disavow the support of David Duke, the former Ku Klux Klan leader \u00e2\u0080\u0093 and \u00e2\u0080\u009csays demeaning and degrading things about women.\u00e2\u0080\u009d She also used the same language from a new campaign commercial, which says New Yorkers of all races and backgrounds pull together to tackle major problems and implicitly derides Mr. Trump for offering solutions like building a wall on the Mexican border.\u00e2\u0080\u009cOur diversity is a strength, not a weakness,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cTogether we can face down the worst.\u00e2\u0080\u009dShe also bashed Mr. Trump for promoting the use of torture against enemy combatants and suggesting that Japan and South Korea may need their own nuclear weapons, and lumped those remarks with a recent comment by Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, another Republican candidate, about fighting terrorism by increasing surveillance of Muslim neighborhoods in America.\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t make them sound strong \u00e2\u0080\u0094 it makes them sound in over their heads,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou know, loose cannons tend to misfire. And in a dangerous world, that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not a gamble we can afford.\u00e2\u0080\u009dMr. Trump and Mr. Cruz have both sharply criticized Mrs. Clinton\u00e2\u0080\u0099s foreign policy ideas as weak and wrongheaded, saying she would continue President Obama\u00e2\u0080\u0099s \u00e2\u0080\u009cfailed\u00e2\u0080\u009d approach to combating the Islamic State and preventing terrorist attacks.Mrs. Clinton has shrugged off such attacks, and bragged in Harlem at one point that she had received nearly 9 million votes in the primaries so far \u00e2\u0080\u0094 about a million more than Mr. Trump and 2.5 million more than Mr. Sanders. She pledged to \u00e2\u0080\u009cwork for every vote in every part of this state,\u00e2\u0080\u009d and has scheduled campaign events in Westchester County on Thursday and Syracuse on Friday.\u00e2\u0080\u009cNew Yorkers took a chance on me, and I will never forget that,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said, referring to her election to the Senate in 2000. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou have always had my back, and I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve always tried to have yours.\u00e2\u0080\u009d A few moments later, she drew strong applause when she added, \u00e2\u0080\u009cNow I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m once against asking for your confidence and your vote.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\t\tFirst Draft provides fast-paced and comprehensive coverage of politics and elections by The New York Times.

{"Headline": "Tensions Simmer as a Small Town Seeks Answers in a Boy\u2019s Killing", "Date": "2016-03-05", "News": "The case against a soccer coach charged with murdering a former girlfriend\u2019s 12-year-old son in upstate New York raises questions of racial bias and overreaching.Supported byPOTSDAM, N.Y. \u2014 At the southern edge of this village near the Canadian border, a small billboard slowly comes into focus. On the left is a black-and-white photo of a boy, reminiscent of so many missing-children posters; to the right are the words \u201cUnsolved Murder.\u201dIn these parts, the photo of the boy \u2014 bowl-cut blond hair, bright eyes, smiling face \u2014 is a familiar sight, as is its accompanying plea: \u201cHelp Us Get Justice for Garrett.\u201dGarrett Phillips, a popular and outgoing 12-year-old, was strangled in his home in fall 2011. The murder set off a mad, all-consuming pursuit for a killer in a region where such crimes are extraordinarily rare.The investigation has garnered widespread attention in part because of the case\u2019s pulp-fiction filigree: a gruesome murder of a child, hints of a love triangle and faded affairs and a small town on edge over the idea of a coldblooded killer living in its midst or still on the run.Amid all that is an unsettling undercurrent of racial tension, at a time of simmering national debate over racial bias in law enforcement.A black man who had dated the boy\u2019s mother was a suspect from the start. The man, Oral Nicholas Hillary, known as Nick, is a former United States Army tank gunner originally from Jamaica who parlayed his success as a local college soccer player into a job here as the men\u2019s soccer coach at Clarkson University.In the long lead-up to the prosecution of Mr. Hillary, his supporters have highlighted not only the absence of physical evidence but the lack of any plausible motive or history that would suggest he was capable of murdering a child. They have also said that another man, a local sheriff\u2019s deputy who once dated Garrett\u2019s mother, was removed from suspicion too quickly.But the authorities say they have the right man. They believe that Mr. Hillary killed Garrett as a way of punishing the boy\u2019s mother for breaking up with him about a month before the crime. The mother, Tandy Cyrus, is white, as was Garrett.They say that Mr. Hillary followed Garrett home and throttled him, leaving the boy for dead, and clumsily clambered out a back window as the police closed in, a frantic escape that left him with a telltale limp.They say Mr. Hillary\u2019s alibi \u2014 that he was with his daughter and then at a colleague\u2019s house when the killing occurred \u2014 is undercut by assorted evidence, including surveillance video taken that day that shows Mr. Hillary\u2019s vehicle near Garrett as the boy heads home.\u201cI can\u2019t think of any other person who would want to hurt Garrett,\u201d Ms. Cyrus said in a statement to the police after her son died.\u201cIt was like a meteor hitting,\u201d said Ron Tischler, the mayor of Potsdam, home to around 9,600 residents that is about 25 miles south of Ontario.Mr. Hillary has also accused the county prosecutor, Mary Rain, of forsaking justice in the name of keeping a campaign promise: Ms. Rain was elected in 2013, in part on the strength of campaigning with Ms. Cyrus and promising to focus the energies of her small office on Garrett\u2019s murder.Ms. Rain has enlisted William Fitzpatrick, a respected district attorney from the Syracuse area, to assist in the case.And there are hints that the prosecution may try to link Mr. Hillary to the scene of the crime using low-template DNA analysis, which draws on small and sometimes mixed samples of biological material. The process, which often uses probabilities, has been disputed in some scientific realms.The suspicions and repercussions surrounding the boy\u2019s death have rippled through time and distance. A key defense witness, for instance, suddenly discovered \u201cJustice for Garrett\u201d signs posted near his new workplace and home \u2014 each hundreds of miles from Potsdam. Mr. Hillary, now free on bail, found himself rearrested in September for allegedly violating an order of protection by using a drive-through A.T.M. at the bank where Ms. Cyrus worked. The prominent civil rights lawyer Norman Siegel has consulted with the defense on the case, believing Mr. Hillary to be innocent.In Mr. Hillary\u2019s view, the prosecution\u2019s zeal \u2014 as well as the way he has been treated since Garrett\u2019s death \u2014 may revolve on one other salient detail.\u201cIt goes to show the color of my skin,\u201d Mr. Hillary said in a soft Caribbean cadence.Making a Chilling DiscoveryGarrett Phillips was an ebullient child despite an early-life tragedy: When he was a toddler, his father, Robert \u2014 an amiable grounds worker at the State University of New York at Potsdam \u2014 suffered a brain aneurysm and never recovered. He died before Garrett was 3.Though Garrett never knew his father, the boy emulated him as he grew. Like his father, he hunted and fished; played any sport involving a ball; and balanced his rowdy and respectful sides, rambunctious sometimes in public but polite to family and strangers.\u201cHe was just very energetic, fun-loving,\u201d Brian Phillips, Garrett\u2019s uncle, said. \u201cJust a really well-mannered boy. Just a normal 12-year-old. Just a good kid.\u201dGarrett and his younger half brother, Aaron Collins, lived with their mother at 100 Market Street, a run-down two-story apartment building on a busy byway lined with fast-food outlets and auto shops. Apartment 4, their home, was on the second floor, its hallway illuminated by a bug-infested neon light. But the location was convenient: Potsdam\u2019s public schools complex was a few blocks to the east.On the afternoon of Oct. 24, 2011, Garrett was playing basketball at the middle school with some friends as rain fell intermittently. A little before 5 p.m., Tandy Cyrus called his cellphone and told him to go home to do schoolwork.Garrett got on his caster board \u2014 something of a cross between a skateboard and a snowboard \u2014 and headed home, his progress captured by a series of surveillance cameras and later described in a police timeline.The indictment against Nick Hillary puts the time of the attack between 4:56 p.m. and 5:30 p.m. According to police records, the first sign that something was wrong came around 5:07 p.m., when a neighbor, Marissa Vogel, called 911 to report that she thought she \u201cheard some screaming, like \u2018No!\u2019 and \u2018Help!\u2019\u201d coming from Apartment 4.Ms. Vogel was initially unsure what the noises were \u2014 she and her boyfriend were watching the serial-killer drama \u201cDexter\u201d at the time \u2014 but she soon went out to the narrow hallway and knocked on the door. Then, she told the 911 operator, \u201cI heard the lock click.\u201dPatrolman Mark Wentworth arrived around 5:15 and reported hearing the faint sound of footsteps deep inside the apartment. A dispatcher called the building\u2019s maintenance manager, Richard Dumas, to bring a key. At 5:24 p.m., Patrolman Wentworth reported hearing a faint sound of possible movement in the apartment \u2014 \u201ca single person walking around\u201d \u2014 though a police investigator suggested later it might have been Garrett in distress.Mr. Dumas and Patrolman Wentworth entered the apartment shortly after. What they found was chilling.\u201cI ran to the threshold of the bedroom and looked in,\u201d Mr. Dumas said in a statement to the police. He saw Garrett on his back, clothed in a T-shirt and a pair of checkered shorts, with his head and shoulder against the wall. \u201cHe looked like he was sleeping,\u201d Mr. Dumas said. But \u201cHis face looked dark.\u201dPatrolman Wentworth and Mr. Dumas began to administer CPR.\u201cI kept telling him, \u2018Come on, buddy, wake up!\u2019\u201d Mr. Dumas said.Garrett was taken to Canton-Potsdam Hospital, which he had skated past just hours before. Doctors tried to resuscitate him, and relatives began to gather.Combing the apartment for evidence, investigators found a possible clue: The screen of the bedroom window, about 20 feet off the ground, was \u201cbent outward,\u201d according to the incident report. A tile seemed to be broken on the roof of a lower section of the building, about 10 feet below, and there was a gash in the grass.The police did not know how the attacker had gained access to the apartment, but they thought they knew how he had gotten out.A few hours later, they were at Nick Hillary\u2019s door.Feeling Cultural BoundariesSince arriving in the United States in 1990, Nick Hillary had steadily built a reputation as a soccer player, a coach and a charmer, equally popular with male friends and female fans.His appeal, as both a coach and a person, is evident: His energy is intense, but his smile is unencumbered. He said he had always loved the North Country region\u2019s rural mountains and summertime greenery \u2014 when it was warm it reminded him of Jamaica \u2014 though he was aware of the cultural boundaries beyond campus.\u201cYou\u2019re a black person,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cYou were viewed as such.\u201dA year after being hired by Clarkson, Mr. Hillary found that his relationship with his longtime girlfriend, Stacia Lee, the mother of his three children, was struggling. At a bar called Ton\u2019s, he became acquainted with a bartender, Tandy Cyrus.Raised in the neighboring town of Parishville, Ms. Cyrus was regarded in town as a smart, vivacious woman who bore a passing resemblance to the actress Robin Wright.In her 20s, Ms. Cyrus had married a local man, Casey Collins, and had a second child, Aaron, with him. The couple separated in 2006 and later divorced, and Ms. Cyrus began a relationship with a sheriff\u2019s deputy, John Jones, though Mr. Collins remained close with Garrett.Ms. Cyrus shared Deputy Jones\u2019s interest in law enforcement \u2014 doing field training with a local police department and the county sheriff \u2014 and the two also ran a coffee shop together. But the cafe closed, and the relationship ended in August 2010. Shortly after that, Ms. Cyrus came home from a bartending shift \u2014 the two were still living together \u2014 and Deputy Jones pushed her.\u201cThat was the last straw for me,\u201d Ms. Cyrus said, according to a draft of a deposition she gave to the police after Garrett was killed. Mr. Hillary and Ms. Cyrus began seeing each other shortly after that fight, in September 2010.In an interview with Grantland, Deputy Jones acknowledged confronting Mr. Hillary but denied threatening him, saying he was just trying to \u201chave him man up.\u201d\u201cI go, \u2018Listen. Help me understand. Are you and Tandy together?\u2019\u201d Deputy Jones said.Ms. Cyrus, 37, declined to be interviewed for this article, but Mr. Hillary said he had been harassed because of his relationship with her. \u201cIt\u2019s not a community with a lot of interracial relationships,\u201d he said, adding that he had \u201cto be mindful\u201d when he was out. \u201cI would go to the local restaurant,\u201d he said, and Deputy Jones\u2019s \u201cfriends would come up to me and like, \u2018You know you\u2019re not supposed to be dating John\u2019s girl.\u2019\u201dA few months after they met, Mr. Hillary and Ms. Cyrus moved in together, forming a household of five, including his teenage daughter, Shanna-Kay, and Ms. Cyrus\u2019s two sons.The couple had different approaches to parenting, with Ms. Cyrus telling the police that Mr. Hillary was controlling and judgmental.\u201cNick would sit me down almost on a weekly basis, and he would tell me everything that was wrong with my kids,\u201d Ms. Cyrus said in the draft deposition she gave to the police, adding that Mr. Hillary had an undue need for structure and planning. And, she said, her children \u2014 particularly Garrett \u2014 \u201cdid not like Nick.\u201dPatricia Phillips, Garrett\u2019s grandmother, shared this view. \u201cMy grandson would be here at night and get ready to have to go back down there and cry because he didn\u2019t want to go home,\u201d she said, sitting in her home in Parishville, surrounded by smiling pictures and portraits of Garrett and her son Robert.Mr. Hillary insisted that he and Garrett got along: He said he helped Garrett with homework and had attended his basketball games, treating the boy the same way he treated his own son, Lashaka-mani, who was two years younger.\u201cI interacted with him as much as I could interact with him in the same manner as I would interact with my son,\u201d Mr. Hillary said. \u201cIt\u2019s not like we had a hostile relationship.\u201dMr. Hillary said he deferred to Mr. Collins as Garrett\u2019s father figure. He added, \u201cThe guidelines for Tandy\u2019s kids were set by Tandy; the guidelines for my kids were definitely set by me,\u201d saying, for example, that his children were not allowed to watch television on school nights.At the end of summer 2011, Ms. Cyrus and her two sons moved out \u2014 \u201cto be on our own,\u201d she recalled \u2014 relocating to 100 Market Street. Mr. Hillary said the move was designed to spare Garrett from being teased about his mother\u2019s interracial relationship and to give his daughter more space for herself.\u201cI decided, \u2018O.K., I\u2019ll get my own place, she will have her own place,\u2019 but we were still a couple,\u201d he said.What started as a separation, however, soon became a split. Ms. Cyrus began dating another man, according to her draft deposition, and reconnected with Deputy Jones as well. She said that Mr. Hillary harassed her with text messages after the breakup. She also accused him of showing up at 100 Market Street unannounced \u2014 letting himself in, once in the middle of the night, she told the police \u2014 and warning her about being disrespectful to him by dancing with other men.Mr. Hillary strongly denied this, calling such accounts \u201ctotally fabricated\u201d and noting that no police record of such harassment exists. Ms. Cyrus told the police that \u201cNick always blamed Garrett for our breakup,\u201d but Mr. Hillary said the decision to end the relationship had not been acrimonious. After they did call it quits, near the end of September 2011, he said, he returned a key he had for her apartment at 100 Market Street and never entered the unit again.The police think differently.Focusing on an Ex-BoyfriendGarrett Phillips had not been dead long when Lt. Mark Murray showed up at Nick Hillary\u2019s door.In a deposition, Lieutenant Murray said that Edward F. Tischler, the Potsdam police chief then, told him to inform Mr. Hillary of the death and \u201cask him if he had any information that would help us.\u201d (Mr. Tischler is the brother of Mayor Ron Tischler of Potsdam.)Lieutenant Murray said the visit was not investigative in nature, but police records and statements show the police quickly homed in on Mr. Hillary. The morning after the murder \u2014 even before the coroner had deemed Garrett\u2019s death a homicide \u2014 Lieutenant Murray told a local prosecutor that the authorities were focusing on a boyfriend and cutting \u201coff the heads of any accusations\u201d that other children might have attacked Garrett, an early rumor, according to a recording of the conversation obtained by The New York Times.A search-warrant application indicates that several family members had already spoken to the police, including Brian Phillips, Garrett\u2019s uncle, who said he had seen Mr. Hillary\u2019s sport utility vehicle near the apartment before the crime.Security videos taken that day, described in a police timeline, show Garrett gliding alongside a high school parking lot at about 4:52 p.m. as a light-blue Honda CR-V \u2014 driven by Mr. Hillary \u2014 sits near a row of trees on the north side of the small lot. Seconds after Garrett skates past, Mr. Hillary\u2019s S.U.V. pulls out of its parking spot and heads in the same general direction as Garrett: south, and away from Mr. Hillary\u2019s home, the authorities note.Another video, taken by a camera at Canton-Potsdam Hospital, across from the school, then shows Garrett passing a small gray house where a black pickup truck has just parked. A police timeline identifies the driver as Deputy John Jones arriving at his home, where he once lived with Tandy Cyrus. According to the timeline, the video shows Deputy Jones leaving the house and walking his dog about 20 minutes after Garrett has passed by.Mr. Hillary said he was at the Potsdam public schools complex at the time to scout high school soccer players. He said he left because it was halftime and there was a \u201ctorrential downpour\u201d so severe he had to remain in his vehicle.Mr. Hillary said he initially turned south to go to his office but decided instead to go home to discuss dinner plans with Shanna-Kay, then visited his assistant coach, Ian Fairlie, who lived around the corner from 100 Market Street.Mr. Hillary said he wanted to tell Mr. Fairlie about a meeting he planned to hold with an injured player, Jacob Duff, before a practice scheduled for 6 p.m. that day.Mr. Fairlie said Mr. Hillary had visited him at 5:21 p.m. He was certain of the time, he said, because he had just made a cellphone call when Mr. Hillary arrived. Nothing about Mr. Hillary\u2019s behavior struck him as unusual.\u201cHe just walked in, the same friendly guy I\u2019ve ever met,\u201d he said. Mr. Hillary left after only a minute or two, and the two men soon reconvened in Mr. Hillary\u2019s office for the meeting with Mr. Duff, who never showed up.Mr. Duff told the police he had good reason to miss the meeting: It was a fabrication.On the evening of the murder, after he was approached by the police, Mr. Duff wrote a Facebook post suggesting that he and the coach had never had a meeting scheduled.\u201cI have the chat log,\u201d Mr. Duff wrote. \u201cSo you should probably just start telling the truth now.\u201dLieutenant Murray saw Mr. Duff as deeply credible. \u201cI just can\u2019t bring myself to fathom why a collegiate person playing on a Division III soccer team with his entire future ahead of him would lie and perjure himself on a sworn statement for no reason,\u201d he said.On the evening after the murder, Lieutenant Murray went to watch Clarkson\u2019s men\u2019s soccer squad and videotaped Mr. Hillary coaching the penultimate game of a rough season. (The 2011 Clarkson squad had more losses than goals.)An Absence of Hard EvidenceA little more than 36 hours after Garrett Phillips died, the police brought Nick Hillary and Ian Fairlie in for interrogations.Mr. Fairlie said he told detectives the same story he has repeated to this day: Mr. Hillary arrived at his apartment at 5:21 p.m., briefed him about the upcoming meeting with Jacob Duff and left. (The case has seemed to follow Mr. Fairlie: After leaving Potsdam in 2012, he was surprised to find that someone had posted \u201cJustice for Garrett\u201d signs near a new job in Buffalo and, later, near his home in Owego, N.Y. \u201cThey were absolutely following me,\u201d he said of the signs.)As the men were being questioned, detectives searched for damning evidence. They seized Mr. Hillary\u2019s phone and examined the contents of his pockets and his socks. Nude photographs, fingerprints and palm prints were taken. Mr. Hillary\u2019s car was searched. (The timing of the seizures, and of the subsequent search warrants, has been a focus of Mr. Hillary\u2019s civil suit.) The police also obtained his DNA from a coffee cup and the butt of a cigarette.That night, the police obtained a search warrant for Mr. Hillary\u2019s home. It detailed what they were hunting for: soiled clothing, muddy sneakers, first-aid kits, used ice packs, receipts or \u201cany physical or trace evidence that connects Oral N. Hillary with the victim.\u201dThe police thought they recovered solid physical evidence at the crime scene: latent fingerprints from the exit window, markings on the windowsill and hair and tissue samples on the lower roof. But the police would find that the fingerprints did not match Mr. Hillary\u2019s \u2014 or those of anyone who lived at 100 Market Street \u2014 and the DNA taken from the scene was \u201cneither inclusive nor exclusive\u201d of Mr. Hillary, according to Lieutenant Murray. The tissue and hair samples did not pan out either, nor did the search for any witnesses.\u201cThe results we got back have not placed him at that crime scene,\u201d Edward R. Tischler, the former police chief, said in a sworn deposition.As for John Jones, a sheriff\u2019s deputy, it seemed clear that the authorities had quickly removed him from suspicion.On the morning after the murder, for instance, as Tandy Cyrus arrived at the police station to get an update, Deputy Jones was with her and allowed to sit in on the meeting with Lt. Mark Murray.Deputy Jones was also friendly with both Chief Tischler and Lieutenant Murray: In depositions taken in 2014, the chief said he had seen Deputy Jones and Ms. Cyrus together at local bars, while the lieutenant and the deputy played on the same adult hockey team.Deputy Jones would stay close to the investigation, even offering leads to pursue. At one point, a police document shows, he delivered a key to Ms. Cyrus\u2019s apartment to compare with any found at Mr. Hillary\u2019s home.Deputy Jones has denied any involvement in the crime and declined to be interviewed by The Times. But he left a voice mail message stating his confidence in the circumstantial evidence of the case and said that Mr. Hillary was \u201cplaying every card he can for sympathy.\u201d\u201cRegardless of what color skin he is,\u201d he said, \u201cthis man murdered a young 12-year-old boy.\u201dA Prosecutor\u2019s \u2018Top Priority\u2019She was not down for long. In September 2013, Ms. Rain was standing on the steps of the county courthouse as a candidate for district attorney. And Tandy Cyrus was standing beside her.Ms. Rain, a Republican, sharply criticized her opponent, Nicole Duve, a popular incumbent Democrat, for not doing more to solve Garrett\u2019s case, in which Ms. Duve had declined to make an arrest because of what she considered a lack of evidence. \u201cWhat I told them was,\u201d Ms. Rain said in an interview in her office in Canton, \u201cit was going to be my top priority.\u201d Ms. Cyrus was apparently grateful: A few days before the 2013 election, she wrote an unflattering and widely publicized post about Ms. Duve on Facebook.\u201cEveryone said, \u2018You\u2019ve got a totally good case,\u2019\u00a0\u201d Ms. Rain said.That fall, however, Justice Jerome J. Richards of St. Lawrence County State Supreme Court dismissed the case and chastised Ms. Rain for her behavior in front of the grand jury, noting \u201cimproper questions, direct and indirect expressions of opinion and use of numerous exhibits without proper foundation.\u201dMs. Rain credited the \u201cJustice for Garrett\u201d movement \u2014 Brian Phillips, Garrett\u2019s uncle, sold and distributed thousands of posters bearing the slogan and raised $40,000 for a reward fund \u2014 with keeping \u201cthis case alive.\u201dMr. Phillips, a genial father of two, has indeed been central to the case, through his steady, if soft-spoken, advocacy for the prosecution and his statement to the police that he had seen Mr. Hillary near the scene of the crime on the day of the murder. He expects to testify at Mr. Hillary\u2019s trial.The Phillipses all believe Mr. Hillary is guilty, and the pain of losing Garrett \u2014 and his father a decade before \u2014 is still immediate. But the expression of it can sometimes be ugly. In conversation, Mr. Phillips \u2014 whose Facebook page is peppered with positive affirmations, remembrances of Garrett and occasionally crude comments \u2014 referred to Mr. Hillary with a racial slur. Asked about this in an interview, he said he generally did not use the term, but offered this explanation: \u201cHe\u2019s not human. He\u2019s not normal.\u201dHe added, \u201cAnybody who can do that doesn\u2019t deserve the respect to be even called...,\u201d he trailed off, before saying, \u201cI\u2019m not racist.\u201dAwaiting His Day in CourtMary Rain acknowledged that race might play a role in Nick\u2019s Hillary trial, particularly in jury selection, but said it had not affected the prosecution. \u201cI\u2019m colorblind when it comes to justice,\u201d she said.Yet, in an interview, Ms. Rain suggested that there was more physical evidence than it seemed, but that a gag order prevented the prosecution from being more forthcoming. She said she did not believe the case would be hard to prove, and supporters of the prosecution believe Mr. Hillary\u2019s statements in his civil suit may be useful against him.For his part, Mr. Hillary became an American citizen in 2011 and has been awaiting trial in Potsdam, living with Stacia Lee and their children, who now number five. No matter how the trial ends, he said, he had already been punished, having lost his job, his life savings and his place in the community.\u201cIt has been total destruction of everything I\u2019ve worked to build over the years,\u201d he said.He said he was ready for any questions he might face at trial. Why, for instance, did Mr. Duff say there had been no meeting?\u201cIt\u2019s not the first meeting that he ever missed,\u201d Mr. Hillary said. \u201cAnd he\u2019s not the first player to have ever missed a meeting.\u201dWhy was he described as so strict with children?\u201cWhat they\u2019re calling strict is more a structure for success,\u201d he said.And finally, a more direct query.\u201cDid you kill Garrett?\u201dMr. Hillary answered immediately.\u201cNo,\u201d he said, \u201cI did not.\u201dJack Begg contributed research.Advertisement"}

Two suspects were in custody on Sunday night in connection with the attack in Landover, Md. The authorities identified the officer killed as Jacai Colson, 28, a four-year veteran of the Prince George\u2019s County police force.One of the suspects was believed to be the gunman, who the police said was struck during the gunfight and was in custody at a hospital. The second suspect was brought in for questioning. Charges were pending on Sunday night, the police said.The gunman fired on the station around 4:30 p.m. Officer Colson returned fire but was fatally shot, the police said in a statement.

A debate soon erupted on the Lands\u2019 End Facebook page.While the original interview drew the ire of anti-abortion activists, it did not broach the topic of abortion. Ms. Steinem instead talked about the need for an Equal Rights Amendment that would formally acknowledge that men and women have equal rights.A spokeswoman for Lands\u2019 End, Michele Casper, declined to comment Monday on the future of the interview series, and would not say how many schools had cut ties with the company.Lands\u2019 End, a catalog-based company that made its name by selling primary-colored chunky sweaters and khakis, has in recent years struggled to reinvent itself. But now its first order of business appears to be weathering criticism from both sides of the abortion debate.Kristie Wolfe, the president and principal of Father Tolton Catholic High School in Columbia, Mo., said in an interview that parents began emailing her in droves after receiving catalogs in the mail last week.\u201cWhen they honored Gloria Steinem, she has so much of her work working for abortion rights,\u201d Ms. Wolfe said, \u201cwhich is contrary from what the Catholic system believes.\u201dBlaine Edens, an assistant to Ms. Steinem, said in an email that Ms. Steinem was not available to comment on the controversy, but added that \u201cher stance on all issues remains the same, so this is really for Lands\u2019 End to comment on.\u201dAdvertisement"}

The interview has been condensed and edited for clarity.What\u2019s obvious is that it\u2019s not just important to open cases, but important to close cases, too. But as some of the antitrust cases we have ongoing are huge, that\u2019s not necessarily going to happen in 2016. I expect in the merger field we will keep busy, and we\u2019ll keep our focus on antitrust and state aid issues.Since we aren\u2019t done yet, we can\u2019t yet go through the different elements of the statement of objections. But Google gave us a very substantial answer, and what we need to do is ask them for more data to have a comprehensive picture so they aren\u2019t just giving us data that solely substantiates their position.It\u2019s a huge task. We\u2019re doing our best with the analysis, but it\u2019s also interesting to see how legitimate third parties [that have filed complaints in the case] also look at it.I have learned that to do antitrust at this volume takes the patience of steel. Speed is itself a quality because we have big companies whose names are being mentioned over and over again, so you have to think about that.But speed isn\u2019t a quality unto itself. You can\u2019t substitute justice with speed. You need to be able to say this will hold up in court. Then, speed is a secondary issue.That depends. Other complaints related to online mapping or local search are similar, as they say Google uses its position to promote itself in neighboring markets. That is very similar to the current statement of objections.The biggest American tech companies face intensifying scrutiny by European regulators, with \u2014 pressure that could potentially curb their sizable profits in the region and affect how they operate around the world.Then we have issues that are different in nature. One is scraping [allegations that Google copies content from other sites]; another is the question of advertising [claims that Google abuses its dominance in advertising contracts]; and then we have Android, which is almost another planet. We will become much wiser as we go in-depth in these areas.It\u2019s not black or white. The questions people have been asking are whether data can be duplicated, and can a competitor establish itself in the same way or buy a copy of another\u2019s data?So far, the analysis shows that data can be copied or newly created without any detrimental effects to competitors. That\u2019s why I have approached this area with a very open mind.That doesn\u2019t necessarily have to be a problem.But I still think Adam Smith was right when he said there\u2019s no such thing as a free lunch. Eventually, you will pay in one form or the other. And it\u2019s that \u201cother\u201d that is still hard to grasp because we are just in the process of truly appreciating the value of our own data.National tax legislation and European state aid rules need to be fulfilled at the same time. For me, it\u2019s a simple question of fair competition.Companies compete door to door with similar products, prices and services. If one company has higher costs and another company has lower costs solely because of aggressive tax arrangements, then you have a problem.There\u2019s a lot of convenience in that argument. I\u2019ve been asking my people to give me the statistics to find a bias, and I can find no bias. Not in the mergers, not in the fines being paid out, there\u2019s no U.S. bias. It also ignores the fact that we often react to complaints from U.S. companies.These are huge companies that play a very strong role in the market. But you still have many, many, many more companies that are on their way, that want to make it into the market, and that need open markets for the incentive to innovate.Advertisement"}

Hundreds of protesters, who had promised to be a visible presence here and filled several sections of the arena, let out an elated, unstopping cheer. Mr. Trump\u2019s supporters, many of whom had waited hours to see the Republican front-runner, seemed stunned and slowly filed out in anger.Around the country, protesters have interrupted virtually every Trump rally, but his planned appearance here \u2014 in a city run for decades by Democrats and populated by nearly equal thirds of blacks, Latinos and whites \u2014 had drawn some particularly incensed responses since it was announced days ago.The canceled rally came on a day that Mr. Trump sought to move past the primary fight, saying that the party needed to come together behind him.Elsewhere, Mr. Trump\u2019s security has tried to identify and exclude potential demonstrators before they enter his events, but large groups of protesters had waited in line for seats here, and engaged in tense disputes with Trump supporters even as the University of Illinois at Chicago Pavilion was still filling up. For more than an hour before the event was to begin, security teams led protesters out, one by one, but many more remained, sparring with Trump supporters.In a statement, Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign said that he \u201chas determined that for the safety of all of the tens of thousands of people that have gathered in and around the arena, tonight\u2019s rally will be postponed to another date.\u201d\u201cThank you very much for your attendance and please go in peace,\u201d the statement said.On MSNBC, Mr. Trump said that after meeting with the law enforcement authorities, \u201cI felt it was just safer. I don\u2019t want to see anybody get hurt.\u201dAsked about the images of people clashing at the rally, Mr. Trump said, \u201cHonestly, we have a very divided country.\u201dMr. Trump\u2019s opponents, Senator Marco Rubio, Senator Ted Cruz and Gov. John Kasich, condemned the disruptions, but said Mr. Trump was responsible for the tenor of his rallies. Mr. Cruz said Mr. Trump \u201caffirmatively encourages violence.\u201dFor hours, the Chicago police, along with university officers, the federal authorities and others, were out here in force. A Chicago police spokesman said that city law enforcement authorities were not consulted and had no role in canceling the event. The spokesman said there had been five arrests, two by the Chicago police, two by the university\u2019s police and one by the Illinois State Police. The fire department said three people, including a police officer, were injured.The University of Illinois at Chicago draws a significant share of students from Chicago\u2019s neighborhoods, and has a large number of international students, and planned protests were publicized on social media. Around 10,000 people had signed up on Facebook to take part in one anti-Trump march. Scores of faculty members had pleaded with administrators over allowing the rally in a letter, which read, in part: \u201cWe also request that the university publicly distance itself from the event and make a statement that the Trump rally is an anathema to the mission of U.I.C.\u201dIn the hours before the event, inside the 9,500-seat arena, Mr. Trump\u2019s backers were energized. Some dressed in outfits to match his, and chanted \u201cTrump! Trump! Trump!\u201d as they waited.But the situation grew tense as the size of the protest crowd became clear, and as some yelled anti-Trump slogans and skirmished with the supporters. Three men in T-shirts that read, \u201cMuslims United Against Trump,\u201d departed early on, delighting the pro-Trump crowd.Outside, a tense standoff mounted as well. A line stretched for blocks while ticketholders \u2014 a diverse mix of older whites wearing Trump gear and younger African-American and Muslim students \u2014 waited to be allowed inside. Some said they were devoted Trump fans eager to hear him speak in person. \u201cI believe in Trump absolutely,\u201d said Jana Hayek, a Chicagoan and stay-at-home mother, holding the hand of her 12-year-old son, Peter. \u201cI definitely agree with his immigration policy. It\u2019s important to control who comes into this country.\u201dA large group opposing Mr. Trump merrily taunted the people entering the stadium with shouts of \u201cDonald Trump has got to go\u201d and signs caricaturing Mr. Trump as a fascist with a Hitler mustache. (In one only-in-Chicago insult, a protester carried a sign reading, \u201cTrump puts ketchup on his hot dog.\u201d) And then, suddenly, an announcement declared the event \u201cover\u201d and repeated it several times.As people streamed out, supporters of Mr. Trump were angry and frustrated. Anthony Pieroni, 19, a student at the university and a Republican, said he was disappointed. \u201cI understand why people didn\u2019t want him to come here,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople were fighting, ripping up signs, going crazy. It was just a terrible idea.\u201dBut protesters were jubilant, and celebrated along the intersections on the city\u2019s Near West Side. Some protesters shut down lanes of a nearby expressway.Arguments and small skirmishes broke out along the streets. At one point, the police rushed in, separating people.At least one man was hit on the head with a police baton, witnesses said, and blood could be seen coming from a gash on his face. A woman, also bloodied, was led away by police.\u201cThey got the job done,\u201d Vickie Deanda, 54, an accountant from Chicago, said of the demonstrators. \u201cSomeone has to object to this hatred. The people inside have a right to be there. But we have a right to be here, too.\u201dAshley Parker contributed reporting from Washington, and Liam Stack from New York.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Body of Second Crew Member Is Recovered From Tugboat Crash Near Tappan Zee Bridge", "Date": "2016-03-13", "News": "Supported byTARRYTOWN, N.Y. \u2014 The body of a second tugboat crewman was recovered by searchers on Sunday a day after the boat slammed into a barge near the foot of the Tappan Zee Bridge. The body of the tugboat captain was recovered from the Hudson River after the dawn crash, and a third member of the crew was still missing and presumed to be dead, according to officials.The tugboat, Specialist, was escorting a barge carrying a tower crane down the Hudson River to a Jersey City terminal when it hit a stationary barge just south of the bridge, and rapidly plunged about 40 feet, officials said. The cause of the crash was uncertain on Sunday, and an investigation was continuing.\u201cWe try to wonder if there is a lesson to learn, if there is something that could be done differently,\u201d Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo said at a news conference beside the Tarrytown Marina, shortly before the body of the second man, identified as Timothy Conklin, 29, of Westbury, Long Island, was brought by a police boat and taken by stretcher up the dock. \u201cSometimes it\u2019s just a pure accident, and that\u2019s what this appears to be,\u201d the governor said. \u201cA pure accident.\u201dRadio dispatches revealed that the tugboat\u2019s crew members were aware their vessel was too close to the barge, Mr. Cuomo said, but the boat could not move in time. The body of Paul Amon, 62, of Bayville, N.J., the tugboat\u2019s captain, was recovered on Saturday.The search for a third crew member, Harry Hernandez, 56, continued on Sunday, impeded at points by powerful currents. Divers could explore the vessel only when the current subsides at slack tide. They must search \u201cby feel,\u201d with just six inches of visibility, Mr. Cuomo said.Low water temperatures and the duration of the search have made finding Mr. Hernandez alive all but impossible, said Mark Magrino, deputy chief of enforcement operations of the United States Coast Guard\u2019s New York sector. \u201cIt\u2019s just disheartening,\u201d he said.The ruptured vessel had approximately 5,000 gallons of its own fuel, which was leaking into the river, causing a large sheen of oil, Mr. Cuomo said. Crews erected thousands of feet of boom to contain the oil, and were working to soak it up. Officials do not currently have a timetable to remove the boat.Members of Mr. Conklin\u2019s family and his girlfriend spent the morning standing at the river\u2019s edge, awaiting news as Coast Guard helicopters buzzed overhead and boats with search teams coursed through the water. By noon their fears were confirmed.Rob Astorino, the Westchester County executive, said Mr. Conklin had expressed trepidation about the journey to a brother. \u201cHe felt the tides and the currents were very, very strong,\u201d Mr. Astorino said at a news conference. \u201cHe was concerned about this trip. But obviously the trip continued.\u201dMr. Conklin grew up in Westbury in a neighborhood of trim wooden homes, many decked with American flags. He loved to surf and spend time with his four siblings, said Jeffrey Conklin, his uncle. \u201cTimmy and his siblings were incredibly close,\u201d the uncle said in a telephone interview. \u201cIt\u2019s just a heartbreak.\u201dHe described his nephew as someone who was family-oriented and preferred to stay at home with his siblings and parents than to go out. He added, \u201cI\u2019m sure everyone says the same thing, but this was a remarkable young man.\u201dMr. Amon, the tugboat captain, had spent most of his life on the water, neighbors said. He was a father of two. A daughter, Erica Amon, 34, who became a tugboat captain like her father, declined to comment when reached by phone on Sunday.Mr. Hernandez, who grew up in Brooklyn, took pride in his young son, his Puerto Rican heritage and his ability to brew a good pot of coffee, said Richard Jimenez, 39, a friend who lives in Texas and who had worked on support vessels off the Louisiana coast with Mr. Hernandez for several years. Mr. Hernandez was known for his booming voice and his zeal for his work. \u201cHe was a loud talker from New York; us guys from the South, we were not used to that,\u201d Mr. Jimenez said with a laugh. \u201cYou could hear him a mile away. You knew when Harry was coming down to the galley. You knew when Harry was coming on the deck.\u201dWhen Mr. Jimenez was out of work recently, Mr. Hernandez, who was also out of work, took it upon himself to find his friend a job. He was skillful on a variety of vessels and jobs, including dredging, and earned the senior rank of bosun, or boatswain. \u201cFor him to work on a ship, for him to work on a dredge, he could do it all,\u201d Mr. Jimenez said. \u201cHarry is a crew mate that I would want on deck with me.\u201dMr. Hernandez was saving to bring his son and wife, who lived in the Dominican Republic, to the United States. When he was not speaking about them, he spoke of his profession with gusto. His Facebook page was covered with pictures of him at work, each photo accompanied by praise for captains and crew mates.A picture posted on Wednesday showed cranes on barges underneath a cloudless blue sky, framed against the Tappan Zee Bridge. \u201cGood morning,\u201d the post said. \u201cThank you God for giving me another day of life.\u201dBecause of an editing error, an article on March 14 about the recovery of the body of a crewman who was on a tugboat that crashed in the Hudson River described the term slack tide incorrectly. It is the time when the current subsides, not when the water recedes.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How to Spot and Treat a Child\u2019s Hernia", "Date": "2016-03-28", "News": "Jane Brody on health and aging.Welcome to Well Family, Well\u00e2\u0080\u0099s new home for news about parenting, child health and relationships plus advice from our experts to help every family live well.When my twin sons were 2\u00c2\u00bd, their pediatrician detected a hernia in the right groin of one of the boys. The doctor minced no words: The hernia would not repair itself and surgery was necessary to avoid a serious, potentially life-threatening complication. But he added reassuringly that the operation was routine and the patient nearly always goes home the same day.I selected a top-notch pediatric surgeon at a nearby hospital who found during surgery that my son had a second hernia on the left side that he also repaired. He was in recovery for an hour or so, where he was watched for possible complications while the anesthesia wore off. Then we took him home, put him in his crib, curled in a fetal position, and raised the crib\u00e2\u0080\u0099s bar to keep him safe.Despite that precaution, during the night, he climbed out over the bar, went to the bathroom and climbed back into his crib, all without waking us. The next morning he saw a lot of snow outside the house, and after downing a hearty breakfast, went out to play with his brother. If only grown-ups recovered from surgery even half as quickly!Because genetics can play a role in pediatric hernias, I fully expected that his identical twin brother might develop one too, but 44 years later this has yet to happen.\u00e2\u0080\u009cInguinal hernia correction is the most common elective surgery that pediatric surgeons perform,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Dr. Shaun Steigman, a pediatric surgeon at Weill Cornell Medical College who also operates at New York Methodist Hospital in Brooklyn. The word \u00e2\u0080\u009celective\u00e2\u0080\u009d distinguishes it from an emergency operation, which repairing a hernia is meant to avoid.The two types of hernias that most often affect children are inguinal (the kind my son had), which occurs in the groin area, and umbilical, which occurs around the navel.Pediatric hernias stem from a defect present at birth \u00e2\u0080\u0094 a hole in the muscle wall of the abdomen. While not all such holes develop into hernias, in those that do, abdominal tissue, usually a portion of the small intestine, can protrude through.Hernias in children are often detected during a routine pediatric checkup, or by a parent who notices a lump on one or both sides of the groin or around the navel while changing a diaper or bathing the baby. A telltale sign is a bulge in the groin when the baby is straining, crying or coughing.In making the diagnosis, Dr. Steigman said he might try to get the hernia to pop out by making a young infant cry or an older baby laugh. He asks a toddler or older child to jump or cough.In some cases the protruding tissue of a hernia can become trapped, an often painful condition called incarceration. This situation is especially dangerous if the intestine is pinched hard enough to cut off its blood flow, a condition called strangulation.In addition to a lump, symptoms of incarceration or strangulation may include severe pain, fever, nausea and vomiting, or an inability to pass gas or produce a bowel movement.An incarcerated or strangulated hernia can cause severe complications and even death. Emergency surgery is necessary if the doctor cannot push the intestine back through the hole by massaging the protrusion from outside the child\u00e2\u0080\u0099s abdomen.Inguinal hernias affect from 3 percent to 5 percent of children born full-term, the vast majority of them boys. During fetal development, the testes have to pass from the abdominal cavity through the inguinal canal to reach the scrotum. Before birth, the opening to the canal is supposed to close. When it doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t, a hernia can result.Children born prematurely are six times as likely to have an inguinal hernia as those born full-term. Up to 30 percent of premature infants develop an inguinal hernia, and in 60 percent of them tissue from the abdominal cavity gets trapped, according to Dr. Andre Hebra, chief of surgery at the Medical University of South Carolina Children\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Hospital.Hernias are usually detected during the first year of life. In babies born prematurely they are often surgically corrected before the infants are discharged from the neonatal intensive care unit. But sometimes hernias do not become apparent until a child is much older, and occasionally not until adulthood.Umbilical hernias, which affect about 10 percent of children, result when the hole in the abdominal muscles through which the umbilical cord passes in utero fails to close after birth. These too can ensnare a portion of the small intestine. However, unlike inguinal hernias, which always require surgical correction, \u00e2\u0080\u009c95 percent of umbilical hernias close on their own,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Dr. Steigman said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThey are less likely to get something trapped, so we wait until age 4 or 5 to repair them if they don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t self-correct.\u00e2\u0080\u009dA third type, called a femoral hernia, is more common in girls. It usually shows up as a bulge in the groin, upper thigh or labia, the skin folds around the vaginal opening. It is associated with a high risk of strangulation and must always be surgically repaired.Surgery to correct a hernia is straightforward and usually done as an outpatient procedure in children older than 3 months, Dr. Steigman said. In a majority of cases, the repair is done through open surgery, though Dr. Steigman said he prefers to operate laparoscopically, through two tiny incisions. But either way, the incision is very small and the child heals rapidly.According to the American College of Surgeons, an open repair is needed by about 1 percent of children born full-term, 15 percent of those born prematurely and 20 percent of those who experienced an incarceration.All that is required before surgery is a routine checkup \u00e2\u0080\u0094 blood tests, urine analysis and a discussion of medications the child regularly takes. If the hernia is difficult to see or feel, an ultrasound exam may be done.In preparing for surgery, the child should not eat for six to eight hours, consume breast milk for four hours or drink clear fluids for two hours before the scheduled operation to minimize the risk of aspirating stomach contents. The operation is most often done under general anesthesia, but even if local anesthesia is planned, there is always the possibility that general anesthesia will become needed during the operation.Related:Your health questions answered by Times journalists and\u00a0experts.Get Well's Running email for practical tips, expert advice, exclusive content and a bit of motivation delivered to your inbox every week to help you on your running journey.

Coming soon.To keep our muscles healthy deep into retirement, we may need to start working out more now, according to a new study of world-class octogenarian athletes. The study found substantial differences at a cellular level between the athletes\u00e2\u0080\u0099 muscles and those of less active people. Muscular health is, of course, essential for successful aging. As young adults, we generally have scads of robust muscle mass. But that situation doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t last. Muscles consist of fibers, each attached to a motor neuron in our spinal column by long, skinny nerve threads called axons. The fiber and its neuron are known as a muscle unit. When this muscle unit is intact, the neuron sends commands to the muscle fiber to contract. The muscle fiber responds, and your leg, eyelid, pinky finger or other body part moves.  However, motor neurons die as we age, beginning as early as in our 30s, abruptly marooning the attached muscle fiber, leaving it disconnected from the nervous system. In younger people, another neuron can come to the rescue, snaking out a new axon and re-attaching the fiber to the spinal cordBut with each passing decade, we have fewer motor neurons. So some muscle fibers, bereft of their original neuron, do not get another. These fibers wither and die and we lose muscle mass, becoming more frail. This process speeds up substantially once we reach age 60 or so.Scientists have not known whether the decline in muscular health with age is inevitable or whether it might be slowed or altered. But whether exercise would continue to protect muscles in people decades older than 60, for whom healthy muscles might be the difference between independence and institutionalization, had never been examined. At the lab, the scientists measured muscle size and then had the athletes and those in the control group complete a simple test of muscular strength and function in which they pressed their right foot against a movable platform as forcefully as possible. While they pressed, the scientists used sensors to track electrical activity within a leg muscle. Using mathematical formulas involving muscle size and electrical activity, the scientists then determined precisely how many muscle units were alive and functioning in each volunteer\u00e2\u0080\u0099s leg muscle. They also examined the electrical signal plots to see how effectively each motor neuron was communicating with its attached muscle fiber. Unsurprisingly, the elite masters athletes\u00e2\u0080\u0099 legs were much stronger than the legs of the other volunteers, by an average of about 25 percent. The athletes had about 14 percent more total muscle mass than the control group.More interesting to the researchers, the athletes also had almost 30 percent more motor units in their leg muscle tissue, and these units were functioning better than those of people in the sedentary group. In the control group, many of the electrical messages from the motor neuron to the muscle showed signs of \u00e2\u0080\u009cjitter and jiggle,\u00e2\u0080\u009d which are actual scientific terms for signals that stutter and degrade before reaching the muscle fiber. Such weak signaling often indicates a motor neuron that is approaching death. In essence, the sedentary elderly people had fewer motor units in their muscles, and more of the units that remained seemed to be feeling their age than in the athletes\u00e2\u0080\u0099 legs. The athletes\u00e2\u0080\u0099 leg muscles were much healthier at the cellular level. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThey resembled the muscles of people decades younger,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Geoffrey Power, who led the study while a graduate student at McGill and is now an assistant professor at the University of Guelph in Ontario. Of course, this type of single-snapshot-in-time study can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t tell us whether the athletes\u00e2\u0080\u0099 training actually changed their muscle health over the years or if the athletes were somehow blessed from birth with better muscles, allowing them to become superb masters athletes. But Dr. Power, who also led the 2010 study, said that he believes exercise does add to the numbers and improve the function of our muscle units as we grow older.Whether we have to work out like a world-class 80-year-old athlete to benefit, however, remains in question. Most of these competitors train intensely for several hours every week, Dr. Power said. But on the plus side, some of them did not start their competitive regimens until they had reached their 50s, providing hope for the dilatory among us.

He acknowledged that after a disappointing showing on Super Tuesday he did not see a political path forward.Mr. Carson received a standing ovation at the Conservative Political Action Conference on Friday when he announced that he would be leaving the campaign trail.\u00e2\u0080\u009cThere\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a lot of people who love me, they just won\u2019t vote for me,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Carson said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI will still continue to be heavily involved in trying to save our nation.\u00e2\u0080\u009dDespite his departure from the race, Mr. Carson is not finished with politics.

{"Headline": "Obama Commutes Sentences for 61 Convicted of Drug Crimes", "Date": "2016-03-30", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Ismael Rosa, a salsa singer serving a lifetime prison sentence for drug crimes, had often promised his lawyers that he would sing for them if he ever won his freedom.\u201cI\u2019m free and I\u2019m unbound and there are no shackles on me now,\u201d he sang softly, according to MiAngel Cody, one of his lawyers, who called the moment \u201cbeautiful.\u201d Mr. Rosa, 56, who has served 21 years and plans to live with his brother, a sheriff\u2019s deputy in Chicago, when he is released early next year, passed on a message to Mr. Obama.\u201c\u00a0\u2018Please tell Mr. President that I will always represent him and I will not let him down,\u2019\u00a0\u201d Ms. Cody said.Mr. Rosa\u2019s conviction in 1995 on conspiracy to distribute multiple kilograms of cocaine sent him to prison for life. On Wednesday, he was among 61 federal prisoners, incarcerated for drug offenses, whose sentences Mr. Obama commuted, extending his administration\u2019s efforts to reshape a criminal justice sentencing system the president has often described as unduly harsh, unfair to minorities and badly outdated.Like Mr. Rosa, more than a third of the prisoners who will soon be released were serving life in prison as a result of federal sentencing laws that imposed severe punishments for the distribution of cocaine and other drugs. Mr. Obama has now commuted the sentences of 248 prisoners, more than the total commuted by the last six presidents combined, administration officials said.Drug deaths have surged in nearly every U.S. county.Ms. Cody commended Mr. Obama for his efforts on behalf of people like Mr. Rosa. She said that someone newly convicted of crimes like his would no longer receive life in prison, but added that broader changes to sentencing laws were still needed.\u201cWe are seeing, hopefully, some withdrawal from our own justice system\u2019s addiction to incarceration,\u201d Ms. Cody said. \u201cSome of this will happen with clemency, but some of it needs to happen with true legislative sentencing reform.\u201dFor years, Mr. Obama has been pressing for just that, hoping to reverse steep penalties put in place in recent decades that sent many African-American and Hispanic men to prison for mostly nonviolent offenses. The president has said he is hopeful that he can reach rare agreement with Republicans on broad changes to sentencing laws.Mr. Obama has said he is encouraged by expressions of support for a criminal justice overhaul by conservative lawmakers and groups. Several Republicans who ran for president this election cycle have said sentencing laws need to be revamped. Liberal groups like the Center for American Progress have teamed up with Koch Industries, the conglomerate owned by the conservative brothers Charles G. and David H. Koch, to try to shrink prison populations.In brief comments on Wednesday, Mr. Obama singled out House Speaker Paul D. Ryan for his support on the issue and said he was \u201cstill hopeful that criminal justice reform can get done.\u201dBut even as Mr. Obama seeks to work with Congress, he has tried to use the power of his office to address the thousands of mostly young men who were imprisoned under the stricter laws established during the \u201cwar on drugs\u201d of the 1990s.Marjorie J. Peerce, a partner in New York with the law firm Ballard Spahr, praised Mr. Obama for commuting the sentences of people like Kevin County, a low-level drug offender convicted of distributing small amounts of heroin and crack cocaine. Because Mr. County had a prior felony, the federal judge was required to impose a 20-year sentence, more than four times what would probably be given today.After serving 14 years, Mr. County is set to leave the Federal Correctional Institution in Yazoo City, Miss., on July 28, 2016.\u201cThe war on drugs from the 1990s resulted in inordinately harsh and long prison sentences for offenders who did not deserve to serve that length of time,\u201d Ms. Peerce said.Some advocates for those in prison say Mr. Obama\u2019s efforts, while laudable, fall far short of what is needed. They note that his public commitment to using his clemency power more frequently has encouraged more than 30,000 federal inmates to come forward seeking shorter prison sentences. Many of those will not qualify because they committed violent crimes or have not been in prison long enough. But Ms. Peerce said there were \u201chundreds, if not thousands more that meet the criteria.\u201dAt his current pace, Mr. Obama will free a small fraction of those prisoners by the time his term ends next year. Officials said that was in part because of a lengthy review process that the administration had set up to consider clemency applications.White House officials said Wednesday that the president also wanted to help those released from prison become more effective members of society. On Thursday, the White House will host a discussion with advocates and administration officials about how to help those receiving clemency return to productive lives.After the announcement of the new commutations, Mr. Obama met with several federal prisoners whose sentences had previously been commuted to discuss how effectively they had re-entered society. In a video posted on Facebook with his statement, Mr. Obama invited the group to lunch to discuss the issue.\u201cYou\u2019ve got folks around this table who are now attorneys,\u201d Mr. Obama said. \u201cThey\u2019re raising children, getting married.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Coming soon.Meditating before running could change the brain in ways that are more beneficial for mental health than practicing either of those activities alone, according to an interesting study of a new treatment program for people with depression. As many people know from experience, depression is characterized in part by an inability to stop dwelling on gloomy thoughts and unhappy memories from the past. Researchers suspect that this thinking pattern, known as rumination, may involve two areas of the brain in particular: the prefrontal cortex, a part of the brain that helps to control attention and focus, and the hippocampus, which is critical for learning and memory. In some studies, people with severe depression have been found to have a smaller hippocampus than people who are not depressed. Interestingly, meditation and exercise affect those same portions of the brain, although in varying ways. In brain-scan studies, people who are long-term meditators, for instance, generally display different patterns of brain-cell communication in their prefrontal cortex during cognitive tests than people who don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t meditate. Those differences are believed to indicate that the meditators possess a more honed ability to focus and concentrate.   Meanwhile, according to animal studies, aerobic exercise substantially increases the production of new brain cells in the hippocampus.  Both meditation and exercise also have proven beneficial in the treatment of anxiety, depression and other mood disorders. These various findings about exercise and meditation intrigued researchers at Rutgers University in New Brunswick, N.J., who began to wonder whether, since meditation and exercise on their own improve moods, combining the two might intensify the impacts of each. The researchers found that the depressed volunteers showed signaling patterns in their prefrontal cortex that are associated with poor concentration and focus. Then the researchers had all of the volunteers begin a fairly rigorous, supervised program of sitting, followed by sweating. To start, the volunteers were taught a form of meditation known as focused attention. Essentially entry-level mindfulness meditation, it requires people to sit quietly and think about their respiration by counting their breaths up to 10 and then backward. This practice is not easy, especially at first.\u00e2\u0080\u009cIf people found their thoughts wandering\u00e2\u0080\u009d during the meditation, and especially if they began to ruminate on unpleasant memories, they were told not to worry or judge themselves, \u00e2\u0080\u009cbut just to start counting again from one,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Brandon Alderman, a professor of exercise science at Rutgers who led the study. The volunteers meditated in this way for 20 minutes, then stood and undertook 10 minutes of walking meditation, in which they paid close attention to each footfall. Then they clambered onto treadmills or stationary bicycles at the lab and jogged or pedaled at a moderate pace for 30 minutes (with five minutes of warming up and five minutes of cooling down).The volunteers completed these sessions twice a week for eight weeks. Then the researchers retested their moods and their ability to focus and concentrate. There were significant changes. The 22 volunteers with depression now had a 40 percent reduction in symptoms of the condition. They reported, in particular, much less inclination to ruminate over bad memories. Meanwhile, the members of the healthy control group also reported feeling happier than they had at the start of the study. Objectively, the volunteers\u00e2\u0080\u0099 results on the computerized tests of their ability to focus and their brain activity also were different. The group with depression now showed brain cell activity in their prefrontal cortex that was almost identical to that of the people without depression. They could concentrate much better and hone their attention, attributes that are believed to help reduce stubborn rumination. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI was quite surprised that we saw such a robust effect after only eight weeks,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Dr. Alderman said. He and his colleagues theorize that the meditation and exercise may have produced synergistic effects on the brains of their volunteers. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe know from animal studies that effortful learning, such as is involved in learning how to meditate, encourages new neurons to mature\u00e2\u0080\u009d in the hippocampus, he said. So while the exercise most likely increased the number of new brain cells in each volunteer\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hippocampus, Dr. Alderman said, the meditation may have helped to keep more of those neurons alive and functioning than if people had not meditated.Meditation also may have made the exercise more tolerable, he said, since some studies indicate that being mindful of your breathing and your body during workouts increases people\u00e2\u0080\u0099s enjoyment of the exertion. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve started meditating,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Dr. Alderman, a long-time athlete.Of course, this was a small study and the scientists did not follow their volunteers long term, so they do not know if any mood improvements linger. They also have no idea whether similar or even greater benefits might occur if someone were to run and then meditate or to practice both activities but on alternating days. They plan to study those questions in future experiments.

{"Headline": "In the Waiting Room of Estranged Spouses", "Date": "2016-03-11", "News": "Supported byModern LoveI Googled \u201ccounseling\u201d and scrolled through pages of possibilities before finally settling on a female psychologist with a kind face. Later that week, I went to her office wanting to talk about fidelity and broken trust, but somehow we ended up talking about sex and guilt. I cried a lot.Eight years earlier, when I was 20, I had served in Afghanistan as a machine-gunner in a security platoon that accompanied convoys, a six-month tour of grinding tedium interspersed with episodes of unpredictable violence and death. But that\u2019s not what drove me to the psychologist\u2019s office. I went because my marriage had fallen apart.My wife had had an affair. As is often the case in marriage, the infidelity was more a symptom of our trouble than its cause. Their situation was typical; they met through work. One evening, before I knew what was happening, the three of us were at the same fund-raising event, and at one point, he and my wife ducked outside for a smoke and I was left alone.Well, not entirely alone. His wife was there too, holding a newborn, looking uncomfortable. We didn\u2019t talk. Someone was making a speech about future goals, and I was eating dessert.After the affair came to light, my wife and I separated. I missed the cat. When I wasn\u2019t feeling self-righteously angry, I missed my wife, too. In the evenings I listened to Springsteen, ordered pizza, watched hockey, slept poorly and spent the gray hours before dawn Googling my wife\u2019s name, the guy\u2019s name and \u201cthe pain of divorce.\u201dOne night the first link told me to pray to God, the second told me to prepare for \u201ca new life with many beautiful women,\u201d and the third led me to a body-hair-removal site. I decided to go for counseling.A few months later, I was in the psychologist\u2019s reception room, paying for my fourth really good cry, when a woman carrying a child walked in. I didn\u2019t recognize her at first, and then I remembered her face from the fund-raiser.\u201cAre you the wife of the guy my wife is having an affair with?\u201d I asked tactlessly.The question is a stupid one. First off, it\u2019s stupid. Second, it assumes that this woman\u2019s identity, like mine, is wrapped up in fidelity and infidelity and everything between. It assumes that her skin, like mine, feels like the translucent noodle paper of a Thai wrap that holds in the lettuce and the shrimp, the peanut sauce and the pain.\u201cYeah,\u201d she said. \u201cBut we\u2019re not together anymore. I\u2019m Catherine.\u201dThe receptionist rushed out and returned with the psychologist.\u201cIs everything O.K.?\u201d the psychologist asked as she walked in.We looked at her, and that\u2019s when she understood what was going on. \u201cOh my God,\u201d she whispered, her worlds colliding.In fairness, the chances of Catherine and me meeting in this fashion were extremely low. She and I had never spoken before. We both worked full time and lived on opposite ends of a large city. We both searched the Internet for counselors and somehow decided on the same psychologist and arranged to meet her on the same day in consecutive hours.The receptionist was still shaking her head.\u201cOh my God,\u201d the psychologist whispered again.Catherine\u2019s baby murmured.Later, Catherine and I went to a breezy cafe and talked about our estranged spouses, the circumstances that brought us here. Catherine\u2019s son bumped away on her knee. She asked if I\u2019d like to hold him; I reached my hands out.He smelled clean and abundant and wonderful, and he didn\u2019t care who I was or what started happening when or why it all began. For a time, my questions and fear and anger resolved into this child sitting on my lap.Then he started to cry and Catherine took him back, cradling him in her forearm and pulling her jacket over her upper body and his.I was attracted to her strength \u2014 maybe to her as well. I wondered if she was attracted to me, but the question was irrelevant. Neither of us knew what to do with love right then. I asked her if she wanted to get married again.\u201cAt some point I think,\u201d she said. \u201cHow about you?\u201d\u201cProbably sometime down the road,\u201d I said.\u201cI\u2019m glad we met,\u201d she said.By early winter, my final day as an inner-city housing worker had arrived, and I was told to go buy a cake for my farewell party later that afternoon. I walked under the bright lights of the supermarket and stared at the walls of food.When I returned from Afghanistan, I hated supermarkets. Like the soldier Jeremy Renner plays in \u201cThe Hurt Locker\u201d who returns from war only to feel overwhelmed by too many choices and too much freedom, I felt paralyzed by possibilities. I wanted to go back to M.R.E.s and the cafeteria and decisions made for me. So I limited the possibilities and got married.Now, unmarried again, I settled on a giant carrot cake. It had fist-size rosettes of pink and blue icing and weighed almost as much as Catherine\u2019s son. I paid for my food, grasped the oversize cake in both hands and headed for the exit, where I somehow ended up a few feet away from my ex-wife\u2019s lover.I hadn\u2019t seen him since the fund-raiser. He had been in my dreams, though. In one dream I was knocking at the door of my childhood home when he opened it and just stood there: handsome, shirtless, confident, everything I was not. I was crying when I awoke, alone in a new apartment and newly divorced.He was in my dreams the same way the suicide bomber was in my dreams the year after I came back from Afghanistan; I couldn\u2019t always see him, but I felt his presence at the edges of consciousness, pushing me somewhere I didn\u2019t want to go, forcing me toward the inevitable conclusion. Dreams like the slow burn of a forest fire, where the roots under the earth smolder and stretch in a hundred different directions.I spent a lot of time thinking about the ways I wanted my ex-wife and her lover to feel that burn. I thought I hated them. Later on, some friends proclaimed that a giant carrot cake in his face in the supermarket line would have been a fitting conclusion to the story. But I didn\u2019t even consider the option. I just stood there with the cake in my hand, feeling ridiculous.He looked tired. Maybe he had custody of his son right then. Maybe he had been up all night taking care of him.\u201cDo you want to go for a beer sometime and talk about it?\u201d he asked.\u201cNo, I don\u2019t want to go for a beer to talk about it,\u201d I said, which was petulant and true. \u201cBut I forgive you,\u201d I added, which was supercilious and false.\u201cO.K.,\u201d he said, still looking tired.I couldn\u2019t summon any real anger. He was just a young boy\u2019s tired father. He wasn\u2019t even unkind. I walked out holding the cake, feeling happy I hadn\u2019t burst into tears or tried to fight.I slowly continued to heal.In the months that followed, thinking of my ex-wife\u2019s lover as that sweet boy\u2019s father was somehow very helpful for me. I had held Catherine\u2019s boy, felt the good weight of his body, and eventually I learned that it\u2019s hard to hate a person when that person was a part of bringing something good into the world.Her boy is much bigger now, a beautiful child. I see his photos on Facebook and sometimes \u201clike\u201d them. Catherine and I haven\u2019t spoken in a while, and that\u2019s O.K. I don\u2019t know what has happened to my ex-wife and Catherine\u2019s ex-husband, and that\u2019s O.K., too. There\u2019s enough pain in the world and I don\u2019t wish it on them anymore.Some days I wish I had taken up Catherine\u2019s ex on his offer of a beer that afternoon, been kinder to my ex-wife, opened myself up to those possibilities a bit more. I remain grateful for the opportunity of meeting Catherine, and I would like to meet her son again when he is older. A coffee shop, a supermarket line or a psychologist\u2019s waiting room all seem like good places for such a meeting.I wouldn\u2019t explain the situation; that wouldn\u2019t be fair. I would probably just smile and mumble, \u201cYou helped me through a tough time when you were young.\u201d Then I would walk away, trusting in the possibilities.Benjamin Hertwig is a writer and poet who lives in western Canada.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Malaysia\u2019s Immigrant Worker Debate", "Date": "2016-03-28", "News": "Supported byKUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia \u2014 On a recent weekend excursion out of the city, I stopped for coffee at a cluster of roadside shops selling refreshments for travelers heading to the jungle-shrouded highlands that form the spine of Malaysia. A young man was sweeping the small yard outside the outbuilding that housed the restrooms; he was the janitor and handyman, he said, but he was wary when I tried to strike up a conversation.He was from Bangladesh, he told me, and had been in Malaysia for three years. He was called Yunus, but there was no way I could tell if that was his real name.During the rest of my weekend trip, I noticed how many immigrant workers there were in the countryside, as accustomed as I am to seeing them in the capital city. They\u2019re on construction sites, in factories and on huge palm oil plantations. But most Malaysians will encounter those who work in the lower ends of the service industry, waiting tables in cheap restaurants or, in Yunus\u2019s case, cleaning restrooms.These immigrants tend to be found in what the locals call \u201c3D jobs\u201d: dangerous, dirty and difficult. In short, jobs that few Malaysians nowadays are willing to do.Workers from Malaysia\u2019s lower-income neighbors \u2014 Indonesia, Vietnam, Nepal, Myanmar and, increasingly, Bangladesh \u2014 have become ubiquitous here, yet they remain largely disconnected from the rest of society and have generally been absent from any discussion of national identity. But a recent government communiqu\u00e9 has pushed them into the limelight and forced Malaysians to confront, with unusual frankness, the deep-seated prejudices that some hold against low-skilled workers from abroad.All this focus on migration and labor suggests that Malaysia is beginning to look harder at itself as the maturing, middle-class country it aspires to be \u2014 even if, for now, more liberal attitudes are in a minority. As I found in my rather stilted conversation with Yunus, a lack of trust and a huge gulf still divide foreign workers from Malaysians.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Shell and Nigerian Partner Are Sued in Britain Over Spills", "Date": "2016-03-02", "News": "Supported byLONDON \u2014 Nigerian communities from the oil-rich Niger Delta initiated court action on Wednesday in London against the energy giant Royal Dutch Shell, in a case that may have far-reaching implications for whether companies can be sued in Britain for pollution and damages caused by their activities in other countries.The case is based on accusations by farming and fishing communities that say they have suffered years of damage because of repeated large spills from oil pipelines in their home areas.On Wednesday, the claimants won a small victory when a judge ruled that the Nigerian venture could be included in the case, along with its parent company.Daniel Leader, a partner at Leigh Day, said in an interview that the outcome of what are likely to be lengthy proceedings \u201cwill set an important precedent as to whether the courts here are going to be willing to hear cases relating to multinational enterprises and their subsidiaries in the developing world.\u201dIf the case is ultimately successful, he added, \u201ccleanup costs could run into the hundreds of millions of dollars.\u201dJonathan French, a Shell spokesman in London, said in an email that the company was \u201cat an early stage of assessing the Bille and Ogale claims.\u201dShell\u2019s Nigerian subsidiary said in a statement that \u201cboth Bille and Ogale are areas heavily impacted by crude oil theft, pipeline sabotage and illegal refining, which remain the main sources of pollution across the Niger Delta.\u201dThe Nigerian joint venture is 55 percent owned by the Nigerian National Petroleum Company, with Shell holding a 30 percent stake. The French energy company Total holds 10 percent, and Eni of Italy owns the remaining 5 percent. Shell has said that cleanup costs from spills are shared on the basis of holdings.The company says it is committed to cleaning up oil spills, which it is obliged to do under Nigerian law no matter what the cause, but the company said it was not liable to pay compensation for damage caused by oil thieves and saboteurs.Shell\u2019s Nigerian subsidiary said that it would fight having the case tried in Britain.\u201cWe believe that allegations concerning Nigerian plaintiffs in dispute with a Nigerian company, over issues which took place within Nigeria, should be heard in Nigeria,\u201d the company said.Mr. Leader, however, said that bringing cases against oil companies in Nigeria was futile. \u201cThe Nigerian legal system cannot deal with these cases and there is complete regulatory failure,\u201d he said.Nigeria remains one of the most important countries for Shell production, but because of the theft of oil from its pipelines and other difficulties, the company is gradually withdrawing from onshore areas and is focusing on offshore facilities, where it is easier to maintain security.Advertisement"}

By contrast, about a third \u00e2\u0080\u0094 34 percent \u00e2\u0080\u0094 of Republicans 65 and over favored deportation, and fewer than half \u00e2\u0080\u0094 47 percent \u00e2\u0080\u0094 said they supported a pathway to citizenship for those immigrants.A third option, allowing the immigrants to become permanent legal residents but not citizens, was not supported by more than 15 percent of either group.The institute\u00e2\u0080\u0099s survey is unusual because of the size and duration of its sample. The report is based on 42,586 telephone interviews conducted in English and Spanish from April 29, 2015, to Jan. 7, 2016. The margin of error is plus or minus one point.Mr. Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s pledges to expel illegal immigrants and to build a wall along the border with Mexico consistently draw cheers at his rallies.

According to the survey, those voters are older, white and working class, with a high school education or less; they say they are conservative, and many are evangelical Christians. In short, they are the voters who have flocked to support Mr. Trump in the Republican race, and who, in smaller numbers, have also backed Mr. Cruz.But even after months of the candidates\u2019 scorching comments, a slim majority \u00e2\u0080\u0094 52 percent \u00e2\u0080\u0094 of all Republicans say they would offer a path to citizenship for immigrants in the United States illegally, a finding that remained \u00e2\u0080\u009cremarkably stable throughout 2015,\u00e2\u0080\u009d according to the report.\u00e2\u0080\u009cMany younger Republicans have grown up in a much more diverse world,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Robert P.

Trump as they campaigned together in Ohio and North Carolina on the eve of Tuesday\u2019s primaries in both states.Mr. Trump, not so much.Targeting the Ohio governor, John Kasich, his chief rival in the state\u00e2\u0080\u0099s primary, Mr. Trump berated Mr. Kasich here on Monday evening for being an absentee for his time away from Ohio last fall and winter as he campaigned in New Hampshire. The only other sitting governor or senator who was in New Hampshire as much as Mr. Kasich was Mr. Christie, who has since dropped out and endorsed Mr. Trump. While most politicians would conveniently forget that fact, to spare Mr. Christie the humiliation, Mr. Trump actually highlighted it.\u00e2\u0080\u009cYour Governor Kasich, if you look at him, and I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m being totally impartial, he goes to New Hampshire, he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s living in New Hampshire,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cIs Chris around? He was there even more than Chris.\u00e2\u0080\u009dMr. Christie, fortunately, was offstage.The Ohio remarks were an extension of a theme that Mr. Trump started in North Carolina earlier in the day. In Hickory, Mr. Christie was the questioner at a makeshift town hall event, an often-fawning role that other supporters of Mr. Trump have filled at previous events.Mr. Trump told the crowd that he had excelled in every debate. If not, he said, he probably wouldn\u2019t have done so well in the campaign.\u201cI would have been like the other people \u2014 out!\u201d Mr. Trump said, as Mr. Christie scratched the back of his neck in the seat across from him.Mr. Trump wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t so much trying to embarrass Mr. Christie as tear down Mr. Kasich, whom he attacked repeatedly during his final rally before Tuesday\u2019s voting. Mr. Trump was not coy about the reason: He acknowledged that the Ohio contest looked like the closest of the day\u2019s five primaries. Mr. Kasich, who is popular among many Republicans in his home state, has a small lead over Mr. Trump in some Ohio polls.\u00e2\u0080\u009cKasich cannot make America great again, can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t do it, can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t do it,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Trump said, dismissing the state\u00e2\u0080\u0099s positive economic figures as a result of lucky oil strikes. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIf you didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t hit oil \u2014 that wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t because of him, believe me \u2014 you would have had a disaster.\u00e2\u0080\u009dMr. Trump argued that Mr. Kasich would destroy the auto industry in Ohio by negotiating more free trade deals that would lead American companies to shift jobs to other countries. That is a charge that resonates deeply with many Ohioans who blame the North American Free Trade Agreement for destroying the economy in once-thriving cities like nearby Youngstown. Mr. Trump drew boos as he noted that Mr. Kasich supports the Trans-Pacific Partnership, the 12-nation trade deal President Obama has negotiated.\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s going to take all of your car business out,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Trump warned about the trade deal. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe car business is going to be destroyed by TPP.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00e2\u0080\u009cYour governor is totally overrated, he hasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t done a thing,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Trump said, urging people to get a good night\u00e2\u0080\u0099s sleep and then wake up to help him beat their governor.\n\t\tFirst Draft provides fast-paced and comprehensive coverage of politics and elections by The New York Times.

{"Headline": "Abortion, Guns and Gay Rights Offer Risks, Rewards for State Republicans", "Date": "2016-03-31", "News": "Supported byATLANTA \u2014 Congressional Republicans in the Obama era have largely been defined by their insistence on standing in front of the administration and yelling stop. Democrats call them the party of \u201cno.\u201dBut in state legislatures, Republicans are finding rewards and peril in being a vigorous party of \u201cyes\u201d when it comes to promoting conservative social issues. This year, in many of the 30 state legislatures under full Republican control, lawmakers continued to pass a number of new expansions of gun rights and groundbreaking restrictions on abortion. Perhaps most controversially, they also approved bills that opponents say would allow for discrimination against gays, lesbians and transgender people.For social conservatives, the legislative wins are a bright spot in an otherwise troubling health report for the Republican Party.But the risks were also evident this week in North Carolina, as a furor erupted over a new law that prohibits local anti-discrimination protections for gay, bisexual and transgender people and restricts transgender bathroom use. More than 90 chief executives, including Timothy D. Cook of Apple and Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook, have objected to the new law.Democrats are hoping that such Republican stands on social issues, while politically helpful to state lawmakers in their heavily conservative districts, may underscore the Democratic contention that Republicans have veered too far to the right to win some statewide elections, keep their control of both houses of Congress and win back the presidency. The stakes are particularly high at a time when the Republican presidential primary brawl and Donald J. Trump\u2019s candidacy have the potential to turn off women, independents and others whom Republicans need to succeed nationally.\u201cThe national Republican Party is trying not to lose three presidential elections in a row,\u201d said William Boone, a political scientist at Clark Atlanta University. \u201cThe local guys are trying to maintain their right and sometimes far-right positions to be re-elected at the local level.\u201dNorth Carolina is an example of a legislative success that can come with big risks. Corporate opponents of the new law include Bank of America, the state\u2019s largest employer. Three governors and a number of big-city mayors have banned official state travel to North Carolina. Private business travelers have canceled plans to visit. The American Civil Liberties Union and other groups have brought a legal challenge in federal court.The Republican governor, Pat McCrory, a former Charlotte mayor who ran for office promising a practical-minded, pro-business administration, was forced into a defensive crouch this week. He accused critics of a \u201cvicious nationwide smear campaign\u201d against the state, while the campaign of Attorney General Roy Cooper, a Democrat who plans to run against Mr. McCrory this fall, started a \u201cShame on McCrory\u201d website.\u201cYour new discrimination law won\u2019t just hurt L.G.B.T. North Carolinians and their families \u2014 it will damage our economy and harm North Carolina\u2019s national reputation,\u201d the site says, addressing the governor. \u201cRepeal this shameful law now.\u201dChris LaCivita, a Republican strategist working for Mr. McCrory\u2019s campaign, said Tuesday that the law was a common-sense effort to protect the privacy of people in public restrooms. He said that it was likely to be welcomed by parents \u2014 and to be a political hit.\u201cThere\u2019s a basic expectation of privacy that everyone has,\u201d he said, adding, \u201cWe\u2019ll side with parents against Democrats and, quite frankly, against a lot of the out-of-state interests, any day of the week.\u201dA similar legislative drama, one with a different outcome, played out in neighboring Georgia, where a second-term Republican governor, Nathan Deal, who was under no re-election pressure but tremendous pressure from big businesses, announced Monday that he would veto legislation meant to protect opponents of same-sex marriage.\u201cI do not think that we have to discriminate against anyone to protect the faith-based community in Georgia,\u201d Mr. Deal said. But the move was also widely seen as a way to ward off the kind of economic threats being hurled at North Carolina.In the Mississippi Senate, Republicans argued that their bill would protect residents from being forced to act in violation of their religious beliefs, while Democrats, many of them black, likened the bill to shameful moments in the state\u2019s racist past. State Senator John Horhn, a Democrat, read passages from the Book of Ephesians and others that had been used by Christians to justify slavery.\u201cWe don\u2019t need to demonstrate to the rest of the world how backwards we are in our thinking,\u201d he said.The sweeping bill passed on a 32-to-17 vote. If signed, it will let government clerks decline to issue marriage certificates to same-sex couples as long as they have found another official to issue them. The Human Rights Campaign, a gay rights group, argues that the bill would let faith-based groups refuse to sell or rent a home to lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people.In Virginia, Gov. Terry McAuliffe, a Democrat, vetoed a bill on Wednesday passed by Republican legislators that was meant to protect opponents of same-sex marriage. In South Dakota, the Republican governor, Dennis Daugaard, recently vetoed a bill that would have forced transgender students in public schools to choose a bathroom based on their birth gender.In North Carolina, the blowback is already merging with a broader Democratic Party argument that the state\u2019s Republican leadership is out of touch with the mainstream. It is an argument Democrats are likely to deploy not just in the governor\u2019s race, but also in the presidential election, particularly if Republicans nominate Mr. Trump or his main rival, Senator Ted Cruz of Texas.Democrats are smelling similar opportunities to engage in culture-war arguments in other places where Republicans dominate state government, but a Democratic presidential candidate may have a shot against Mr. Cruz or Mr. Trump. These include Indiana, which, like North Carolina, President Obama won in 2008 but lost in 2012. Last week, the Republican governor of Indiana, Mike Pence, signed a law approved by the Republican-controlled Legislature that holds doctors liable if a woman has an abortion solely because of objections to the fetus\u2019s race, sex or a disability like Down syndrome.Mr. Pence\u2019s Democratic rival, John Gregg, lost to Mr. Pence by three percentage points in the 2012 election. Mr. Gregg, who calls himself \u201cpersonally pro-life,\u201d nonetheless denounced Mr. Pence\u2019s decision to sign the bill.In Florida, the second-term Republican governor, Rick Scott, is not facing re-election, but this, too, is seen by many in politics as a state up for grabs in the presidential contest. Florida Democrats were quick to pile on Mr. Scott\u2019s signing of a bill last Friday banning state funding for facilities that perform abortions.The incremental expansion of abortion limits and pro-gun legislation has a long history. Jennifer Baker, a spokeswoman for the National Rifle Association\u2019s lobbying arm, said 13 pro-gun bills had been enacted by states this year, with 11 more awaiting the signatures of governors. \u201cI think the overwhelming majority of Americans support law-abiding gun owners\u2019 ability to exercise their Second Amendment rights, and I think that\u2019s reflected in the fact that lawmakers in state legislatures across the country are passing pro-Second Amendment legislation,\u201d she said.Ms. Baker said that a new frontier in gun rights involved laws that let people older than 21 carry concealed weapons without permits. In West Virginia, Republican lawmakers passed such a law this month after overriding a veto from the Democratic governor, Earl Ray Tomblin. In Georgia, Republican legislators passed a bill allowing people over 21 to carry concealed weapons onto public college and university campuses. Mr. Deal has indicated that he has concerns about the bill but has not said definitively if he will veto it.In Utah, a new, first-of-its-kind abortion law requires doctors to give women anesthesia for an abortion at 20 weeks or later.The success of such measures is encouraging to social conservatives who are otherwise worried about the Republican Party.The difference between Washington and the statehouses, he added, was evident: \u201cQuite frankly, you can get stuff done at the state level that you can\u2019t get done here.\u201dAn earlier version of this article, relying on information from the Mississippi Senate\u2019s reading clerk, misstated the vote on a bill that would protect residents from being forced to act in violation of their religious beliefs. It was 32-17, not 31-17.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Picture This: Marketers Let Emojis Do the Talking", "Date": "2016-03-06", "News": "Supported byAdvertisingThe condom brand Durex has used World AIDS Day as a marketing hook for years, but for the most recent edition it tried something different: a condom emoji.Durex said there was no icon that communicated a desire for safe sex, so it started a campaign to provide one on smartphone keyboards. The consortium that sets standards for characters and emojis has yet to approve it, but the mere fact that Durex started the campaign prompted 210 million mentions on Twitter and, by Durex\u2019s estimates, drew 2.6 billion media impressions worldwide.Such is the power of emojis. And more companies are taking notice.\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of brand demand for emojis,\u201d said Ross Hoffman, senior director of global brand strategy at Twitter, which recently started offering custom emojis for companies to use in advertising. That is because some 92 percent of the online population now uses emojis, according to a study by Emogi, a start-up that uses them to let people indicate how they feel about particular ads. Swyft Media, which creates alternate phone keyboards featuring multiple emojis, says people send six billion of them a day.Brands like emojis for several other reasons. For one, they reach ad-averse millennials, sailing past ad-blocking software. They are visual, which makes them a natural fit for popular messaging apps such as Snapchat and Instagram and also appeals to international audiences. And because they are meant to be shared, the brand images are distributed widely, free.\u201cAll of a sudden, the brand is in this very personal conversation between friends and family,\u201d said Evan Wray, the chief executive of Swyft Media.Coca-Cola, PepsiCo, Anheuser-Busch InBev, Starbucks, Disney and more than a dozen other companies have each paid Twitter more than $1 million for designs combined with various kinds of ads. During the Super Bowl, people who used the hashtag #PepsiHalftime got a reply that included a soda can emoji with musical notes floating out from it. For the Feb. 21 introduction of its new smartphone, Samsung rolled out on Twitter a custom emoji featuring its virtual-reality headset, along with several kinds of ads.Emojis are also spreading further afield in marketing. 20th Century Fox used them on a Los Angeles billboard to promote the movie \u201cDeadpool.\u201d IHOP Restaurants redesigned its logo in the style of emojis.The bungles haven\u2019t slowed down brands\u2019 embrace of emojis. That is mostly because they convey emotion, the precious currency of marketers.Some companies are even starting to quantify those emotions to provide a more nuanced view of ad effectiveness than clicks or impressions. Emogi\u2019s \u201cemotion engine\u201d analyzes data on how people use emojis to reveal their sentiments about ads. Marketers can use that data to tweak campaigns or target promising audience segments, said Travis Montaque, the chief executive of Emogi.Taco Bell last year mounted a campaign for a generic taco emoji. A few months after the emoji became official last July, the company created a \u201ctaco emoji engine\u201d that allows people to tweet the taco, along with another emoji. An automated program sends back one of 700 mash-ups of the two. Fans have used the engine 756,000 times since November.\u201cThat\u2019s how Taco Bell could own it,\u201d said Winston Binch, chief digital officer at Deutsch, the lead agency on the campaign. \u201cIt\u2019s not just a one-off ad, it\u2019s an ongoing connection with a brand.\u201dOther companies have devised more direct ways to profit from standard emojis. Domino\u2019s Pizza lets people order a pie by tweeting a pizza slice emoji. It\u2019s not that easy, since customers first must set up an online ordering account, and the company follows up with a Twitter direct message to confirm the order. Still, for its \u201cbusiness-moving\u201d idea, the novel transaction system won the ad industry\u2019s top award for breakthrough marketing at last summer\u2019s Cannes Lions advertising conference.Of course, this could all be a fad. But many marketers think emojis are here to stay. Mark DiMassimo, the chief executive and chief creative officer of the agency DiMassimo Goldstein, said that emojis were likely to spread from messaging to social media and beyond.\u201cThe best uses of emojis haven\u2019t been done yet,\u201d Mr. DiMassimo said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Hillary Clinton Lauds Reagans on AIDS. A Backlash Erupts.", "Date": "2016-03-11", "News": "In the days since her death on Sunday, Nancy Reagan has been praised for her work on a range of causes, from preventing drug abuse to supporting research into Alzheimer\u00e2\u0080\u0099s.But on Friday, Hillary Clinton praised Mrs. Reagan as a force in confronting another disease: H.I.V./AIDS, which was killing alarming numbers of gay men and others during Ronald Reagan\u00e2\u0080\u0099s two terms.The problem with Mrs. Clinton\u00e2\u0080\u0099s compliment: It was the Reagans who wanted nothing to do with the disease at the time.The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention first identified the disease in 1981, but Mr. Reagan, despite desperate calls for action and thousands of deaths, did not mention H.I.V. or AIDS publicly until 1985 and did not give a speech about the disease until 1987, when an estimated 40,000 people had already died of the disease and roughly 36,000 more had been given a diagnosis.Indeed, the activist-author Larry Kramer, who chronicled the early years of the epidemic in his play \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe Normal Heart,\u00e2\u0080\u009d called Mr. Reagan \u00e2\u0080\u009cAdolf Reagan\u00e2\u0080\u009d and wrote that he \u00e2\u0080\u009cmurdered more gay people than anyone in the entire history of the world.\u00e2\u0080\u009dAnd in 1985, after the C.D.C. said the AIDS virus could not be spread through casual person-to-person contact, Mr. Reagan expressed skepticism about whether children with AIDS should be allowed to attend school.Yet Mrs. Clinton said Friday that she had appreciated Mrs. Reagan\u00e2\u0080\u0099s \u00e2\u0080\u009clow-key advocacy\u00e2\u0080\u009d on H.I.V./AIDS, saying \u00e2\u0080\u009cit penetrated the public conscience, and people began to say, \u00e2\u0080\u0098Hey, we have to do something about this.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s almost tempting to interpret this as withering, devastating sarcasm,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Gawker wrote. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe Reagans \u00e2\u0080\u0098started a national conversation about AIDS\u00e2\u0080\u0099 in the same sense that George W. Bush \u00e2\u0080\u0098started a national conversation\u00e2\u0080\u0099 about Iraq.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\u00e2\u0080\u009dThere were calls for the Human Rights Campaign, the nation\u00e2\u0080\u0099s largest gay-rights group, to revoke its endorsement of Mrs. Clinton. Its president, Chad Griffin, a former Clinton administration official, issued a statement saying that \u00e2\u0080\u009cNancy Reagan was, sadly, no hero in the fight against H.I.V./AIDS.\u00e2\u0080\u009dThe comments struck a particular chord with older gay men who watched in the 1980s as their communities were ravaged by the disease.\u00e2\u0080\u009cThis is shameful, idiotic, false \u00e2\u0080\u0093 and heartbreaking,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Charles Kaiser, author of \u201cThe Gay Metropolis.\u201d \u00e2\u0080\u009cThere is nothing else to say about it.

On Twitter and Facebook, they distributed photographs of Mr. Hecht, a sandy-haired law student at Saint-Louis University in Brussels who enjoyed skiing and acting.The death of Mr. Hecht, one of the 31 people killed in the bombings, illustrates how both hope and misinformation can flourish in the echo chamber of social media after a terrorist attack. For the families and friends of those who died and of some of the additional 300 who were hurt, the hours have been marked by constant communication but relatively little useful information.The authorities have asked for time to identify the victims, a process slowed in part, they say, by the condition of some bodies.

Scavenging is a crime. Don\u2019t allow scavenging to steal recycling\u2019s future.\u201dThe moment refuse hits the curb it becomes the city\u2019s property \u2014 and the city\u2019s problem. From there, materials like metals, cardboard and plastic are supposed to enter into the vast web of the recycling process, a network of carters and sorters, compactors and remelters. The theft of such items has long been an issue, taking a toll on the city\u2019s curbside recycling, or diversion, rate. The problem has peaked and fallen over the years as prices for commodities have fluctuated.Even amid ambitious goals for waste reduction and new strategies for recycling established by Mayor Bill de Blasio, the problem of scavenging persists. To some, who carts away cans and paper may seem irrelevant: what is being scavenged is still being recycled, after all. But sanitation officials say that if the city is going to reach its goals, then it must be the one doing the recycling.\u201cRecycling theft does impact the city\u2019s ability to track our curbside diversion rate,\u201d Amy Spitalnick, a spokeswoman for the mayor, said in a statement. \u201cAnd, perhaps most importantly, it\u2019s theft \u2014 and it\u2019s illegal. The city will continue to crack down on recycling theft as we simultaneously push forward a greener and more sustainable waste management system.\u201dThe city\u2019s trash is treasure for a wide array of collectors, for whom a rusty air conditioner means cash for scrap metal and bottles from last night\u2019s celebration are nickels to be redeemed. In many instances, by the time sanitation workers get to a trash pile, all that is left is actual garbage, hampering the ability of companies with city recycling contracts to earn their fees.More significantly for the city, the scavenging of recyclables makes it difficult to track its own progress.The city calculates what is known as a diversion rate by dividing the amount of recyclables the Sanitation Department picks up at the curb by the overall amount of trash it hauls away. Private trash companies, which serve commercial businesses, are not included in the tabulations.The city\u2019s current diversion rate is 16 percent, far below the national average of 34.4 percent, according to the federal Environmental Protection Agency, and lower than those of cities that have been more successful, like San Francisco, which has an 80 percent rate. (Critics argue that because municipalities tabulate things differently, the comparisons are of limited value.)\u201cGiven the aggressive goal just set forward by the city, every single piece counts,\u201d said Councilman Antonio Reynoso, a Brooklyn Democrat who is the chairman of the Council\u2019s committee on sanitation and solid waste management. \u201cWhat I don\u2019t want to do is put the burden of getting to zero on the poor canners.\u201dThe theft of recyclables by bottle collectors makes it difficult for the city to determine how well residents are recycling, Mr. Reynoso said. \u201cThere are people on the street that are helping us get toward recycling goals that we might be proud of,\u201d he said. \u201cBut our system doesn\u2019t track their contribution.\u201dVito Turso, a spokesman for the Sanitation Department, said the fact that items pilfered by scavengers were being recycled anyway missed the point. \u201cThe city\u2019s got goals, and the only way we know how to meet those goals is if we have control over the commodity,\u201d Mr. Turso said. \u201cIt would be very easy for us to say, \u2018Well, since it\u2019s not out there it must be being recycled,\u2019 but that would be something that is unquantifiable. We want to be the city, the largest urban center, that does the best it can to recycle as much as possible, and the only way to know that is if we can measure it.\u201dThe public service announcement, made in 2012 during the administration of Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, a political independent, was available on YouTube but was never posted elsewhere, Mr. Reynoso said. One day after The New York Times asked the Sanitation Department about the video, it was made private online.There are grass-roots efforts to thwart theft, including a Facebook page dedicated to exposing recycling thieves by posting their photos; new images are published almost every day. David Biderman, the executive director and chief executive of the Solid Waste Association of North America, said that when the price for cardboard peaked a few years ago, his cellphone rang nonstop with messages from New York City trash carters complaining that they had arrived at pickup sites to find not a single flattened box in sight.Charise Paschall, 41, who sleeps on the street in the SoHo neighborhood of Manhattan and frequently relies on the money she makes from unearthing bottles in the garbage, said the city should embrace collectors\u2019 efforts. \u201cWhy are you complaining, when we\u2019re taking care of it for you? What is your problem?\u201d Ms. Paschall said. \u201cWe are not being a menace. The only thing that\u2019s happening is, you\u2019re not getting paid for it.\u201dThe city has been reluctant to crack down on individuals who need the recyclables, in particular bottles and cans, to survive, and has instead targeted operations that appear to be more organized and employ an array of collectors to haul away large amounts. A city law passed in 2008 allows people to collect bottles and cans with some restrictions, including forbidding the use of vehicles.\u201cWhy should they even try to hinder us from doing this type of thing?\u201d Ms. Celestin, who is a nurse\u2019s aide, said, adding that the extra money was essential to them. \u201cYou make $40, you can go to the market, you can do your laundry, it could put gas in my car. Why should they take food off my table?\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Wind Given as Possible Cause of Fatal Plane Crash in Russia", "Date": "2016-03-19", "News": "Supported byMOSCOW \u2014 A Boeing 737-800 from the United Arab Emirates with 62 people aboard crashed early Saturday while trying to land at the airport in the southern Russian city of Rostov-on-Don, Russian officials said.Both of the plane\u2019s flight data recorders were recovered, the Russian Investigative Committee, a law enforcement agency, said. In a statement on its website, the agency listed \u201ccrew error, technical failure, adverse weather conditions and other factors\u201d as possible reasons for the crash.The airliner was operated by the Dubai budget carrier FlyDubai, which confirmed that the plane had crashed on landing and that none of the passengers had survived. Forty-four of the passengers were Russian, eight were Ukrainian, two were Indian and one was a citizen of Uzbekistan, the airline said.\u201cWe are doing everything that we can to help those who have been affected,\u201d the airline\u2019s chief executive, Ghaith al-Ghaith, said in a video posted on Facebook.On the second landing attempt, a wing of the plane struck the ground, and the aircraft began to break apart and burn, the statement said.\u201cIf the wing did strike the ground, it would indicate a loss of stability at the very least, which could be the result of wind shear,\u201d said John J. Goglia, an aviation safety consultant and a former member of United States National Transportation Safety Board. While wind shear can occur at all stages of flight, it is most dangerous during takeoff and landing, when the plane is \u201clow and slow,\u201d Mr. Goglia said.The Interfax news agency quoted Mr. Golubev, the regional governor, as saying the plane had crashed short of the runway. \u201cWith all likelihood, the strongly gusting wind, approaching a hurricane level, was the cause of the air crash,\u201d Interfax quoted Mr. Golubev as saying.Gusts reached 43 miles per hour at the time of the crash, according to the Flightradar24 website, which said there had also been light rain.The Rostov-on-Don airport is scheduled to be closed next year, after a new one farther from the city center is completed. The airport served just over two million passengers last year.A well-known Russian pilot, Andrei Litvinov, said Saturday on Russian television that the airport lacked advanced navigation equipment that would make the landing procedure easier for pilots.President Vladimir V. Putin expressed his condolences to the families of the victims, according to a statement on the Kremlin\u2019s website. Mr. Golubev declared Sunday a day of mourning, Interfax said.FlyDubai\u2019s website said the plane could seat up to 189 people. The airline said 33 of the passengers were women and four were children. The seven crew members were from Cyprus, Spain, the Seychelles, Colombia, Kyrgyzstan and Russia, according to the Emergency Situations Ministry\u2019s updated list.The Russian Investigative Committee said in a statement online that it had set up a team of at least 50 investigators to look into the crash.

{"Headline": "Artifacts of a Doomed Expedition", "Date": "2016-03-18", "News": "AdvertisementOn a Monday morning in May 1845, two ships, the Erebus and the Terror, set out from Greenhithe, England, to chart a northwest passage to India and China. They departed with 134 crew members commanded by Sir John Franklin, 59, a decorated explorer famous for his previous journeys to the north. The ships were former bomb vessels that had been refitted with iron plating, furnaces and steam engines. They carried the latest magnetic surveying instruments and were provisioned for three years: The ships\u2019 manifests listed 32,289 pounds of preserved meat, 1,008 pounds of raisins and 580 gallons of pickles. Also aboard were 2,000 books, a hand organ and a daguerreotype.Three years after setting out, Franklin and his 129 men (five had been discharged and sent back home within three months) were missing. The British public, and Franklin\u2019s wife, Lady Jane, held out hope that they were still alive, and the admiralty dispatched its first search parties along the largely uncharted route that Franklin had followed. In 1850, three graves, two dated January and one April 1846, were discovered by American and British searchers on Beechey Island, an uninhabited speck, less than two square miles, in northernmost Canada.No further traces were found until 1854, when John Rae, a Scottish explorer searching for the men, met some Inuit at Pelly Bay, southwest of Baffin Island. They were carrying personal items from Franklin\u2019s crew found at abandoned camps. A gold cap band. A telescope. The Inuit also described seeing kettles containing cooked human remains. Rae reported this disturbing news to the admiralty, and it was published in the London papers. Charles Dickens, in an 1854 edition of his weekly Household Words, dismissed the accounts Rae collected as \u2018\u2018the vague babble of savages.\u2019\u2019 Finally, in 1859, an official naval record was found in a stone cairn at Victory Point, on the northwest coast of King William Island, a rippling expanse of tundra 150 miles above the Arctic Circle. The record held two messages. The first ended with \u2018\u2018All well.\u2019\u2019 The second, written in shakier script, reported that Franklin was dead. With the Erebus and the Terror stuck in ice, the men abandoned ship on April 22, 1848, and began a march, presumably to a trading post 600 miles south.In the years since, the mystery of what happened to those men has inspired countless writers and artists. Wilkie Collins, Jules Verne, Mark Twain and Margaret Atwood all wrote fiction based on the Franklin expedition. James Taylor, Iron Maiden and the Breeders wrote songs about the sailors and their ordeal. Hobbyists and scholars connect on Facebook and blog forums to pore over evidence and crowdsource keys to the question of how, exactly, the men died.From 1849 to the present, some 90 search parties have set out to find the fate of Franklin and company. A toothbrush was found lying atop the windblown tundra. A lowering mechanism for the ship\u2019s lifeboats was discovered when ice melted in the summer. Recently, dinner china was found in the debris field of the Erebus, preserved by ice water.The National Maritime Museum in Greenwich, England, has more than 400 of the relics from the expedition, recovered by 19th-century search parties. Personal belongings, like bone combs and soap, are emotional to contemplate. A piece of uniform found beneath a skeleton in 1859 was placed in Abraham Lincoln\u2019s coffin by a dignitary. Franklin\u2019s fiddle-pattern cutlery is in usable condition.Bits and buttons keep turning up in a trail of Victorian breadcrumbs strewn across the tundra. Some artifacts, like files and tins, have been repurposed by the Inuit as sledge runners and knives, and some relics are nearly dust, like the scraps of a naval overcoat found frozen to the bleached bones of a skeleton. But each fragment flickers with a life.In 1984, Owen Beattie, a Canadian anthropologist, exhumed the three Beechey Island graves in order to examine, X-ray and autopsy their contents. The permafrost had preserved John Torrington, John Hartnell and William Braine perfectly, even keeping intact snow dusting Torrington\u2019s coffin, indicating a light flurry the day he was buried in 1846. Franklin had given the men proper burials in navy wool-covered coffins trimmed with decorative handles and cushioned by wood shavings. Three years later, Beattie and a writer, John Geiger, published \u2018\u2018Frozen in Time,\u2019\u2019 in which they argued that Franklin\u2019s men had suffered from acute lead poisoning. The most likely cause: 8,000 tins of food, sloppily soldered with lead. The levels of the toxin Beattie found in the three frozen sailors could have produced symptoms of malaise, irritability, convulsions, anorexia and coma. There are color photographs of the frozen sailors online. Torrington was 19 when he sailed as a petty officer on the Terror. He has pale eyelashes, bare feet and narrow hands. His clothing is delicate: shell buttons, linen trousers and a fine blue stripe on his cotton shirt. A blue-and-white polka-dot kerchief is bound under his chin and around his head, keeping his jaw in place. His expression is calm. There is a passage in \u2018\u2018Frozen in Time\u2019\u2019 I keep going back to, in which Geiger describes Beattie\u2019s lifting Torrington\u2019s body from his grave, after days of pickax work and slow thawing:\u2018\u2018He was very light, weighing less than 88 pounds, and as they moved him his head lolled onto Beattie\u2019s left shoulder; Beattie looked directly into Torrington\u2019s half-open eyes, only a few inches from his own.\u2019\u2019It is a Piet\u00e0 in warped time. A man cradles a boy 123 years his senior.On Sept. 2, 2014, a team of researchers and divers, backed by 13 partners including the Arctic Research Foundation, the Royal Canadian Geographical Society and the Canadian Navy, and led by a 43-year-old Parks Canada underwater archaeologist named Ryan Harris, found the H.M.S. Erebus, upright and intact. It was lying in 33 feet of water in Queen Maud Gulf, just north of mainland Canada. This news, in Canada at least, where I\u2019m from, was big. My dad sent me commemorative stamps. They recovered the ship\u2019s bell \u2014 often considered the soul of a vessel \u2014 and hoped the wreck might illuminate how the crew\u2019s ordeal unfolded. In New York, I excitedly brought up the discovery at dinners, over coffee and at the playground, only to find that just a handful of people knew about Franklin.I\u2019m not a reporter. I paint and draw, make conceptual books and graphic novels. I get fixated on things, on pieces of history, on patterns and form. Most of my work, and life, is preoccupied with objects and the value we place on them.One night, in a London hotel bar, I have a drink with my friend Mark. We talk about Franklin. Mark asks me what \u2018\u2018Erebus\u2019\u2019 means anyway. I shrug. We look it up on his phone. He reads the definition aloud: \u2018\u2018One: a personification of darkness in Greek mythology. Two: a place of darkness in the underworld on the way to Hades.\u2019\u2019I go upstairs to my room, order soup and for three hours scroll through the National Maritime Museum\u2019s online catalog of Franklin expedition relics, losing myself in the virtual vitrines. I take screen grabs. Pieces of iron, snow goggles and forks stack on my computer desktop.The Latin word \u2018\u2018Vesper\u2019\u2019 is related to the Greek \u2018\u2018Hesperides,\u2019\u2019 three daughters whose parentage has been traced to Nyx and Erebus.On one of the hottest days of the summer, I meet the \u2018\u2018Frozen in Time\u2019\u2019 author John Geiger in a Toronto restaurant. He is now C.E.O. of the Royal Canadian Geographical Society. Over Arctic char, he recommends books about Inuit testimony of their sightings of Franklin\u2019s men, telling me, \u2018\u2018The Inuit had always known where one of the boats sank \u2014 their oral history is incredibly accurate.\u2019\u2019By the end of lunch, he has invited me to join an expedition the R.C.G.S. is organizing on King William Island, Nunavut, an island the size of Jamaica with a population of 1,200. It is one of the last places Franklin\u2019s men were seen. Louie Kamookak, 56, an Inuit historian specializing in aboriginal knowledge, will be taking a group of students from Gjoa Haven, a 95 percent Inuit hamlet on the southeast coast of the island, to sites where Franklin relics have been found.In the late 1840s, on the southwest coast of King William Island, a small Inuit hunting group encountered 30 white men who asked for food. The Inuit traded whale blubber and seal meat for a knife, then watched as the men melted the blubber and cooked the meat over it, losing the blood and fat considered by the Inuit to be the most nutritious parts.Since the 2014 discovery of the Erebus, Parks Canada has made a five-year plan to continue to search for the Terror and to dive to the Erebus and eventually go inside the ship to try to find clues. If there are human remains, they could help identify the last survivors of the party.The window for dives is small. The Arctic summer is brief, and waterways open up for only a few weeks, if at all, each August and September. A 40-year-old fishing boat, the Martin Bergmann, has been the dedicated vessel on which the dive team lives and works. It belongs to the Arctic Research Foundation, created by the Canadian businessman Jim Balsillie, a former BlackBerry C.E.O. turned philanthropist. I am invited to visit the Bergmann while it\u2019s at anchor in Cambridge Bay, 200 miles west of Gjoa Haven.I imagine Richard Wall, the cook on the Erebus, trying to light a match to the camp stove. He can\u2019t feel his fingers, black with frostbite. Three matches go out before he finally lights one to a small piece of wool and then to the paper in the stove. Half the men won\u2019t touch the tinned food. Wall spits in the snow. His gums are bleeding. He wiggles his bottom teeth with his tongue as the pemmican thaws.In 1859, a search party discovered an abandoned boat in the northwest part of King William Island. It was mounted on a sledge and contained two skeletons and a heavy heap of items like cutlery, books, plates, soap, chocolate and worsted-work slippers.A few weeks before my trip to King William Island, I spend some time at my parents\u2019 house near the Niagara escarpment. I think they are on the hoarder spectrum and worry I am too. A glance behind the barn reveals five fenders, eight worn-out plastic shovels, a dryer, a small fridge, a wheelchair, two axles, a sign holder and a toilet seat. I understand why my father is holding onto these things. It all might come in handy. Franklin\u2019s crew members probably planned on trading their things with the Inuit they hoped to encounter, but the sheer weight of the load \u2014 estimated at 1,400 pounds \u2014 would have exhausted the suffering men.At a camping store, I keep stopping in front of the Freshette, a plastic funnel allowing women to urinate standing. It is $22.95. I want it.I wonder how cold it will be. I look it up. The weather looks O.K. for late summer, 35 degrees dropping to 30 at night. The day before my departure, I try on all my new cold-weather clothes and look in the mirror. I start to shiver. It is 84 outside, and the air conditioner in my bedroom is blasting. The \u2018\u2018smart wool\u2019\u2019 of my long underwear is itchy. The technical fiber in my shirt smells weird. I think about the navy-issue woolens the crew wore. I\u2019m sure a few of the men suffered from eczema, as I do. Psoriasis. God knows. I like how prepared I look. Maybe some of the men were vain like me. Scurvy and lead poisoning would be hard on the vain.I remove my clothes and pack them. In the morning, I\u2019ll take a flight to Toronto for a connection to Edmonton. From there I\u2019ll fly to Yellowknife and catch a prop plane to Gjoa Haven. The trip takes 13 hours. I will be gone for 10 days. I already miss my 2-year-old daughter.On Beechey Island in 1846, someone laid a pair of gloves on the ground to dry. They placed stones on the palms to keep them from blowing away. I imagine a sailor with two left hands. Then I imagine a girl, learning how to cast and purl, knitting them for her older brother. Not realizing her mistake until he tries them on the morning he leaves.Thomas Evans was 18 when the expedition sailed in 1845. He lived with six siblings and his grandfather in Kent, and was listed as a ship\u2019s boy in the H.M.S. Terror muster roll. The left-hand glove is worn in the usual way, the thumb rubbed down, holes in the index finger, palm stained. The left-hand glove that was worn on the right is cleaner, its wear on the opposite side. The heart-shaped embroidery on its palm is clear. Evans reassures his tearful sister that they fit perfectly.I continue walking. In the bay, the tide is out, leaving seaweed-covered rocks exposed. They look like the tops of green-haired men, sunk up to the brow line. Like they have male pattern baldness. I think again of male vanity.Louie Kamookak is tall and broad, and doesn\u2019t speak much. On the morning of Sept. 5, we load two motorboats and head west. The water is smooth and we spot a seal in our boat\u2019s wake. The goal of the King William Island expedition, as set out by Kamookak and the R.C.G.S., is to pass on what remains of the oral history of the Franklin expedition to the next generation of Inuit. I sit behind Josephine Kamookak, Louie\u2019s wife, and their daughter, Jade, who is 12. A student, Shaunya, 18, sits beside me. In a second boat are five others, including two more students, James and Michael, both 16. David Qirqqut, a former Royal Canadian Mounted Police officer, drives the boat, and his father, Jimmy, 78, sits behind him. We are headed to Peabody Point on the southwest coast of the Island, known to the Inuit as Malerualik, or \u2018\u2018the place where one could follow after caribou.\u2019\u2019 I like this straightforward way of naming. The Erebus was found near an island called Umiaqtalik, which translates to \u2018\u2018there is a boat there.\u2019\u2019Kamookak knows the cellphone numbers of everyone in Gjoa Haven by heart. When he speaks, it\u2019s in a precise monotone, and the bare minimum; often little more than a shrug. I soon realize that oral tradition is about listening, not speaking. I ask what makes the Inuit good listeners. \u2018\u2018They have nothing else to distract,\u2019\u2019 he says. \u2018\u2018The lights go out, it\u2019s dark, the elders tell a story, you listen and you fall asleep. It\u2019s very quiet in an igloo.\u2019\u2019I show Kamookak a picture of four brass buttons from the National Maritime Museum collection. He thinks they should have been left at the abandoned camp where they were found. \u2018\u2018When an Inuit dies, he is buried with his belongings,\u2019\u2019 he explains. \u2018\u2018It\u2019s bad luck to take a dead person\u2019s stuff.\u2019\u2019 If an Inuit needs something that was left with the deceased, like a tool or an article of clothing, he or she will make a miniature replica and switch the two. At a grave site, Kamookak leads us in the Inuit tradition of circling the grave clockwise, to show respect for the dead.Malerualik is not far from where a skeleton was found in 1859 by Francis Leopold McClintock of the search vessel the Fox. He writes: \u2018\u2018I came upon a human skeleton, partly exposed, with here and there a few fragments of clothing appearing through the snow. The skeleton, now perfectly bleached, was lying upon its face.\u2019\u2019 The skeleton was presumed to be Henry Peter Peglar, captain of the foretop on the Terror, but is likely to be Peglar\u2019s friend, Thomas Armitage, the gun-room steward.I wonder if one line, \u2018\u2018all my art Tom,\u2019\u2019 meant Peglar and Armitage were in love. Traditionally, when ships wintered over in the Arctic, the crews would put on concerts and pantomimes to offset the boredom. Illiterate sailors were taught to read. Parlor games were played. I wonder if Armitage was carrying souvenirs of a winter night spent below decks killing time.In my tent, I think about Thomas Armitage, found nearby, face down. Just \u2014 splat. How everyone thought he was Peglar until the knot in his neckerchief \u2014 not a style the captain of the foretop would assume \u2014 gave his rank away. But maybe Peglar was wearing his friend\u2019s scarf? I think about people who don\u2019t die in their own clothes.The two pairs of pants I have with me are not mine. One pair is North Face fleece, with knee and bum patches, lent to me by a friend. The other is an old pair of hunting trousers found at a yard sale. They are men\u2019s but at some point have been roughly tailored to fit a woman. The legs evidence years of someone else\u2019s stains and wear. If I died in either of these pairs of pants, people would get the wrong idea.I begin to consider my family and friends in terms of how their qualities would be tested in severe temperatures or situations. My brother would show grit but impatience. My father might mutiny. My mother would starve herself to feed others. If I were hauling 600 miles across the Arctic, I\u2019d choose J. for stamina and his uncomplaining nature; A. for her medical skills and ability to play music; N. because he\u2019s optimistic and multilingual; H. for her understanding of the natural world; T. for her scientific mind, though she probably would not hesitate to fry my liver and eat it if I died.Thomas Honey, a carpenter on the Terror, has been given orders to make a saw. He uses a file to cut the serrated teeth, his progress painstaking because his hands are frostbitten. When he is finished, he brings the saw to John Peddie, a surgeon, where he has laid the stiffened body of Thomas Terry, a boatswain. Honey walks a few paces and retches into an icebank.On our third day, the wind picks up. Jimmy Qirqqut points out a ring around the sun. Bad weather. Simpson Strait, the narrowest waterway between King William Island and the mainland of the Adelaide Peninsula, is white-capped. I ask Kamookak about the likelihood of returning home by the afternoon, and he shrugs and turns his tent so it is not broadside to the wind. I do the same with mine. Josephine, while uphill at the makeshift toilet, spots some caribou. A cry goes up through camp. The students grab guns and head upriver. I walk to a peak, where four of us \u2014 the women and the elders \u2014 pass around binoculars.When we see that Michael has made a kill, Shaunya and I head across the rocks. As we walk, my attention is caught by the lichen on the rocks. It is bright orange, making the ground look sprinkled with Cheetos dust. She tells me Michael is a sharpshooter who turned down an opportunity to go to a national competition in Montreal because he didn\u2019t like the idea of the long flight. They are butchering the caribou, a large female, when we arrive. It\u2019s like watching a pit crew. The students are covered in blood. Within 10 minutes, the organs are tied up in a large furry package. One boy slings the hindquarters over his shoulders, the other strings together the trunk with twine, Shaunya carries the guns. The velvety antlers are left behind.After a lunch of rich caribou liver, fried and peppered, and starchy pilot crackers, Kamookak decides the wind has died down enough for us to head home. We quickly pack up. The small boats are difficult to handle in the chop. Halfway across Douglas Bay, a deep inlet on the south coast of the island, we reverse and pull into a cove. It\u2019s too dangerous to continue. We climb out and sit on the shore. It gets colder. We\u2019ll pitch camp here if the wind does not die down. I throw some rocks, trying to hit a \u2018\u2018Toy Story\u2019\u2019 diaper that has been left on the ground. I remember a line from Barry Lopez\u2019s book \u2018\u2018Arctic Dreams\u2019\u2019: \u2018\u2018To travel in the Arctic is to wait.\u2019\u2019 My flight to Cambridge Bay to meet the divers\u2019 ship, the Bergmann, is in 18 hours. Time feels gummy, as if it\u2019s stretching and compressing. In 1847, the ice in Victoria Strait, directly west of King William Island, where the admiralty recommended Franklin sail, did not melt during the summer. Nor did it melt in 1848. The ships were stuck.When we finally pull up to the small hotel, the doors are locked. Because the ship is at anchor and the divers and crew are staying ashore, I ask if I can stay on the boat. Schimnowski shrugs. If you want to.I\u2019ve been carrying 4-by-6 prints of daguerreotypes taken of some of the H.M.S. Erebus officers. A curly lock of hair falls over the forehead of James Fitzjames, the ship\u2019s commander. Harry D. S. Goodsir, the ship\u2019s naturalist, holds his hand to his temple, pensive. James Reid, ice master, clutches a telescope. Franklin\u2019s portrait is blurred. He looks stout and bleary. Letters from the ship\u2019s surgeon, Stephen Stanley (collar popped, smiling), report that the day the picture was taken, Franklin had the flu. He seems preoccupied. He had amassed years of Arctic experience, but his 1819 expedition to the Coppermine River resulted in the deaths by starvation of 11 crew members, a murder and Franklin\u2019s having to subsist on shoe leather and soup made from lichen. He was able to spin this into a popular book, \u2018\u2018To the Shores of the Polar Sea,\u2019\u2019 and he became known in London as \u2018\u2018The Man Who Ate His Boots.\u2019\u2019Franklin\u2019s reputation, since the late 19th century, has made the rounds from hero to fool. But Ryan Harris, the lead diver who discovered the Erebus in 2014, leapt to Franklin\u2019s defense when I suggested that the mission had some blind spots. \u2018\u2018Franklin and his men were doomed the moment they received orders from the admiralty. He followed those orders to a T and into the worst choke point in the Arctic Archipelago.\u2019\u2019 Harris, the most successful searcher in 170 years, is loyal to the captain: \u2018\u2018The notion that Franklin was anything but a sterling naval officer I just can\u2019t accept. He followed his orders faithfully and died.\u2019\u2019The Bergmann is built like a little blue teapot. Short and stout. There is nothing sleek, nothing gleaming or high-tech about it. I peek in the pantry. Tea, maple syrup, cereal. A map of the Arctic Archipelago is spread beneath a Plexiglas tabletop. Atop it sit a deck of cards, a pair of aviators and \u2018\u2018The Quest for the Northwest Passage,\u2019\u2019 by Glyn Williams.Straight off the kitchen is the lab, formerly a fish hold. This is where most of the onboard cataloging, diagraming and technical work is done. Heavy neoprene wet suits hang, feet suspended a few inches from the floor, and rainbow-colored multibeam sonar images of the Erebus hull are taped to the walls. My bunk is tucked into the bow, in a three-person cabin dubbed \u2018\u2018the executive suite.\u2019\u2019 Yellow foam mattresses are covered with faded plaid, floral and geometric patterned sheets.I sleep well. When I wake in the dark morning, gently rocking, a feeling of peacefulness comes over me. I walk through the lab, pushing past the rows of empty wet suits.Filippo Ronca, an underwater archaeologist responsible for the safety of the crew, tells me the hose that supplies air to a diver is called the umbilical. The cold, Ronca explains, is not the most dangerous element in Arctic diving. The most worrisome aspect is how remote the team is from emergency assistance. Ronca recounts how once, as an exercise in compassion, he tried to fix a shovel handle with no tools: \u2018\u2018I just worked on it and worked on it, and just imagined what Franklin\u2019s guys would have gone through. Four hours and a couple of bloody fingers later, I was able to fix it.\u2019\u2019The divers have been working around the clock during the tiny window of ice-free water the Arctic summer provides. By the time they return to Ottawa, they will have put in 25 days of diving over the past two years. They\u2019ve managed to trim all the seaweed off the Erebus, retrieve artifacts and test structural stability. But they still have not gone inside.Ronca shows me a printout of a picture of his family he keeps inside a Ziploc bag in his wet suit when he dives. The paper is creased and worn. It has been folded and unfolded many times.William Wentzall, able seaman, turns in his hammock and feels the frame of a purse press into his armpit. He pulls it out of his pocket and holds it to his nose and lips. Hannah, his wife, gave him her beaded purse, containing a lock of hair from their first son, William, who was buried on Christmas Eve 1842. When Wentzall left to sail on the H.M.S. Terror, Hannah was heavily pregnant.In the final weeks of my research and writing, I scratch my cornea badly with the end of a paintbrush. My 20/13 vision, of which I am overly proud, is reduced to 20/50 in my left eye. It hurts to look at light. I feel off balance, bumping into doorjambs and grabbing twice at the refrigerator door. The theme of visibility has shadowed me for the last year: The Franklin story is riddled with gaps in foresight, lack of wisdom, snow blindness, faith in navigation, even clairvoyance (the ghost of a little girl was consulted by Lady Jane Franklin as to where the ships were abandoned). The story of any wreck is told in hindsight. I think again about blind spots.Back in Toronto, I sit down with Jim Balsillie, the founder of the Arctic Research Foundation, in the lobby of the Shangri-La Hotel. We drink mint tea. \u2018\u2018Up there, the penalty for blind spots is death,\u2019\u2019 he says bluntly. He points out that so many Inuit myths end in death: \u2018\u2018Here is the story of a husband who didn\u2019t share his food with his wife, so he died. Here\u2019s the story of boys and girls who were not respectful of the ice monster, so they died. Here\u2019s the story of the little girl who didn\u2019t tie up her mukluks right, so her feet froze off and she died.\u2019\u2019 My pen explodes, and he gives me his.When I return to New York, the two movies everyone is talking about are \u2018\u2018The Martian\u2019\u2019 and \u2018\u2018The Revenant.\u2019\u2019 Both are survival stories. First I see \u2018\u2018The Martian,\u2019\u2019 in which the astronaut Mark Watney gets stuck on Mars. In the final scene, Watney advises his students: \u2018\u2018At some point, everything\u2019s gonna go south on you.\u2019\u2019 He continues: \u2018\u2018You can either accept that, or you can get to work. That\u2019s all it is. You just begin, you do the math, you solve one problem, then you solve the next one, and then the next, and if you solve enough problems you get to go home.\u2019\u2019 I think of 129 men who didn\u2019 t go home. I walk out into the multiplex lobby. I feel as if I\u2019ve just watched an episode of \u2018\u2018Curious George.\u2019\u2019I see a matinee of \u2018\u2018The Revenant\u2019\u2019 on New Year\u2019s Day. In it, the frontiersman Hugh Glass also solves problem after problem. Where Watney removes shrapnel from his abdomen, Glass cauterizes a severed windpipe with gunpowder; Watney heats his rover with a radioisotope thermoelectric generator, while Glass uses a dead horse as a duvet. (Luke Skywalker did this with a tauntaun in 1980.) In the end, instead of taking full credit for his success, as Watney does, Glass realizes the futility of revenge in the face of grief and leaves his fate in God\u2019s hands. Each narrative is triumphalist. After a year of thinking about Franklin, I\u2019m not so interested in triumph; I\u2019m more interested in tragedy. Has our appetite for artistic tragedy waned as we get daily reports of shootings, suicide bombs, still more lead poisoning?Hugh Glass reminds me of my favorite character in the whole Franklin story, the Scottish explorer John Rae, who was renowned for his physical endurance and respect for natives. Were he part of the Franklin expedition, he probably would have survived. Still, I doubt anyone could turn Franklin\u2019s story into a triumphalist narrative. He and his men died. We are left with stuff. So much stuff. And more to be recovered.What are we looking for?I ask Bernier and Harris, the Parks Canada divers, if their theories about what happened to Franklin have changed with the discovery of the Erebus. Harris points out that the location validates the Inuit accounts of where the ship sank, but adds, \u2018\u2018We don\u2019t have any earth-shattering observations to make at this point.\u2019\u2019Bernier adds: \u2018\u2018We haven\u2019t seen any big conclusion one way or the other.\u2019\u2019I look out the window of my new apartment to the building across the street. I\u2019m wearing a pair of bone snow goggles I bought on my last day in Gjoa Haven. I can see the mortar between each brick and can read the \u2018\u2018Friedrich\u2019\u2019 logo on the air-conditioning units. Things seem closer and clearer. The design is crude but perfect: a hollowed-out bone, a dent for the bridge of a nose and two narrow slits. I take them off, place them on my bookshelf and think of the pairs Franklin\u2019s crew fashioned out of reading spectacles.The steward Tom Jopson glances over Capt. Francis Crozier\u2019s quarters for the last time. Crozier has ordered all to abandon ship. On his way out, Jopson pauses in the doorway and looks at the linen curtains hanging on a rod. He turns back, unhooks the rod, discards the drape and tucks it under his armpit.At the eye doctor, the vision in my left eye is only 20/50 until I am handed a pinhole occluder to look through. My vision improves to 20/25. When I ask my doctor how obstructing vision makes things clearer, she explains that the occluder, a plastic sievelike disc, cuts down on periphery, focuses vision and can correct myopia.To travel, hunt, survive, to simply see in the Arctic, the aperture needs to be smaller.I\u2019ve been making replicas of the artifacts by painting them. By occluding the value of these pieces, I\u2019m trying to see the men and their lives. I think about how David Qirqqut, when we were camping one night, described the traditional Inuit sense of time: The new moon every month has a meaning, and the Inuit have a name for each new moon, relating to a detail of an animal or the landscape. The bright half moon in the sky, he explained, means it is the time of the year when the velvet of the caribou antlers is coming off. There is no new year.Leanne Shapton is an artist, an author and a publisher based in New York City.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "This Is Trump Country", "Date": "2016-03-04", "News": "AdvertisementBut the coal business is troubled. The county\u2019s unemployment rate in December was 10.6 percent, the highest in Virginia and more than double the statewide rate of 3.9 percent. And since 1980, its population has fallen by about 40 percent. Dana O\u2019Quinn, a lifelong resident, has been a barber for close to 40 years. These days, fewer people are coming in to get their hair cut. Those who have remained are much poorer than people elsewhere in the state. Fewer than one in 10 adults have a bachelor\u2019s degree or higher. Ms. O\u2019Quinn, a Democrat, won\u2019t be voting for Mr. Trump. But she acknowledged his appeal, saying people in Buchanan County are looking for a change. As with other New England mill communities, those days are long gone. In December, the unemployment rate was 8 percent, among the highest in Massachusetts. Its median income is about half that of the state as a whole. Even its city motto lacks gusto: \u201cWe\u2019ll try.\u201d Bruno Teixeira, 68, voted for Mr. Trump on Tuesday. He used to work as a foreman at a factory that dyed and finished cloth. \u201cI was fortunate that I could say I retired,\u201d he said. \u201cI never thought I would, I thought it was going to be pulled out from under me, like it was for a lot of my colleagues.\u201d Mr. Teixeira\u2019s father came to the United States from Portugal, his mother from England. He said he liked Mr. Trump\u2019s views on immigration, as well as his straightforward talk. \u201cI think most people here realize this is a big opportunity to change the economy,\u201d he said. \u201cWho better to change the economy than a businessman?\u201d Atkinson County, in southern Georgia, is poorer and less educated than the state as a whole. Fewer than one in 10 adults has a bachelor\u2019s degree or higher. A sizable portion of the county is farmland, but hundreds of people also work in manufacturing. Its list of big employers last year included makers of prefabricated buildings, decorative moldings and bags for produce. Its share of residents who are Hispanic, about a quarter, is among the largest in Georgia. Most of them are of Mexican descent. (They were most likely not voting Republican; in Georgia, only 3 percent of voters in last Tuesday\u2019s Republican primary were Hispanic, according to exit polls.) Mr. Morris said his wife volunteered for the Trump campaign, getting the word out in Atkinson County. The interest in Mr. Trump, he said, was unmistakable. \u201cI\u2019ve been involved in party politics since \u201992,\u201d Mr. Morris said, \u201cand this is the most exciting thing I\u2019ve seen.\u201d Shelta Shrum, 59, spent two decades working at a boot factory, where she was a clerical worker.

{"Headline": "Google and Apple: the High-Tech Hippies of Silicon Valley", "Date": "2016-03-28", "News": "Supported byWhy are the two companies spending billions to build offices that look lifted straight from the 1960s?11 PhotosFor all the talk of \u201cdisruption\u201d coming out of Silicon Valley, one thing that has tended to remain stubbornly stuck in the past is tech companies\u2019 architecture. Many of today\u2019s most innovative companies are housed in deadly dull, boxy and glassy suburban campuses: Google lives in the rehabbed buildings once occupied by Silicon Graphics, Facebook in a laboratory from the 1960s. Though the interiors might have advanced lighting systems, state-of-the-art fitness facilities and cafeterias serving farm-to-table fare, the exteriors \u2014 flat, unarticulated facades; ribbon windows; hard right angles \u2014 could come from any suburban office corridor anywhere in the country, and from any moment in the past half-century.This is why the recently revealed plans for the new campuses of Google, in Mountain View, Calif., designed by Bjarke Ingels and Thomas Heatherwick, and Apple, in Cupertino, from Sir Norman Foster, are so striking: They, like the companies they will house, point to the future \u2014 the future, that is, as it looked in the 1960s. Images of the projected Apple campus \u2014 a four-tiered ringlike structure nestled in a thickly wooded landscape \u2014 evoke the landing of an alien spaceship. The central structure in Ingels\u2019s and Heatherwick\u2019s design is canopied by a sinuous glass membrane, a protective bubble or amniotic sac, shielding an entire section of the campus \u2014 not just buildings but bike paths and desks \u2014 while letting the abundant Northern California light stream in. In aerial renderings it looks like larvae, incubating a new and possibly terrifying future.Like the rest of Silicon Valley, however, this future is in fact rooted in the past. It comes, transfigured, from the wrecked dreams of communal living, of back-to-the-land utopias, of expanding plastic spheres and geodesic domes that populated the landscape of Northern California around the time (and around the same place) that the first semiconductors were being perfected. This is the world of what a recent exhibit at the Walker Art Center in Minneapolis has termed \u201cHippie Modernism.\u201d Out of the ferment of the \u201960s came a spectacular brew of experiments that softened the edge of the bureaucratic architecture of Modernism and explored new shapes and styles of building, new ideas about how to live and work. In the world of the counterculture, round and pliant was good; sharp and angular was bad. These concepts found their way into the cinema \u2014 into the soft plastic finishes of the circular, rotating space station in Stanley Kubrick\u2019s \u201c2001: A Space Odyssey,\u201d where it was the antithesis of the sourceless, death-bringing black slab monolith, itself almost the clone of that icon of corporate Modernism, Mies van der \u00adRohe\u2019s Seagram Building. Now those same undulations have found their way back to us, in the form of impregnable corporate campuses for the future-plotting, world-dominating, \u201cdon\u2019t be evil\u201d tech industry.It may sound unlikely, but there is in fact a strong connection between the utopian movements of the \u201960s and the tech industry; it\u2019s a topic that\u2019s been well explored by academics, most notably in Stanford professor Fred Turner\u2019s wonderful 2006 history \u201cFrom Counterculture to Cyberculture.\u201d Turner\u2019s book centers on the role played by Merry Prankster-turned-designer Stewart Brand, whose magazine The Whole Earth Catalog, started in 1968 and regularly published through 1972, advocated \u201960s ideals of autonomy, do-it-yourself design and deep ecological thinking. The cover of the first issue was an image of the earth \u2014 another sphere \u2014 taken from space, exemplifying its spirit of holism. Brand advertised where you could get tools to build out the new society, among them, critically, new technology, from calculators to Moog synthesizers, which connected him, and the counterculture, to the burgeoning tech scene. Kevin Kelly, a co-founder of Wired and one of the editors of The Whole Earth Catalog, thought that the magazine\u2019s ethos of sharing products and communications, even its cobbled-together design, prefigured the blog. The young Steve Jobs, for one, was a huge fan. \u201cOn the back cover of their final issue,\u201d Jobs told graduating Stanford students in a 2005 commencement speech, \u201cwas a photograph of an early morning country road, the kind you might find yourself hitchhiking on if you were so adventurous. Beneath it were the words: \u2018Stay Hungry. Stay Foolish.\u2019\u200a\u201d Brand himself would later call Jobs one of the exemplary fusers of the counterculture and technology.Brand was also an enthusiast for countercultural design ideas as a way to build a new society. In an issue from 1971, he called for the creation of an \u201cOutlaw Area,\u201d a territory removed from civilization, where human community could be reinvented. \u201cAny design fantasy is just loose talk until it happens,\u201d he wrote, suggesting that the Outlaw Area would transform our understanding of what human beings were capable of, \u201cbending reality off into unimaginable directions with no restrictions save the harsh ones of nature.\u201dThe designers who followed up on Brand\u2019s injunctions over the next decade would create forms that startlingly presage the new office worlds being designed by Google and Apple. Above all, they would take to heart the idea of \u201cbending reality,\u201d with their embrace of soft, flexible, organic forms. Architects became attracted to furniture and buildings that resembled bubbles. As the design critic Alastair Gordon observed in his book \u201cSpaced Out: Radical Environments of the Psychedelic Sixties,\u201d not only did the trippy shimmer of the bubble delight the hippies, its transparency and unpredictable movement seemed at once stimulating and human. The visionary architect Buckminster Fuller\u2019s famous concept of a \u201cgeodesic dome,\u201d a giant all-purpose shelter, drew heavily on bubble imagery. Meanwhile, students at Antioch College in Ohio conceived of a \u201cNomadic/Pneumatic Campus,\u201d an outdoor classroom sheltered by a 40-foot-high polyvinyl canopy. For a time the \u201coffices\u201d of The Whole Earth Catalog, in their temporary digs in California\u2019s Saline Valley, were sheltered in just such a bubble. The fact that they were temporary was the key: Like the conversion of garages into tech offices, the bubble shelter was meant to be forgiving, improvisatory, for a nomadic and restless society seeking a new relationship with how to fuse life and work.Not that these future society plans were limited entirely to the planet. In 1969, Princeton physics professor, Gerard O\u2019Neill, and his students began to imagine how to create a space colony to house a million people. O\u2019Neill\u2019s vision comprised two concentric cylinders (round forms, again), spinning in opposite directions to generate gravity, and on which each person would be allotted five acres of land. The designer Don Norman did a rendering of the concept, and it bears a striking resemblance to the images of the new Google office: Filled with dazzling foliage, plentiful water and bucolic housing, it looks a lot like Marin County, placed under glass.These images and experiments fueled the imagination of Silicon Valley, even as the young tech entrepreneurs began converting their ramshackle means to far different ends. It was, after all, an earth held in common that inspired the hippie Modernists to find new ways of designing and living. The new unearthly Silicon Valley campuses represent the triumph of privatized commons, of a verdant natural world sheltered for the few. Neither the Google nor Apple campus is open to the public, nor are their designs replicable on the scale that the \u201960s utopians imagined for their designs. Well after the orchards of Northern California were overwhelmed by glass boxes and suburban tracts, the tech companies find themselves looking longingly at an Edenic, prelapsarian moment, when it seemed that \u2014 to adapt a more recent slogan \u2014 another world was possible. But what was originally borne from improvisation and a desire to live simply is now borne from unimaginable mountains of cash. The new Apple office will cost an estimated $5 billion, making it possibly the most expensive office building in history. We are dealing with a bubble of a different kind.A subheading on Page 116 this weekend with an article about plans for the new Silicon Valley headquarters of Google and Apple, and the ways in which they are influenced by utopian-minded 1960s ideas, refers incorrectly to the design of one of the headquarters. It is the design of Google\u2019s headquarters \u2014 not of Apple\u2019s \u2014 that can be said to resemble larvae. The article also refers incorrectly to the technology company Silicon Graphics. Although the company went bankrupt in 2009, its assets were purchased by another company, and today it operates as Silicon Graphics International; it is not \u201clong-defunct.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Trump\u2019s campaign has reserved television airtime in Arizona, where primary voters will cast ballots on Tuesday, and where a super PAC supporting Senator Ted Cruz and his campaign are also running or preparing to run their own ads. Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign began reserving some airtime on Thursday morning. Mr. Cruz\u2019s campaign has been running an ad similar to one the Trump campaign has used elsewhere, featuring the relative of someone killed by an illegal immigrant. Arizona is a state with a heavy immigrant population, and it was ground zero for some of the most contentious crackdowns on illegal immigration over the last six years. The state\u2019s former governor, Jan Brewer, signed a 2010 law that gave the police the authority to question anyone whom they had \u201creasonable suspicion\u201d of being an undocumented immigrant. Ms. Brewer, a Republican, has endorsed Mr. Trump. So has the Maricopa County sheriff, Joseph Arpaio, whose round-ups of immigrants here illegally became famous nationally. Recent polls have shown that large numbers of Arizona voters are undecided, and Mr. Trump\u2019s lead, while large, might not be insurmountable.The patchwork of super PACs supporting Mr. Cruz, now called Trusted Leadership PAC, began reserving airtime in Arizona as well, intending to run an ad that suggests that Mr. Cruz is a rock-ribbed conservative who is also ready to be president \u2014 a consistent criticism of Mr. Trump. In Utah, which also votes on Tuesday, the anti-tax group the Club for Growth said it would air an ad against Mr. Trump, hoping to keep him from another win. Utah is a caucus state, where campaign organization can be important, and Mr. Trump has tended to fare worse in those types of contests than in primaries.\n\t\tFirst Draft provides fast-paced and comprehensive coverage of politics and elections by The New York Times.

{"Headline": "Putin\u2019s Syria Tactics Keep Him at the Fore and Leave Everyone Else Guessing", "Date": "2016-03-15", "News": "Supported by\u201cRussia does not want to fight for Assad as such,\u201d said Aleksei V. Makarkin, the deputy director of the Center for Political Technologies in Moscow. \u201cIf Russia continued, that would make it more dependent on Mr. Assad and would make it clash with other players directly.\u201dAnalysts noted that Mr. Putin had achieved most, if not all, of his goals \u2014 some stated, others not.First, to thwart another Western attempt to push for leadership change in Syria and to fight the very idea of outside governments forcing political shifts.Second, to show that Moscow is a more reliable ally than Washington, given that the Obama administration had abandoned long-term allies like former President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt when they faced political upheaval.Third, to restore to Russia the role it had in the Soviet era as an important actor in the Middle East and as a global problem solver, and to force respect for Mr. Putin as a world leader.Fourth, to shatter the isolation that Washington had tried to impose on Moscow after the crisis in Ukraine, forging a dialogue with the United States and, to a lesser degree, with Europe.Fifth, a subset of the previous goal, to distract attention from the war in Ukraine and to get lifted the economic sanctions imposed on Russia \u2014 a step the Kremlin is desperate to achieve in the face of continuing economic problems. Saving the estimated $3 million daily cost of the Syrian operations will also help, but it was not considered decisive.Sixth, to show off the effectiveness of a new generation of weaponry from Russia, the biggest arms exporter in the world after the United States.Many analysts thought the main goal, of forcing a dialogue with the United States and of reviving the Cold War idea that Washington and Moscow are the main global police forces, had been achieved. Mr. Obama\u2019s spokesman first said that the president had no idea about plans for a Russian withdrawal, but soon after the Kremlin website noted that the Russian and American leaders had spoken by telephone.The inner circle consists of Sergei K. Shoigu, the defense minister; Sergei B. Ivanov, the leader of the president\u2019s administration and a former top operative in state security; Alexander V. Bortnikov, the director of the Federal Security Service, known as the F.S.B.; and Nikolai P. Patrushev, secretary of the Security Council and a previous F.S.B. director.Given their backgrounds, the men believe that secrecy is the key to good government, said Ekaterina Schulmann, a political scientist, and they abhorred the leaky Kremlin of the 1990s.The partial cease-fire in Syria, which began Feb. 27, has proved more effective and durable than expected, significantly reducing the level of violence.They also believe that surprise announcements provide a giant public relations payoff, keeping Russians riveted to the TV news and making them feel that they are included in a parade of thrilling events, Ms. Schulmann said.\u201cA good decision in today\u2019s Russia should be swift and surprising and take everyone unawares,\u201d she said. \u201cThat is considered good political management.\u201dThey are also meant to emphasize that Russia acts alone. \u201cThe main goal is to show that Russia acts completely independently,\u201d said Alexander Morozov, an independent political analyst. \u201cWe expand our military presence without any prior consultations and wrap it up without any warning.\u201dA statement by Mr. Assad calling the announcement about the Russian withdrawal the result of a consultation process seems somewhat dubious given Mr. Putin\u2019s habit of not sharing his thinking with many Russians, much less with foreigners.Some analysts said the sudden decision was intended to send a message to Mr. Assad, who by all accounts has exasperated Mr. Putin by becoming ever more inflexible at the negotiating table as his battlefield fortunes have improved.Mr. Assad recently earned a rebuke from Russia for saying that he would continue fighting until he had unified all of Syria, and after his foreign minister dismissed talk of presidential elections, which are supposed to be part of a transition to peace. Arab diplomats in Damascus said that their Russian counterparts had emphasized in recent weeks that Russia was intervening to protect the Syrian state, not Mr. Assad himself.\u201cI think this is a shot into Assad\u2019s bow, not over Assad\u2019s bow, as Putin\u2019s way of saying that it is now up to you,\u201d said Cliff Kupchan, chairman of the Eurasia Group, a Washington-based consulting firm. \u201cAt least for now, Putin is a looming maven of peace, and that is pretty clever.\u201dThe stated goal of the military deployment in Syria was to take the fight against the metastasizing Islamic State to the \u201cterrorists\u201d themselves, before they could take the fight to Russia.Instead, the main targets proved to be immediate threats to Mr. Assad in western Syria, many of them allied with Western or Arab powers. In summarizing the achievements of the mission, Mr. Shoigu, the defense minister, noted that Russia had helped the government restore control over 400 towns and nearly 4,000 square miles of territory.Modern Russia has inflamed conflict in former Soviet republics to create \u201cfrozen zones,\u201d allowing it to influence events and confound its opponents.Some analysts in Russia and elsewhere also said they thought that Mr. Putin had begun to realize that the violence that Russia was helping to perpetuate in Syria was working at cross purposes with the goal of showing Europe that he is a reliable partner and a peacemaker who does not deserve the economic sanctions that are denying Russia desperately needed access to Western credit markets.The European Union has hinged lifting sanctions to putting into effect the Minsk II peace accords in Ukraine. The Europeans have also been alarmed that the escalating violence in Syria, now entering its sixth year, is feeding an enormous refugee crisis.It remains unclear whether Mr. Assad will show a new willingness to negotiate after the loss of his principal military patron. Syria still has foreign allies in Iran and Hezbollah that have long shored up the government. They have no interest in a political transition, which risks replacing the government dominated by the Alawite minority, a Shiite sect, with the majority Sunnis.There have long been questions about just how much leverage Moscow has ever had over Damascus, and the coming weeks might tell.If Damascus begins to flounder without Russian support, the withdrawal is instantly reversible. Dmitri S. Peskov, Mr. Putin\u2019s spokesman, noted that not all forces would be withdrawn from the Hmeymim air base near Latakia, nor from the longstanding Russian naval refueling and repair facility at Tartus.Russia will also keep its powerful S-400 air defense system in Syria to protect the forces staying behind, Mr. Ivanov, the head of the president\u2019s administration, was quoted by the Interfax news agency as saying. That would maintain Russian dominance of Syrian airspace, where bombers were still carrying out attacks on Palmyra on Tuesday, even as others were shown on Russian TV flying home.In Russia, people were asking \u201cWhat next?\u201d as often as \u201cWhy now?\u201d The rainbow of responses indicated that Mr. Putin was again leaving his own people guessing.Several members of the opposition dared to hope that with problems building up at home and parliamentary elections coming in September, Mr. Putin may be ready to focus more on domestic ills.\u201cThe choice is simple: It\u2019s either a mobilization against an external enemy or mobilization against internal problems,\u201d Dmitry Gudkov, one of few members of the opposition in Parliament, wrote on his Facebook page. \u201cIf suddenly, and almost unbelievably, it is the second, even ahead of elections, we at least have a slim chance.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misidentified the area of Syria where the Russians had concentrated their firepower. It was western Syria, not eastern.Ivan Nechepurenko contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Meeting My DNA", "Date": "2016-03-16", "News": "I was adopted when I was 6 months old, so I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know much about my family medical history. I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know, for example, whether I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m at increased risk for breast cancer, heart disease, mental illness. But home DNA testing is changing all that. The tests are sent through the mail, no lab visits required. And they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not limited to the human genome.I tested the DNA waters with Cody, my four-legged adoptee. After shelling out $69 for a Wisdom Panel DNA test kit, I swabbed the inside of Cody\u00e2\u0080\u0099s cheek with a cotton swab from the kit and dropped it in the mail. Six weeks later I received Cody\u00e2\u0080\u0099s genealogy chart by email. While I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d always considered him pure mutt, with his apple-shaped head and stocky middle, results showed an uninterrupted lineage of Chihuahuas going back three generations.I could only hope for such clarity. I ordered a kit from 23andMe, one of a handful of companies that now offer home testing for humans. Unlike the other major genetic testing companies Ancestry and Family Tree DNA, 23andMe offers both health and ancestry results. The cost is $199.As with Cody, I collected a saliva sample and dropped it in the mail. A few weeks later, I got an email saying my results were ready. I logged on to the website to see my ancestry composition distilled into a pie chart. The chart showed that my ancestors hailed from Korea, something I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d already been told. What I didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t expect to see were the smaller slices indicating I had Japanese and Chinese ancestors scattered in. Seeing my genealogy for the first time was thrilling.23andMe also scanned its database of others who had submitted their genetic material to the company for potential DNA matches. It  identified over a hundred of my relatives, ranging from fourth to eighth cousins. 23andMe predicts that the average person has around half a million eighth cousins. The number gets exponentially larger as you go back generations. Some geneticists believe that all humans are at least 50th cousins with one another.A messaging tool on the 23andMe website also allows you to connect with DNA relatives who\u2019ve also taken the test. I eagerly exchanged messages with four of my distant cousins: the parent of a Chinese adoptee living in the Netherlands, the stepfather of a fifth cousin in the Philippines and a fellow Korean adoptee. Nobody could tell me more about my genealogy.Only a fourth cousin named Henry who lives in California could shed light on a common ancestor who lived in Japan in the 1700s. He wrote in an email: \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt would be an okay assumption that you may have genes to my father\u00e2\u0080\u0099s side, as his family was not in the bushi/samurai class, but comfortable merchants. Also, my patriarchal prefecture was sort of a \u00e2\u0080\u0098doorway\u00e2\u0080\u0099 to Japan.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Henry and I became Facebook friends, but I still have no tangible information about my ancestors.Joy Lieberthal, a clinical social worker who specializes in issues related to adoption, said that for adoptees digging into their past, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s important to look at the big picture. She explained that genetic testing kits really just give adoptees a history lesson in migration and land conflict over time, and that it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s important not to overstate the importance of the results. The bottom line: Just have fun with it. In my health report, some of the inherited traits ranged from the frivolous (my sensitivity to bitter tastes) to T.M.I. (my type of earwax). It did pinpoint some of my physical attributes, like eye and hair color. It confirmed that I was lactose intolerant and predicted my athletic performance, based on my type of muscle fiber, compared to world class athletes. It suggested that, were I a runner, I would be better suited for sprinting than cross-country. It also confirmed that I lacked an enzyme to process and detoxify ethanol, making me sensitive to alcohol. Over all, I was tested for 122 health risks and 53 inherited conditions. It showed I had a slightly higher than average risk for developing rheumatoid arthritis and ulcerative colitis and no inherited conditions. I had an elevated risk for developing restless leg syndrome. Was that why I felt that strange, jumpy sensation in my legs a few months ago? I made a note to mention this to my doctor at my next physical.Through social media, I found other adoptees who had used DNA testing. An adoptee named Bee told me that her DNA test confirmed that she suffered from a rare and incurable genetic disease that affects her kidneys; with the results from her test, she was able to go to her doctor for an official diagnosis. She later learned that she had passed on the disease to her daughter, she told me. Another adoptee named Janine, who was born in Korea and told by her adoptive parents that she was of mixed race, ordered a DNA kit so that she could learn about her biological father\u00e2\u0080\u0099s European lineage.

{"Headline": "Hillary Clinton Brings On Former Senate Aide for New York Primary", "Date": "2016-03-24", "News": "Looking to channel some of her Senate campaign energy for the New York presidential primary on April 19, Hillary Clinton\u2019s team has brought on a former aide from her days as the junior senator as they begin to organize. The former aide, Resi Cooper, a Democratic consultant who was Mrs. Clinton\u2019s main liaison to Long Island, will be the state director for her primary fight against Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, a campaign aide confirmed. The state is almost certainly a lock for Mrs. Clinton. But the margin is a question: Mr. Sanders could fare well in some areas, particularly in New York City. His campaign has also spent many months trying to sign up supporters in the state. To that end, Mrs. Clinton\u2019s campaign has started creating teams of volunteers on college campuses around the state, and her aides are reactivating her old volunteer networks. There is also a potential psychic benefit to Mrs. Clinton: Her Senate campaign in 2000, her first, is something she and her longtime advisers have often talked about as a model for how to run her national races. She could not recreate that in her 2008 presidential campaign, but she has tried to, to a greater extent, in the 2016 race. \n\t\tFirst Draft provides fast-paced and comprehensive coverage of politics and elections by The New York Times.

{"Headline": "Self-Correcting Beyond a Web Era Marked by Sensationalism", "Date": "2016-03-20", "News": "Supported byNews AnalysisBut in many ways, the Gawker that posted the video \u2014 an aggressive and unpredictable news and gossip site \u2014 has already passed into memory. So, too, has an era of the web in which Gawker thrived.In the last few years, digital news sites with ambition \u2014 even the ones, like Gawker, that had originally hailed themselves as being anti-establishment \u2014 have undergone something of a self-correction. Vivid videos of random bedroom romps are out; a little bit of privacy is in.Readers, empowered by social media, have reshaped publications directly, by collective will. And they seem to realize that the photos and videos captured on their smartphones or elsewhere could just as easily be used against them as anyone else, including a celebrity.\u201cNow that \u2018everyone\u2019 has a \u2018sex tape\u2019 \u2014 and everyone is at risk of having their sex tape published online,\u201d the publication of celebrity sex tapes is less justified in the eyes of readers, said Max Read, a former editor of Gawker.The online world in which these sites operate, even compared with 2012 when Gawker posted the video of Mr. Bollea, is no longer the same. Visitors increasingly arrive from social platforms \u2014 mainly Facebook \u2014 and those readers have far more control of how a story is received.Pleasing stories can be shared and cheered on those social platforms. Behavior deemed bad can now be shunned with immediate results.The change was evident as the verdict came down on Friday.But in 2012, the vast majority of Twitter posts that linked to Gawker\u2019s video were lighthearted jokes \u2014 about Mr. Bollea\u2019s physique, about the humiliation of a childhood idol, about fame-seeking.The user @tsayvs, who did not provide a real identity, linked to Gawker\u2019s video the day after it was posted and called Gawker\u2019s description a \u201cmasterpiece.\u201d After the verdict was announced and facing a cascade of messages from the affronted, he posted again: \u201cAm I the only one on Team Gawker here.\u201dIf he was not alone, he sure seemed to have little company.A similar sense of outrage built in 2014, when hackers posted hundreds of photos obtained from celebrities\u2019 private accounts. Publications that had previously trafficked in leaked nude photos \u2014 including Gawker Media properties and sites like BuzzFeed \u2014 shied away from publishing them.Instead, reporters covered the hack as news. Writers published essays examining the hack through the lens of privacy and consent; readers, frequently confronted with privacy worries of their own, were receptive.Today, the decision of whether to publish the most sensitive content often doesn\u2019t fall on publications or editors. It falls to online services that openly host videos and images, and to the social platforms on which videos and images spread.A video like the one that ran on Gawker might now appear on a site like LiveLeak, where people can post and distribute videos. Or it might be posted to a site like Vidme, a newer video host, or directly to Twitter, where it might be removed, only to surface again.File hosts and social networks are governed by individual terms of service.Imgur, an image site where photos from the celebrity iCloud hack were uploaded for a time, has rules that ban \u201cnonconsensual (\u2018revenge\u2019) porn.\u201dTwitter\u2019s rules prohibit \u201cprivate and confidential information,\u201d including \u201cimages or videos that are considered and treated as private under applicable laws\u201d \u2014 a matter of interpretation left first to the company.Facebook, which began hosting news last year, prohibits most nudity. In addition, its guidelines state, \u201cDescriptions of sexual acts that go into vivid detail may also be removed.\u201dHaving rules is one thing; enforcing them is another. Large platforms usually rely on a combination of employee oversight and user reporting to identify content that violates policy. Rules are enforced primarily through after-the-fact removal, not upfront moderation. Imgur, despite a ban, still hosts a large repository of sexual material.For media organizations, that means some of the most difficult decisions are limited to deciding if, and how, to acknowledge information that seems to publish itself.A hack in which content from Sony\u2019s internal network, including email, was posted online forced editors to choose whether to access and use information that was available to anyone with a web browser.Celebrity nude photos, posted by hackers, became a news story and jumping-off point for discussions about privacy and consent. Videos of violence involving police officers, some posted directly to platforms by citizens, forced the subject into view, reverberating around the country. ISIS circumvented news outlets by uploading videos directly to video hosts. Gatekeepers had become bystanders, controlling little beyond their own participation.Just a month earlier, the company\u2019s editorial employees had voted to unionize. And in November, the site announced that it would focus on covering politics.The final legal outcome in the Hulk Hogan case may be years away. Whatever the result, it could end up not as a significant legal precedent, or as a landmark freedom of speech case, but as a curious artifact of a recent but nonetheless bygone era of web journalism.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Year After Detentions, Chinese Feminists Mark Setbacks and Progress", "Date": "2016-03-07", "News": "Supported bySinosphereBut while the women and their lawyers continue to protest the lack of resolution in the public disorder charges against them, Ms. Li welcomed a victory in a cause that feminists have advocated for more than two decades: China\u2019s first law against domestic violence took effect on March 1.Taken together, the two issues reflected a society where there is progress even as feminists struggle to advance women\u2019s rights amid tightening restrictions on public advocacy. They also highlight differences between younger and older feminists who share similar goals but may differ in their approach.On Monday, Ms. Li, 26, also posted a statement sarcastically thanking the Chinese government \u201cfor pushing the feminist movement in China to another peak\u201d by detaining the women, and vowing that the women would persist in their cause, despite being \u201cgreatly restrained.\u201dMs. Li (also known as Li Maizi), Wang Man, Wei Tingting, Wu Rongrong and Zheng Churan were released on bail after a five-week incarceration that their lawyers said included ill treatment, medical neglect and harassment.\u201cFrom then until now, not a single legal body of state has answered our questions,\u201d Ge Wenxiu, a lawyer for Ms. Wei, said in an interview.\u201cThis time we\u2019ve sent our statement to the Supreme People\u2019s Procuratorate because, in the Chinese system, investigating the limits to legal activities is done by the procuratorate,\u201d Mr. Ge said.\u201cLike all the social movements, the Chinese feminist movement has experienced climaxes and bottoms,\u201d Ms. Li wrote. \u201cAlthough it is greatly restrained at present, we believe that the feminism activists in China will promote it with our wisdom and brave heart.\u201dFor Ms. Li, the new law was an achievement. She welcomed it, though her comments were measured, reflecting perhaps greater impatience and ambition among younger Chinese feminists. For example, many openly lobby for gay rights in a way older generations did not.\u201cIt\u2019s definitely good to have this law,\u201d she said in an interview. She was happy that the law covered cohabiting partners, not just married couples. But she had concerns, including the fact that the law does not clarify whether it also protects same-sex partners.\u201cIt\u2019s a big help that the law defines domestic violence for the first time,\u201d said Mr. Qi, a lawyer at Beijing Ming Hang Law Firm.The definition says, \u201cDomestic violence as defined by this law is when people within a family beat, tie up, abuse or limit personal freedoms, or regularly verbally abuse or terrorize, causing physical or mental harm.\u201d It includes violence against women, men, children, the elderly and the disabled.For Zhang Rongli, a law professor at China Women\u2019s University, the law was \u201creally big progress.\u201d\u201cIn traditional and patriarchal countries like China or India, it\u2019s really big progress that people can be punished for this violence,\u201d she said in an interview.There had been significant pushback, Ms. Zhang said. Some warned the new law would cause family disharmony.\u201cSome people are saying it will create problems, for example in the education of children,\u201d she said. Corporal punishment of children is common in China. \u201cSome even say that we\u2019re changing Chinese tradition! This is absurd.\u201d\u201cPeople used to have nowhere to go,\u201d Ms. Zhang added. \u201cNow they have protections.\u201dMs. Zhang said the government was moving fast to spread word of the law with education and training. She was set to travel to Inner Mongolia soon to train court and police personnel in how to put it into effect, she said.Some of the measures the lawyers and Ms. Li said the law should have included are those addressing sexual violence in a marriage such as rape, abusive economic control and the denial of medical treatment, \u201ca big problem,\u201d according to Mr. Qi.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A New View of Appendicitis", "Date": "2016-03-21", "News": "Jane Brody on health and aging.Gwen Deely\u00e2\u0080\u0099s story is an example of how not to deal with a health crisis when traveling abroad. She realizes she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s lucky to be alive.Ms. Deely, a 66-year-old living in Manhattan, was on an overnight flight from New York to Venice in October when she developed what she thought was food poisoning, perhaps from the tuna sandwich she had eaten at home that day. She weathered the night armed with more than a dozen airsickness bags and figured it would pass.But it didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t, and she spent the entire week in Venice in bed staring at the ceiling in the Airbnb apartment she and her partner had rented. She attributed her low-grade fever and chills to the flu shot she had received just before the trip.\u00e2\u0080\u009cI would have had to take a boat to get to a doctor, and I couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t even stand up,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said. Her decision not to go to a hospital that was a water taxi ride away was reinforced by a reluctance to seek medical help where she didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t speak the language. \u00e2\u0080\u009cHad I been in a hotel, I would have asked to see a doctor who spoke English,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said.Ms. Deely somehow managed to fly home as scheduled, trying not to act sick on the plane, and went from the airport to the emergency room, where blood tests and a CT scan revealed a ruptured appendix.Riddled with infection, she spent five days in a hospital on intravenous antibiotics, followed by months of antibiotic treatment and abdominal drainage at home. Finally, in mid-February, she was healthy enough for her ailing appendix to be removed with laparoscopic surgery, involving several tiny incisions in the abdomen.A ruptured appendix is a life-threatening condition. Blindsided by atypical flulike symptoms rather than the stabbing abdominal pain one usually associates with a ruptured appendix, Ms. Deely failed to realize how close she came to dying. She now knows better than to try to \u00e2\u0080\u009ctough it out\u00e2\u0080\u009d when unexplained, debilitating symptoms occur.Such symptoms are a clear warning that requires prompt medical attention. However, a third to a half of people with appendicitis do not have these typical symptoms, making cases like Ms. Deely\u00e2\u0080\u0099s especially challenging.The appendix is a finger-shaped pouch attached to the large intestine (colon), usually on the lower right side of the abdomen. Long considered a vestigial organ with no known function, many people, young and old, have theirs removed in the course of another operation.However, there are now indications that the appendix serves as a repository of healthy bacteria that can replenish the gut after an extreme attack of diarrhea. People who have had appendectomies, for example, are more likely to experience recurrent infections with the bacterium Clostridium difficile, a debilitating intestinal infection that causes severe, difficult-to-treat diarrhea.Acute appendicitis is the nation\u00e2\u0080\u0099s most common surgical emergency. It is most often performed laparoscopically, which is associated with faster recovery, less pain and lower risk of infection than an open operation. Some 300,000 people in the United States undergo an appendectomy each year, but sometimes, the appendix turns out not to have been inflamed, meaning the operation was not necessary.The results of several recent studies suggest that patients with uncomplicated appendicitis should not be rushed into surgery and instead should be offered the option of a trial of antibiotics.Some patients may choose an operation so they won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have to worry about developing another attack of appendicitis, but if they aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t told they have a choice, they can hardly make one.But Dr. Telem pointed out that under the Affordable Care Act, it may soon become necessary for physicians to inform patients of nonsurgical options, which may include \u00e2\u0080\u009cwatch and wait,\u00e2\u0080\u009d as some cases of appendicitis disappear without any treatment, and there may be nothing wrong with the appendix in others.\u00e2\u0080\u009cSurgeons would be well served to take a leadership role in proactively developing decision aids to inform patients about the benefits and risks for both nonoperative antibiotic treatment and surgical treatment of appendicitis,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Dr. Telem said. She added, however, that the information should include the fact that data on the long-term outcome of nonsurgical treatment is currently lacking.Also lacking is a large controlled trial in which patients with uncomplicated appendicitis are randomly assigned to antibiotic or surgical treatment and followed for perhaps five or more years. Such a study could define exactly which patients do best with nonoperative therapy and which require immediate surgery.Related:Your health questions answered by Times journalists and\u00a0experts.Get Well's Running email for practical tips, expert advice, exclusive content and a bit of motivation delivered to your inbox every week to help you on your running journey.

{"Headline": "Christians Flock to Groups That Help Members Pay Medical Bills", "Date": "2016-03-10", "News": "Supported bySAN ANTONIO \u2014 When Chris Doyle learned that his health insurance deductible would climb to $10,000 last year, he and his wife, both evangelical Christians, \u201cspent a couple weeks just praying,\u201d he said.Then they opted out of insurance altogether, joining something called a health care sharing ministry, which requires members to help cover one another\u2019s major medical costs as they come up.While such nonprofit ministries have been around for decades, interest in them has grown since the Affordable Care Act passed in 2010, largely because the law exempts members from the requirement to have health insurance or pay a yearly fine.Because they are not insurance companies, sharing ministries provide no guarantee that members\u2019 medical debts will be paid; members are advised to trust that God will provide. The ministries say the payment system is helping Christians fulfill a biblical mandate to share one another\u2019s burdens.\u201cOur only assets are the good will and continued participation of our members,\u201d said James Lansberry, executive vice president of Samaritan, which is based in Peoria, Ill.Some ministries operate differently, requiring members to pay monthly into accounts from which funds are disbursed to those with eligible medical bills. Pre-existing medical conditions are often not covered, nor are preventive care, mental health and injuries resulting from behavior the ministry considers immoral or reckless. Members who acquire a sexually transmitted disease from an extramarital affair are out of luck, for instance, as are those injured while driving drunk or during a melee.The growth seems to have come largely through word of mouth, at churches, schools and workplaces. Mr. Doyle, a machinist, heard about Samaritan Ministries at Grace Point Church in San Antonio, whose pastors and employees are members and whose congregants post about it on Facebook.He and Sarah, who stays home with their two toddlers, mail a flat $405 payment to a fellow member every month, the standard rate for families of three or more. Had they stuck with the insurance he was offered through work, the Doyles said, their share of the premium would have been about $600 a month, and they would have had to pay the first $5,000 in individual medical costs, $10,000 for the family, other than preventive care.Under the ministry, they also have to pay the first $300 of any medical expense they incur. They have not yet had a doctor\u2019s bill exceed that amount, though they are waiting somewhat nervously for that day to come. Samaritan limits spending on each injury or illness to $250,000, with exceptions for people who agree to pay extra each year toward others\u2019 bills above that amount.\u201cThere\u2019s a little bit of fear going into it,\u201d said Mrs. Doyle, 33, adding that she suspected she had a hernia that would need to be repaired soon. \u201cWhat if people don\u2019t pay their share and what if the money doesn\u2019t come in? But that\u2019s where the faith-based part comes in \u2014 I\u2019m really going to rely on God.\u201dMr. Lansberry said Samaritan members\u2019 eligible medical bills averaged, cumulatively, over $16 million a month. Its membership has grown by about 50,000 over the last year, to nearly 200,000 people in 58,000 paying households.Acknowledging that many families can qualify for subsidized insurance policies with free preventive care through the Affordable Care Act, Mr. Lansberry said that most new members were not \u201cjoining primarily on price; they are joining primarily on principle.\u201dBefore members can be reimbursed, they sometimes must pay upfront for their medical care \u2014 potentially a sizable outlay, because hospitals increasingly require at least partial prepayment. It then takes at least two months for Samaritan to process their requests for help and for checks from other members to arrive in the mail.The most harrowing part of health care sharing so far for Kyle Burkholder, the teaching pastor at Grace Point, and his wife, Stefani, was paying $6,500 upfront for their daughter\u2019s ear tube surgery, they said. They waited for what seemed like forever for other members\u2019 checks to come.\u201cAbout 90 days after her surgery, sure enough, the money did start showing up,\u201d Mrs. Burkholder said. \u201cAnd it was with handwritten notes \u2014 every day it was one, two, three notes, and she was reading them aloud, and I found myself just crying.\u201dMembers with \u201cspecial prayer needs\u201d \u2014 conditions that are not eligible under the ministry\u2019s rules \u2014 can also ask for financial help. Last month, for example, Samaritan\u2019s newsletter highlighted the case of a woman with uterine cancer diagnosed before she became a member, and a teenager who tore a knee ligament in a dirt bike race.Upon joining, members waive their right to sue, and in the case of Samaritan, appeals panels of randomly selected members are supposed to settle disputes. Mr. Lansberry said that such panels had been convened only four times since Samaritan\u2019s founding in 1994, and that the group had never been the subject of complaints to state attorneys general or insurance commissioners.The insurance commissioner in Washington State did try to stop Samaritan from operating in 2011, saying it was selling \u201cunauthorized insurance,\u201d but the state Legislature passed a law explicitly exempting health care sharing ministries from regulations.Insurance commissioners in Kentucky and Oklahoma had tried to block Medi-Share, the Florida-based ministry, but were thwarted when their legislatures also passed protection laws.In 2001, Ohio\u2019s attorney general sued one ministry \u2014 known then as the Christian Brotherhood Newsletter, and now as Christian Healthcare Ministries \u2014 ultimately forcing its leaders to repay $15 million they had spent on homes, vehicles and excessive salaries out of the fund where members had sent payments.Members have filed a handful of lawsuits against Medi-Share after bills they had expected to be covered were not. The cases were settled out of court. While the health law requires the ministries to submit to annual independent audits, critics question whether that safeguard is sufficient.\u201cOur message has consistently been that this is not a health insurance product that we regulate, so buyer beware,\u201d said Nick Gerhart, the insurance commissioner in Iowa. \u201cA premature baby could cost $1 million pretty easily, so it wouldn\u2019t take very many of those to put a significant strain on any group, let alone an unregulated group like this.\u201dLee and Amy Jebson of Chesapeake, Va., were not expecting any major medical costs when they signed up for Medi-Share in 2014 after being priced out of the plans available through HealthCare.gov, the federally run insurance marketplace. Then their 8-year-old son was found to have acute lymphoblastic leukemia, leading to several hundred thousand dollars\u2019 worth of medical bills in just the first few months of his treatment.\u201cOne single fever is a $10,000-a-night hospital cost,\u201d said Mrs. Jebson, adding that her family pays a $500 monthly share toward other members\u2019 medical costs, and $2,500 a year toward their own. But so far, she added, their bills are being covered, with the exception of a few thousand dollars.They, like others interviewed, said joining the ministries allowed them to live by their religious beliefs rather than follow a government mandate to buy insurance that may cover things they do not want to pay for, like abortion (though half the states do not allow plans sold through the Affordable Care Act marketplaces, at least, to pay for abortions) or birth control.\u201cIt\u2019s really a model of wanting to take care of someone else \u2014 not being told, \u2018You have to,\u2019 or \u2018I\u2019m forcing you to do this,\u2019\u00a0\u201d Mr. Jebson said.The Doyles said that their impression might change if they incurred big medical bills, but that for now they appreciated the personal nature of their monthly transactions.\u201cThere\u2019s something different about writing my check to someone who needs it,\u201d Mrs. Doyle said. \u201cI feel like I\u2019m loving on somebody instead of just paying my premiums.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Gallup Finds Concerns Rising Over Global Warming and Nuclear Energy Solution", "Date": "2016-03-19", "News": "I\u2019d love to think so, but I wouldn\u2019t count on it.\u00c2\u00a0Read on for my reasoning.To me, the\u00c2\u00a0more subtle background trend is the significant one to watch because it\u2019s like the long-term warming of the climate itself.Two-thirds of Americans support the United States joining a binding international agreement to curb growth of greenhouse gas emissions\u00e2\u0080\u00a6.But surveys consistently rank the environment in general, and global warming more specifically, at the bottom of lists of public concerns when people are simply asked to say what worries them. For the first time since Gallup first asked the question in 1994, a majority of Americans say they oppose nuclear energy. The 54 percent opposing it is up significantly from 43 percent a year ago, while the 44 percent who favor using nuclear energy is down from 51 percent.I\u2019m not sure I buy into the pollsters\u2019 hypothesis for why this is happening even though the big rise in opposition happened five years since the Fukushima nuclear calamity: \nIn 2011, Gallup conducted its annual Environment poll a few days before the Fukushima nuclear plant disaster in Japan, and at that time, 57 percent of Americans were in favor of nuclear energy. The next time the question was asked in 2012, a similar majority still favored the use of nuclear energy.And although there have not been any major nuclear incidents since Fukushima in 2011, a majority of U.S. adults now oppose nuclear energy. This suggests that energy prices and the perceived abundance of energy sources are the most relevant factors in attitudes toward nuclear power, rather than safety concerns prompted by nuclear incidents.Lower gasoline prices over the past year are likely driving greater opposition toward the use of nuclear power. As Americans have paid less at the pump, their level of worry about the nation\u2019s energy situation has dropped to 15-year-low levels. This appears to have resulted in more Americans prioritizing environmental protection and fewer backing nuclear power as an alternative energy source.Could it also be that those most concerned about climate change have become convinced that rapid deployment of renewable energy technologies can rapidly decarbonize energy supplies without splitting atoms?

{"Headline": "The Plot to Take Down a Fox News Analyst", "Date": "2016-03-01", "News": "FeatureFor years, Wayne Simmons claimed to be a former C.I.A. operative. Then one ex-spook got suspicious.Supported byClizbe grew up poor in Halifax County, North Carolina, raised by a single mother. In 1980, after failing out of East Carolina University, he joined the Air Force. Aptitude tests revealed a gift for languages, so Clizbe enrolled in intensive Vietnamese courses and then was shipped to the Philippines, where he spent three years monitoring Vietnamese radio communications. When his tour ended, he went back to school at Southern Illinois University. On campus, he fell in love with a Malaysian girl, who told him that if he wanted to marry her, he would have to convert to Islam. He converted, married her and followed her back to Southeast Asia, where he found work at a refugee camp in the Philippines. Clizbe made frequent trips to her hometown outside Kuala Lumpur, where he immersed himself in the local customs.He and his wife lived in Asia for a year before finding jobs at the business college at King Saud University in Qassim Province in Saudi Arabia. He taught English as a second language and made the pilgrimage to Mecca. It was 1988, and the war in Afghanistan was dragging on. At the mosque on Fridays, Clizbe would hear calls for young men to travel east and wage jihad against the communists.After returning to the United States in 1990, Clizbe earned a master\u2019s degree in linguistics and studied business and instructional design. While he searched for a job, he sometimes paid the bills by working the phones at a venereal-disease hotline. He was eventually hired by the C.I.A. as an operations officer.He was sent to an island overseas, where he worked a day job unrelated to his real responsibilities. At night he recruited spies. His experiences in the Philippines, Malaysia and Saudi Arabia all came in handy. \u2018\u2018You have to understand your target and immerse yourself in his or her culture and the context from which they come,\u2019\u2019 he said. \u2018\u2018Do they have access to something of interest to you? Are they suitable to do what you want them to do? What are their motivations? What problems do they have that I can solve? Solve their problems, and they\u2019ll become your best friend forever.\u2019\u2019 (This fixation on immersion was a big reason Clizbe practiced Islam in the Muslim world; he stopped going to mosques, for the most part, after leaving.) He told me that during his first overseas tour, he probably recruited as many spies as anybody else in his region. \u2018\u2018I was really, really good at what I did,\u2019\u2019 he said. \u2018\u2018Never pitched somebody who said no. This process of elicitation is really like the slow hitching up of a woman\u2019s skirt.\u2019\u2019In the fall of 2010, Clizbe was summoned from his Northern Virginia home to a restaurant at Baltimore-Washington International Airport for lunch with a Department of Defense contractor named Kerry Patton. The two had grown friendly on an email list affiliated with the International Association for Intelligence Education. The lunch was Patton\u2019s idea; he wanted Clizbe to meet a mentor of his, Wayne Simmons. Simmons had served in the C.I.A. for 27 years and appeared regularly as an analyst on Fox News. He was \u2018\u2018all Kerry could talk about,\u2019\u2019 Clizbe recalls.Though Simmons had become well known to people in that right-wing media circle, Clizbe didn\u2019t know his name. He never encountered Simmons during his days with the C.I.A. \u2014 it\u2019s a massive, compartmentalized organization, after all \u2014 and he didn\u2019t have cable TV. Still, Simmons and Clizbe should have had plenty to discuss. Their political leanings were similar enough. Simmons claimed to be \u2018\u2018far right of Attila the Hun.\u2019\u2019 But something about Simmons didn\u2019t sit right with Clizbe.Over lunch, it seemed to Clizbe that Simmons was oblivious to the routine \u2018\u2018butt-sniffing\u2019\u2019 that C.I.A. veterans routinely engage in: questions about time spent at the \u2018\u2018Farm\u2019\u2019 and about stints in war zones. Simmons said he had operated separately from Langley; he hinted at brazen operations against drug cartels, opining on the painful isolation of an operative\u2019s existence. \u2018\u2018\u2009\u2018You and me, we know what it\u2019s like,\u2019\u2009\u2019\u2019 Clizbe recalls him saying. \u2018\u2018\u2009\u2018It\u2019s how we have to live our lives.\u2019\u2009\u2019\u2019Clizbe added: \u2018\u2018He was so full of bluster that anybody who hadn\u2019t been in the C.I.A. would have had their socks knocked off. But the things he said were so not C.I.A.\u2019\u2019Five years later, in October of last year, Simmons \u2014 who, as a frequent guest on Fox News discussing intelligence matters, had become a prominent commentator on national security \u2014 was arrested for fraud, on charges that (among other things) he used a fictitious background in the C.I.A. to gain real government contract work. Today, the garrulous 62-year-old is under house arrest pending trial. He claims that he was done in by a vindictive Obama administration, which is taking advantage of the fact that his agency past, while real, is almost unfathomably classified. \u2018\u2018Nobody could see us,\u2019\u2019 he said. \u2018\u2018Nobody knew who we were. The program I was in was so black it made the black hole seem white.\u2019\u2019Fox News may have been surprised by the allegations, as were many close to Simmons, but doubts about his background had percolated for years within Clizbe\u2019s social network of ex-spooks, and they began in earnest at that fateful lunch in 2010. As Clizbe drove home, his thoughts drifted to a passage from George MacDonald Fraser\u2019s 1969 novel \u2018\u2018Flashman,\u2019\u2019 about a wealthy misfit who, because of a series of misunderstandings, earns a reputation as a war hero. It opens on the fraudulent narrator considering a portrait of himself: \u2018\u2018I can look at the picture above my desk, of the young officer .\u2009.\u2009. tall, masterful and roughly handsome .\u2009.\u2009. and say that it is the portrait of a scoundrel, a liar, a cheat, a thief, a coward \u2014 and, oh yes, a toady.\u2019\u2019Soon after that, Fox bookers started calling, inviting him to appear on more shows: Rita Cosby, Neil Cavuto, Bill O\u2019Reilly, Hannity and Colmes. Not only was Simmons a good talker, he was also courteous, dependable and willing to make the trek from his home in Annapolis, Md., to the bureau in Washington whenever he was needed. And he was a guest, not a contributor, so he worked free.By the time of the invasion of Iraq in 2003, Simmons was a regular on the network, talking primarily about terrorism. His tidy gray mustache and smoky-lensed glasses lent him an air of mystery. Everything else about his appearance \u2014 the fullback\u2019s neck, razor-sharp jawline and power suits \u2014 amplified his message of American supremacy through force. His opinions were cartoonishly belligerent. He defended the enhanced-interrogation techniques employed by the Bush-era C.I.A. In 2005, after Al Jazeera broadcast footage of Ayman al-Zawahri calling for jihad on the West, Simmons suggested one way to contain the terrorist\u2019s message was to \u2018\u2018locate Al Jazeera and blow them off the map.\u2019\u2019 He urged lawmakers to consider a moratorium on the construction of mosques in the United States. After The Times exposed the Bush administration\u2019s covert terrorist-finance-tracking program in 2006, he suggested the paper\u2019s sources ought to be imprisoned and maybe even face a firing squad.In 2005, Simmons was invited to join a Defense Department effort called the Retired Military Analysts program. Started in 2002 during the Bush administration\u2019s push for a U.S. invasion of Iraq, the program recruited retired military officers who had high-profile jobs as cable-news experts to be Defense Department \u2018\u2018message force multipliers.\u2019\u2019 They were given regular briefings from Donald Rumsfeld, then the secretary of defense, as well as access to other high-ranking department officials. There were trips to Iraq and Guant\u00e1namo Bay. It was all done in an effort to win favorable but independent-seeming news coverage for the administration\u2019s foreign policy.Cable-news bookers typically do not run extensive background checks. Standards vary from show to show, but according to producers and bookers I spoke with, a cursory look at an expert\u2019s website is usually sufficient. (In a statement, Fox News said its vetting procedure is as thorough as possible.) But it\u2019s somewhat more surprising that the Retired Military Analysts program did not include a thorough check, either. While many participants in the program did have top-secret clearances, program events were \u2018\u2018no clearance necessary\u2019\u2019: Any time Simmons wanted to visit the Pentagon or hop on a jet to Iraq, he simply submitted his date of birth, Social Security number and a photo ID for a check that verified only that he was an American citizen and wasn\u2019t on any watch lists.One of Clizbe\u2019s specialties in the C.I.A. and in his post-agency career as an intelligence consultant was \u2018\u2018deception detection.\u2019\u2019 He had even codified his method, which he calls the \u2018\u2018holistic contextual credibility assessment system.\u2019\u2019 Clizbe doesn\u2019t believe in polygraph machines and other standard lie-detection techniques. They function, he says, from the flawed assumption that people from all cultures have the same physical and psychological reactions when they lie. After all, famous American traitors like Aldrich Ames passed polygraphs while spying for the enemy. True deception detection requires a far deeper cultural immersion. \u2018\u2018I am what Wayne was pretending to be,\u2019\u2019 he says. \u2018\u2018He was stepping into my context. I\u2019ve lived it, thought about it, pondered it academically and philosophically. Wayne never saw me coming.\u2019\u2019Still, there\u2019s no number to call at the C.I.A. about that sort of business \u2014 no desk dedicated to fact-checking wild claims nor, for obvious reasons, any public access to the agency\u2019s roster. The C.I.A. also has a policy against confirming or denying questions about employment. (The agency declined to comment on the Simmons prosecution, except to say that it is working closely with the Justice Department on the case.) There was also the simple difficulty of proving a negative. Clizbe had been an executive recruiter for clients in Silicon Valley for two years after he quit the C.I.A. in 1999, which taught him to approach such epistemological quandaries the other way around. \u2018\u2018I never vetted a candidate by starting with the hypothesis that they weren\u2019t qualified for a job,\u2019\u2019 he says. \u2018\u2018I tried to prove that they were qualified. If the evidence proves that they aren\u2019t, then I\u2019ve falsified the hypothesis.\u2019\u2019He set out to see if he could prove that Simmons was a former C.I.A. employee. Running into old C.I.A. colleagues at the Raleigh Spy Conference or at meetings of the Association of Former Intelligence Officers or the C.I.A. Retirees Association, Clizbe folded his inquiries into conversations with dozens of former spooks. Who is this guy? Seen him around? Ever work with him? Know anybody who has? He was especially interested in those who had worked at the Crime and Narcotics Center (C.N.C.), which was the division of the C.I.A. that he figured Simmons claimed to be a part of. But none of the former agents, even from the C.N.C., remembered working with him or even hearing about him.By the spring of 2011, Clizbe was convinced that there was no way to confirm Simmons\u2019s claims, so he reached out to his former boss, M., an irascible older man who had been a high-ranking Senior Intelligence Service officer. (He insisted on being identified only by his middle initial.) M. spent about 40 years with the C.I.A., both on the staff and as a contract worker, ascending to its highest ranks. He knew of Simmons \u2014 he consumed Fox News regularly \u2014 and had figured Simmons might have been an obscure contractor at the agency. Clizbe pointed out the irregularities in Simmons\u2019s biography, and M. became convinced he was a fraud.M. alerted Paul Vallely, the retired two-star general who founded Stand Up America, an organization that promotes a conservative foreign-policy agenda through analysis on cable-news networks and talk radio. Vallely met Simmons through Fox News and invited him to serve on the Citizens\u2019 Commission on Benghazi, a collection of military brass, C.I.A. officers and politicians determined to uncover the truth about the September 2012 embassy attack in Libya. M. remained suspicious when Vallely failed to respond after a month. (Vallely declined to comment for this article, citing Simmons\u2019s coming trial.)M. also contacted Gary Berntsen, a decorated former C.I.A. counterterrorism officer and onetime Republican Senate candidate from New York. Berntsen made occasional appearances on Fox News and wasn\u2019t surprised by M.\u2019s message. \u2018\u2018When I started doing television, senior agency guys were calling me on the phone and telling me: \u2018That guy\u2019s on television, he goes on the network you are on, he\u2019s a fraud. Please tell them,\u2019\u2009\u2019\u2019 Berntsen says. While waiting in the greenroom one day before going on Judge Jeanine\u2019s show, Berntsen was approached by Col. David Hunt, a retired officer who had done special-operations work.\u2018\u2018\u2009\u2018Can I ask you something?\u2019\u2009\u2019\u2019 Berntsen recalls Hunt saying. \u2018\u2018\u2009\u2018This guy Wayne Simmons, is he a fraud?\u2019\u2018\u2018Of course he\u2019s a fraud,\u2019\u2019 Berntsen said he replied. \u2018\u2018He\u2019s a blithering idiot.\u2019\u2019According to Berntsen, Hunt said that he too had been suspicious of Simmons and intended to inform Bill Shine, a senior programming executive at the network. He suspected Fox would heed Hunt\u2019s warning. (Hunt did not respond to requests for comment.) But then, one morning, Berntsen was at the network\u2019s studios to make an appearance on a radio show, and he bumped into Simmons. He asked Simmons what division of the C.I.A. he had served in. \u2018\u2018If you\u2019re an agency officer, you know exactly what to say,\u2019\u2019 Berntsen told me. But Simmons\u2019s response was, he said, \u2018\u2018bloody [expletive] gibberish.\u2019\u2019This assessment could be correct. Publicly available information on Simmons\u2019s life after 1973, when he left the Navy, reveals a certain sort of aimlessness that doesn\u2019t jibe with a career in the C.I.A. He worked as a headwaiter at Pisces, a nightclub in Georgetown, and as a manager for Making Waves, an adult-entertainment hot-tub complex in College Park, Md. He played semipro football for the Baltimore Eagles and, in 1978, was invited to try out with the New Orleans Saints. He played defensive back for them before being cut early in the season. In July 1980 he got into an argument with three men in a nightclub parking lot and shot at them with his 9 millimeter Walther \u2014 the sort of handgun James Bond carries. He pleaded guilty to assault and transporting a firearm and received probation.In 1983, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms and the F.B.I. received a tip that Simmons was looking to purchase large quantities of Uzis, grenades and surface-to-air missiles. Undercover agents began meeting with Simmons late at night, in an effort to draw him out. Simultaneously, the Prince George\u2019s County Police Department vice squad learned of a bookmaking operation that Simmons ran out of the small house he shared with his wife and two young children. The police monitored his phone activity and, after gathering enough evidence for an arrest warrant, staged a raid. In addition to gambling paraphernalia, the authorities recovered an old handgun stashed in the garage and a rifle in Simmons\u2019s bedroom. They also confiscated a safe. Simmons was charged with possession of firearms by a felon.When Simmons took the stand, an incredible story emerged. The prosecution revealed that Simmons was involved with a man named Tom Tindall, a pilot who had been caught by the United States Customs Service flying drugs into the country for the Patriarca crime family. Because Tindall decided to testify against the Boston-based organized-crime group, he had a contract on his head. Simmons claimed that the Patriarcas wanted him dead, too, simply because of his affiliation with Tindall. That, he said, was the reason for the rifle in his bedroom. As for the artillery he was looking to buy, Simmons claimed that was Tindall\u2019s idea. The two were working undercover with Customs, buying weapons so they could infiltrate \u2018\u2018anti-American forces\u2019\u2019 in South Florida and Central America. Simmons was found guilty, but his sentence was suspended and he was placed on five-year probation.In a post-trial motion to modify the conditions of Simmons\u2019s release, the prosecutor mentioned the safe seized from Simmons\u2019s bedroom. When law-enforcement officers opened the safe, they found a ledger that contained documentary \u2018\u2018evidence of large-scale narcotics activity.\u2019\u2019 Simmons, however, never faced any drug charges. The safe was barely mentioned during his trial. Simmons claims today that the lenient sentence is proof that he was working for the C.I.A. He also claims he perjured himself to cover up for his C.I.A. work. To Clizbe, though, the outcome of the trial supports his theory: Simmons was an informant. Drug charges were never pursued, perhaps, in exchange for some sort of cooperation. (Simmons denies being an informant and dismissed the notion as \u2018\u2018amateur speculation.\u2019\u2019)Clizbe\u2019s theory seems plausible, but it was still missing some vital details. The typical informant doesn\u2019t try his hand, let alone succeed, at conning his way into Pentagon public-relations programs. Clizbe eventually found what he thought was the missing piece: The 2012 obituary for Simmons\u2019s wife, Corinne, a longtime military-hospital administrator, laid out the Simmons family tree, and further digging revealed that it was a remarkable lineage. Simmons\u2019s father, Wayne Sr., joined the Navy on the day he turned 17 and was stationed at Pearl Harbor when the Japanese attacked. He served in the Pacific during the war and belonged to the Baltimore Masonic Lodge. His mother had been an F.B.I. fingerprint analyst. Simmons\u2019s sister, Patricia Bradshaw, had been the deputy under secretary of defense for civilian personnel policy. Before that, she held a number of high-ranking positions in the Defense Department and the Department of the Navy. She was married to a former admiral. (Bradshaw didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment.)Clizbe finally saw it: the black sheep of a distinguished family, disgraced with an arrest that put him in the hands of special agents. Clizbe imagined Simmons reading spy novels and watching movies, researching the history of the C.I.A., internalizing tradecraft. And then one day, he got a lucky break, finding his way onto Fox and into the Retired Military Analysts program. All of a sudden, he was eating lunch with Donald Rumsfeld at the Pentagon and making day trips to Guant\u00e1namo. He was living the life of the decorated patriot he was born to be.In late 2013, Clizbe and M. developed a plan to extract a confession from Simmons. Their method would be a good-cop/bad-cop interrogation, carried out where Simmons would least suspect it: on Facebook. M. left needling comments on Simmons\u2019s page, questioning the validity of his claims. In a series of private messages beginning Dec. 1, M. called him a liar. Simmons shot back, accusing M. of being an Obama apologist. M. responded, \u2018\u2018I agree with you politically (not an Obamatron), but .\u2009.\u2009. am convinced that your claim to be a former \u2018operative\u2019 is phony.\u2019\u2019Simmons noticed that Clizbe and M. were Facebook friends and suspected a connection, so he wrote to Clizbe in an effort to ward off further attacks: \u2018\u2018My creds are impeccable. .\u2009.\u2009. Every Federal Agency in the US gov has been up my ass for 12 years.\u2019\u2019 Clizbe responded with a message that seemed friendly yet was still intended to push Simmons closer to an admission: \u2018\u2018[M.] is about as wired into the C.I.A. as anyone living. If he\u2019s criticizing something .\u2009.\u2009. it might be worth listening to. You\u2019re welcome to reach out to him. He is not shy.\u2019\u2019 So Simmons turned back to M., again leaning on his work with the Pentagon: \u2018\u2018BTW .\u2009.\u2009. I was sent by the SECDEF, Rumsfeld, to GITMO 3 times. My clearances were good on each trip.\u2019\u2019 M. had seen a flight manifest from one of those trips, showing Simmons listed as a former C.I.A. worker. M. knew that didn\u2019t prove anything; Simmons most likely provided that description himself.The next morning, Simmons provided M. with a litany of his operations. He helped bring down the Patriarcas in Boston; he helped uncover an Iranian-American drug-smuggling ring; he orchestrated the recovery of a device stolen from a Scandinavian laboratory. He\u2019d been all over the globe: Central America, South America, Geneva, Bimini, Islamorada, Hong Kong, Macau and Kazakhstan. M. reviewed the message, line by line. He may not have been aware of every operation the C.I.A. ran, but he knew what sort of work they did. And like Clizbe, he noticed the strange jurisdictional confusion in Simmons\u2019s r\u00e9sum\u00e9 as well as the suspicious diversity of tasks and locations. Despite its swashbuckling reputation, the C.I.A. is a highly bureaucratic organization, rife with procedures, regulations and paperwork. People like M. rise through the ranks because of their ability to work that bureaucracy to their advantage. The operations Simmons claimed to have carried out, if they were real, would have been well known around the higher levels of the directorate, and M. had never heard of any of them. Moreover, if Simmons had done half the things he claimed, the agency never would have agreed to lift his cover. They most likely would have sued him for writing \u2018\u2018The Natanz Directive\u2019\u2019 or for appearing on Fox News at all.On the afternoon of Dec. 2, M. sent a note to a group of former senior C.I.A. officers whose careers would have made them familiar with the operations Simmons claimed to have worked. Nobody knew him or his supposed exploits. M. composed a stern warning to Simmons: \u2018\u2018If you continue to promote yourself as a former agency \u2018operative,\u2019 we will have to expose you publicly as a poser and a fraud.\u2019\u2019 But he also offered him a way out: either to provide his full name and date of birth so that a friend of M.\u2019s with access to the C.I.A.\u2019s records could run his name, or to provide the name of a living C.I.A. officer who could vouch for him.And then, just like that, Simmons folded. He wouldn\u2019t admit to having fabricated the operations on his r\u00e9sum\u00e9, but he was willing to entertain the idea that his bosses had been pretending to be C.I.A. \u2014 that he had been duped his entire career by some other outfit. \u2018\u2018I will cede to your wishes,\u2019\u2019 he wrote. \u2018\u2018You have my word that I will never personally hold myself out as C.I.A. again.\u2019\u2019Almost immediately, Clizbe pitched the story of this vetting operation to The Washington Times. The paper sent Simmons an email. Simmons replied, denying the accusations and claiming that he had run an \u2018\u2018intel op\u2019\u2019 to expose the link that he suspected between Clizbe and M. (This was apparently a reference to their interactions on Facebook.) It was a bold move, but Simmons was a well-known media figure. Nobody knew who Clizbe and M. were. The Washington Times rejected Clizbe\u2019s story.Clizbe had sent a draft to Simmons for comment, and as he tried to find another home for his article, Simmons offered a new and curious response. He categorically denied the accusations, which didn\u2019t surprise Clizbe. But then he changed his story completely, claiming that for 27 years, he was a sort of officer known as a NOC (Nonofficial Cover). This is the deepest cover the C.I.A. provides. Rather than working out of an embassy, NOCs often maintain a plausible career \u2014 as energy consultants, for example \u2014 and if they are caught, the C.I.A. may deny their affiliation.M. thought this explanation was absurd. If Simmons had been a NOC for almost three decades, one of M.\u2019s colleagues would have remembered his name. He began to alert Simmons\u2019s media colleagues about his and Clizbe\u2019s suspicion. One of them, a high-ranking military officer who worked as a paid contributor to Fox News, wrote: \u2018\u2018I\u2019ve had reservations for years. In my experience, some of the \u2018programs\u2019 he claims to have been a part of simply never existed. While he may have somehow been on the periphery of something, I\u2019ve seen and heard nothing to convince me he was a NOC.\u2019\u2019 M. also notified Shine, the Fox senior programming executive; the Fox legal chief Dianne Brandi; and Neil Cavuto. Nobody wrote back to him. (These emails were obtained by The Times. Fox says Shine, Brandi and Cavuto have no record of receiving the emails.)After trying and failing to pitch his story elsewhere, Clizbe eventually gave up. He contacted a former senior official at the agency, who took Clizbe\u2019s report to an assistant deputy director, close to the top of the chain. He had no idea if he would ever hear back.In papers submitted by the prosecution, Simmons is said to have repeatedly tried to use his reputation as a C.I.A. veteran to find lucrative contracting work. In 2008, he managed to pass an interim security clearance and gain entry into the U.S. Army\u2019s Human Terrain System program, which brought anthropologists into Afghanistan and Iraq to learn about local culture. Interim clearances are minimally invasive and granted on a temporary basis, pending the completion of a more intense background investigation. According to Simmons, he self-reported his criminal infractions, explaining them away as the collateral damage of a long, complicated career with the C.I.A. He went to training at Fort Leavenworth but was asked to resign before completing the program. Simmons says he resigned over a pay cut. The Army, however, cited unspecified performance problems.A manager of the Human Terrain System program told me that Simmons had found his way into the program through BAE Systems, a subcontractor that was struggling to meet personnel quotas. \u2018\u2018Wayne was like a lot of folks taking advantage of the poor screening by the BAE recruiters to draw good pay during training and then cop out,\u2019\u2019 the manager told me. \u2018\u2018We had a lot of this.\u2019\u2019 He described Simmons as \u2018\u2018a mile wide\u2019\u2019 and \u2018\u2018an inch deep.\u2019\u2019In 2009, the prosecution argues, Simmons made false statements on security-clearance forms in an effort to secure employment with the defense contractor Triple Canopy. This application led to a full background check by the State Department, which concluded that Simmons never worked for the C.I.A. in any capacity whatsoever. His top-secret clearance was denied. In 2010, he supposedly used another interim clearance to be hired as a senior intelligence adviser on NATO\u2019s anti-insurgency team in Kabul. After a time, his clearance was revoked, and he was sent back to the United States.Simmons generally failed in his attempts to fleece the government, but he succeeded elsewhere. According to the prosecution, Simmons defrauded his former girlfriend, referred to in documents as E.\u2009L. (Simmons denies any romantic involvement.) She gave him $125,000 to invest in a real estate venture, and Simmons pocketed the money. (Simmons denies this, too.) Simmons\u2019s trial is set to begin in May and, if he is found guilty, he could face decades in federal prison.The F.B.I. claims that the timing of Clizbe\u2019s investigation and their own is coincidental, but Clizbe is skeptical. During the course of his inquiry, he talked to dozens of people, and any one of them could have sounded the alarm. Additionally, Clizbe said, he submitted his article to the C.I.A.\u2019s Publications Review Board, which would have sent it to offices all around the agency and, potentially, to other federal agencies as well.After trying to publish his story about Simmons, Clizbe says, he was blacklisted by the conservative media. (When I asked Simmons about this claim, he grinned, shrugged and said, \u2018\u2018I have powerful friends.\u2019\u2019) I asked Clizbe if exposing Simmons was worth the trouble it had brought him. He insisted that it was. \u2018\u2018We cannot allow scum bags to take away honor and truth and change the meanings of those things,\u2019\u2019 he said. \u2018\u2018It\u2019s the fundamental basis of our society and culture.\u2019\u2019In the government\u2019s extensive rap sheet on Simmons, the picture that emerges is not of a cynical fraudster but of a man living in a fiction of his own creation. The U.S. attorney\u2019s office shared with me a particularly troubling police report from January 2007. Two police officers in Annapolis, Md., were called to Church Circle, right in the center of town, to break up a street fight. They arrived to find Syed Mohammed Azizur-Rehman, a 53-year-old taxi driver, lying face down on the street; nearby, they found Simmons screaming, \u2018\u2018He has a bomb!\u2019\u2019 Simmons claimed that during a ride in Azizur-Rehman\u2019s cab, the driver started ranting about his hatred of America and announced that he had a bomb in the trunk. After grabbing his cellphone, which Simmons believed to be the detonator, he forced Azizur-Rehman to stop the car and subdued him. He was a former C.I.A. officer, he told the Annapolis Police, and he advised them to call the White House or Fox News to vouch for him.A crowd assembled. Bomb dogs were called in. The driver, meanwhile, explained his side of the story. He picked up Simmons at a downtown steakhouse. Simmons hopped in, handed him a $20 bill and told him to just drive; he wouldn\u2019t say where he wanted to go. Once they reached Church Circle, with seemingly no explanation, Simmons grabbed the driver\u2019s cellphone and ordered him to stop the car. Simmons pulled Azizur-Rehman out of the car and started kicking him.Needless to say, a bomb-sniffing dog failed to find any explosive devices in the car. At the local precinct, the police called the C.I.A. and spoke to a supervisor, who advised them to \u2018\u2018take appropriate action\u2019\u2019 \u2014 whatever that meant. They called Corinne Simmons, and she told them Wayne was depressed and was supposed to be at a support group for retired government employees the previous day, but it had been canceled. Simmons was taken to the hospital for observation. No charges were ever filed. (Simmons now blames drinking and PTSD for the episode.)Simmons answered the door in gray wool slacks, a pressed navy blue shirt and blue boat shoes. At 62, he remains physically imposing and still moves with an athlete\u2019s grace, something he has retained, he said, through regular krav maga, the Israeli self-defense system. The rooms in his ornately decorated home are painted pink, burgundy and teal. He hadn\u2019t changed a thing since Corinne died in 2012, he said. He had a Rottweiler named Brutus and two irresistible Maltipoos. His shelves were covered in patriotic bric-a-brac: presidential biographies, flags and awards earned by his son, a civil servant. (His daughter, who is active in local politics, does his shopping.) On a ledge sat a signed note from Rumsfeld, thanking Simmons for some cigars, and next to it, an autographed photo of Ronald Reagan and a glossy of a gleeful handshake Simmons shared with President George W. Bush in 2006.We sat down at the kitchen table, and he produced a black binder, stuffed with documents. He began to unspool his current version of events: He dropped out of Jacksonville State to join the Navy. His service lasted less than two months before he was given a medical discharge for post-concussion syndrome. The diagnosis was phony, however: a ruse to separate from the Navy and join the C.I.A. But he wasn\u2019t recruited to be an officer, he said. He didn\u2019t go to \u2018\u2018the Farm,\u2019\u2019 the C.I.A.\u2019s famous training facility near Williamsburg, Va. Instead, he shipped off to Alaska and got a job with Mukluk Freight Lines \u2014 perfect cover. He would work four weeks and then take off to Fort Wainwright to learn tradecraft. He flipped to a printout of the Wikipedia entry on MK Ultra, the notorious C.I.A. mind-control program, and told me he was subjected to similar sorts of experiments there.The reason Clizbe and M. found his r\u00e9sum\u00e9 bizarre, he said, is that he was part of an off-the-books outfit authorized to do whatever was needed, wherever it was needed. Simmons was a saboteur, specialized in infiltrating criminal organizations or terror groups and dismantling them from the inside by inciting violence between rivals. He insinuated that he killed foreign nationals on American soil. His weapons convictions and several D.U.I.s were proof of how far outside the law he operated: Before his arrest in October, he\u2019d never spent a day in jail, he says.He showed me snapshots of buildings that he said were safe houses. Each one was accompanied by a map, their locations marked with a black X. I told him those didn\u2019t prove anything about the C.I.A.; they were just photographs of vacation cottages. He shut his binder and held it up in the air for me to ponder. \u2018\u2018Alex, you don\u2019t just wake up one morning and make this from nothing,\u2019\u2019 he said. \u2018\u2018If it appears I lived this life, it\u2019s because I did.\u2019\u2019He flipped to a binder tab marked \u2018\u2018Businesses.\u2019\u2019 He showed me articles of incorporation for consulting firms bearing opaque names like WSS International and Phoenix Management. There was Regal Limousine, which had just one car in its fleet. These were agency fronts, he claimed. \u2018\u2018The C.I.A. spent millions to make sure no one can see me,\u2019\u2019 he said.He dropped name after name, putting himself in the middle of real events that I later found news clippings about: the massive heroin bust in Washington that took down that Iranian smuggling ring, for instance. But I was never able to independently confirm his involvement in any of the events he mentioned. He vowed to send me corroborating documents but never delivered them. He promised to introduce me to former colleagues and lawyers who would verify his stories, but those offers always fell to the side.I questioned Simmons on his credentials, and he fell back, as he did with others, on his trips to Gitmo. \u2018\u2018We rode down on Air Force Two,\u2019\u2019 he said. He produced a photograph taken on the runway. \u2018\u2018I don\u2019t care who you are, you don\u2019t get on Air Force Two unless your credentials are legit.\u2019\u2019 (Allison Barber, who ran the Retired Military Analysts program, says the group never flew to Cuba on the vice president\u2019s plane during her tenure, which overlapped with Simmons\u2019s.) He pulled out a photo of him standing nose to nose with President Bush. \u2018\u2018Who did the background checks on me then? Every time we went to White House or the Pentagon, they ran a background check.\u2019\u2019 I knew that his service in the Retired Military Analysts program didn\u2019t require anything more than a cursory check to make sure he wasn\u2019t on any watch lists and that a visit to the White House required only his name on the guest list and a name check.Simmons was quick to point out that the F.B.I. banged on his door just a few days before Hillary Clinton\u2019s congressional testimony about Benghazi. He told me his legal problems were an Obama administration ploy, a craven attempt to punish him for his opinions and to discredit the Citizens\u2019 Commission on Benghazi. He removed his glasses and rubbed his eyes. \u2018\u2018I wish I was this smart,\u2019\u2019 he said, chuckling. \u2018\u2018Nobody can do what the government says I did, fooling the F.B.I., C.I.A., D.O.D. and I.R.S. If I\u2019m that good, they should erect a plaque for me. Are you kidding me? I\u2019ve fooled the most powerful divisions of most powerful nation of the world?\u2019\u2019Simmons said there were documents that he\u2019d scattered around the world, files that detailed the unimaginable things he did. They would ultimately set him free, he said. \u2018\u2018The C.I.A. knows what else I did for them,\u2019\u2019 he said. \u2018\u2018It\u2019s the royal straight flush of spades.\u2019\u2019 His vindication was coming soon, he promised.

Now it\u2019s gone. We stand in line for hours for a sandwich. My husband told a journalist recently: \u201cPeople are fed up. Maybe tomorrow they will break down the gate and flood across the border.\u201d The journalist said, \u201cHow many weapons do you have?\u201d If we knew how to carry weapons or wanted to carry weapons we would not have fled Syria. We want peace. We are sick of killing.We fled a war, and now the European Union is making war against us, a psychological war. When we hear rumors that we\u2019ll be let into Europe, we celebrate. These leaders give us new hope, then they extinguish it. Why did you open the door to refugees? Why did you welcome people? If they had stopped it before, we would not have come. We would not have risked death, me and my children, and thousands of others, to make the crossing.I\u2019m 39 and Kurdish, from the city of Hasakah. I knew from watching the news that Hasakah was under threat from the Islamic State. Every day last spring, the government would shell the city\u2019s outskirts. Sometimes a stray shell would land near us.One day, at 5 in the morning, we heard the shelling and we knew that the Islamic State had arrived. I took my children and two bags and fled. In those days, everyone had two bags ready at all times: one containing important documents and the other clothes and other essentials. We ran through a dry riverbed. It was still muddy and we sank in up to our ankles.Even before the Islamic State came, life under the Kurdish forces was very hard. There was no wood to burn. Once I asked my husband, \u201cIf we took out one of the roof beams to put on the stove, and left one, do you think the roof would fall?\u201d He laughed. \u201cYes,\u201d he said. \u201cIt would fall, and we\u2019d be living in the street on top of everything.\u201dIf you have a son in Hasakah today he has to go to war. It doesn\u2019t matter if he\u2019s your only son or if he\u2019s studying. If there\u2019s no boy, a girl has to go. Someone from every house has to fight if you want to stay in the area.

Two days later, we stood in the dark with 35 others somewhere on the Turkish coast.We were the last people on the beach, my daughter, her husband, their baby and me. My daughter was sobbing. She said she didn\u2019t want to go and that if she died, the guilt was around my neck. I didn\u2019t know what to do. Then, like a dream, a young man came and lifted her and the baby into the boat. It was just me on the shore. I waded out to the boat. The smugglers lifted me from below, and my nephew pulled me up.The day we arrived here in Idomeni people were still crossing the border into Macedonia. We thought we had arrived. We thought the hard part was the sea.There is a saying in Arabic: \u201cEven heaven, without people, is unbearable.\u201dI have three sisters and three brothers in Germany. The European Union wants to keep us divided between countries. If we sign up for the relocation program and the European Union assigns us a European country and we get that citizenship, will we be able to go to our family in Germany? I\u2019m afraid they will change the laws and we won\u2019t be able to go even then.In our own country we refused to be separated. Are we going to agree here? Everyone in Idomeni just wants to go to their families; otherwise they would not have undertaken this dangerous journey to be reunited with them. In the next tent, there are two women who haven\u2019t seen their husbands in two years. The men are in Germany and haven\u2019t been able to bring their wives and children.I want all the leaders in Europe to hear me: If any one of them agrees to be separated from his son, I agree to do the same.

{"Headline": "Visiting the World of Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen: On The Row\u2019s Instagram", "Date": "2016-03-28", "News": "Supported bySocial CapitalMary-Kate and Ashley Olsen have been famous since before they could talk. In the three decades since, they\u2019ve never identified as any one thing, choosing instead to market themselves as two golden girls who might, under the right circumstances, show up at your slumber party.For the first 18 years of their lives, they didn\u2019t require a particular medium to succeed; their mere existence was enough to persuade children, myself included, to buy anything they were selling. Books, headbands, monthly newsletters that arrived in the actual mail: I threw all my babysitting money at children my own age. They were a special kind of American royalty \u2014 princesses who, as if by birthright, commanded a paycheck.As adults, they\u2019ve retained their skill for silence. For the most part they no longer act. They rarely give interviews, and though they\u2019re still hounded by paparazzi, the images are mostly of them walking between offices and cars, hands in front of their faces. They\u2019ve embraced being behind the scenes of fashion, with a stable of lines for different price points. Their prized collection, The Row, was founded in 2006. Since then, the Olsens have won CFDA Womenswear Designer of the Year \u2014 the highest award available to American fashion designers \u2014 twice, in 2012 and 2015.Given that they are among the most famous and wealthiest members of my generation, it\u2019s striking that they also share few of the trademarks commonly associated with our cohort. They don\u2019t tweet (at least not on Twitter accounts we know about). They don\u2019t use Facebook (that we know of). If they party, it\u2019s not at clubs we\u2019ve ever heard of; if they have unfortunate political views, well, they\u2019re keeping them to themselves. The Olsens don\u2019t use social media because they can\u2019t \u2014 there is nothing they can share that their audience doesn\u2019t already think they know.We\u2019re meant to see what these clothes are for: sipping afternoon cocktails on our way to a quick dip in a pool, after which we\u2019ll sit on a very nice piece of furniture. It\u2019s the epitome of understated, adult indulgence, at least as seen by someone (read: me) who only recently started thinking of herself as an adult. The days of safe adolescent icons, banal beloved heroines of eras recently past, are gone. The Instagram has caught up to the Olsens; as they grew into their work as fashion designers, they grew more confident in showing their evolving values, and used this account to do it.Money talks, but when everyone is talking about a lack of money \u2014 the Row was selling $300 T-shirts while #America was going through a recession \u2014 luxury adapts by shutting up. Brands hide their logos and start talking about fabrics, cuts and other tastefully silent indicators of power. Simplicity is the safest place to hide extravagance. On Instagram, The Row can hide in plain sight. Here it commands complete attention, even if it\u2019s just the attention of a follower scrolling through a feed; here, nobody has to use words to communicate.The Row, and by extension the Olsen twins themselves, use Instagram not only as free advertising, but also as a way to act as if their world is transparent \u2014 here are the artists we love! the clothes we make! the scenery we look at! \u2014 while obscuring any contact with the designers themselves, instead offering opaque ideas about inspiration. Other designers have tried to downplay their public personas, hiding behind their work and offering only a quick bow at seasonal runway shows, but the Olsen twins are the rarities who have gone from pop-culture ubiquity to an attempt at obscurity. By choosing to speak only through art, commerce and fashion, they\u2019ve grown into the identity they bought for themselves.Rather than reinventing the artisanal wheel, the Olsens have been reflecting culture, not necessarily directing it. Their aesthetic aligns with many other forces at work: Phoebe Philo at Celine, issues of Kinfolk at the local vegan cafe. I am their target demographic: a materialistic young woman, born in the mid- to late 1980s, partial to fine fabrics and various ideas about blond hair. But I\u2019ve had a luxury that the Olsen twins never had, or will never have \u2014 the chance to make my Instagram a carefully constructed reflection of what I want followers and friends to think my life is like. The Olsens, in their quiet dominance of a peculiar corner of popular culture, will always be \u201cthe Olsens\u201d first, their corporate Instagram account read to verify and not to understand.Haley Mlotek is a writer and editor based in New York.Advertisement"}

Pressed by Mr. Cooper as to whether he was saying he thinks that is what Mr. Trump is doing, Mr. Kasich declined to elaborate.Last September, the Republican National Committee chairman, Reince Priebus, asked Mr. Trump to sign a loyalty oath at a time when he left open the possibility of bolting from the party and running as a third-party candidate. Mr. Trump said he would sign, so long as all of the other candidates did the same. So they all did. But Mr. Trump, amid intense efforts to derail his march toward the nomination in a race in which he has a large lead among delegates to the Republican National Convention, said at the forum that he did not believe he was being treated fairly.  \u201cI have tremendous support right now from the people,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cI have many more delegates than him,\u201d he added of Mr. Cruz. \u201cI don\u2019t want people to do something against their will, Anderson,\u201d he said. Mr. Trump also gave a lengthy defense of his campaign manager, Corey Lewandowski, who was arrested on misdemeanor battery charges over an episode in which he is accused of grabbing and bruising a reporter speaking with Mr. Trump after a news conference. \u201cShe\u2019s not a baby,\u201d Mr. Trump said of the reporter, suggesting that she had overstated what happened. When Mr. Cooper asked if Mr. Trump had ever apologized for anything, he replied: \u201cOh, wow. I don\u2019t know. I\u2019ll think. Can I think?\u201d  He added, \u201cI do believe in apologizing if you\u2019re wrong.\u201d And then conceded, \u201cI apologize to my wife for not being presidential on occasion.\u201d\n\t\tFirst Draft provides fast-paced and comprehensive coverage of politics and elections by The New York Times.

{"Headline": "After Brussels Attacks, a Slow Process to Confirm Families\u2019 Worst Fears", "Date": "2016-03-25", "News": "Supported byBRUSSELS \u2014 From his home in Tennessee, Levi Sutton has spent three days trying to figure out what happened to his half brother and sister-in-law, Justin and Stephanie Shults, who were at the Brussels international airport when the bombs went off.On Wednesday, the State Department told Mr. Sutton\u2019s family that the couple \u201chad been found,\u201d without saying if they were alive or dead. Hours later, a Belgian social worker called to say that the information was wrong and that the Shultses\u2019 whereabouts were unknown. Frustrated by the confusing and contradictory information, Mr. Sutton, a college student, has been posting pleas for help via Twitter.\u201cWe tried calling the embassy, the Red Cross, hospitals,\u201d he said in a telephone interview. \u201cWe\u2019re unable to get any information,\u201d he added. \u201cNo one is telling us anything. All we can do is pray.\u201dMore than 72 hours after the deadly attacks at the Brussels airport and a busy subway station, the Belgian authorities still had not published a list of the victims. Families across Brussels and around the world were left waiting for word, prolonging the agony of those already suffering and teetering between hope, despair and grief.Some official confirmations did come out on Friday \u2014 but only a trickle.The 31 people killed in Brussels included Americans, Secretary of State John Kerry announced at a morning news conference here in the Belgian capital, though many hours later the State Department still had not released their names.Three Dutch citizens were killed, too, came the word from the Foreign Ministry in the Netherlands.The German police announced by the afternoon that a young woman from Aachen who was at an airport checkout counter when the terror attacks erupted there on Tuesday morning had not survived, though her husband did, and was being treated at a Brussels hospital. Around midnight in China, the state-run news agency named another victim: Deng Jingquan, a businessman who was known as Frank.By Friday, about a third of those killed had been publicly identified, mostly by relatives, workplaces or universities, and often through social media. The Belgian authorities said the process was slow because of the mutilation of many bodies, particularly at the subway, where the bombs did more damage because of the enclosed space.\u201cWe need to have 100 percent certainty in the identification of the victim before we can identify someone,\u201d said Michael Jonniaux, a spokesman for the Belgian federal police, who are overseeing the gruesome task.After a plane crash, he noted, investigators begin with a manifest of who was onboard, but no such list exists for a subway. The fact that the victims, including at least 300 wounded, are believed to be from at least 40 countries, only complicates the notification process.The Belgian government\u2019s crisis center issued a statement responding to the families\u2019 frustration, saying: \u201cIt is imperative not to make a mistake.\u201dMr. Jonniaux said his seven-member team had added 23 people after Tuesday\u2019s attacks.As rescue crews began sorting through the rubble after the morning blasts, victims from the airport were sent to a university hospital in the town of Leuven, while those from the Maelbeek subway station went to the military hospital in Neder-over-Heembeek in northern Brussels, which is also serving as a coordination point for relatives. The injured have since been scattered to 48 hospitals across Belgium, and some were sent to France.At the military hospital, a blocky concrete structure, the relatives of the missing must pass through two security checkpoints guarded by armed soldiers and police officers, and show identification. They are greeted by members of the Red Cross and officials from Mr. Jonniaux\u2019s identification team, as well as a psychologist to help shepherd them through the process.Relatives can help identify possessions found at the scene, such as eyeglasses, clothing or computers, though to call the body a match, the team requires DNA evidence, dental records, X-rays or digital fingerprints.\u201cWe pick up everything that can be used as evidence,\u201d Mr. Jonniaux said. \u201cAnything that can provide a clue, such as a piece of jewelry or a valise.\u201dAs of Friday afternoon, the list of confirmed dead included:\u0095 Loubna Lafquiri, a gym teacher at a Muslim school in Brussels.\u0095 Jennifer Scintu-Waetzmann, 30, a German newlywed leaving for her honeymoon in New York.On Facebook, the search continued as well. \u201cHave you seen this young woman?\u201d begins one anguished post, accompanied by a photograph of a smiling woman with long brown hair. \u201cHer name in Aline Bastin, Belgian nationality, 29 years old. She was very probably in the subway during the explosion. We are desperately looking for her \u2014 if you have seen her, please contact us!\u201dDan Bilefsky reported from Brussels, and Russell Goldman from New York.

{"Headline": "Hillary Clinton Criticizes Sheriff Joe Arpaio, Immigration Proxy for Donald Trump", "Date": "2016-03-22", "News": "PHOENIX \u00e2\u0080\u0094 Hillary Clinton sharply denounced Sheriff Joe Arpaio, saying the Maricopa County sheriff, who became the face of hard-line anti-immigration policies because of his tactics here, had treated his \u00e2\u0080\u009cfellow human beings with disrespect\u00e2\u0080\u009d and contempt.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt just makes my heart sink,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mrs. Clinton told a rally of mostly Latino supporters on Monday. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe are better than that.\u00e2\u0080\u009dMr. Arpaio, who rose to national prominence for his aggressive raids of undocumented immigrants in Arizona, endorsed the leading Republican presidential candidate, Donald J. Trump, in January and campaigned with him in Arizona over the weekend.Mrs. Clinton did not mention Mr. Trump or the violence that erupted at his rally in Tucson on Saturday, but she alluded to his \u00e2\u0080\u009cpitting groups of Americans against each other.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s just wrong. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not who we are,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mrs. Clinton said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI do believe we are stronger and more effective when we are coming together.\u00e2\u0080\u009dMrs. Clinton reminded the audience to vote in Arizona\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Democratic primary on Tuesday. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThere is an opportunity for everybody in Arizona to go out and vote for the kind of future you want, the kind of president you want,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said, when a man interrupted with: \u201cWe want you!\u00e2\u0080\u009d A coy Mrs. Clinton said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, I want you to want me.\u00e2\u0080\u009dEver since her sweep of victories in the five states that held contests last week, Mrs. Clinton has taken sharper aim at Mr. Trump. Hours before the rally here, Mrs. Clinton lambasted the Manhattan real-estate developer as inexperienced and na\u00c3\u00afve on foreign policy.\u00e2\u0080\u009cWe need steady hands, not a president who says he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s neutral on Monday, pro-Israel on Tuesday and who-knows-what on Wednesday,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mrs. Clinton said early Monday in a speech at the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, or Aipac, the nation\u00e2\u0080\u0099s most powerful pro-Israel lobbying group.Mr. Trump also addressed Aipac in Washington, just as Mrs. Clinton spoke here, vowing to \u00e2\u0080\u009cfight for comprehensive immigration reform,\u00e2\u0080\u009d another issue that has sharply divided the political landscape and animated voters on both sides.On Monday, Mrs. Clinton largely left the direct criticism of Mr. Trump to her surrogates. Thomas E. Perez, the secretary of labor and a Clinton supporter, poked fun at Mr. Trump as he announced Mrs. Clinton, the former secretary of state. The presidency, he said, isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t about \u00e2\u0080\u009cwhether you have big hands, but steady hands.\u00e2\u0080\u009dMark Kelly, the astronaut and husband of former Representative Gabrielle Giffords, who was shot at a Tucson shopping center in 2011, said Mr. Trump was \u00e2\u0080\u009cbringing out the worst in our country: anger, hatred, division.\u00e2\u0080\u009dArizona will award just 75 delegates in Tuesday\u00e2\u0080\u0099s primary, but it represents a battleground in the fight over immigration reform. Democrats believe Mr. Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s remarks about immigrants and his signature proposal to build a wall on the Mexican border could galvanize Latinos to vote in larger numbers in November, potentially turning states like Arizona and Colorado blue.Mrs. Clinton has mocked Mr. Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s proposal to build a wall. \u00e2\u0080\u009cHe\u00e2\u0080\u0099s talking about a very tall wall, right, a beautiful tall wall, the most beautiful tall wall, better than the Great Wall of China,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mrs. Clinton said in the last Democratic debate, impersonating Mr. Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s accent.Senator Bernie Sanders has crisscrossed Arizona holding large rallies, as Mrs. Clinton has mostly dispatched surrogates,  including Bill Clinton, to campaign on her behalf here. Mr. Sanders has criticized Mrs. Clinton for telling CNN in 2014 that the Central American children that arrived on the border should be sent back.As Mrs. Clinton spoke here, the Sanders campaign blasted out an editorial in The Arizona Republic blaming Bill Clinton\u00e2\u0080\u0099s signing of the 1996 Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act for the current deportations.Mrs. Clinton\u00e2\u0080\u0099s choice of venues was symbolic: Carl Hayden high school, a mostly Latino high school, became famous in 2004 after a group of students, the sons of undocumented immigrants from Mexico, beat M.I.T. students and won a national engineering competition by building an underwater robot from Home Depot parts. The underdog tale became a documentary, \u00e2\u0080\u009cUnderwater Dreams.\u00e2\u0080\u009dAfter her rally, Mrs. Clinton planned to meet with representatives from many of the state\u00e2\u0080\u0099s native tribes, including the Navajo Nation and the Hopi. On Tuesday, in Washington State, Mrs. Clinton plans to have a round-table discussion with tribal leaders in Puyallup.An earlier version of this article misstated the number of states holding Democratic nominating contests last week.

{"Headline": "A Day of Potential Clarity Amid a Long Slog", "Date": "2016-03-15", "News": "For the current leaders of the long march toward the 2016 presidential nominations, Tuesday will be either the beginning of the end, or the end of the beginning.Donald J. Trump could have a banner night, winning primaries in both Florida and Ohio and becoming unstoppable on the way to the nomination. Or, as is more likely, the night will be inconclusive, with different candidates winning different states, denying Mr. Trump a clear path to the 1,237 delegates needed to lock up the convention. Gov. John R. Kasich of Ohio is leading in some polls in his state and could keep his candidacy alive there. Marco Rubio, who is trailing in Florida, could be driven from the race with a loss.Hillary Clinton could have a great night, winning Ohio and Florida easily over Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont. Or they could split those states, with less certain outcomes in Illinois, Missouri and North Carolina.Mrs. Clinton\u00e2\u0080\u0099s trajectory toward sewing up her party\u00e2\u0080\u0099s nomination is far clearer than Mr. Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s. But the reality is that if Mr. Trump wins Florida, and wins decisively, it will become very hard to stop him. So the focus will now fall to Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, who is reviled by many of his Republican colleagues for his role in the 2013 government shutdown. Mr. Cruz is about 100 delegates behind Mr. Trump, and he hopes to win some states on Tuesday and finish second in enough others to position himself as the only alternative. The night\u00e2\u0080\u0099s results will also be a test of whether Mr. Trump has taken on water after his slow disavowal of the former Ku Klux Klan leader David Duke, and his refusal to take responsibility for the violent turn that some of his rallies have taken, particularly in Chicago on Friday. A candidate who has won a dozen states can usually grow his voter pool, but if Mr. Trump remains below 40 percent in most states, it would indicate he has cauterized his base of support.  As for Mrs. Clinton, a loss in Ohio, a state where she famously demanded that Barack Obama meet her for a primary showdown in the 2008 race, would propel the questions about her ability to win white working-class voters. For a candidate who said in that 2008 race that she was fighting for \u00e2\u0080\u009chard-working Americans, white Americans,\u00e2\u0080\u009d it has been a surprising turn of events. \n\t\tFirst Draft provides fast-paced and comprehensive coverage of politics and elections by The New York Times.

{"Headline": "In Sri Lanka, Barriers Fall in a Land Marred by Bloodshed", "Date": "2016-03-02", "News": "Supported byExplorerWe had just crossed the causeway leading from the Jaffna Peninsula to the Vanni, the northern Sri Lankan mainland, when the colossus came into view: a pair of bronze hands, mounted on a plinth, raising aloft a model of this teardrop-shaped island nation. A marble frieze on the wall that encircled the statue showed columns of helmeted troops and tanks rolling past swamps and palmyra trees, the spiky palm indigenous to Sri Lanka\u2019s far north. I stepped out of the car in the torpid heat and walked around the monument, which dominates this strategic corridor known as Elephant Pass.It was here, in January 2009, that two divisions of Sri Lankan troops pushed down from the peninsula, converging with two other divisions marching from the south, to begin a final offensive against the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam, otherwise known as the Tamil Tigers. \u201cThe gallant operation [was] launched under the state leadership of the president ... who was born for the grace of the nation,\u201d declared a plaque at the base of the statue, commemorating Sri Lanka\u2019s hard-line leader at the time, Mahinda Rajapaksa. In overblown language, the inscription noted that the troops had \u201ctraversed scrubs, impassable moats, quagmires and ... dreadful traps ... liberating this long path and annihilating terrorism.\u201dBut in 2011, with the region pacified, President Rajapaksa began relaxing his stringent security measures, allowing in both Sri Lankans from the south and foreigners.Last year\u2019s election, which brought Maithripala Sirisena, a moderate Sinhalese, to power, raised hopes for reconciliation, and an end to government obfuscations about the brutality that took place here during the war\u2019s final months.To reach the north, I traveled from the ancient Sinhalese Buddhist capital of Anuradhapura to Jaffna on the Northern Line, the old British-built railroad that runs for 211 miles through Sri Lanka\u2019s interior. In the 1980s, Tiger bombings and sabotage forced the line to shut down; the guerrillas then seized control of the adjacent territory, ripped up the rails to make bunkers, and let the jungle reclaim what was left. Bombing raids by the Sri Lankan Air Force reduced stations to rubble.Financed by loans from Indian Railways and other sources, President Rajapaksa\u2019s government rebuilt the line over five years. On a sunny afternoon in October 2014, the president made the inaugural journey to Jaffna aboard the Queen of Jaffna train, known in Tamil as the Yarl Devi. Garlanded with flowers and banana leaves, it rolled into Jaffna to an explosion of cheers and firecrackers.My own journey on the Northern Line took place with less fanfare. The train arrived at Anuradhapura\u2019s sleepy station two hours behind schedule, and I took a seat in the nearly empty first-class car. Walking through the train as it rumbled through paddies and jungle, I encountered a microcosm of Sri Lanka\u2019s population. Two young men sitting together in a second-class compartment told me they were military officers returning to their base in Kilinochchi, the former Tigers capital in the Vanni, but politely rebuffed my attempts at further conversation.In a crowded third-class car I met a Tamil Hindu family \u2014 husband, wife and teenage son \u2014 traveling to Jaffna from their home in Colombo to visit the man\u2019s ailing mother. It was the first time that the 62-year-old railway worker had ridden the line since the 1980s, and he gave President Rajapaksa grudging credit. \u201cHe built roads, the railways are running, education is better,\u201d he told me in Tamil, which his son translated. But the Tamil people, he added, shifting nervously in his seat, \u201chave to watch what we say. We do not feel protected.\u201dAfter five hours we pulled into Jaffna, dominated by a heavily shelled Portuguese-built fort, where the Tigers once held sway. The army drove the guerrillas out of the Jaffna Peninsula 20 years ago, forcing them to take refuge in the Vanni to the south, and, for many Jaffna residents, the war has faded into a distant memory.Worshipers gather every Friday at the city\u2019s elaborate Hindu temples to make puka, or devotions, to their gods. The military curfew has been lifted, and outdoor restaurants are packed at night with Tamil families dining on dosas, idlis and other specialties of the distinctive cuisine that Jaffna shares with Tamil Nadu, India\u2019s southernmost state.Scholars and students fill the Jaffna library, an opulent, Indo-Saracenic-style edifice. After a pro-separatist Tamil party held a rally in Jaffna in 1981 in which two Sinhalese policemen were killed, a mob burned the library to the ground, an act that served to catalyze the conflict. But the library was restored two decades ago, and it has again become a center of Tamil intellectual life.The next morning my guide, a Tamil architect named Kumaralingan Pathyran but known to everyone as Pathy, and I followed a causeway across a lagoon to the western edge of the peninsula. There we boarded a navy-operated ferry and motored toward Delft, one of several remote islands in the Palk Strait dividing Sri Lanka and India. I secured a perch on the tiny foredeck. Below, dozens of locals huddled in a dark and cramped cabin.As we crossed the strait, Pathy told me that the body of water was the site of what was called a massacre. In May 1985, six men believed to be from the Sri Lankan navy boarded the Kumudini, a ferry sailing from Delft, and hacked to death 23 Tamil men, women and children. The slaughter was in revenge for a mass killing carried out by the Tigers around Anuradhapura days earlier.Alighting in Delft\u2019s soporific port, we hired a motorized rickshaw and bounced down decrepit roads, past Hindu temples, stopping to view various curiosities left by Sri Lanka\u2019s succession of European conquerors: a giant baobab brought by the Portuguese in the 16th century from Madagascar; a ruined 17th-century Portuguese fortress built of coral; a herd of wild horses galloping across a barren plain, the descendants of those brought over, then abandoned, by Dutch colonizers 300 years ago; a stone aviary used by a British governor to house his carrier pigeons.There were no hotels, no restaurants, no tourist infrastructure, just a back-of-beyond landscape and miles of empty beach. Pathy and I bought fish at a market by the port and hired a local man to prepare a curry with chiles and coconut milk. On a deserted strip of sand battered by rough waves, we ate out of a communal pot, as feral cats gathered.Just past the Elephant Pass, at the edge of the Vanni, a grandiose memorial celebrates the life of Gamini Kularatne, an ordinary Sinhalese soldier who, in July 1991, single-handedly disabled a Tiger bulldozer packed with explosives, and died. It typifies the iconography indulged in by the Rajapaksa government to glory in its victory and to remind the Tamils of the cost of resistance.The shredded remnants of the Caterpillar, which Gamini Kularatne attacked with grenades, are mounted on a pedestal, surrounded by a carp pond, a fountain and exhibits chronicling every twist and turn in the young hero\u2019s life: a New Year\u2019s greeting from the soldier to his mother, a 1988 pay slip, snapshots of his wedding. Farther down the road an outdoor museum displays captured Tiger speedboats, submarines, even a mini-destroyer. In Kilinochchi, which the Tigers occupied for a decade, I inspected a 60-foot-high water tank lying on its side, a tangle of concrete and rebar that was toppled by the Tigers in the spring of 2009 as they retreated.Pathy and I drove down a dirt road through the jungle, followed by clouds of green parakeets. After a 15-minute drive, we stopped before a brick bungalow with a red-tile roof and an orange stucco facade. Soldiers sat on the veranda and milled about the garden. This was the former hideaway of Velupillai Prabhakaran, the charismatic founder of the Tamil Tigers.A high-school dropout from Jaffna, Mr. Prabhakaran tried to build an egalitarian utopia in the Tiger-occupied Vanni, but he grew increasingly isolated, paranoid and brutal; Sri Lankan troops captured and executed him in the last days of the government\u2019s offensive. His house, laced with underground bunkers, is open to the public, but this day the soldiers refused to let us enter, claiming that the bunkers were in danger of collapse. Instead we had to settle for a visit to the nearby home of Colonel Soosai, the commander of the Sea Tigers, the rebels\u2019 naval force, who was killed a few days before Mr. Prabhakaran.\u201cEnemies are our best teachers\u201d read a sign placed by government soldiers over the doorway to the guerrilla chief\u2019s bungalow. I walked down a narrow flight of steps concealed inside a closet, and found myself in a long, mud-filled tunnel \u2014 a secret escape route that burrowed beneath Colonel Soosai\u2019s garden.The Tigers made their final stand at the Nanthi Kadal Lagoon, a few miles down the coast. The road followed an unbroken swath of jungle, bordered by yellow tape and signs displaying a skull-and-crossbones and the warning, \u201cMines,\u201d in English, Sinhalese and Tamil. Soldiers were still sweeping the jungle for buried explosives and had blocked off many dirt roads leading to the lagoon. Eventually we found our way to the Vaddu Vakal Bridge, not far from Lagoon\u2019s Edge, the military-owned villa now being marketed as a getaway for tourists.A scene of pristine beauty surrounded me. Looking north toward the Indian Ocean, I could see distant breakers crashing against a golden beach. On the inland side of the bridge, herons flew over tidal flats and islets covered with marsh grass, and palmyras swayed over the thick brush that grew along the shore. But the serenity belied the horror that had unfolded here. In May 2009, the Sri Lankan army trapped 100,000 civilians and Tiger guerrillas between the jungle and the ocean, and shelled them relentlessly.Today a military guard post flanks one end of the span, along with a sign that reflects the Sinhalese victors\u2019 view of history. It proclaims that this was the site of \u201cheroic victory\u201d over \u201cruthless terrorists,\u201d by government troops who saved the civilians in a \u201chumanitarian operation.\u201dI fell into a conversation with a grizzled Tamil fisherman who was dangling a line off the bridge. He\u2019d been trapped here with thousands of others in 2009, he told me, but \u201cthere has no been no problem here since the \u2018liberation.\u2019 \u201d He cast a nervous glance toward the military guard post, and then hurried away.Seven years after a brutal war, peace and tourism have returned to Sri Lanka\u2019s north, but normality remains more elusive.An article last Sunday about traveling to the Jaffna region of Sri Lanka misspelled part of the Tamil name of the Queen of Jaffna train. It is Yarl Devi, not Yari Devi. The article also misstated the phone number for the Experience Travel Group, which organizes tours to the area. It is 44-20-79-24-7133.Advertisement"}

In an exceedingly strange case of simultaneous musical inspiration, both Mr. Blue and the producer Tobtok, from Sweden, released dance covers of \u201cFast Car\u201d within a week of each other this winter. Both are viral hits in Europe and gaining traction in the United States; both artists \u2014 Mr. Blue is 26, and Tobtok, 23 \u2014 are too young to have heard the original when the singer and songwriter Ms. Chapman first released it.\u201cIt was just a song that kind of stuck with me when I was younger, and I had always wanted to do a cover of it,\u201d Mr. Blue said by phone recently, \u201cbecause, obviously, being a dance D.J., I could never play the original version in my sets. It would just never work.\u201dMs. Chapman\u2019s original \u201cFast Car\u201d spins a yarn of hope, relying primarily on an acoustic guitar and her own throaty, impassioned vocals. The song won a Grammy Award and was her biggest hit. It has been covered many times \u2014 by artists from Xiu Xiu to Sam Smith \u2014 but never before to such an enthusiastic response. Mr. Blue\u2019s version, the more successful of the two covers, has charted on iTunes in more than 50 countries, hitting No. 1 in five, and has been streamed more than 100 million times on Spotify.Tobtok takes a somewhat sunnier approach in his peppy, brighter tropical house mix, featuring the singer River, which has made the iTunes charts in Ireland, Australia and Germany. He said in a phone conversation that he got the idea for the cover after seeing the music video for Ms. Chapman\u2019s original at the Hard Rock in Budapest.Just before Tobtok released his version, his label informed him that another producer had covered \u201cFast Car.\u201d \u201cI was like, \u2018Are you serious?\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cI think these kind of situations rarely happen \u2014 it\u2019s just a crazy thing in the music business.\u201d\u201cHis is obviously one style, a bit more indie, a bit more dark, and mine is a bit more summerish, I guess,\u201d Tobtok added. \u201cI obviously prefer my version \u2014 as a producer, the way that I went with the track is my taste.\u201d (To be fair, he also called Mr. Blue\u2019s version a \u201cgood, well-executed track.\u201d)Both of the \u201cFast Car\u201d artists plan to follow up their surprise hits with their first United States tours: Tobtok will visit in a few months, while Mr. Blue began his run of shows last Friday at Webster Hall. And while Ms. Chapman couldn\u2019t be reached for direct comment, she acknowledged through a representative that she has heard, and is flattered by, the covers of her song.

Now we\u2019re talking about the sort of bro who instigates the hijacking of Hillary Clinton\u2019s official Facebook page; who harasses women who endorse Clinton; who tells black Americans whom he thinks it\u2019s in their best interest to support. Yeah, we\u2019re talking about the Berniebro. I know: him, that Bernie Sanders supporter so badly feeling the Bern that he communicates in condescension and flames.The deployment of \u2018\u2018bro\u2019\u2019 as a means of disparagement is part of a generalized expression of fatigue with the wielding of white-male power, a feeling that has emboldened Clinton supporters. We\u2019re no longer talking about the classic bro. We\u2019re talking about trolls and, in lieu of a less printable word, jerks.This was the bro, optimally: feeling good in front of an audience, without rhythm, shame or a shirt. This was the bro, suboptimally, too: Gronk\u2019s presumption that his fun is fun for everybody else. The Party Ship featured a version of the bro that America got to know on MTV\u2019s friends-at-the-beach reality sitcom, \u2018\u2018Jersey Shore,\u2019\u2019 which, to the consternation of Italian-Americans, Garden Staters and many sentient humans, ran from 2009 to 2012. The men on that show made such prolific use of the word that it occasionally abutted the palindromic, as in, \u2018\u2018Bro, I\u2019m telling you, bro.\u2019\u2019Courtesy of \u2018\u2018Jersey Shore,\u2019\u2019 the bro became evidence of ridiculous male friendship, like the bond among veterans, but with self-tanner instead of casualties of war. The prominence of \u2018\u2018bro\u2019\u2019 also coincided with the arrival of the joshing fraternal comedies of Judd Apatow and the cresting popularity of Barney Stinson, the sleazy, slutty suit Neil Patrick Harris played for nine seasons on \u2018\u2018How I Met Your Mother,\u2019\u2019 who adhered to the articles of a handbook called the Bro Code.But now \u2018\u2018bro\u2019\u2019 has been ripped from its life as a teasing term of endearment and description of camaraderie and plunked into the sociopolitical swamps of entitlement and privilege. It starts to get at the fractious identity rifts at the heart of this campaign season. On one hand, women and people of color don\u2019t want to be patronized by know-it-all white guys or bullied into supporting one presidential candidate and harassed away from supporting another. On the other: #NotAllMen.What are white guys who just want to chill with one another supposed to do? Keep their mouths shut and legs closed, for starters. Jesting aside, though, that\u2019s the frustration fueling the current presidential election. White men are being called out for the transgressions of the last year and also, less obviously, for the lingering affronts of centuries past. (You know what they say: A fight about the dishes in the sink is about everything but the dishes.) Bruised male ids are running against rule-bound superegos. The irony is rich. It\u2019s also real: Bros be feelin\u2019 oppressed, yo!It\u2019s also odd that \u2018\u2018bro\u2019\u2019 has become a culturally white designation. The word has roots both in the church and as a way that black people address black men \u2014 as \u2018\u2018brother.\u2019\u2019 Black use of that word is publicly fraternal and privately political. It\u2019s how black men salute each other \u2014 still \u2014 in white spaces, as a way of saying to each other, \u2018\u2018I see you.\u2019\u2019 What\u2019s vaguely obnoxious about \u2018\u2018bro\u2019\u2019 is that it doesn\u2019t really see anybody.The willful blindness sometimes feels like a stab at utopia. White men calling black men \u2018\u2018bro\u2019\u2019 aspire to or assume a kinship with black Americans. There are other words \u2014 O.K., the N-word \u2014 that the bro knows he can\u2019t say. \u2018\u2018Brother\u2019\u2019 seemed O.K. Eventually, so did \u2018\u2018bro.\u2019\u2019 But I\u2019ve heard more than one black man say, \u2018\u2018Dude, I\u2019m not your bro.\u2019\u2019 I\u2019ve been that man. There are regional variations on the word \u2018\u2018bro\u2019\u2019 that seem designed to lock out certain white people: In the South, for instance, there\u2019s \u2018\u2018bruh\u2019\u2019 and, in Hawaii and the American West, \u2018\u2018brah.\u2019\u2019 But a bro can always get a key made.\u2018\u2018Bro\u2019\u2019 draws a line between cultural blackness and cultural whiteness while also drawing a circle around white male groups. Its swell gets at a kind of vague discomfort we have with male camaraderie, even though certain comrade cohorts \u2014 like the dudes in \u2018\u2018Entourage\u2019\u2019 or at Donald Trump events \u2014 invite derision. The bro, in all his permutations, can work the nerves. But the trawl used to fish him out seems indiscriminate, netting all senses of fraternity.Where does the expanded taxonomy leave earnest, sensitive male bonds? American neologists coined a cheeky answer: bromance. Meanwhile, dudes who prefer doing everything with and just like other dudes (minus sex) are bromosexuals. And dudes who prefer the company of (and actual sex with) \u2018\u2018masculine\u2019\u2019 guys are gaybros.\u2018\u2018Bro\u2019\u2019-liferation presents an unhappy paradox. We\u2019re out of ideas for how to think about male behavior. And yet, lately certain male behavior has been so reliably hegemonic, so boorish, so violently intolerant that it needs to be classified, rounded up and put on notice. \u2018\u2018Bro\u2019\u2019 puts a dunce cap on patriarchy.Wesley Morris is the critic at large for The New York Times and a contributing writer for the magazine.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Bravo Zulu: On (Representative) Ryan Zinke", "Date": "2016-03-04", "News": "Supported bySocial CapitalWelcome to Social Capital, a series devoted to analyzing the social-media presences of celebrities.As a freshman congressman \u2014 he became Montana\u2019s sole delegate to the House of Representatives in 2015 \u2014 he criticized President Obama for participating in the Paris climate summit, on the grounds that it did nothing to stop ISIS. He made the same argument about gun control a month later. In his disdain for the hierarchies of Washington, his attention to cultural signifiers and his fixation on foreign enemies, Zinke represents the post-Tea Party strain of conservative populism. But unlike Sarah Palin or Ted Cruz, he actually fought in a war.If Commander Zinke were a fictional character, this presentation would be too flat: No real person could bravo zulu so hard. But on Twitter, we\u2019re all fictional anyway. Zinke has taken the performance of identity that is social media and reduced it to one clear note. Ironically, his relentless message discipline compels us to imagine the man behind the curtain, or the phone, in this case. There must be a real Ryan Zinke, because Commander Zinke is obviously fake. This impression only deepens with the discovery that there are two of him on Twitter: @RepRyanZinke, the congressman, and @RyanZinke, the citizen.It\u2019s a relief, I suppose, that he is keeping his admiration for Roosevelt out of his personal life. Otherwise, @RepRyanZinke versus @RyanZinke is a distinction without difference. His insistence on keeping them separate when they are functionally the same suggests that he thinks of himself as a man with two identities, and that idea is important to him.About 13 percent of adult Montanans have served in the armed forces; no state but Alaska has a higher percentage. At the same time, the national rate of service is shrinking. In 1977, Congress was 77 percent veterans. Today, that number stands at 20 percent, making Zinke\u2019s war record a valuable commodity. But as his status as a veteran advances his political career, he undergoes the same blurring of previously distinct identities \u2014 soldier, patriot, Republican \u2014 that has transformed his party into a lifestyle brand.There\u2019s something sympathetic about that picture. Commander Zinke, rare in his experience and outsize in his public persona, has committed a faux pas familiar to ordinary men: He has dressed wrongly for an event. Memorialized on social media, the mistake humanizes him. It makes him seem fallible in a way Special Forces commanders generally do not.Behind Commander Zinke\u2019s gung-ho social media facade lies a certain vulnerability. If Zinke is a soldier, not a politician, then the business of serving in the House must rack his nerves. In this context, his social media persona becomes a poignant archetype: the old soldier, hyper-competent in situations that would reduce most men to tears, befuddled by civilian life. The irony is that these two Ryan Zinkes seem identical to everyone else.His hooah shtick is surely exaggerated. But if Commander Zinke is a role he plays on Twitter, it is also the character he has enacted his whole life. He was a teenager once. He had a first day in the Navy. As a soldier, he faced terrifying danger, but at least he knew his mission. Can we blame him for wanting to carry that certainty into the House, where so much seems unclear? His social media persona captures the central fantasy of contemporary politics: that running this country is simple, so long as we are bluff, hearty and unusually brave.Advertisement"}

He called the report \u00e2\u0080\u009cgarbage\u00e2\u0080\u009d and said it was \u00e2\u0080\u009cdisgusting to see a candidate attacking the spouse of another\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u0093 while at the same time denying that he had anything to do with a mailing by a \u00e2\u0080\u009cSuper PAC\u00e2\u0080\u009d featuring a mostly unclothed Melania Trump, Mr. Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s wife and a former model, that circulated in Utah before Tuesday\u00e2\u0080\u0099s primary there.The warfare over spouses represents an attempt by Mr. Trump to get under Mr. Cruz\u00e2\u0080\u0099s skin, just like he did, effectively, with former rivals like Jeb Bush and Ben Carson. Mr. Trump also continues to use social media like Twitter to focus the race on personality and language rather than policy: He denied disparaging Mrs. Cruz by posting an unflattering photo of her on his Twitter page by noting that it was simply a retweet of another user\u2019s post. He added that he would not use Twitter \u00e2\u0080\u009cvery much as president\u00e2\u0080\u009d compared to his current tendency to send flurries of late-night tweets.On \u00e2\u0080\u009cFox News Sunday,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Cruz argued that Mr. Trump had a habit of turning to personal attacks \u00e2\u0080\u009cwhen he gets scared, particularly on foreign policy,\u00e2\u0080\u009d and said he was doing so now because he was \u00e2\u0080\u009cout of his depth\u00e2\u0080\u009d with recent comments like suggesting that United States pull back from NATO unless other nations pay more of the alliance\u00e2\u0080\u0099s costs. Mr. Trump repeated that view on Sunday and called NATO \u00e2\u0080\u009cobsolete\u00e2\u0080\u009d in the fight against terrorism.Mr. Trump was also asked if he would rule out internment camps for American Muslims \u00e2\u0080\u0093 an idea he has never proposed, though he has argued for a temporary ban on Muslims entering the country if they are not American citizens.\u00e2\u0080\u009cI would rule it out, but we would have to be very vigilant,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Trump said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIf we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not very, very strong and very, very smart, we have a big, big problem coming up.

{"Headline": "Apple Gets Tech Industry Backing in iPhone Dispute, Despite Misgivings", "Date": "2016-03-02", "News": "Supported byYet behind the scenes, it took time for some of the tech companies to make the decision to support Apple. Several feared the showdown with the government was too risky and could have far-reaching implications for the tech industry if Apple lost.Those misgivings ultimately did not win the day. About 40 companies and organizations are expected to file court briefs on Thursday backing Apple as it fights a judge\u2019s order to help law enforcement break into an iPhone used by a gunman in the San Bernardino, Calif., terrorist attack last year.Dropbox, Facebook, Google, Microsoft, Snapchat and Yahoo are among the tech companies expected to sign on to briefs in the case, according to people with knowledge of the plans who spoke on the condition of anonymity. More than 40 individuals, including prominent security experts and academics, are also planning to sign briefs, which will focus on themes like free speech, the importance of encryption and concerns about government overreach.The show of support \u2014 including briefs filed on Wednesday by groups like the American Civil Liberties Union and Access Now \u2014 is unusual in its breadth, showing that many in Silicon Valley believe that it could have profound implications on the trustworthiness of their products.Still, several executives at tech companies supporting Apple said they were worried that Apple had picked a fight that could end up backfiring on the rest of the industry. In the days since a magistrate judge in California ordered Apple to bypass security measures on the iPhone, lawyers in some of the companies debated these issues with one another and peers at other firms.All of the executives asked to remain anonymous because their deliberations were private, but their views are shared among others in Silicon Valley.Keith Rabois, a venture capitalist with the firm Khosla Ventures, said he was a strong believer in privacy and encryption \u2014 \u201call the normal Silicon Valley views,\u201d he said \u2014 but worried that Apple could lose the case, setting a legal precedent that could force other companies to compromise the security of their products for law enforcement.\u201cIn my view, this is the wrong case to fight,\u201d Mr. Rabois said. \u201cThere are plenty of other cases with a lot less sympathetic case for the government.\u201dApple\u2019s defenders said the company did not pick this fight \u2014 the government did. Critics of Apple\u2019s approach believe that the company could have quietly complied with the government\u2019s request to help break into the iPhone and then taken a public stand in a more favorable case. But Apple has said that once a tool exists for extracting data from the phone, that tool cannot be made to disappear.Yet whatever doubts Apple\u2019s allies voiced privately, they were in the end insufficient to keep a large number of big companies from signing on to the cause.Dropbox\u2019s general counsel, Ramsey Homsany, said in a statement, \u201cWe stand against the use of broad authorities to undermine the security of a company\u2019s products.\u201dBruce Sewell, Apple\u2019s general counsel, said in a statement, \u201cWe are humbled by the outpouring of support we\u2019ve received from our customers, our colleagues in business, nonprofit organizations, the security community and many others.\u201d He added, \u201cThe groups filing briefs with the court understand, as more and more people have come to realize, that this case is not about one phone \u2014 it is about the future and how we protect our safety and our privacy.\u201dOn Tuesday, Apple filed its formal objection to the government order to open up the iPhone, citing the reasons set forth in a previously filed motion.For many tech companies that were initially concerned by Apple\u2019s opposition to opening up the iPhone in the San Bernardino case, the worries centered not only on whether this was the right case for challenging the government but also on how public perceptions of the fight might reflect on the rest of the industry, according to tech executives involved in the discussions, who spoke on the condition of anonymity.Some of the companies were also concerned that the relationships they had forged with the government might degrade because of Apple\u2019s battle, according to the people involved in the tech industry discussions. In the years since the disclosures by Edward J. Snowden, the former intelligence contractor who released a trove of details on United States government surveillance tactics, some tech companies have been trying to educate members of Congress about online privacy practices.Others were also anxious that Apple\u2019s defiance of the government could lead to congressional efforts to reshape, in ways unfavorable to the tech industry, the Electronic Communications Privacy Act, which privacy advocates and tech companies have long claimed needs an overhaul.And these companies are watching what effect the fight could have on a proposal to establish a national commission that would explore ways to obtain encrypted data from consumers while working to safeguard users\u2019 privacy. The proposed commission, the bill for which was introduced on Monday, would be led by the House Homeland Security Committee chairman Michael McCaul, Republican of Texas, and Senator Mark Warner, Democrat of Virginia.Nick Wingfield reported from Seattle and Mike Isaac from New York.

Again", "Date": "2016-03-01", "News": "Supported byOn Tuesday, Zynga said Mr. Pincus would leave as chief executive once again.Zynga, based in San Francisco, appointed Frank Gibeau, a board member and longtime game industry executive, as its chief executive as of March 7. Mr. Pincus will become executive chairman.The changes in the executive suite at Zynga are strikingly similar to earlier management reshuffles at the company. In 2013, Mr. Pincus handed the chief executive job to Don Mattrick, who had spent 15 years at Electronic Arts, betting that his experience in the games industry could help lead a turnaround.By April of last year, that turnaround had not arrived. Mr. Mattrick left and Mr. Pincus returned to the top job. Zynga\u2019s stock now trades at $2.16 a share, lower than when Mr. Pincus became chief executive for the second time.And so Mr. Pincus and Zynga are again bringing in new blood. Like Mr. Mattrick, Mr. Gibeau, 47, worked for most of his career \u2014 more than two decades \u2014 at Electronic Arts, the publisher behind big PC and console games like Madden NFL and The Sims.In an email to Zynga employees, Mr. Pincus said that he recruited Mr. Gibeau to join Zynga\u2019s board seven months ago and that since then Mr. Gibeau had advised and coached game development teams at the company.Zynga was once a highflier, one of the first of a new era of game companies that created social games that let friends play one another on Facebook. But as many Facebook users began to tire of endless electronic invitations to play FarmVille and other Zynga games, Facebook made it harder for app makers to broadcast solicitations, hurting Zynga\u2019s growth.At the same time, Zynga was slow to recognize that mobile devices like the iPhone and iPad were becoming the biggest new opportunity for game start-ups, helping to create huge hits like Clash of Clans and Candy Crush.While Zynga has shifted its focus to mobile, the company still has not managed to match its earlier success and has spent several years reducing its costs. The company had 1,669 employees at the end of last year, down from 3,058 three years earlier, according to filings with regulators.\u201cWhile we\u2019re not yet the company we aspire to be, it\u2019s clear to me that Zynga has significant strengths that it can thrive on,\u201d Mr. Gibeau said in an email to Zynga employees on Tuesday.Advertisement"}

In dire language, he evoked the specter of totalitarianism, saying Mr. Trump embodied a \u00e2\u0080\u009cbrand of anger that has led other nations into the abyss.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Such a statement would be impossible to retract in a general election campaign and all but precludes a later endorsement.Mr. Trump repeatedly and provocatively reminded his supporters of that endorsement on Thursday, saying Mr. Romney had been prepared to debase himself to obtain it.\u00e2\u0080\u009cHe was begging for my endorsement,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Trump said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI could have said, \u00e2\u0080\u0098Mitt, drop to your knees\u00e2\u0080\u0099 \u00e2\u0080\u0094 he would have dropped to his knees.\u00e2\u0080\u009dIn an apologetic-sounding addendum on Thursday, conveyed over Twitter, Mr. Romney said he would never have accepted Mr. Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s blessing in 2012 had Mr. Trump made the same kind of divisive remarks back then.For Mr. Romney, a confrontation with Mr. Trump was both inevitable and undesirable. The son of a Republican presidential candidate himself, he is a reluctant instigator of ugly intraparty battles. But Mr. Trump represented things that Mr. Romney, a religious family man, loathed: a profane, philandering self-promoter.Mr. Romney had discussed simply throwing his support behind a mainstream Trump rival, like Mr. Rubio, the Florida senator, to undermine his candidacy, a traditional route for a party elder. But after debating his options with friends and advisers, he decided instead to confront Mr. Trump directly and avoid issuing an endorsement that might saddle a candidate with responsibility for his attacks.After chiding Mr. Trump last week for declining to release his tax returns, Mr. Romney decided over the weekend to escalate his criticism, several close associates said. Mr. Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hesitation on Sunday in disavowing an endorsement from David Duke, the white supremacist, convinced Mr. Romney that Mr. Trump could never win in November, and that there was no possibility of reaching an accommodation with him in a general election.And Mr. Romney told friends that he could not stomach \u00e2\u0080\u009ccoddling\u00e2\u0080\u009d a bigot.Mr. Romney tapped out a draft of his speech on his computer in Utah and shared it with his longtime advisers. His disgust suffused the remarks. He upbraided Mr. Trump for boasting about his marital affairs and lacing his speeches with vulgarities. And he questioned Mr. Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s basic decency.\u00e2\u0080\u009cDishonesty,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cis Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hallmark.\u00e2\u0080\u009dEven Republicans who welcomed Mr. Romney\u00e2\u0080\u0099s intervention in the race were doubtful that he would be able to dislodge Mr. Trump. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI feel like it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s nomination regardless of what anyone says,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Jason Adam, 37, a technology worker in Detroit. Michigan is the next big state to vote in the presidential race, next Tuesday.Sam Lopez, 55, a Republican who lives in nearby Shelby Township, saw Mr. Romney\u00e2\u0080\u0099s attack as a case of sour grapes.\u00e2\u0080\u009cI think what he did was very distasteful,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cTo go out and to publicly chastise Trump because Trump is winning: Is that the American way?\u00e2\u0080\u009dStill, Mr. Romney\u00e2\u0080\u0099s plea may help deter other Republicans from joining forces with Mr. Trump, at a point in the race when party leaders would typically rally around a clear front-runner.Mr. Christie was politely dismissive of Mr. Romney on Thursday and reminded him that democracy did not always conform to the party\u00e2\u0080\u0099s will.In a news conference in Trenton, Gov. Chris Christie addressed calls for him to resign, his support for Donald J. Trump and his appearance at a recent Trump news conference.\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt is the people who vote who ultimately decide who the nominee is,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s how Mitt Romney became the nominee.\u00e2\u0080\u009dOn the campus of the University of Utah, in a city where his family has deep roots, Mr. Romney argued that it was still possible to save a party that he and his father helped lead, a generation apart, from becoming the party of Mr. Trump.He offered a blueprint for a contested convention that may prove impractical, urging Republican primary voters to cast ballots for whichever candidate appeared to be the strongest Trump alternative in each state: Mr. Rubio in Florida, Gov. John Kasich in Ohio and Senator Ted Cruz wherever appropriate.But time, in fact, is running out for Mr. Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s opponents, who must defeat him in several of the big states that vote over the next two weeks to block him from seizing an insurmountable lead.John F. Lehman, a former Navy secretary who advised Mr. McCain\u00e2\u0080\u0099s 2008 campaign, said the alarm bells about Mr. Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s preparedness for the presidency may be ringing too late.\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s too bad that the party has waited so long, and the other candidates waited so long, to point out these shortcomings, because they are severe,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Lehman said. Explaining the delay, Mr. Lehman acknowledged, \u00e2\u0080\u009cPeople haven\u00e2\u0080\u0099t come out against him because nobody thought he\u00e2\u0080\u0099d get this far.\u00e2\u0080\u009dDespite the late date, Mr. Romney\u00e2\u0080\u0099s remarks could still sway voters before important primaries in two states that vote on Tuesday: Michigan, where Mr. Romney was raised and his father was governor, and Idaho, where he is a popular figure with fellow Mormons.Frances F. Townsend, a former Homeland Security adviser to George W. Bush, said she hoped that Thursday would be a turning point in the halting and haphazard struggle to derail Mr. Trump.\u00e2\u0080\u009cThere needed to be a group that would stand up and say, \u00e2\u0080\u0098Yes, I am willing to be counted,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 \u00e2\u0080\u009d said Ms. Townsend, who signed on to the letter rejecting Mr. Trump. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe cannot all be silent, or be Chris Christie and decide, \u00e2\u0080\u0098I am going to put myself first and, for political and opportunistic reasons, I am going to endorse this stuff.\u00e2\u0080\u0099 \u00e2\u0080\u009dHistorians could not recall another time in the last century when the Republican Party\u00e2\u0080\u0099s previous nominees had so harshly attacked a would-be successor. The most recent antecedent, said David Greenberg, an associate professor at Rutgers University, might be the 1912 election, when a former president, Theodore Roosevelt, led an exodus of progressive voters from the Republican Party and ran as a third-party candidate against the incumbent, William Howard Taft.\u00e2\u0080\u009cThere probably hasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t been this level of personal invective by one Republican nominee against another leading candidate,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Greenberg said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cEver.\u00e2\u0080\u009dAlan Rappeport and Jonathan Martin contributed reporting from Washington, and Alex Thompson from Salt Lake City.The following is a transcript of Mitt Romney\u00e2\u0080\u0099s remarks addressing the candidacy of Donald J.

{"Headline": "Donald Trump Hires Paul Manafort to Lead Delegate Effort", "Date": "2016-03-28", "News": "Donald J. Trump, girding for a long battle over presidential delegates and a potential floor fight at the Cleveland convention, has enlisted the veteran Republican strategist Paul J. Manafort to lead his delegate-corralling efforts, according to people briefed on Mr. Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s plans.Mr. Trump confirmed the hire in a brief telephone interview. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYes,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cit is true.\u00e2\u0080\u009dMr. Manafort, 66, is among the few political hands in either party with direct experience managing nomination fights: As a young Republican operative, he helped manage the 1976 convention floor for Gerald Ford in his showdown with Ronald Reagan, the last time Republicans entered a convention with no candidate having clinched the nomination.He performed a similar function for Mr. Reagan in 1980, and played leading roles in the 1988 and 1996 conventions, for George Bush and Bob Dole.Mr. Manafort has drawn attention in recent years chiefly for his work as an international political consultant, most notably as a senior adviser to former President Viktor F. Yanukovych of Ukraine, who was driven from power in 2014.The hiring is a sign that Mr. Trump is intensifying his focus on delegate wrangling as his opponents mount a tenacious effort to deny him the 1,237 delegates he would need to secure the Republican nomination. Under those circumstances, Mr. Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s opponents hope they can wrest that prize from him in a contested convention.Bringing Mr. Manafort on board may shore up Mr. Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s operation in an area where his opponents currently see him as vulnerable. In an alarming tactical setback for Mr. Trump, The Wall Street Journal reported last week that he might harvest fewer delegates from his primary win in Louisiana than Senator Ted Cruz, whose campaign has aggressively picked off delegates who are uncommitted or apportioned to candidates no longer in the race.Too many missteps of that kind could force Mr. Trump unnecessarily into a Cleveland floor fight.By hiring Mr. Manafort, Mr. Trump aims to avert such a situation. The move is freighted with political symbolism: After the 1980 election, Mr. Manafort was among the young-gun Reagan operatives who founded one of Washington\u00e2\u0080\u0099s best-known political consulting and lobbying shops.His principal business partners were Roger J. Stone Jr., a longtime Trump confidant who frequently advocates for the campaign on television, and Charles R. Black Jr.Gov. John Kasich of Ohio unveiled Mr. Black as an adviser earlier this month, in an announcement intended to convey his readiness for a contested convention \u00e2\u0080\u0094 effectively making Mr. Black and Mr. Manafort, allies dating to the 1970s, direct competitors in the 2016 race.\n\t\tFirst Draft provides fast-paced and comprehensive coverage of politics and elections by The New York Times.

Pass the Tissues.", "Date": "2016-03-07", "News": "Supported byThe Republican primary campaign has a cold.As an unruly election season wears on, dragging a bleary-eyed field along with it, the candidates are struggling to stave off illness and exhaustion at a time when the calendar demands their best.The customary sprints of January and February have given way to a breathless March, with little electoral clarity and rumblings of a slog to the convention in July, forcing the candidates to gird for the long haul.It is not going well.Mouths have been covered and tissues fetched. Surrogates with crisper voices have been recruited. Events have been scheduled and scrapped.The plan changed again Monday: Mr. Cruz added an event in Florence, Miss., for midafternoon.A spokeswoman for Mr. Cruz declined to comment. Aides to Mr. Rubio and Mr. Trump did not respond to messages.But even Mr. Trump, known to detest handshakes and the maladies they might introduce, is not immune to the rigors of the trail.

{"Headline": "Mind-Based Therapies May Ease Lower Back Pain", "Date": "2016-03-22", "News": "Sixty-five million Americans suffer from chronic lower back pain, and many feel they have tried it all: physical therapy, painkillers, shots. Now a new study reports many people may find relief with a form of meditation that harnesses the power of the mind to manage pain.The technique, called mindfulness-based stress reduction, involves a combination of meditation, body awareness and yoga, and focuses on increasing awareness and acceptance of one\u00e2\u0080\u0099s experiences, whether they involve physical discomfort or emotional pain. People with lower back pain who learned the meditation technique showed greater improvements in function compared to those who had cognitive behavioral therapy, which has been shown to help ease pain, or standard back care.Participants assigned to meditation or cognitive behavior therapy received eight weekly two-hour sessions of group training in the techniques. After six months, those learning meditation had an easier time doing things like getting up out of a chair, going up the stairs and putting on their socks, and were less irritable and less likely to stay at home or in bed because of pain. They were still doing better a year later.The findings come amid growing concerns about opioid painkillers and a surge of overdose deaths involving the drugs. At the beginning of the trial, 11 percent of the participants said they had used an opioid within the last week to treat their pain, and they were allowed to continue with their usual care throughout the trial.\u00e2\u0080\u009cThis new study is exciting, because here\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a technique that doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t involve taking any pharmaceutical agents, and doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t involve the side effects of pharmaceutical agents,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Dr. Madhav Goyal of Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, who co-wrote an editorial accompanying the paper.Dr. Goyal said he sees many patients with chronic lower back pain who become frustrated when they run out of treatments. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt may not be for everybody,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said, noting that some people with back pain find yoga painful. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBut for people who want to do something where they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re using their own mind to help themselves, it can feel very empowering.\u00e2\u0080\u009dSixty-one percent of participants who received meditation training experienced meaningful improvement in functioning six months after the program started, slightly more than the 58 percent who improved with cognitive behavioral treatment but far exceeding the 44 percent who improved with their usual care.Those who got cognitive behavioral therapy had greater improvement when it came to a measure called \u00e2\u0080\u009cpain bothersomeness,\u00e2\u0080\u009d with 45 percent gaining meaningful improvement compared with 44 percent in the meditation group. But both these treatments were more effective than the usual treatment, which led to improvement in only 27 percent of people.The benefits were limited, but that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not really surprising, said the study\u00e2\u0080\u0099s lead author, Daniel Cherkin of Group Health Research Institute in Seattle. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThere are no panaceas here. No treatment for nonspecific back pain has been found to make a whole lot of difference for many people.\u00e2\u0080\u009d While some treatments may help some people, he said, they don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t work well for others, which is why it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s important to be able to offer lots of options.Access to mindfulness-based stress reduction can be problematic, however. Training by certified instructors is not available everywhere, and may not be covered by health insurance.Dr. Cherkin said mindfulness-based stress reduction may be particularly helpful for people because even if their use lapses, they develop a skill they can draw on later when they need it.\u00e2\u0080\u009cThat suggests that training the mind has potential to change people on a more lasting basis than doing a manipulation of the spine or massage of the back,\u00e2\u0080\u009d techniques that may be \u00e2\u0080\u009ceffective in the short term but lose effects over time,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Dr. Cherkin said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou can practice it by waiting at the bus stop and just breathing.\u00e2\u0080\u009dRelated:Your health questions answered by Times journalists and\u00a0experts.Get Well's Running email for practical tips, expert advice, exclusive content and a bit of motivation delivered to your inbox every week to help you on your running journey.

{"Headline": "How ISIS Built the Machinery of Terror Under Europe\u2019s Gaze", "Date": "2016-03-29", "News": "Supported byThe day he left Syria with instructions to carry out a terrorist attack in France, Reda Hame, a 29-year-old computer technician from Paris, had been a member of the Islamic State for just over a week.His French passport and his background in information technology made him an ideal recruit for a rapidly expanding group within ISIS that was dedicated to terrorizing Europe. Over just a few days, he was rushed to a park, shown how to fire an assault rifle, handed a grenade and told to hurl it at a human silhouette. His accelerated course included how to use an encryption program called TrueCrypt, the first step in a process intended to mask communications with his ISIS handler back in Syria.The handler, code-named Dad, drove Mr. Hame to the Turkish border and sent him off with advice to pick an easy target, shoot as many civilians as possible and hold hostages until the security forces made a martyr of him.\u201cBe brave,\u201d Dad said, embracing him.Officials now say the signs of this focused terrorist machine were readable in Europe as far back as early 2014. Yet local authorities repeatedly discounted each successive plot, describing them as isolated or random acts, the connection to the Islamic State either overlooked or played down.Mr. Hame was arrested in Paris last August, before he could strike, one of at least 21 trained operatives who succeeded in slipping back into Europe. Their interrogation records offer a window into the origins and evolution of an Islamic State branch responsible for killing hundreds of people in Paris, Brussels and beyond.The people in Mr. Abaaoud\u2019s external operations branch were also behind the Brussels attacks, as well as a foiled attack in a suburb of Paris last week, and others are urgently being sought, Belgian and French officials say.\u201cIt\u2019s a factory over there,\u201d Mr. Hame warned his interlocutors from France\u2019s intelligence service after his arrest. \u201cThey are doing everything possible to strike France, or else Europe.\u201dFor much of 2012 and 2013, the jihadist group that eventually became the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL, was putting down roots in Syria. Even as the group began aggressively recruiting foreigners, especially Europeans, policy makers in the United States and Europe continued to see it as a lower-profile branch of Al Qaeda that was mostly interested in gaining and governing territory.One of the first clues that the Islamic State was getting into the business of international terrorism came at 12:10 p.m. on Jan. 3, 2014, when the Greek police pulled over a taxi in the town of Orestiada, less than four miles from the Turkish border. Inside was a 23-year-old French citizen named Ibrahim Boudina, who was returning from Syria. In his luggage, the officers found 1,500 euros, or almost $1,700, and a French document titled \u201cHow to Make Artisanal Bombs in the Name of Allah.\u201dBut there was no warrant for his arrest in Europe, so the Greeks let him go, according to court records detailing the French investigation.Mr. Boudina was already on France\u2019s watch list, part of a cell of 22 men radicalized at a mosque in the resort city of Cannes. When French officials were notified about the Greek traffic stop, they were already wiretapping his friends and relatives. Several weeks later, Mr. Boudina\u2019s mother received a call from a number in Syria. Before hanging up, the unknown caller informed her that her son had been \u201csent on a mission,\u201d according to a partial transcript of the call.The police set up a perimeter around the family\u2019s apartment near Cannes, arresting Mr. Boudina on Feb. 11, 2014.It was not until nearly two years later, on Page 278 of a 359-page sealed court filing, that investigators revealed an important detail: Mr. Boudina\u2019s Facebook chats placed him in Syria in late 2013, at the scene of a major battle fought by a group calling itself the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria.According to a brief by France\u2019s domestic intelligence agency, he was the first European citizen known to have traveled to Syria, joined the Islamic State and returned with the aim of committing terrorism. Yet his ties to the group were buried in French paperwork and went unconnected to later cases.Including Mr. Boudina, at least 21 fighters trained by the Islamic State in Syria have been dispatched back to Europe with the intention of causing mass murder, according to a Times count based on records from France\u2019s domestic intelligence agency. The fighters arrived in a steady trickle, returning alone or in pairs at the rate of one every two to three months throughout 2014 and the first part of 2015.Like the killers in Paris and Brussels, all of these earlier operatives were French speakers \u2014 mostly French and Belgian citizens, alongside a handful of immigrants from former French colonies, including Morocco.They were arrested in Italy, Spain, Belgium, France, Greece, Turkey and Lebanon with plans to attack Jewish businesses, police stations and a carnival parade. They tried to open fire on packed train cars and on church congregations. In their possession were box cutters and automatic weapons, walkie-talkies and disposable cellphones, as well as the chemicals to make TATP.Most of them failed. And in each instance, officials failed to catch \u2014 or at least to flag to colleagues \u2014 the men\u2019s ties to the nascent Islamic State.Though the degree to which the operatives were being directed by the Islamic State might have been unclear at first, a name began to appear in each successive investigation: Abdelhamid Abaaoud, a Belgian citizen who counterterrorism officials say rose through the ranks to become a lieutenant of the Islamic State\u2019s external operations efforts.\u201cAll of the signals were there,\u201d said Michael S. Smith II, a counterterrorism analyst whose firm, Kronos Advisory, began briefing the United States government in 2013 on ISIS\u2019 aspirations to strike Europe. \u201cFor anyone paying attention, these signals became deafening by mid-2014.\u201dIt was in the summer of 2014 that the link to the terrorist organization\u2019s hierarchy became explicit.On June 22 of that year, a 24-year-old French citizen named Faiz Bouchrane, who had trained in Syria, was smuggled into neighboring Lebanon. He was planning to blow himself up at a Shiite target, and during interrogation, he let slip the name of the man who had ordered him to carry out the operation: Abu Muhammad al-Adnani.Mr. Adnani is the spokesman for ISIS and is considered one of its most senior members. Just a few days after Mr. Bouchrane checked into a budget hotel in Beirut, Mr. Adnani released an audio recording announcing the establishment of the caliphate.The unit identifies recruits, provides training, hands out cash and arranges for the delivery of weapons once fighters are in position. Although the unit\u2019s main focus has been Europe, external attacks directed by ISIS or those acting in its name have been even more deadly beyond Europe\u2019s shores. At least 650 people have been killed in the group\u2019s attacks on sites popular with Westerners, including in Turkey, Egypt and Tunisia, according to a Times analysis.Within the hierarchy, Mr. Abaaoud was specifically tasked with mounting attacks in Europe, according to the French police report and intelligence brief.\u201cAbaaoud, known as Abou Omar, was the principal commander of future attacks in Europe,\u201d Nicolas Moreau, a French jihadist who was arrested last year, told his French interrogators, according to the report by France\u2019s antiterror police. \u201cHe was in charge of vetting the applications of future candidates.\u201dIn an audio recording released on Sept. 22, 2014, Mr. Adnani, the ISIS spokesman and chief of the external operations wing, addressed the West.The low potency of these attacks, with single-digit death tolls, combined with the fact that many of the perpetrators had a history of mental illness, prompted analysts and officials to conclude that the Islamic State remained a distant second to Al Qaeda in its ability to carry out attacks on Western soil.Experts now believe that the Islamic State was actually adopting a strategy first put forward by an earlier operations leader for Al Qaeda, who argued that the group would become obsolete if it worked only on 9/11-size plots that took months or years to mount. He instead called for Al Qaeda to also carry out a patter of small- and medium-size plots, and to use propaganda to inspire self-directed attacks by supporters overseas.The Islamic State quotes the blog, explaining that the terror group adopted the system to give recruits \u201ccomplete tactical autonomy,\u201d with few fingerprints that could be tracked back to the group, and \u201cno micromanaging.\u201dBy early 2015, the Islamic State\u2019s external operations branch had personnel dedicated to spending their days in Internet cafes in Syria pumping out propaganda, aimed both at inciting lone-wolf attacks and at luring new recruits.Among the people who took the bait was Reda Hame, the young technology professional from Paris, who later told investigators that he had joined in hope of fighting to bring down President Bashar al-Assad of Syria. Instead, upon arriving in Syria in June 2015, he walked directly into the Islamic State\u2019s pipeline for foreign attacks.Days later, a man wearing a mask called Mr. Hame outside, told him to lie down in the bed of a pickup truck and covered him with a tarp. He was warned to keep his eyes lowered and not to look out.They drove at high speed, and when the truck stopped, a fighter speaking Arabic directed him to a sport utility vehicle idling nearby, its tinted windows obscuring its occupants. When Mr. Hame opened the door to the back seat, the driver said, \u201cMonte devant,\u201d French for \u201cGet in the front.\u201dThe driver, Mr. Hame said, was Mr. Abaaoud, by then considered the most wanted terrorist in Europe. As they drove through the Syrian countryside, the future architect of the Paris attacks explained to Mr. Hame that if he faced the enemies of Islam alone, he would receive double the reward in heaven.More than 1,200 people outside of Iraq and Syria have been killed in attacks inspired or coordinated by the Islamic State.\u201cHe asked me if I was interested in going abroad,\u201d Mr. Hame told investigators. \u201cHe said to imagine a rock concert in a European country \u2014 if you were given a weapon, would you be ready to open fire on the crowd?\u201dWhen Mr. Hame reiterated that he wanted to fight the Assad government instead, Mr. Abaaoud became terse. \u201cHe said he would show me those wounded in the war and buildings that had been destroyed, so that I would realize how lucky I was to be sent back to France rather than stay to fight here,\u201d Mr. Hame recounted.Officials have deduced that the footage was filmed between February and September 2015, suggesting the Paris attacks were being planned months before they took place. It is now known that at the same time Mr. Abaaoud was laying the groundwork for the devastating plot, he was recruiting, cajoling and training Mr. Hame and others for smaller, quick-hit attacks.The night they met, Mr. Abaaoud dropped off Mr. Hame at a house in Raqqa with a white gate, according to the transcript. He said he would come for Mr. Hame the next morning, and warned him that if he did not agree to the mission, his passport, which was about to expire, would be given to another recruit who would go to Europe in his place.When Mr. Abaaoud returned the next day, his face was covered with a brown scarf with slits for his eyes. He wore a holstered handgun. \u201cHe told me that he was now going to explain the mission to me,\u201d Mr. Hame said after his arrest, describing how the discussion occurred in the senior operative\u2019s speeding vehicle. \u201cHe told me I didn\u2019t have a lot of time; he said he was just waiting for the confirmation of his emir. I told him that I would go.\u201dMr. Hame said his training began about a 30-minute drive from Raqqa, in a villa that acted as Mr. Abaaoud\u2019s classroom. There, the senior operative demonstrated how to load a Kalashnikov rifle. When Mr. Hame tried, he jammed his thumb in the metal, hurting himself. Mr. Abaaoud made him repeat the exercise again and again.The next day, Mr. Abaaoud drove Mr. Hame to a park covered in dry grass for target practice. Throughout the lesson, Mr. Abaaoud repeatedly lost his temper, annoyed by his recruit\u2019s lack of skill.\u201cHe yelled at me because when I was shooting in volleys, it went into the air,\u201d Mr. Hame recounted. \u201cHe made me practice a lot, to the point that the grass caught fire.\u201dThe instructor appeared even more on edge during the third and final day of Mr. Hame\u2019s military training, when he drew a silhouette on the wall of an abandoned building and demonstrated how to throw a grenade. Inexperienced and struggling in the suffocating heat, Mr. Hame did not throw it far enough and was cut by shrapnel. Only when Mr. Abaaoud saw him bleeding did he relent, driving his student to a nearby clinic to be bandaged.At night, Mr. Hame was dropped off at an apartment in Raqqa that appeared to be a dormitory for members of the external operations branch. One room served as an arsenal, with stacks of suicide belts, jugs of explosives, body armor and combat boots. The other recruits were also French speakers, including a man who said he had been training for eight months. He and Mr. Hame were told to team up by Mr. Abaaoud, who decided to send them back to Europe the same day.They were among the many pawns that Mr. Abaaoud was positioning across the Continent.The final phase of Mr. Hame\u2019s training took place at an Internet cafe in Raqqa, where an Islamic State computer specialist handed him a USB key. It contained CCleaner, a program used to erase a user\u2019s online history on a given computer, as well as TrueCrypt, an encryption program that was widely available at the time and that experts say has not yet been cracked.The external operations unit was on a drive to improve its operational security after months of embarrassing failures.More than a year and a half earlier, the would-be Cannes bomber, Ibrahim Boudina, had tried to erase the previous three days of his search history, according to details in his court record, but the police were still able to recover it. They found that Mr. Boudina had been researching how to connect to the Internet via a secure tunnel and how to change his I.P. address.Though he may have been aware of the risk of discovery, perhaps he was not worried enough.Mr. Boudina had been sloppy enough to keep using his Facebook account, and his voluminous chat history allowed French officials to determine his allegiance to the Islamic State. Wiretaps of his friends and relatives, later detailed in French court records obtained by The Times and confirmed by security officials, further outlined his plot, which officials believe was going to target the annual carnival on the French Riviera.Mr. Hame, in contrast, was given strict instructions on how to communicate. After he used TrueCrypt, he was to upload the encrypted message folder onto a Turkish commercial data storage site, from where it would be downloaded by his handler in Syria. He was told not to send it by email, most likely to avoid generating the metadata that records details like the point of origin and destination, even if the content of the missive is illegible. Mr. Hame described the website as \u201cbasically a dead inbox.\u201dThe ISIS technician told Mr. Hame one more thing: As soon as he made it back to Europe, he needed to buy a second USB key, and transfer the encryption program to it. USB keys are encoded with serial numbers, so the process was not unlike a robber switching getaway cars.\u201cHe told me to copy what was on the key and then throw it away,\u201d Mr. Hame explained. \u201cThat\u2019s what I did when I reached Prague.\u201dMr. Abaaoud was also fixated on cellphone security. He jotted down the number of a Turkish phone that he said would be left in a building in Syria, but close enough to the border to catch the Turkish cell network, according to Mr. Hame\u2019s account. Mr. Abaaoud apparently figured investigators would be more likely to track calls from Europe to Syrian phone numbers, and might overlook calls to a Turkish one.Next to the number, Mr. Abaaoud scribbled \u201cDad.\u201dMr. Hame was instructed to make his way back to Paris, employing an itinerary that mimicked the journey of a backpacker on a summer holiday: He was to travel to Istanbul and spend a few days wandering the streets of the tourist district around Taksim Square.Then he was to fly to Prague and buy a Czech SIM card. He would again check into a hotel, pretend to be a tourist and leave quick missed calls on Mr. Abaaoud\u2019s Turkish phone number. The record of the call would be Mr. Abaaoud\u2019s notification of his trainee\u2019s progress. Mr. Hame was expected to repeat the procedure for each leg of his journey, including in Amsterdam and then Brussels, before returning by train to Paris.Once Islamic State leaders knew that Mr. Hame had made it home, they would use the encryption and the Turkish drop box to coordinate further instructions, he said.The mission began on the morning of June 12, when Mr. Abaaoud drove Mr. Hame and a second recruit to the Turkish border. Both had USB keys with TrueCrypt, and each was handed \u20ac2,000, in \u20ac500 bills, Mr. Hame said. Both had the same general agenda \u2014 to hit a soft target in Europe \u2014 but they were instructed to take separate paths, with Mr. Hame returning to France while the second recruit was headed to Spain.But Mr. Hame\u2019s comrade was picked up after he flew to Spain, and under interrogation, he divulged Mr. Hame\u2019s plan as well. After being notified, the French police tracked Mr. Hame to his mother\u2019s apartment in Paris. Behind a couch, they found his USB stick from the Islamic State, and in his bag a piece of paper showing his login credentials for TrueCrypt. They arrested and began interrogating him last August, almost three months to the day before the worst terrorist attack in French history.In many ways, it was another clear failure for the Islamic State\u2019s operational security. Mr. Hame agreed to cooperate with investigators, and confirmed that the group was bent on attacking in Europe and was already interested in picking out a concert hall to strike.Yet many aspects of the group\u2019s security protocol were working. In the end, Mr. Hame had few specifics he could share with the authorities. He did not know the names or even the nationalities of the other operatives he had met; they had been introduced to him only by their aliases.Though they failed, the thwarted plots kept counterterrorism officials stretched thin in the months before the November attacks in Paris.\u201cIt served to put all of our agencies on edge,\u201d said France\u2019s chief antiterrorism judge, Marc Tr\u00e9vidic, who debriefed Mr. Hame, Mr. Ghlam and Mr. Khazzani before retiring last summer. \u201cJust like a smoke screen, it allowed them to calmly prepare.\u201dThe white explosive powder was found in the suicide belts of the Paris attackers and in the suitcases of the Brussels bombers, as well as in two other ISIS-led plots in 2014 and 2015.TATP has become terrorists\u2019 go-to explosive in Europe because the main ingredients, acetone and hydrogen peroxide, can be found in common household goods like nail polish remover and hair bleach, experts say.But while the building blocks are easy to come by, TATP is difficult to make, because the ingredients are unstable once combined and can easily detonate if they are mishandled. Over at least two years, Islamic State operatives were working to get it right.The three bombs found in Mr. Boudina\u2019s building near Cannes in 2014 were beverage cans filled with the explosive powder and wrapped in black tape, according to the French court filing in the case.Though he had successfully cooked the explosive, Mr. Boudina was still struggling to set it off. He had jammed a filament into a cavity in the body of each can, most likely to use as a crude fuse, investigators concluded. However, the online searches he had conducted on his laptop just before his arrest indicated that he did not know how to make the final component. He searched \u201chow to make a remote detonator,\u201d \u201cdetonation by cellphone,\u201d and finally \u201cwhere to buy firecrackers?\u201dBy comparison, the team sent from Syria to carry out the Paris assaults in November had ironed out the final details.Two months before those attacks, the man suspected of handling logistics for the assailants, Salah Abdeslam, stopped by a fireworks shop northeast of Paris to buy a mechanism used to detonate fireworks from a distance, according to the French prosecutor. The Firework Magician shop\u2019s in-house lawyer, Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Zajac, remembered little about the young man with a Belgian accent, except that \u201cunlike other clients, he didn\u2019t ask questions about how it all worked.\u201dThe attackers he had been helping successfully detonated their suicide belts in seven locations in Paris, indicating that the group had mastered both how to mix the compound and how to set it off.That network stretched like a web across Europe to at least a dozen other accomplices, including a cell holed up in an apartment in the Brussels neighborhood of Schaerbeek, where two other teams of Islamic State fighters prepared the bombs detonated last week in Brussels Airport and a metro station.That marked another level of achievement in making the explosive: The higher the volume of TATP, the more volatile it becomes.The one thing the attackers had not thought of was that the taxi they called to take them to the airport had room for only three suitcases, so they abandoned the fourth upstairs, Mr. Moniquet said.The driver could not help but notice a strong odor wafting into the taxi from the sealed trunk.An article last Tuesday about the ways in which the Islamic State built its terrorist machine to attack Europe referred incorrectly to information about its planning that the group posted on Dar al-Islam, its online French magazine. As the Islamic State noted in its post, the information came from a study first published on the French security blog kurultay.fr; it was not the Islamic State\u2019s original explanation about its tactics in planning terrorist attacks.Reporting was contributed by David E. Sanger and Eric Schmitt from Washington, Laure Fourquet and Aurelien Breeden from Paris, Katrin Bennhold from London, Andrew Higgins from Brussels, and Runa Sandvik from New York.

{"Headline": "With \u2018Smog Jog\u2019 Through Beijing, Zuckerberg Stirs Debate on Air Pollution", "Date": "2016-03-18", "News": "Supported bySinosphereHONG KONG \u2014 A morning run can be the perfect way to overcome jet lag, but usually not when it\u2019s through the choking haze of auto exhaust and industrial discharge.In a photo accompanying the post, made about 10:30 a.m., Mr. Zuckerberg smiles alongside several running companions in front of the famous portrait of Mao Zedong that overlooks Tiananmen Square. The color of the sky was the sort of gray hue that indicates a bad pollution day. The faint smell of something burning hung in the air. Many children on buses, or scooting to school with their parents or nannies, wore face masks. In homes and offices, air purifiers were cranked up to the highest setting.The background for the photo of Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s run, directly in front of the Forbidden City at the center of Beijing, is normally public-relations friendly. But by ignoring the air quality, Mr. Zuckerberg inadvertently stirred an online debate about China\u2019s major air pollution problems.On Facebook, responses to Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s run ran the gamut from mocking to genuinely concerned about his health.One user, Christina Tan, sought to warn Mr. Zuckerberg: \u201cMark, don\u2019t u see the air pollution? Stop running outside! Beijing is my home, but I\u2019m not recommending you run outside.\u201dAlthough some noted he should have worn a face mask, others joked about his ability to access Facebook despite the Chinese government\u2019s cracking down on ways to get around the so-called Great Firewall, which keeps Chinese users cordoned off from the wider Internet.Others simply took umbrage with where the photo was staged, at the heart of Tiananmen Square.\u201cThe floor you stepped has been covered by blood from students who fought for democracy. But, enjoy your running in China, Mark. :),\u201d wrote a user named Cao Yuzhou.On Twitter, that sentiment was reflected in an image in which Mr. Zuckerberg had been photoshopped in place of the famous \u201ctank man\u201d in front of a line of tanks from the 1989 military crackdown on the student-led protests in Tiananmen Square.Within China, news of Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s run was quickly picked up by the tech media. On China\u2019s Weibo, the microblogging service, Chinese users were as sarcastic as those on Facebook. Austin Ramzy contributed reporting from Hong Kong.

{"Headline": "The Falafel King of Astoria", "Date": "2016-03-11", "News": "Supported byCharacter StudyOnce upon a time there was a big, jovial king in Queens whose subjects lined up at his falafel cart in Astoria.The lines were long, the portions were big and the cart owner \u2014 Freddy Zeideia, the Falafel King of Astoria \u2014 had an outsize personality to go along with his huge frame.But alas, the king\u2019s kitchen was tiny, and he always dreamed of opening up his own Middle Eastern restaurant in the neighborhood he called \u201cmy comfort zone.\u201dSo when a chicken shop went dark last year on Broadway near 31st Street, a block from his longtime cart location at 30th Street, Mr. Zeideia pounced.He renovated the place and six weeks ago opened a restaurant, also called the King of Falafel & Shawarma, with kitchen, storage and serving space that is comparatively vast.\u201cThis grill is the size of my entire cart,\u201d he said on Tuesday at the new place, which has a dozen tables and wall murals of Manhattan (as seen from Queens) and Jerusalem.On the back wall, his restaurant logo includes images of his food carts.Mr. Zeideia is offering the same dishes that were honored twice in 2010 at the annual street food competition known as the Vendy Awards.Mr. Zeideia, a Palestinian immigrant, said that when he first opened a cart in 2002, a block from the Broadway stop on the N train, he chose his business name because \u201cI knew everyone in the area, so people would say, \u2018Freddy, you\u2019re the king of the neighborhood.\u2019\u201dHe used his mother\u2019s recipes and was known for wearing rubber clogs and a chef\u2019s outfit adorned with funky prints.Customers enjoyed the oval-shaped falafel balls with homemade tahini sauce, as well as the shawarma pita made of grilled marinated chicken or lamb and beef, topped with pickled turnips, lettuce and onions, on homemade pita bread.Mr. Zeideia would banter with passers-by. He would crank up the Middle Eastern music and belly dance for his customers, who would often eat in his dining section: a row of mismatched chairs he would set up in an adjacent supermarket parking lot.He became known for his favorite tagline \u2014 \u201cYeah, baby!\u201d \u2014 as he served customers, and for the bright green truck he acquired several years back as a rolling kitchen, to expand at the Astoria location.At his new restaurant, those playful elements live on.

{"Headline": "John Kasich Enlists Two Operatives to Wrangle Delegates", "Date": "2016-03-29", "News": "MADISON, Wis. \u00e2\u0080\u0094 Gov. John Kasich\u2019s only hope for the Republican presidential nomination rests on an extraordinary turn of events at the party\u00e2\u0080\u0099s convention. To that end, his campaign has enlisted two experienced political hands to lead its work.The operatives, Michael Biundo and Andrew Boucher, will guide the campaign\u00e2\u0080\u0099s efforts in the delegate selection process as well as preparing for the convention, to be held in July in Cleveland. Their work includes targeting delegates pledged to other candidates, such as Senator Marco Rubio of Florida.Mr. Biundo was a senior adviser for the presidential campaign of Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky, and he was campaign manager in 2012 for the presidential bid of former Senator Rick Santorum of Pennsylvania. Mr. Boucher served as national political director for Mr. Santorum\u00e2\u0080\u0099s 2012 bid.Both had previously signed on to advise Mr. Kasich. In recent weeks, they built a team of operatives around the country, according to the Kasich campaign.Mr. Kasich has prevailed in only one nominating contest thus far, the primary in his home state, Ohio. But he has held an edge over Hillary Clinton in national polls, and his team is betting that his apparent strength in a general election contest, as well as his experience as a congressman and as Ohio\u00e2\u0080\u0099s governor, will be attractive to delegates. If no candidate achieves a majority in the first round of voting at the convention, many of the bound delegates will be free to support another candidate.A spokesman for Mr. Kasich, Mike Schrimpf, said that as the convention draws closer, \u00e2\u0080\u009cmore and more of the delegates are going to focus on who can actually win in November.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00e2\u0080\u009cThat is going to be a very, very good discussion to have Governor Kasich in the middle of,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Schrimpf said.Electability is an issue that Mr. Kasich likes to bring up with voters, as he did on Monday at a town-hall-style event near La Crosse, Wis.\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat good does it do to win a primary in a narrow way and get your brains beat out in a general if you want to elect a president?\u201d he said. Later Monday, at a town-hall-style event here, Mr. Kasich said two factors should matter to delegates at the convention: the ability to win in November and the ability to do the job of president. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe have one person with no political experience at all that says everything\u00e2\u0080\u0099s going to be great,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Kasich said, alluding to Donald J. Trump.  Then he alluded to Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, likening him to Barack Obama in 2008. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd the other one, let me tell you, the Republican Party and the conservative commentators have talked for seven years about electing a first-term United States senator who hadn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t accomplished anything,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Kasich said, adding that the crowd could complete that thought.\u00e2\u0080\u009cI think there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a possibility of convincing people about who can win and who can serve,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Kasich added, \u00e2\u0080\u009cand that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s why I stay.\u201d\n\t\tFirst Draft provides fast-paced and comprehensive coverage of politics and elections by The New York Times.

{"Headline": "Fasting Diets Are Gaining Acceptance", "Date": "2016-03-07", "News": "\u00e2\u0080\u009cOnce you get used to it, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not a big deal,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Dr. Mattson, chief of the institute\u00e2\u0080\u0099s laboratory of neurosciences. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not hungry at all in the morning, and this is other people\u00e2\u0080\u0099s experience as well. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s just a matter of getting adapted to it.\u00e2\u0080\u009dIn a culture in which it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s customary to eat three large meals a day while snacking from morning to midnight, the idea of regularly skipping meals may sound extreme. But in recent years intermittent fasting has been gaining popular attention and scientific endorsement.\u00e2\u0080\u009cFrom an evolutionary perspective, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s pretty clear that our ancestors did not eat three meals a day plus snacks,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Dr. Mattson said.Across the world, millions of people fast periodically for religious and spiritual reasons. But some are now looking at the practice as a source of health and longevity.Dr. Longo said the health benefits of fasting might result from the fact that fasting lowers insulin and another hormone called insulinlike growth factor, or IGF-1, which is linked to cancer and diabetes. Lowering these hormones may slow cell growth and development, which in turn helps slow the aging process and reduces risk factors for disease.\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhen you have low insulin and low IGF-1, the body goes into a state of maintenance, a state of standby,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Dr. Longo said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThere is not a lot of push for cells to grow, and in general the cells enter a protected mode.\u00e2\u0080\u009dCritics say that health benefits or not, various forms of intermittent fasting are too impractical for most people.The 5:2 diet, for example, advocates eating without restrictions for five days and then consuming just 500 calories \u00e2\u0080\u0094 roughly the equivalent of a light meal \u00e2\u0080\u0094 on each of the other two days of the week. Another regimen, called alternate-day fasting, involves eating no more than 500 calories every other day.The scientific community remains divided about the value of intermittent fasting. Critics say that the science is not yet strong enough to justify widespread recommendations for fasting as a way to lose weight or boost health, and that most of the evidence supporting it comes from animal research. Advocates say the body of research on intermittent fasting is growing rapidly and indicates that the health benefits are striking.\u00e2\u0080\u009cMost people who do this understand that it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not about binge eating,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Dr. Dubost said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBut they like that it gives them the freedom not to worry about calories, carbs and other restrictions on days when they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not fasting.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00e2\u0080\u009cWe\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve run close to 700 people through various trials,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Dr. Varady said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe thought people would overeat on their feast days to compensate. But people for some reason, regardless of their body weight, can only eat about 10 or 15 percent more than usual. They don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t really overeat, and I think that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s why this works.\u00e2\u0080\u009dAfter six months, both groups had lost weight. But the intermittent fasting group lost slightly more \u00e2\u0080\u0094 about 14 pounds on average \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and had greater reductions in belly fat. They also retained more muscle and had greater improvements in blood sugar regulation.Dr. Mattson\u00e2\u0080\u0099s interest in intermittent fasting grew out of work on animals that showed that alternate-day fasting protected mice from strokes, Alzheimer\u00e2\u0080\u0099s and Parkinson\u00e2\u0080\u0099s disease, and consistently extended their life spans by 30 percent. Dr. Mattson and his colleagues found that alternate-day fasting increased the production of proteins that protect brain cells, enhancing their ability to repair damaged DNA. Fasting, he said, acts as a mild stress that makes cells throughout the body stronger, shoring up their ability to adapt to later insults.In this way, intermittent fasting is like exercise, which causes immediate stress and inflammation, but protects against chronic disease in the long run. Eating fruits and vegetables may have a similar effect. While very large doses of antioxidants can cause cancer in humans, moderate amounts of exposure can make cells more resilient, Dr. Mattson said.\u00e2\u0080\u009cThere is overlap between the way cells respond to exercise, to fasting, and even to exposure to some of the chemicals in fruits and vegetables,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he added.Dr. Mattson is now starting a rigorous clinical trial of people 55 to 70 years old who are prediabetic and at high risk for developing Alzheimer\u00e2\u0080\u0099s disease. He plans to study whether intermittent fasting may slow cognitive decline.Dr. David Ludwig, a professor of nutrition at the Harvard T. H. Chan School of Public Health, said one benefit of fasting is that it forces the body to shift from using glucose for fuel to using fat. During this process, the fat is converted to compounds known as ketones, a \u00e2\u0080\u009cclean\u00e2\u0080\u009d energy source that burns more efficiently than glucose, like high-octane gasoline, Dr. Ludwig said.\u00e2\u0080\u009cThere are extensive reports of children who had debilitating seizures who were cured on ketogenic diets,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Dr. Ludwig said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIf it benefits the brain to prevent seizures, then maybe it benefits the brain in other ways.\u00e2\u0080\u009dDr. Ludwig noted that the long-term effectiveness of fasting had not been well studied. He cautioned that for many people, fasting is simply too difficult and may slow metabolism. A potentially more practical approach is to limit sugar and other processed carbohydrates, replacing them with natural fats, protein and unrefined carbohydrates, he said.\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt takes a very disciplined person to skip a couple meals every day,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he added.But Dr. Mattson, who has been skipping meals for decades, said the adjustment to skipping breakfast and lunch was a lot like the change that occurs when a couch potato starts exercising.\u00e2\u0080\u009cIf you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been sedentary for years and then you go out and try to run five miles, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not going to feel very good until you get in shape,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009c It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not going to be a smooth transition right away. It takes two weeks to a month to adapt.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n            Tell us about it.

Mr. Ryan, who represents a Wisconsin district, has repeatedly said he isn\u2019t interested in the nomination. Mr. Walker said that he will likely make an endorsement in the coming days, before his state\u2019s April 5 primary, which is now seen as a crucial battle in efforts by those wishing to halt Mr. Trump\u2019s march to the nomination. Mr. Walker also said that though Senator Ted Cruz of Texas and Mr. Trump each have the ability to capture the nomination at this point, this is not true of the third hopeful, Gov. John Kasich of Ohio, who has only won his home state and therefore lags far behind the other two men in delegates. It would be surprising, based on what he said, if Mr. Walker decides to endorse Mr. Trump. And he said he hears frequently from people close to Mr. Cruz and Mr. Kasich, but not Mr. Trump. \u201cIn fact, I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know, other than the candidate, what kind of infrastructure, if anything, they have here, which is similar to what I hear from others around the country,\u201d Mr. Walker said about Mr. Trump\u2019s team.\n\t\tFirst Draft provides fast-paced and comprehensive coverage of politics and elections by The New York Times.

{"Headline": "If Jack Dorsey Has a Problem Child Among His 2 Companies, It Isn\u2019t Square", "Date": "2016-03-09", "News": "Supported byFor months, a prime question facing Jack Dorsey has been how he will juggle being the chief executive of two complicated companies he helped found \u2014 Square, the recently public mobile-payments company, and Twitter, the ailing social network in search of new users.It looks as if leading Square may be giving Mr. Dorsey a bit less difficulty than rejuvenating Twitter.\u201cAs long as the business is growing and the numbers are like what we saw today, his two jobs are not going to be a concern,\u201d Gil Luria, managing director at Wedbush Securities, said of Mr. Dorsey and Square. \u201cIt might be an issue for Twitter investors, but not for Square investors.\u201dMr. Dorsey has repeatedly said that he splits his time between his companies, meeting with executives from Square and Twitter every Monday. He said he maintained a strict schedule thereafter, with checkpoints on Wednesday and Friday to keep him on track throughout the week.\u201cI can split my time and be present at both companies every single day,\u201d Mr. Dorsey said in an interview on Wednesday, noting that Square and Twitter are across the street from each other. \u201cIt\u2019s not something I stress out about.\u201dIn 2016, seven I.P.O.s have been made from across all industries, the least since 2009, according to data compiled by Dealogic. The dearth is largely because of volatile markets that make pricing and selling new shares more difficult. In the meantime, investor attitudes have grown more conservative.\u201cIf you look over the past few years at a lot of recent tech I.P.O.s, there was an almost myopic focus on growth,\u201d said Josh Beck, a research analyst for Pacific Crest Securities. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen a correction and a different focus in the last year. Now everyone is really looking for a path to profitability.\u201dSquare executives said on Wednesday that they were also looking for it to become profitable and that they expect to reach that goal this year. While the company\u2019s net loss in the fourth quarter widened to $80.5 million from $37.1 million a year earlier, that was largely because of a one-time charge.And there were high points. Square processed $10.2 billion in global payments, up 47 percent from a year ago. Its software and services businesses \u2014 like Caviar, Payroll and Appointments, which are offered to small businesses with Square\u2019s core payments processing \u2014 are also growing at a healthy clip, generating $22 million in fourth-quarter revenue, more than triple from a year earlier.Square is also bullish on Square Capital, its cash-advance program for small businesses, which is another high growth area. Square said it made $150 million in cash advances in the fourth quarter through Square Capital; the company earns a fixed fee on each advance.Perhaps what investors appreciate most about Mr. Dorsey\u2019s leadership at Square are his choices in executive staff. He has brought in former Facebook, Amazon and Google executives. Wall Street particularly praises Square\u2019s chief financial officer, Sarah Friar, a former Goldman Sachs technology analyst.\u201cIt\u2019s very important given this arrangement to have someone like that that provides another important layer of leadership,\u201d Mark Palmer, a financial analyst at BTIG LLC, said of Ms. Friar. \u201cFrankly Square is wise to highlight her role. It\u2019s not just Jack out there.\u201dLeslie Picker contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Talking Abortion, Donald Trump Gives Rivals on Both Sides Fresh Fodder", "Date": "2016-03-31", "News": "Every day, it seems that Donald J. Trump must soon run out of ways to counteract negative perceptions of his campaign. And yet, he has continued to find new ones, as he did on Wednesday. In a town-hall-style forum with Chris Matthews of MSNBC, Mr. Trump, a late-in-life convert to an anti-abortion view, said that he believed, should a ban be put in place on the procedure, that women who get one should face a \u00e2\u0080\u009cpunishment\u00e2\u0080\u009d of as-yet-undetermined length. The uproar was swift and extensive, as Democrats condemned the remarks as dangerous, and anti-abortion campaigners said that Mr. Trump had misstated their goals. Mr. Trump, who almost never admits an error, did not quite do so in this case, although he reversed course with a statement that offered a new position: He said abortion practitioners would be the ones to face a penalty, not the women receiving the abortions. He also insisted his position had not changed. The episode created fresh fodder for his Democratic rival Hillary Clinton, who has been looking for ways to criticize Mr. Trump on policy without having the fight devolve into personal attacks. It also created a line of attack for his Republican opponents, who are hoping to slow him in the Wisconsin primary on Tuesday. And it raised new questions about Mr. Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s readiness for prime time as he leads the pack for the Republican nomination. Before the abortion dispute, Mr. Trump had been addressing questions in another potentially damaging episode, spending 24 hours defending his campaign manager, Corey Lewandowski, who has been charged with battery for grabbing a former reporter for the conservative website Breitbart News. Despite a videotape showing that Mr. Lewandowski had grabbed the reporter, Michelle Fields, Mr. Trump insisted that the tape showed nothing and rejected questions about why his campaign manager was putting his hands on people. Mr. Trump will now take two days off the campaign trail, before a final push in Wisconsin.

{"Headline": "Warning of U.S. Attacks, Donald Trump Advocates Allowing Torture", "Date": "2016-03-22", "News": "On Fox News, Mr. Trump said, \u201cThis is a story that seems to be more and more happening.\u201d He described Brussels, even before the attacks, as \u201can armed camp,\u201d although he did not elaborate on what he was referring to and wasn\u2019t pressed.The CBS News anchors pressed Mr. Trump about whether he was calling for a form of racial profiling, as he repeatedly suggested the attackers have come from Muslim-heavy countries. Pointing to the shooters in the Paris terrorist attacks last fall, Mr. Trump said, \u201cThey weren\u2019t exactly from Sweden that did the shootings.\u201dOn the \u201cToday\u201d show on NBC, Mr. Trump, who has been criticized for such statements in the past and has tried to clarify his views on torture before, said that he would favor methods such as waterboarding to extract information from suspects believed to be involved in attacks.\u201cIf it was up to me and if we changed the laws and have the laws, waterboarding would be fine,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cIf they could expand the laws I would do a lot more than waterboarding.\u201d He questioned how some people photographed migrating from Syria to Europe were seen holding cellphones, and wondered who paid those bills.\u201cThere\u2019s no assimilation. They are not assimilating and they are not assimilating in other locations, either,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cThey want to go by Sharia law. They don\u2019t want laws that we have. They want Sharia law.  And you know you say to yourself, at what point how much of this do you take?\u201dBelgian officials have said little about who perpetrated the attacks and how many people were involved. But Mr. Trump, pushed by the Fox News anchors to question whether people who had ascribed racism to his proposed Muslim ban were wrong, called for tighter borders with regard to Muslim immigrants.\u201cYou have to be very vigilant as to who you have and where you\u2019re coming from,\u201d Mr. Trump said, adding, \u201cThe assimilation is very, very difficult and, in some cases, impossible.\u201d Muslims, he said, \u201chave to become part of the community.\u201dThe twin attacks came several hours before two Republican nominating contests in the presidential race to succeed President Obama. Mr. Trump\u2019s calls for tighter borders helped propel him to the top of a divided and crowded Republican field over the last several months.Mr. Trump, on Fox News, said that things are \u201cnot gonna change. It\u2019s not gonna get better.\u201d  His message to the United States, he said, is \u201cwe better get smart and we better get smart fast.\u201d As president, he added, he would give a \u201cpep talk\u201d to rally spirit after such a dangerous moment. \n\t\tFirst Draft provides fast-paced and comprehensive coverage of politics and elections by The New York Times.

{"Headline": "The B.D.S. Movement and Anti-Semitism on Campus", "Date": "2016-03-29", "News": "Supported byOp-Ed ContributorTHE casual consumer of campus-related news might be forgiven for assuming that anti-Semitic intimidation is breaking out all over. Where I teach, at Brooklyn College of the City University of New York, arguments over a proposed event or demonstration regarding Israel and Palestine appear every few months, and sometimes turn ugly.In 2013, some Jewish students were forced out of a lecture sponsored by Students for Justice in Palestine. Just recently, a few members of the same organization broke up a faculty council meeting with demands that included barring \u201cZionists\u201d from the campus.At private colleges and universities, pressure to suppress pro-boycott activities is usually administered quietly by donors or alumni and rarely makes the news. But at publicly funded institutions, boycott-related arguments often inspire politicians to try to legislate punishment if the school refuses to shut them down.Anti-Semitism is no doubt a problem on many college campuses. And the boycott Israel movement \u2014 which has inspired these arguments \u2014 is tainted with it. I have long been a vocal B.D.S. opponent at CUNY and helped to found a national organization of academics to fight it, and I\u2019ve experienced the nastiness firsthand. Still, as obnoxious as some of its followers can be, the boycott movement on campus is thriving not because of, but in spite of, the anti-Semitism of some of its adherents.But contrary to what the state senators claimed, CUNY administrators did not ignore the accusations. They hired two former federal prosecutors to examine the complaints of anti-Semitism and \u201crecommend appropriate action.\u201d CUNY has also established a working group to go over its policies relating to the boundaries of acceptable speech. Abraham Foxman, the former director of the Anti-Defamation League and an alumnus of CUNY, has praised the university\u2019s handling of these isolated incidents. And, to borrow a phrase, when it comes to anti-Semitism, if Abe Foxman is not worried, I\u2019m not worried.Moreover, the notion that the people behind the worst of this behavior are anything but a loud and obnoxious minority is belied by the reality of everyday life on campus. Aside from Facebook and Twitter posts, where anonymity often invites abuse, I\u2019ve never heard a single anti-Semitic syllable uttered on any CUNY campus in the dozen years I\u2019ve been on the faculty. My classes on Jewish history and culture often discuss extremely delicate questions of Jewish identity without anyone, Jew or gentile, evincing the slightest discernible discomfort. (Well, one traditionally Orthodox undergraduate once called Woody Allen and Philip Roth \u201cworse than the goyim.\u201d)The notion that politicians can demand that a university prohibit certain types of political speech it finds politically distasteful by threatening its funding not only makes martyrs of those whom it seeks to silence, it also bespeaks a lack of confidence both in its own beliefs and in the value of reason itself.The rabbinic sage Yossi Ben Zimra would recognize these campaigns as so much motzira-making, or malicious gossip. Regarding CUNY, I\u2019d call it shameful to see such tactics deployed against so proud and significant an institution in the history of American Jews, and now an invaluable educational lifeline to millions of recent immigrants and hardworking, largely low-income students.By protecting the right to free speech and expression, while simultaneously demanding civility and respectful discourse on all sides, universities can take care of these problems without political threats that undermine the very purpose of the university itself.Eric Alterman is a professor of English and journalism at Brooklyn College, a columnist for The Nation and a senior fellow at the Center for American Progress.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Israeli Court Strikes Down Natural Gas Development Deal", "Date": "2016-03-27", "News": "Supported byThe gas trove, called Leviathan, has the potential to transform Israel into an exporter of the fuel, but it has been plagued by delays.Justice Elyakim Rubinstein, the court\u2019s deputy president, said that the government did not have the authority to make such a long-term deal, which would bind its successors, especially \u201cwhen the issue at hand is a matter of real political controversy.\u201dThe court gave the government a year to work out an alternative solution, but that may lead to further delays in developing the field, which was discovered in 2010.Noble Energy, based in Houston, has already reached preliminary agreements to export gas from Leviathan to Egypt and Jordan. The Obama administration has enthusiastically supported these efforts in the hope that energy ties would help build peaceful relations between Israel and its neighbors in the Middle East.Plans to bring Leviathan\u2019s gas to market have been slowed by a series of roadblocks, including a decision in 2014 by Israel\u2019s antitrust commissioner that Noble and its partners would have too much power over the Israeli energy market. That ruling led Mr. Netanyahu to devise a deal under which Noble and its partners would divest part of their Israeli holdings, but now the court has objected to that arrangement.Predictably, the Israeli government reacted with dismay to the court decision.\u201cThe High Court of Justice decision severely threatens the development of the gas reserves of the State of Israel,\u201d Mr. Netanyahu said in a statement. \u201cCertainly, nobody has any reason to celebrate that the gas is liable to remain in the depths of the sea and that hundreds billions of shekels will not reach the citizens of Israel.\u201dMr. Netanyahu also said that Israel was \u201cseen as a state with excessive judicial interference in which it is difficult to do business.\u201dFor many Israelis, however, the benefits of a surging natural gas industry are outweighed by concerns that Noble and its partners were becoming too powerful.\u201cThe judges chose today to protect the separation of powers and the rule of law in Israel, to halt the limitless recklessness for the benefit of the gas tycoons, and to put up a glowing stop sign in order to defend the public and Israeli democracy,\u201d Shelly Yachimovich, a lawmaker from the center-left Zionist Union group, wrote on her Facebook page on Sunday.Isabel Kershner reported from Jerusalem, and Stanley Reed from London.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "G.O.P. Legislators Face New Pressure to Decide: Can They Get Behind Trump?", "Date": "2016-02-29", "News": "Supported byRather than unify, Republicans are feeling increasing pressure to align themselves with traditional conservatism or ride the wave of resentment toward it that has led many voters Mr. Trump\u2019s way.\u201cI told Donald Trump, \u2018This isn\u2019t a campaign, this is a movement,\u2019\u00a0\u201d Senator Jeff Sessions, Republican of Alabama, told a large crowd of supporters Sunday when he became the first senator to endorse the businessman.But Senator Ben Sasse, the freshman Republican from Nebraska, countered on Facebook: \u201cPlease understand: I\u2019m not an establishment Republican, and I will never support Hillary Clinton. I\u2019m a movement conservative who was elected over the objections of the G.O.P. establishment. My current answer for who I would support in a hypothetical matchup between Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton is: Neither of them.\u201dWhile many senators are waiting for the results of the primaries on Tuesday to endorse Mr. Trump, renounce him or reserve the right to remain silent, many are privately pondering which camp to join. There is no playbook for the choice they face. In the last half-century, no prospective Republican front-runner at this stage has been the object of such intraparty animus.Some members say they are merely reflecting their constituents\u2019 views. \u201cI come from an interesting rural county with a lot of Rust Belt union folks, and Donald Trump is truly resonating through western New York,\u201d said Representative Chris Collins, one of a handful of House Republicans who have endorsed the front-runner. \u201cIt starts first and foremost with the leader who is going to make our borders safe again, and some of the rhetoric, he realizes, he now has to moderate.\u201dBut other leading Republicans are saying a Trump nomination could hurt Republicans running for re-election in swing states. \u201cWe can\u2019t have a nominee be an albatross around the down-ballot races,\u201d Senator John Cornyn of Texas, the No. 2 Republican in the Senate, told CNN on Monday. \u201cThat\u2019s a concern of mine.\u201d\u201cJust as the burden is on the establishment to understand that Trump will likely be the nominee,\u201d said Newt Gingrich, the former House speaker and presidential candidate, \u201cso is the burden on Trump to understand that establishment doesn\u2019t have to support him.\u201dMr. Sessions has never been a leader of a large faction on Capitol Hill, and indeed on Monday he seemed to back away slightly from his fulsome endorsement, urging Mr. Trump to denounce white supremacists after the billionaire businessman initially declined to criticize David Duke, the former Ku Klux Klan leader.But in at least one important area, immigration, Mr. Sessions and Mr. Trump are closely aligned. The senator has made it almost a single-minded pursuit to thwart any overhaul of the nation\u2019s immigration laws that he deems \u201camnesty,\u201d and he served as a one-man wrecking crew in 2006, 2007 and 2013 when Congress pursued changes to immigration laws. That role alone has made him a power broker in an election cycle in which Mr. Trump has soared in part because of his anti-immigration statements.More Republicans, like Senators Jeff Flake of Arizona and Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, have been vocal critics of Mr. Trump, and former Senator Tom Coburn of Oklahoma, a staunch fiscal conservative, added his voice on Monday.\u201cHe simply lacks the character, skills and policy knowledge to turn his grandiose promises into reality,\u201d he said.Mr. Coburn\u2019s replacement, Senator James Lankford, a former minister, is unlikely to back Mr. Trump, reflecting a possibly growing discomfort with the candidate among religious conservatives even as he so far has won a sizable share of evangelicals\u2019 votes.\u201cI think a lot of people in churches are starting to say, \u2018This guy doesn\u2019t reflect my values,\u2019\u00a0\u201d said Tim Griffin, the lieutenant governor of Arkansas, which holds a primary on Tuesday with polls indicating a close race. \u201cI don\u2019t let my kids watch shows with cussing in them,\u201d he said. \u201cI never thought that would include Donald Trump on C-Span.\u201dRepresentative Mo Brooks, Republican of Alabama, has broken with Mr. Sessions and thrown his support behind Senator Ted Cruz of Texas for the presidential nomination. Mr. Brooks has largely made an economic argument, but has also said he objects to what he characterized as Mr. Trump\u2019s admitted history of adultery.Some members, particularly those in tough re-election fights, are electing to stay vague and elliptical. When asked in a local radio interview Monday about Mr. Trump\u2019s initial reluctance to denounce Mr. Duke, Senator Ron Johnson, Republican of Wisconsin, said more than once that he \u201cprays every night\u201d that the Republican presidential nominee \u201cis a person of integrity, intelligence, ideas, and courage.\u201dFor other members, the balance of the Supreme Court remains a key issue, and on that logic alone they are resisting being too critical of the potential nominee, no matter his flaws.\u201cI\u2019d rather be in our shoes than in Hillary Clinton\u2019s shoes any day of the week,\u201d Mr. Collins said.Worried about the prospects of a negative Trump effect on some House races \u2014 even though gerrymandered districts make it exceedingly unlikely for Republicans to lose the House \u2014 Kevin McCarthy of California, the House majority leader, is advising members to focus on local issues and priorities in their respective districts.\u201cI don\u2019t think there is any pressure in the House,\u201d said Representative Thomas Massie, Republican of Kentucky, who had endorsed Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky. \u201cI think as the winner emerges I think you will see my colleagues in the House starting to endorse the front-runner. But it will be motivated by a desire to get a seat on the bus.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Taking Baby Steps Toward Software That Reasons Like Humans", "Date": "2016-03-06", "News": "Supported byBitsRichard Socher appeared nervous as he waited for his artificial intelligence program to answer a simple question: \u201cIs the tennis player wearing a cap?\u201dThe word \u201cprocessing\u201d lingered on his laptop\u2019s display for what felt like an eternity. Then the program offered the answer a human might have given instantly: \u201cYes.\u201dMr. Socher, who clenched his fist to celebrate his small victory, is the founder of one of a torrent of Silicon Valley start-ups intent on pushing variations of a new generation of pattern recognition software, which, when combined with increasingly vast sets of data, is revitalizing the field of artificial intelligence.MetaMind is now focusing on one of the most daunting challenges facing A.I. software. Computers are already on their way to identifying objects in digital images or converting sounds uttered by human voices into natural language. But the field of artificial intelligence has largely stumbled in giving computers the ability to reason in ways that mimic human thought.Now a variety of machine intelligence software approaches known as \u201cdeep learning\u201d or \u201cdeep neural nets\u201d are taking baby steps toward solving problems like a human.The new research is intriguing because it indicates that steady progress is being made toward \u201cconversational\u201d agents that can interact with humans. The MetaMind results also underscore how far researchers have to go to match human capabilities.Other groups have previously made progress on discrete problems, but generalized systems that approach human levels of understanding and reasoning have not been developed.Five years ago, IBM\u2019s Watson system demonstrated that it was possible to outperform humans on \u201cJeopardy!\u201dLast year, Microsoft developed a \u201cchatbot\u201d program known as Xiaoice (pronounced Shao-ice) that is designed to engage humans in extended conversation on a diverse set of general topics.To add to Xiaoice\u2019s ability to offer realistic replies, the company developed a huge library of human question-and-answer interactions mined from social media sites in China. This made it possible for the program to respond convincingly to typed questions or statements from users.In 2014, computer scientists at Google, Stanford and other research groups made significant advances in what is described as \u201cscene understanding,\u201d the ability to understand and describe a scene or picture in natural language, by combining the output of different types of deep neural net programs.These programs were trained on images that humans had previously described. The approach made it possible for the software to examine a new image and describe it with a natural-language sentence.While even machine vision is not yet a solved problem, steady, if incremental, progress continues to be made by start-ups like Mr. Socher\u2019s; giant technology companies such as Facebook, Microsoft and Google; and dozens of research groups.In their recent paper, the MetaMind researchers argue that the company\u2019s approach, known as a dynamic memory network, holds out the possibility of simultaneously processing inputs including sound, sight and text.The design of MetaMind software is evidence that neural network software technologies are becoming more sophisticated, in this case by adding the ability both to remember a sequence of statements and to focus on portions of an image. For example, a question like \u201cWhat is the pattern on the cat\u2019s fur on its tail?\u201d might yield the answer \u201cstripes\u201d and show that the program had focused only on the cat\u2019s tail to arrive at its answer.\u201cAnother step toward really understanding images is, are you actually able to answer questions that have a right or wrong answer?\u201d Mr. Socher said.MetaMind is using the technology for commercial applications like automated customer support, he said. For example, insurance companies have asked if the MetaMind technology could respond to an email with an attached photo \u2014 perhaps of damage to a car or other property \u2014 he said.There is still significant debate within the research community about the best technical approach and even what is the best way to measure progress.In contrast, his laboratory is focusing on creating software that can answer questions taken from standardized elementary school science tests.Advertisement"}

Over the coming days, the group, Priorities USA, will begin making reservations in those states, as well as in Colorado, Iowa, Nevada, New Hampshire and Virginia, said the group\u00e2\u0080\u0099s chief strategist and co-chairman, Guy Cecil. The aggressive move comes as the super PAC looks to the fall and what could be a crowded market of television ad reservations. But it emphasizes a level of preparedness at a time when Republicans remain deeply fractured over their prohibitive front-runner, Donald J. Trump. And while they are sticking with the traditional general election battlegrounds for now, they are leaving open the possibility of expanding to other states. Saying that Republicans have been preparing for a billion-dollar campaign to \u00e2\u0080\u009cdistort Hillary Clinton\u00e2\u0080\u0099s record,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Cecil added, \u00e2\u0080\u009cHillary\u00e2\u0080\u0099s campaign is not taking anything for granted, including the primary, which is why it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s even more important that we prepare for the long road ahead to November.\u00e2\u0080\u009d He added: \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe have learned a valuable lesson from Republicans during the primary.

After some hesitation, many of the technology industry\u2019s biggest names, including Amazon, Facebook, Google, Microsoft, Snapchat and Yahoo, have filed court briefs supporting Apple and challenging the legal foundations of the government\u2019s case.The high commissioner, who usually avoids taking positions aligned with commercial interests, said he felt strongly that American officials needed to weigh the uncertain benefits of gaining access to one phone against the broader effects of breaching personal security.\u201cIn essence, what we have here is an issue of proportionality: In order to possibly \u2014 but by no means certainly \u2014 gain extra information about the dreadful crime committed by Syed Rizwan Farook and his wife in San Bernardino, we may end up enabling a multitude of other crimes all across the world, including in the United States,\u201d he said.The F.B.I. deserves full support in its investigation into the San Bernardino killings, Mr. al-Hussein said, but \u201cthis case is not about a company and its supporters \u2014 seeking to protect criminals and terrorists \u2014 it is about where a key red line necessary to safeguard all of us from criminals and repression should be set.\u201dThe encryption debate was \u201ctoo focused on one side of the security coin, in particular its potential use for criminal purposes in times of terrorism,\u201d Mr. al-Hussein said. \u201cThe other side of the security coin is that weakening encryption protections may bring even bigger dangers to national and international security.\u201dThe high commissioner\u2019s intervention builds on growing awareness and concern among human rights experts about the crucial role of encryption for safeguarding freedom of speech and of opinion.\u201cEncryption and anonymity, separately or together, create a zone of privacy to protect opinion and belief,\u201d David Kaye, a United Nations expert on freedom of expression, said in a report to the United Nations Human Rights Council last year, addressing ways to shield individuals from scrutiny in hostile political, social, religious and legal environments.Advertisement"}

As someone who was in Tower 2 in the 9/11 attacks, I know all too well what it feels like to live in a city under siege, always fearing the next attack.I am saddened that we are in a world that creates people who see no alternative for their lives than to die violently, taking as many innocent people with them as their crude homemade devices will allow.What we all are losing in this battle is our ability to live our lives devoid of fear. There is a lot to be said for being able to go to a park or a concert or the subway and not worry about the potential for violence and bloodshed.I miss the innocence of a pre-9/11 world where that was the norm.

Having grown up in South Florida since 1964, I have had a number of friends and acquaintances who: were \u201cPeter Pan\u201d children; were missing family members unable to leave Cuba; were poor because the Cuban government confiscated all they had earned; were willing to raft to the Florida shore risking their life.I realize that times change, but the government leaders of Cuba essentially have not.The brothers that brought you the Elian Gonzalez debacle, Mariel boatlift, and Communism 90 miles from our border are still in power. Perhaps if they apologized or renounced some of their actions, having our president watch a baseball game with Cuba\u2019s dictator would be marginally acceptable, but that has not happened.As much as I am grateful to be a citizen of the United States of America, I am troubled to see our president smiling and enjoying a game with the same government that caused so much hardship and strife that still exists today in the hearts and minds of good friends and valued neighbors.4. My family and I came to the States from Cuba in 1962 with pretty much nothing. My parents sacrificed and worked hard and they, I, and my three brothers and my sister have done well.With all its \u201cwarts\u201d I still think the U.S. is a place like no other, and I love America.

Mr. Obama\u2019s reaching out is long overdue.That said, what most people don\u2019t understand is that it was most often the Castros who rebuffed efforts at better relations with the U.S. I\u2019m sure they were well aware that more contact with the States would dilute their stranglehold on Cuba and the Cuban people.My theory is that now in their old age, they\u2019ve \u201cgiven up,\u201d have little left to steal from their own people, and know their days on Earth are numbered, so they apparently aren\u2019t as disinclined to improving relations with the U.S. It\u2019s my fervent hope the Cuban people, the true victims of the Castro revolution, will benefit as a result.This comment received 123 reader recommendations.5. So, let me see if I have the Republican strategy straight. \u201cThe people\u201d should have a say in who the next Supreme Court justice is going to be (and therefore Obama\u2019s pick should be blocked), but \u201cthe people\u201d are not allowed to elect the presidential nominee.

I get to, like, travel around, take photos, make workout videos, I walk my dogs.\u201d When she is not working, which she says is almost never, she and Mr. Pearce hang out with her family. \u201cWe watch TV I guess sometimes,\u201d she said, after a pause.Late at night, work done for the day, Ms. Itsines and Mr. Pearce squeezed in a trip to Rockefeller Center, just another young couple doing tourist things, except accompanied by two P.R. people. When they went to take a group photo, the lights went out, ruining the shot. There was nary a whiff of this disappointment on Instagram. Instead, Ms. Itsines posted a photo of her abs, looking even more chiseled than usual. After all, she doesn\u2019t have a sob story.Advertisement"}

According to the court order, these newspapers are accused of disseminating \u201cterrorist propaganda\u201d and aiding terrorist organizations. This has become a convenient catchall accusation for clamping down on government critics.In the past, Zaman and Today\u2019s Zaman supported the Erdogan-led Justice and Development Party\u2019s pro-Western and democracy-oriented policies, as well as its efforts to introduce reforms that would pave the way toward Turkish membership in the European Union. Since the beginning of this decade, however, Mr. Erdogan and his party have become increasingly authoritarian.His sermons were published in Zaman, but Mr. Gulen has no official ties with the media group that owns the newspapers. Yet the court order that enabled the seizure of Zaman and Today\u2019s Zaman argued, without providing any evidence, that Mr. Gulen controlled the newspapers. Many of my colleagues are inspired by his peaceful, moderate teaching \u2014 as are millions of people around the world \u2014 but it is an insult to their intelligence and integrity to suggest they are under his control.This may be the last article I write as the editor in chief of Today\u2019s Zaman, as I objected to the new administration\u2019s censorship on the day they turned Zaman into an official mouthpiece with a pro-government cover article. The world must tell the Erdogan regime that enough is enough.As we saw in the court ruling on Mr. Dundar and Mr. Gul, which came after the American vice president, Joseph R. Biden Jr., expressed support for the two journalists, the international community still has leverage over Turkey. Merely showing concern for press freedom and civil liberties in Turkey while turning a blind eye to violations for the sake of business and regional deals may pay off for now, but unless the West takes firm action to check Mr. Erdogan\u2019s slide into authoritarian rule, it risks losing a stable ally and rare democracy in a Muslim-majority nation.Sevgi Akarcesme is the editor in chief of Today\u2019s Zaman.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Video Review: The BMW 750i xDrive, Tranquillity With a Touch of Vegas", "Date": "2016-03-10", "News": "Supported byDrivenA case could be made that modern automobiles are the most impressive consumer products created. Sophisticated cars contain more than 100 million lines of computer code (apparently all of Facebook comes in at about 60 million), and you probably don\u2019t leave your laptop outside in the rain, snow or blistering heat for days on end. If you do, please write and tell me why.While new owners could easily hop in and drive away without consulting the manual, mastering the features could take a few days. Bullet points include a \u201ctraffic jam assistant\u201d that semiautonomously keeps the car paced and placed within its lane during rush hour.There is night vision should the LED headlamps not be brilliant enough, and an 8-speed transmission that takes cues from GPS to anticipate shift dynamics. Hand gestures can control phone and sound system functions \u2014 usually. I had some hiccups, and I\u2019ll note again that I\u2019m not crazy about BMW\u2019s transmission selector.Ultimately, though, this car is not about gadgetry. For the lucky ones whose garages are graced by this machine, it\u2019s about indulgence. The 750i tranquilly runs with a 4.4-liter, 8-cylinder engine with two twin-scroll turbos tucked in the V. Rich torque helps usher the car from rest to 60 miles an hour in 4.3 seconds.Using GPS, electromechanical dampers and adjustable antiroll bars, BMW\u2019s adaptive suspension provides a serene ride quality. Agility is courtesy of all-wheel steering and the expected BMW chassis tuning.In sport mode, the car feels as if half a ton has been lifted from its 4,600-pound mass, but the sixth-generation 7 Series is no M3, nor is it meant to be one. Please, BMW purists, hold your venomous tongues. Dynamics are impressive and appropriate for this class, which includes the Audi A8 and Mercedes S-Class. Chill out and buy an M235i to romp around in.The 7\u2019s back seat probably has the same volume as an entire 2 Series cabin. All 7 Series brought to the United States are of the long-wheelbase variety (for now, anyway). Equipped with the Executive Seating package, it pampers chief executives with a removable Samsung tablet that controls entertainment and iDrive features. Doing its best Optimus Prime impression, with the push of a button the car can transform its right side into a true first-class experience with a footrest deploying from the front passenger\u2019s seat back. The gyrations of seats, screens and footrest can cause children to go bonkers (adults, too, though they\u2019re loath to admit it).It appears the Bavarians have been visiting Las Vegas. The cabin lighting is mesmerizing. LEDs rim the panoramic roof, illuminating a pattern etched into the glass. A spiral glow graces a speaker in the superb Bowers & Wilkins sound system, proving music can look as good as it sounds. Even people walking by get a taste of the owner\u2019s good fortune; the puddle lamp pattern is a work of modern art.Starting at $82,295 for a 740i ($129,245 as driven), this stealth luxury ride has a polish and depth that demand time to truly grasp. The cabin is stuffed with inlaid wood and offers sumptuous seats. The large key fob has smartphone envy, its touch screen offering information on vehicle range and whether the doors are locked. In other markets, it can dispatch the 7 to saunter off on its own to park. In reality, it may be a chauffeur behind the wheel. Perhaps what BMW has built is the Ultimate Riding-In Machine.Advertisement"}

Apartheid\u2019s ghosts still stalk the land, conjuring dire warnings about its very fabric. For those who yearned for a rainbow nation, it was not supposed to be this way.But, since January, a series of bitter controversies, inspired and sometimes accelerated by social media, have shown that two decades of democracy have muted neither the perception nor the reality of inequality. Long after political power shifted to the majority, time may have instead amplified them.In many ways, the debate is far more nuanced than in the supremacist past, exposing myriad resentments of privilege and entitlement, victimhood and reward, and even raising the question of who may set the racial agenda and on what terms.However, he said, \u201call whites benefited and still benefit from the history of anti-black oppression.\u201d\u201cMany whites are blind to racism\u2019s continued presence,\u201d he added, \u201cand, related to this blindness, many whites rationalize their ignorance by thinking that black people are \u2018race-obsessed.\u2019 \u201dIt is axiomatic, of course, that the question looks different from other perspectives in South Africa\u2019s splintered prism.

Trump was playing at the 12th Republican primary debate on Thursday night. Whether you call it running out the clock, playing keep-away or working the pitcher\u00e2\u0080\u0099s count, Mr. Trump was looking to escape the last face-off before the March 15 states hold their primaries having done as little harm to himself as possible.In last week\u00e2\u0080\u0099s debate, Mr. Trump made an early reference to the size of his genitalia as he fended off attacks from Senators Ted Cruz of Texas and Marco Rubio of Florida. In this contest, he seemed almost sedated as he sought to project an air of seriousness and sobriety. Mr. Trump has scoffed at critics who suggest he should act more presidential, but that appeared to be on his mind at the debate. Gone were the belittling comments about \u00e2\u0080\u009cLittle Marco\u00e2\u0080\u009d and \u00e2\u0080\u009cLyin\u00e2\u0080\u0099 Ted.\u00e2\u0080\u009d He barely acknowledged Gov. John R. Kasich of Ohio.Instead Mr. Trump, the billionaire real-estate developer and reality television star, sought to protect his position as the Republican front-runner and avoid making any memorable errors on policy. He occasionally made candid statements, like when he acknowledged that he might take donations in earnest if he becomes the nominee and give up the partly true claim that he is self-funding his candidacy. And he stood by his statements questioning the Islamic faith, although he declined to repeat what he had said a night earlier, that \u00e2\u0080\u009cIslam hates us.\u00e2\u0080\u009d He said that there are \u00e2\u0080\u009cbad dudes\u00e2\u0080\u009d who protest his rallies, although, despite his own language at his events, he insisted he does not condone violence. The party needs to unify, he said more than once.  As for Mr. Cruz and Mr. Rubio, they too, somewhat inexplicably, stuck to the civil tone of the evening, giving no sense of the urgency of the task of stopping Mr. Trump that they have talked about on the campaign trail. Mr. Rubio, who hopes to have a political future down the road, tried to sound the aspirational notes that his message had before he devolved into a festival of insults with Mr. Trump. Mr. Cruz got in some barbs suggesting that Mr. Trump was more interested in himself than in voters. But they were lines that probably would have been more effective before this late stage of the game. And it is hard to see the debate altering the state of the race.\n\t\tFirst Draft provides fast-paced and comprehensive coverage of politics and elections by The New York Times.

Her neck and wrists were adorned with layers of beaded jewelry.Just a few hours before, she had been wearing jeans, a button-up shirt and stiletto heels.\u00e2\u0080\u009cEven if we don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t speak the language or don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t go to the village every day, we are still African,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Ms. Choumali said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI think it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s time to redefine what being African is.\u00e2\u0080\u009dBut at least once a year, her family would travel to Adaou, a small town in the southeast, to visit her paternal grandmother, Ettien Amalan Louise. The visits were brief, and Ms. Choumali often felt a cultural disconnect with her grandmother: They didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t speak the same language or have relatable life experiences. Ms. Choumali eventually got a top-level job at an ad agency, while her grandmother spent her life in the village working as a farmer and a trader. When her grandmother died in 2001, Ms. Choumali realized how much of her family history would be lost because she had not been able to talk with her about her life. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI felt like a part of me was going and part of my family was fading away,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cFor a long time, I felt guilty. I thought, I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t speak the language, maybe I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not that African.\u00e2\u0080\u009dIn her portrait series, \u00e2\u0080\u009cResilients,\u00e2\u0080\u009d which was recently featured at the Photolux Festival in Lucca, Italy, sponsored by the African Artist Foundation, Ms. Choumali sought to document young, professional African women \u00e2\u0080\u0094 mostly Ivorian \u00e2\u0080\u0094 who also struggled with the lingering guilt of not being able to relate to their family\u00e2\u0080\u0099s traditional past. Over the course of several months, each portrait session required intense research on the specific details of how the clothes, jewelry, skin and hair needed to be styled based on the specific tribe the family was from. She initially found most of her subjects \u00e2\u0080\u0094 lawyers, students, doctors and managers \u00e2\u0080\u0094 on the streets of Abidjan. Her sole requirement for the portrait was that the women had to wear traditional clothing already worn by their grandmother or an older female relative. This was intended to \u00e2\u0080\u009cemphasize the link between past and present, and also the cultural heritage,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Ms. Choumali said. Inspired by the golden hues of Rembrandt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s paintings, she handmade a backdrop to give the portraits a \u00e2\u0080\u009cfeeling of time travel,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said.Ms. Choumali\u00e2\u0080\u0099s interest in portrait photography began when she was 13; like many West African families, her parents hired a professional photographer to do a traditional family portrait at home. That same year, she received a camera for Christmas and said she had since been exploring how photography can address social issues. After quitting her job as an art director in an advertising agency, she became a full-time freelance photographer and has created her own studio in Abidjan. Over the course of her \u00e2\u0080\u009cResilient\u00e2\u0080\u009d series, women began reaching out to her to participate. Of her more than 30 subjects, a student studying in France came to her studio with her mother wearing a miniskirt and Converse sneakers. They had descended from the royal family of Grand Bassam, a city that was briefly the French colonial capital in the late 19th century. She had asked the king of Grand Bassam if she could wear her great-grandmother\u00e2\u0080\u0099s outfit for the portrait session (image above). \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe mother was so emotional,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Ms. Choumali said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t even know why we cried, but the energy was really special.

{"Headline": "Facebook, in Accounting Change, Could Pay Millions More in British Taxes", "Date": "2016-03-04", "News": "Supported byFacebook moved to change its relationship status with the British tax authorities on Friday.The company announced that it would soon alter how it paid tax in Britain, potentially leading to the company paying millions of dollars more on its operations in the country.The move comes in the face of growing anger across Europe about American technology giants\u2019 aggressive accounting practices.As part of Facebook\u2019s new tax structure, the company said it would report sales linked to its British operations, primarily from digital advertising, through its local subsidiary, instead of booking its British revenues through its Irish unit. Facebook\u2019s international headquarters are in Dublin.The change means the company will pay taxes in Britain on its local sales, as opposed to the current structure, in which Facebook primarily pays taxes through its Irish operation. The new structure will take effect in early April, according to the company.\u201cU.K. sales made directly by our U.K. team will be booked in the U.K., not Ireland,\u201d Lena Pietsch, a Facebook spokeswoman, said in a statement on Friday. \u201cFacebook U.K. will then record the revenue from these sales.\u201dWhile Facebook did not disclose how much more British tax it would pay, it is likely the company will pay significantly more than it currently does on its operations in Britain.In 2014, the latest year for which records are available, Facebook paid a mere $6,100 in British corporation tax, or slightly less than the average British worker paid in income tax.From 2008 to 2014, it paid a combined $1.2 million in taxes to the British government, while recording a $76.5 million loss over the same period, according to DueDil, a data research company.That compares with $16.2 million in taxes that Facebook paid to Ireland\u2019s tax authorities from 2008 to 2014, according to company filings analyzed by DueDil. Facebook had $3.6 million in pretax profit on its Irish operations over the period.The biggest American tech companies face intensifying scrutiny by European regulators, with \u2014 pressure that could potentially curb their sizable profits in the region and affect how they operate around the world.Facebook\u2019s efforts to revamp its accounting structure in Britain follow changes in the country\u2019s tax laws aimed at forcing companies to pay more tax on revenue generated there.The so-called Google tax \u2014 officially called the diverted profits tax \u2014 charges companies a 25 percent tax rate on profits on British revenue that the country\u2019s tax authorities consider to be artificially moved overseas to avoid the British system.For many American tech companies, many of which use complicated tax structures through the likes of Ireland and Luxembourg to reduce their global tax burdens, Europe\u2019s more aggressive stance is starting to bite.Along with its continuing negotiations with French and Italian tax authorities over potential back taxes, Google also recently agreed to pay an extra $183 million in taxes to the British government to cover the 10-year period through 2015.Advertisement"}

It was nearly eight months old. At a town-hall-style event hosted by CNN, Donald J. Trump said he would not promise to support the eventual nominee if it was not him, despite a loyalty oath that he and 16 other candidates signed in September. Senator Ted Cruz of Texas also would not explicitly vow to back the nominee, in his case if it was Mr. Trump, saying only that Mr. Trump would not get that far. Gov. John R. Kasich of Ohio was more explicit, saying that if the nominee was someone who \u00e2\u0080\u009cis really hurting the country and dividing the country,\u00e2\u0080\u009d then he just wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t sure. Pressed by the host, Anderson Cooper, on whether he was saying he thinks that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s what Mr. Trump is doing, Mr. Kasich declined to elaborate.The reason the pledge existed in the first place was to prevent Mr. Trump walking out of the Republican contest and into a third-party candidacy. But the comments marked a fresh stage in the open warfare that has erupted in the past weeks, as Mr. Trump has moved closer to capturing the nomination of a party whose major leaders remain deeply troubled by his comments.

{"Headline": "Technology Expands the World for African Artists", "Date": "2016-03-24", "News": "Supported byArt for TomorrowADDIS ABABA, Ethiopia \u2014 A visit to Dawit Abebe\u2019s painting studio on a recent morning was, to put it bluntly, a bit boring. The room, which he shares with two other artists in a nondescript building down a dirt alleyway in the center of Addis Ababa, was remarkably bare for the workplace of a successful artist: a few blank canvases stacked against the back wall and a lone, large, paint-splattered canvas on an easel. When asked what the piece was meant to represent, Mr. Abebe, wearing a black T-shirt, jeans and a large silver Ethiopian Orthodox cross necklace, laughed heartily: \u201cIt\u2019s the canvas I use to clean my brushes.\u201dThe fact that Mr. Abebe\u2019s studio space was empty is a mark of success. He had recently taken a few works to the Netherlands for an exhibition, and he had shipped off the rest to his London gallerist, Kristin Hjellegjerde, who was taking them to the Volta art fair in New York in early March, where she sold all 13 of them. The two met over Facebook a few years ago, after Ms. Hjellegjerde read an article about Mr. Abebe, who had just set up his account after a friend recommended that it might help broaden his career outside of Ethiopia. \u201cI checked out what she did and with whom, and got a feel for her work,\u201d said Mr. Abebe, who, after being taken on by Ms. Hjellegjerde\u2019s gallery, was featured in a group show last year at the Saatchi Gallery in London. \u201cIf you use technology properly, it helps to promote you, to expose your work in an international way.\u201dA growing number of sub-Saharan African artists are realizing the importance and potency of technology \u2014 social media, apps, websites and online platforms focused on the promotion and archiving of African contemporary art.Smartphones, tablets and even satellite television have also played a role, showing artists that despite the crushing lack of artistic infrastructure across the region \u2014 including few strong commercial and noncommercial art galleries, museums not focused on promoting and exhibiting contemporary art and a general lack of curatorial practice, artist residencies and good art schools \u2014 there are still ways to reach out and get the attention of art managers, critics, collectors and gallerists across the region and the world. \u201cThere are people who are doing great things, but they have no galleries and no curators to look at and promote their work,\u201d said Victor Ehikhamenor, a Nigerian artist who has a master\u2019s degree in information technology. \u201cBut, say you apply for a residency. Most judges will look at your digital footprint, though they may not tell you that is how they checked your background. So in various ways that we cannot quantify, technology has helped the African artist, and has helped a whole lot of us on the continent be able to push out our work.\u201dWhile some artists, like Mr. Abebe, have been lucky enough to be contacted by a gallery owner, other artists have been the ones reaching out. After uploading their works on Instagram and Twitter, they tag curators and art dealers whom they want to have a look at their work, hoping to make a connection. Nkechi Bakare, who runs her Instagram account Art News Africa out of Lagos and has accumulated more than 86,000 followers since she started in 2014, said that every day she gets at least one message from artists asking her to review and post their work on her account. Others get in contact over social media directly with art collectors and gallerists. \u201cWe are seeing a lot of the Internet democratizing artistic conversations,\u201d said Ayo Adeyinka, an art dealer and owner of the Tafeta Gallery near Oxford Circus in central London. \u201cOne artist, Babajide Olatunji, sent me a friend request on Facebook. If you send a request, I make a polite effort to check out your page, and I saw how talented he was.\u201d They exchanged messages and spoke about where Mr. Olatunji, a young Nigerian artist, wanted to go with his career. Impressed, Mr. Adeyinka took him on as an artist \u2014 brokering sales, introducing him to institutions, and managing press and public relations.The Ghanaian artist Serge Attukwei Clottey said that thanks to the Internet, where he posts his artistic productions on his Instagram account, he not only was offered \u2014 and took \u2014 the chance to study in Brazil but he also was contacted by one of his future collectors, who is based in California.\u201cI think technology helps African artists to reach many people in the global art space,\u201d he said by email. \u201cFor example, I\u2019ve been getting many residency opportunities from all over the world because people always see my work online.\u201d Thanks also to technology like smartphones and satellite television, there are an increasing number of artists who have become interested in examining international issues in their work. \u201cIn the past what was inspiring was very local, but technology has afforded a new generation of artists the ability to tap into global issues,\u201d said Lavinia Calza, who owns the ARTLabAfrica gallery in Nairobi. \u201cSo for me, it is interesting that it has opened up some of the artistic practice here.\u201d She added that one of her artists had been examining the immigration crisis in Europe in his new works, while another was tackling the effects of air pollution across the world. There are also a growing number of online platforms \u2014 including art magazines, online galleries and research websites \u2014 that are also helping the overall promotion of African contemporary artists. Contemporary And, a website based in Germany, is both a magazine about the art scene across the continent and a platform for research and networking. \u201cThe original idea was that it was always important to make visible what was happening on the continent,\u201d said Yvette Mutumba, a curator at the Weltkulturen Museum in Frankfurt am Main, Germany.

She has mounted online exhibitions, including one with the South African artist Richard Penn, as well as one-night-only pop-up art shows, where she has used crowdfunding to raise money. \u201cGlobally, art has moved online in a big way,\u201d she said. \u201cBut despite that there are dozens of online art ventures, African contemporary art is still very much missing. I am trying to change that.\u201dOf course, the biggest problem with technology-based ventures in Africa is that the infrastructure across the continent lags far behind that in other parts of the world. Rolling electricity blackouts are an issue, as is the fact that Internet penetration, at 28.6 percent, is lower than anywhere else in the world, with countries like Ethiopia \u2014 after Nigeria the second most populous country in Africa, with 94 million people \u2014 at just 3.7 percent.\u201cThings like uploading images take up a lot of time, and if the Internet keeps going down or the electricity keeps breaking \u2014 these are the kinds of obstacles we live with,\u201d said Nana Oforiatta Ayim, a Ghanian writer and filmmaker whose Cultural Encyclopedia website project, funded by the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, was introduced at the end of last year. \u201cWe get around them and complain about them, but, sadly, that is our reality.\u201dMs. Taylor concurred. \u201cWe need to remember the issues of the digital divide,\u201d she said. \u201cI am a massive fan of technology, but it is not a panacea.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Britain Needs Europe", "Date": "2016-03-03", "News": "Supported byLONDON \u2014 In the Year of the Hair, Boris Johnson of the blonde mop trails Donald Trump, but not by much. The London mayor\u2019s decision, which he has described as \u201cagonizingly difficult,\u201d to come out in favor of a British exit from the European Union in a June referendum has sent British politics into a tailspin.The mayor, whose second four-year term ends this year, likes to wax metaphoric. In an interview with The Times, he compared himself to James Bond up against the \u201cevil baddie who is hell-bent on subverting democracy around the world through a supranational organization.\u201d Britain trapped in Europe was like \u201ca slowly boiling frog,\u201d he suggested.The range of his metaphors is matched only by the extent of his ambition. Boris on Europe is also Boris on Boris. He wants to be the next prime minister of Britain \u2014 or whatever is left of it in 2020, the date of the next election.David Cameron, the conservative prime minister, has said he will not stand again. Under Conservative Party rules, the conclusive vote to replace him will be between two candidates. One of them will be the pro-European chancellor of the Exchequer, George Osborne. By claiming the anti-Europe mantle in a party where Brussels bashing is a popular sport, Johnson has set himself up to be the other contender.Of course, Boris is not just about Boris. He\u2019s been a successful mayor. London works better than New York. His agonizing appears to have been genuine. Theories about what tipped the balance abound.The exit argument \u2014 when it\u2019s not just bloviating little-England inanity dosed with anti-immigrant bigotry \u2014 is that membership hitches Britain to a stagnant Continent whose most powerful countries are locked in a dysfunctional single-currency system that must lead to ever greater European federalism. It is that the Union is short on democracy and long on bureaucracy. It is that leaving the Union will allow Britain, like Norway, to continue to benefit from a single market of more than a half-billion people while freeing it from intrusive regulation. The \u201cOut\u201d mantra is \u201cTake Back Control.\u201dIn fact, a \u201cBrexit\u201d would be an act of folly, slashing Britain\u2019s \u201ccontrol\u2019 at a critical time, inflicting a \u201cprofound economic shock,\u201d in Osborne\u2019s words, and possibly leading to the breakup of Britain.The European Union, together with the trans-Atlantic alliance, ushered Europe to stability and prosperity from the collective suicide of the first half of the 20th century. It remains the world\u2019s most boring, important miracle. A British departure, at a time when President Vladimir Putin is trying by all means to undermine a fragile union, would be a geopolitical disaster. Further European unraveling would become likely. No wonder President Obama is expected in London next month to reiterate his conviction that a Britain in Europe is a stronger, more influential ally.Britain can \u2014 and must \u2014 make the E.U. more transparent, democratic and dynamic. That can only be achieved from within. The country derives immense benefits from being part of an $18.5 trillion economy. To imagine that a Britain outside the Union can continue to enjoy the benefits of membership is pure illusion, as many industry leaders have made clear. The economy as a whole, and the City in particular, would suffer. British insularity would become a byword.Or rather English insularity, for Britain would likely cease to be. Scotland is strongly pro-European. An E.U. exit would give the governing Scottish National Party an overwhelming case for another referendum on independence. Its outcome would surely be the end of the union established in 1707.The June 23 vote will be close, closer now that Johnson has gambled. His choice, so perverse for the mayor of this city of countless tongues, risks pushing his beloved country \u201cremorselessly and expensively in the wrong direction.\u201d Seldom has the need for British good sense, continuity and prudence been more acute.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Advice College Admissions Officers Give Their Own Kids", "Date": "2016-03-17", "News": "While most parents find the college process stressful and bewildering, we interviewed some who have a unique perspective: admissions officers who are also the parents of teenagers and college students themselves. They know that while parents can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t control where their child is admitted, they can influence whether their teenager views the college process as stressful and frustrating or as an exciting time filled with opportunity.  These admissions officers tell their own children that high school is far more than just a pathway to college \u2014 it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a time for maturation, self-discovery, learning and fun. They encourage their teens to embrace activities and courses that reflect who they genuinely are, not who they think colleges want them to be. We interviewed admissions officers at Allegheny College, Georgia Tech, Kenyon College, M.I.T., Penn State, Vanderbilt, U.C.L.A., U.N.C.-Chapel Hill and the University of Richmond. Every one of them emphasized the importance of their child finding a college that fits, not the other way around. With throngs of high school juniors about to embark on college visits over their spring breaks, here is their advice. (Interviews have been edited and condensed.)Diane Anci, vice president for enrollment management and dean of admissions and financial aid, Kenyon College\u201cBefore the college brochures make their way into our house, I plan to ask my son a series of questions that I hope will help him define the type of collegiate environment in which he will be most happy and do his best work. Knowing who you are provides a protective armor in a process that can be overwhelming. Not only are you inundated with communication from the colleges, everyone you know has an opinion of what is a good college and what is not, and they feel very free to express it. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s empowering for a teen to be able to say, \u2018I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m the kind of person who\u00e2\u0080\u00a6\u2019 \u201d Here are some of the questions she plans to ask her own kid:Clark Brigger, executive director for undergraduate admissions, Penn State University\u201cI tell my kids, \u2018Do not wait for the deadline to submit your applications.\u2019 There\u2019s a rule in our house that I pay for the applications completed before Labor Day, but after that, my children are responsible for the fees. Getting those applications in early is the best way to reduce stress senior year. I want them to do well in their academic courses and extracurricular activities and to enjoy that last year of high school. Why spend it struggling with applications?\u201d\u201cAs an admissions officer, when that deadline comes around, I see a huge spike in applications. That\u2019s when the procrastinators send them in. It\u2019s advantageous to get ahead of the bubble. Think about it strategically: there are thousands of applications and essays to get through. If you get yours in early, the reader may be more relaxed and in a better mood at that point in the process.\u201dDoug Christiansen, vice provost for university enrollment affairs, dean of admissions and financial aid, Vanderbilt UniversityAn essential lesson of the college process is learning to make and manage big life decisions and weather setbacks, says Mr. Christiansen. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAs parents we know that our kids may not get accepted everywhere they apply. I advise students to complete all of their applications ahead of the early decision news [when] they are in a positive frame of mind. It is far easier to rebound from disappointment and proceed when you have a game plan already in place.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhen a rejection letter arrives, I see parents who can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t even move on because they are so mad at the school. But that is not letting the child move on. Then it is almost like the next school they get admitted to and may attend is a disappointment. Instead, tell your child: \u00e2\u0080\u0098It didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t work, it is their loss, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re wonderful, now what do we need to do to go forward?\u00e2\u0080\u0099\u00e2\u0080\u009d Youlonda Copeland-Morgan, associate vice chancellor, enrollment management, University of California, Los Angeles\u201cCommunity service is an expectation in our household. We raised our kids to understand that they have a responsibility to make their community better and to give back. My job was to make sure intellectually that they understood the value of community service and why it was important. I think community service should come from the heart. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s important that students don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t engage in community service because somebody else wants them to. Find something you are passionate about, or you are interested in if you are too young to know what your passions are.\u201d\u201cWe would talk a lot with our sons about leadership opportunities, and I think that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the area where we had to give them more guidance. We would say to our sons: Where do you think you can be of greater help? What\u00e2\u0080\u0099s going on at your school, what are the issues? What are the things you like to do where you could provide leadership? With the church there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a youth group: You\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been a part of this group for a long time; do you think it is time for you to step up and do something different? This matters in your college application.\u201dStephen Farmer, vice provost for enrollment and undergraduate admissions, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhen my son was applying to schools, I never read his essay. Parents can sometimes do more harm than good with the essay. My advice to students is to first show your essay to a friend and ask, \u00e2\u0080\u0098Can you hear my voice in this? Could you pick my essay from a stack of 200?\u00e2\u0080\u0099 The essay doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have to be about something life-changing or confessional. Smaller topics, written well, almost always work best.\u201d\u00e2\u0080\u009cMy wife and I have tried to give our kids some air and room to breathe growing up. We never checked their homework or felt like their schooling was a family project. It was their life and their work \u2014 we provided guidance. In the end, our kids need our love more than they need our direction about college. If that direction gets in the way of the love, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not helpful and it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not worth it.\u00e2\u0080\u009dCornell B. LeSane II, vice president for enrollment and dean of admissions, Allegheny College\u201cMy daughter, now a high school senior, has been the driver of the process. Sure, there have been times when I\u2019ve been the backseat driver: Are you sure, and have you thought about this or that? As a parent, it\u2019s impossible not to do that. But you need to allow them to find their way.\u201d \u201cAs an admissions officer, I\u2019ve had parents tell me, \u2018Oh, we missed a deadline \u2014 that\u2019s my fault.\u2019 At that point I\u2019m thinking \u2014 just how interested is the student in our school? I\u2019m not a fan of parents taking over the process. Let the students be the drivers, let them take ownership. Parents should be a great sounding board, but they should not be the ones filling out the applications.\u201dStuart Schmill, dean of admissions, Massachusetts Institute of Technology\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat I tell students, and my own kids, is that you don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have to take every advanced class. My high school daughter, for example, is taking advanced math and science courses but chose not to take advanced English and history. You should challenge yourself. For some students this might mean taking the most advanced classes, but it also might mean taking the most advanced classes appropriate for that student, and not spreading themselves too thin.\u00e2\u0080\u009dApplicants do not need to tick off a laundry list of engagement in every field, like art, music, sports, Mr. Schmill explains. \u00e2\u0080\u009cM.I.T., and other highly selective colleges, want students who prioritize quality over quantity.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Schmill offers high school students this litmus test when choosing extracurricular activities: \u00e2\u0080\u009cIf you couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t write about this on your college application, would you still do it?\u00e2\u0080\u0099 If the answer is \u00e2\u0080\u0098no,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 then you shouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be doing it.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Laura Simmons, assistant director, undergraduate admissions, Georgia Institute of Technology\u00e2\u0080\u009cFor our children, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s important to earn some money in the summer, so they can do things like put gas in the car. As an admissions officer, that plays right into what I am looking for in the admission process: I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not looking for students to have done any particular activity in the summer; but instead, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m looking to see how students grew from whatever they undertook. I do see students who are doing magnificent research and that is a great thing. And I see students, like my daughter, who are working as a lifeguard at the pool all summer, and they are both learning from those experiences.\u201d\u00e2\u0080\u009cThere are some majors here where, if students don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have any connection to that major, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hard for us to predict if they will be successful in it. But in some cases that experience can also come from something they did during the school year. My daughter, for example, is interested in journalism and communications, and she writes during the school year. Over the summer, we don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t feel she needs to do more.\u00e2\u0080\u009dGil Villanueva, associate vice president and dean of admission, University of Richmond \u201cAs my son prepares his college list, I\u2019m going to hand him a spreadsheet. Across the top will be the schools, and down the side will be the list of things he feels are most important to him in a college. When he visits these schools and does his research, he\u2019ll fill in the spreadsheet, and it will be a nice road map for him. At some point, once you visit two or three schools in a day or five schools a week, they begin to blend, and you definitely want some bread crumbs to remind you of where you\u2019ve been.\u201d\u201cOn the same spreadsheet, I\u2019ll have him track what I call the \u00e2\u0080\u0098three rates\u00e2\u0080\u0099 for each college. The first is the retention rate: Are students returning as sophomores? Because if they are, then I make the argument that they have had a very good experience, their needs are met. Next is the graduation rate. A fifth year or a sixth year in a college represents forgone income or time that you are not in graduate school \u2014 and you are not going to get that back. The last rate is the placement rate or \u00e2\u0080\u0098student outcomes.\u00e2\u0080\u0099 What are students doing six months, a year or five years after graduation? Are they employed, are they in graduate school, what type of companies or organizations do they work for? The three rates gives parents and students peace of mind that they\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve done their research.\u201d Your health questions answered by Times journalists and\u00a0experts.Get Well's Running email for practical tips, expert advice, exclusive content and a bit of motivation delivered to your inbox every week to help you on your running journey.

For most people, that is untrue.\u201cDespite the rumors, no feed changes are being implemented right now \u2014 we still have weeks, or even months, of testing to go,\u201d an Instagram spokesman said in a statement. \u201cCurrently the test groups are very small. When we roll it out broadly, we will definitely let the community know.\u201dBy turning on notifications for an individual account, you would allow Instagram to send you the equivalent of a text message every time that account has a new post.That might be O.K. for your favorite accounts, but it is likely to become tiresome if used too often. Your favorite friends, brands and celebrities may essentially be asking to overwhelm you with notifications.The panic is based on a fear that once the algorithm takes over, posts you would otherwise see in a reverse chronological presentation may soon be hidden. That is true: Instagram is likely to present photos and videos based on how inclined you are to be interested in them, your history of interaction with the user and how timely the posts are. If you rarely like or comment on an account\u2019s photo, those photos might be less likely to show up.But you may see more of an account if you interact often with it. If you like every one of your friend\u2019s photos of her cat, you would more likely see her photos, even if they were posted many hours before you logged in. Instagram is betting that you probably won\u2019t scroll down too far and that you would rather see your friend\u2019s cat than whatever was posted five minutes ago.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Six Campaigns Scramble Amid Last Arguments and Final Stands", "Date": "2016-03-14", "News": "Monday represents a significant 24 hours in the life of the 2016 presidential campaign. On the Democratic side, Hillary Clinton\u00e2\u0080\u0099s aides are expecting wins to increase her delegate count, but they are also bracing for losses that could keep the race marching forward. On the Republican side, it is the final day for those praying for a shift in momentum in Florida that will stop Donald J. Trump. The candidates are criss-crossing the states voting on Tuesday: Florida, Illinois, Missouri, North Carolina and Ohio. Senator Ted Cruz of Texas will keep to Illinois and North Carolina, where he hopes to amass enough delegates to stay in the race, while Gov. John R. Kasich of Ohio is banging the drum in his home state of Ohio, where polls show him in a close race with Mr. Trump. Senator Marco Rubio of Florida has wound down his race with increasingly pointed comments about Mr. Trump, suggesting this weekend that it could be hard to support him if he wins the nomination.The busy day follows an extraordinary weekend, which included Mr. Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s canceled rally in Chicago amid clashes between protesters and supporters; a protester who tried to rush the stage in Ohio the next day; and Mr. Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s unsubstantiated claim that the man was connected to the Islamic State. Yet nothing has shaken Mr. Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s supporters over many months. His comments may make it harder to attract new Republican supporters as time wears on, but in a multicandidate race, he needs only to hold at his current level to win. That is particularly true in Florida and Ohio, which allocate their delegates in winner-take-alls.In 2010, Bill Clinton was mindful of the significance of a Democratic-held Senate and of Mr. Rubio\u00e2\u0080\u0099s potential as a future national candidate against Mrs. Clinton, and he agreed, after much prodding, to try to push a friend, Representative Kendrick B. Meek of Florida, a Democrat who had supported Mrs. Clinton in 2008, from the Senate race in Florida. The idea was to unite voters behind Charlie Crist, the former Republican governor who was running as an independent, so that he could overtake Mr. Rubio. That all seems like a long time ago. Then again, so do the 1980s, a time that tripped up Mrs. Clinton over the weekend during Nancy Reagan\u00e2\u0080\u0099s funeral. Mrs. Clinton cast the Reagans as early advocates for H.I.V./AIDS patients, which was incorrect. Mrs. Clinton later apologized and said she misspoke, but many of her supporters were unhappy.  \n\t\tFirst Draft provides fast-paced and comprehensive coverage of politics and elections by The New York Times.

I frankly thought it was amazing. I gained a lot respect for him.\u00e2\u0080\u009dThe support of Mr. Carson, a Seventh-day Adventist, could help Mr. Trump woo evangelical voters, who remain an important part of the Republican base.

It is also a blow to Senator Marco Rubio of Florida, who is friendly with Mr. Lee, as Mr. Rubio strains to catch Mr. Trump before Tuesday\u2019s Florida primary vote.At a news conference at the site of Thursday evening\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Republican debate in Coral Gables, Fla., Mr. Lee said it was \u00e2\u0080\u009ctime to unite\u00e2\u0080\u009d behind the candidate best-positioned, in his view, to catch Mr. Trump.Asked if Mr. Rubio should leave the race, Mr. Lee said he \u00e2\u0080\u009cwould encourage him \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and I do encourage him \u00e2\u0080\u0094 to get behind Ted Cruz.\u00e2\u0080\u009dMr. Lee said he had spoken to Mr. Rubio before the announcement but declined to characterize the conversation.He added that he expected other senators to follow his lead in backing Mr. Cruz, who did not appear with Mr. Lee on Thursday.\u00e2\u0080\u009cHe is the only Republican candidate who can defeat Donald Trump and who can defeat Hillary Clinton, and I believe he will,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Lee said, noting that he had held regular discussions with his colleagues in the hope that more will join him in backing the Texas senator.While Mr. Lee declined to openly criticize Mr. Trump, he said he worried about his policy positions and views on presidential power.\u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099m still waiting to hear more detail from Donald Trump on where he stands on a whole host of issues,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Lee said.Mr. Lee has appeared with both Mr. Cruz and Mr. Rubio during the campaign and has expressed concern with the tenor of the race.\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not easy to see them fighting,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said last month outside a barbecue restaurant in South Carolina, where Mr. Cruz was set to hold an event.Even longtime skeptics of Mr. Cruz, like Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, have begun to express an openness to his candidacy \u00e2\u0080\u0094 if only because many establishment Republicans see him as more palatable than Mr. Trump.\n\t\tFirst Draft provides fast-paced and comprehensive coverage of politics and elections by The New York Times.

{"Headline": "Sprawling Mural Pays Homage to Cairo\u2019s Garbage Collectors", "Date": "2016-03-28", "News": "Supported byCairo JournalCAIRO \u2014 The intricate mural took shape over the past few weeks, little noticed at first, spreading across a harried quarter of Cairo where Egypt\u2019s garbage collectors live, amid overflowing bundles of this overcrowded city\u2019s trash.By the time the painting was finished two weeks ago, it stretched across more than 50 buildings, making it the largest public work of art here anyone can recall. The mural, a circle of orange, white and blue in Arabic calligraphy, quotes a third-century Coptic Christian bishop who said, \u201cIf one wants to see the light of the sun, he must wipe his eyes.\u201dWhen the first photographs of the mural circulated, reactions ranged from astonished delight to disbelief. Some people, struck by its seemingly impossible scale, seemed convinced that the images had been digitally altered, according to the man behind the project, a Tunisian-French artist known as eL Seed.But what seemed most surprising was that eL Seed and several friends who worked with him had been able to complete the project at all, without being harassed or arrested.But eL Seed chose a forsaken corner of the city, called Manshiyat Naser, away from the gaze of officials, the kind of place where artists have had more space to work, Ms. Morayef said.The artist said he intended to change popular perceptions of the district, too narrowly associated with squalor, and to celebrate decades of unsung work by its residents who sort and recycle tons of the city\u2019s waste. He has painted large works of distinctive calligraphy in other countries over the past few years, including in Brazil, France and Tunisia, but he said the experience in Egypt, and the reaction, were \u201coverwhelming.\u201dHe chalked up the success of the project, which was entirely self-funded, to his decision to work quietly, with the cooperation of residents, but also to a visitor\u2019s na\u00efvet\u00e9.That meant ignoring the arguments that seem to attend many public expressions in a testy Egypt these days. \u201cSometimes when you come from outside, you don\u2019t see all the problems that might happen,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cI was trying not to look at the political situation, the economic struggles, and just focus on the art project.\u201d\u201cJust imagine that our artists who sell their art for thousands of pounds decide to contribute and suggested some solutions to beautify or enrich Egypt\u2019s facades,\u201d he wrote.More than 5,000 people shared a post of eL Seed\u2019s mission statement on Facebook, and there were hundreds of mostly positive comments that suggested that he had accomplished his goals. \u201cBeautiful and honest words,\u201d one woman in Egypt wrote. The garbage collectors, she added, \u201cdeserve our gratitude.\u201dAs eL Seed planned the mural over the past year, he was aided by a local priest, the Rev. Samaan Ibrahim, who is considered a leader of the mainly Coptic garbage collectors in the neighborhood. The priest\u2019s approval and participation in the project in turn brought residents on board, eL Seed said.The neighborhood was established more than four decades ago, with its striking location in the shadow of cliffs and fetid streets making it the most recognizable of several settlements where the city\u2019s garbage collectors live.The neighborhood has also received frequent attention over the years from international aid organizations and journalists, making it one of the most prosperous settlements, said Ga\u00e9tan du Roy, a Belgian researcher who studies the religious lives of the collectors.But many of its residents are impoverished and continue to be regarded as second-class citizens because of their association with the trash, he said.From the streets of the neighborhood, the painting appears in fragments: above a courtyard where members of one family carefully search for recycling in bags of trash, or looming over a rooftop occupied by a handful of sheep. The bracing scale of the mural is fully visible only from the Mokattam Hill on the edge of the district, near a famous cathedral carved inside a cave.Viewed from there, the colors interrupt the monotonous red brick facades below, distinguishing these buildings from the thousands that have sprung up across the city over decades, with little oversight, to contain Cairo\u2019s bursting population.In the days after the mural was completed, the residents of Manshiyat Naser seemed not to focus too closely on its message: Many people had yet to trek up the hill for a viewing, and few had any idea what the calligraphy said.Instead, people seemed moved that eL Seed and his friends had bothered to travel to Cairo and immersed themselves in the neighborhood defying the various calamities that have driven away many visitors to Egypt in the past few years. The only complaint was that the artists had not painted more of the houses.\u201cThey used to play with the kids here, and talk to the people,\u201d said Boutros Ghali, a 24-year-old shopkeeper who placed a photograph of himself with one of the visitors, a young Algerian, on the wall of his store. \u201cPeople loved them, and got used to them. And when they left, people were upset.\u201dJoe Gabra contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

The great thing about this puzzle is the visual presentation of the CIRCULAR REASONING flaw, that actually reads, if you start from the shaded/circled letter C and proceed clockwise, \u201cCIRCULAR REASONING MAKES NO SENSE BECAUSE \u2026\u201d and repeats itself ad infinitum, which is precisely what a circular argument does. In the grid itself, the clues for this circle-rectangle are missing, but in the print version and the web game there is an \u201cAround\u201d clue that says \u201cSelf-descriptive statement about a 16 Across.\u201d That\u2019s your hint to read in a circle.Clearly, there are a lot of constraints in a grid like this, and you can read about them in the constructors\u2019 notes. There is a plethora of short words in this 16 x 14 grid, but I think it\u2019s filled just about as well as can be expected, given the balancing act Mr. Liben-Nowell and Mr. Pepper perform here. We\u2019ve also got APPLE PIE, C.S. LEWIS, CUBANO and SKI SHOP as some of the nice longer entries.Let\u2019s hear our constructors explain themselves, and please try not to shoot down their arguments in the comments section:We first started talking about some kind of CIRCULAR REASONING puzzle at the 2015 Minnesota Crossword Tournament (where we\u2019d met a few years prior, after both constructing puzzles, and hitting it off both interpersonally and cruciverbally).  We started thinking about a Sunday-sized puzzle (a large circle of marked squares containing \u201cCIRCULAR REASONING WORKS BECAUSE \u2026\u201d), but we couldn\u2019t come up with enough good additional themers to go with the circled squares, so eventually we changed to a 15 x 15 concept using a \u201ccircular rectangle.\u201d  We went back and forth a bunch of times on the long entry, which had to be changed to have even length so it could fit as a rectangle \u2014 CIRCULAR REASONING (WORKS CORRECTLY, IS GOOD, IS USEFUL) BECAUSE \u2026? \u2014 before finally settling on Tom\u2019s idea of the MAKES NO SENSE version.But the 15 x 15 version that we started with was, it turned out, a real bear to grid/fill to our satisfaction.  It took a long while to figure out why, but eventually David realized how ambitious we were being: The two 14s imposed major constraints on the black squares in a 15 x 15 grid, plus the long 38-letter wrapped entry was causing some really tough letter combinations in both directions when it turned a corner.  We had a ton of theme squares, and by necessity there also wasn\u2019t good separation between the theme entries.  Switching to a 16 x 14 grid relaxed the black-square constraints from the 14-letter themers, and we were off and running.Our original submission was a little nastier for the solver: We simply clued what\u2019s now 28 Around as 28 Across and completely omitted the numbers in the squares now numbered 24, 32 and 50, which was the only hint that something strange was going on.We hope that everyone enjoyed solving it!Let\u2019s move on to Friday with a small argument:Your thoughts?FollowAdvertisement"}

The merry-go-round of who wants to debate and when has been a common theme in the Democratic primary, and Mr. Sanders\u2019s push for one in April began in January, with a statement from Jeff Weaver, the Sanders campaign manager.\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhy won\u2019t they debate in Brooklyn?\u201d he said then. \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter with Brooklyn?\u00e2\u0080\u009dHe raised the issue again recently in a letter to Robby Mook, the Clinton campaign manager.\u00e2\u0080\u009cOur campaign continues to believe that the people of New York deserve to have the debate held in their state, and that it should be held prior to the New York primary,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Weaver wrote. He later added, \u00e2\u0080\u009cPerhaps there is some tactical advantage you are seeking by avoiding a debate in New York, but I would remind you that Senator Sanders agreed to debate the secretary in New Hampshire when he was well ahead in the polls.\u00e2\u0080\u009dLast night, the campaign sent the letter to its supporters, asking them to \u00e2\u0080\u009cadd their name\u00e2\u0080\u009d to their request to debate Mrs. Clinton before the New York primary.The discussions are still a marked improvement from the start of the week, when Joel Benenson, the chief strategist for the Clinton campaign, suggested that there would be no debates unless Mr. Sanders changed his \u00e2\u0080\u009ctone.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u201cLet\u2019s see if he goes back to the kind of tone he said he was going to set early on,\u201d Mr. Benenson told CNN. \u201cIf he does that, then we\u2019ll talk about debates.\u201d\n\t\tFirst Draft provides fast-paced and comprehensive coverage of politics and elections by The New York Times.

Some of the values my parents grew up with, my grandparents grew up with,\u201d she says. \u201cWhatever was wrong, they could point it out and tell you.\u201dThe notion that Mr. Trump voices ideas that his supporters are \u201cafraid\u201d to express, vital truths lost to the scourge of political correctness, has been a rhetorical through-line of his campaign. Mr. Trump says exactly what he thinks, his fans gush \u2014 about immigrants, about Muslims, about women \u2014 a bygone pleasure now denied most Americans.Mr. Trump isn\u2019t saying anything that his supporters wouldn\u2019t. He hasn\u2019t let an explicit racial slur slip on the campaign trail. It\u2019s the other way around. They\u2019re laying bare the subtext of his speech and policies, revealing how they appear to angry white people primed and frustrated by the past century of Republican dog-whistling. They\u2019re saying what Mr. Trump can\u2019t.Regardless, even if Trump supporters were managing to toe some politically correct line with their words, they speak as clear as day with their votes.It doesn\u2019t take clairvoyance, or even tremendous mental dexterity, to see what Mr. Trump means by \u201cmake America great again.\u201d It just takes a history book.

Political correctness is construed, deliberately and effectively, by its opponents as an attack on fun, but it\u2019s really an attack on the status quo that made Mr. Trump both very wealthy and a viable presidential candidate.We cannot ignore the fact that the populist sensation of this election hasn\u2019t been Bernie Sanders. It\u2019s been a racist, nationalist demagogue-for-hire with no sincere ideology beyond his own vanity. Mr. Trump is a cipher; his voters love him because he does nothing but hold up a mirror to their basest prejudices and bask in the feedback loop of narcissism.

Her old-school, video game-inspired installation, \u201cSame Old, Brand New,\u201d lit up all four sides of Hong Kong\u2019s tallest building, the 108-story International Commerce Center, with a playful reimagining of our earliest digital entertainment.Around the same time, the Palace Museum in Beijing released an app developed by Moujiti Studio that lets people view centuries of the museum\u2019s porcelain collection in high definition while combing through historical details.The evolving versatility of digital technology continues to offer new platforms and exposure for Chinese artists \u2014 both ancient and modern \u2014 changing how art is made, marketed, distributed and sold. It is the biggest shift for Chinese art since the easing of state control nearly four decades ago.A group of new media artists has evolved in recent years, with pioneers like Zhang Peili and Feng Mengbo being joined by \u201cPost-\u201980\u201d artists like Wang Yuyang and Xu Wenkai. Embracing an interconnected consciousness, such \u201cpost-Internet\u201d artists are expanding the country\u2019s art market.Many of these artists have risen to prominence after initially expanding their own horizons. Mr. Xu, also known by his art handle, aaajiao, was a computer science major during his college days in central China, and for him and others, technology served as a gateway to art.\u201cThe most important possibility offered by digital technology is a kind of education in the values of technological culture,\u201d he said. \u201cIt shatters location, ethnicity and politics, and because of that, it makes us equals.\u201dFor works produced by artists long deceased, technology also offers big benefits. Lulu Li, a partner and creative director at the Beijing-based Moujiti, said digital innovations made it easier to appreciate ancient works of art.\u201cAfter all, in a lifetime one can only visit so many museums and historical sites physically,\u201d Ms. Li said. \u201cWith the rise of digital museums and smart museums, technology like virtual reality and augmented reality can bring immersive experiences that help us access cultural content.\u201dMs. Li said that about 20 people worked on the app for the Palace Museum, from the initial creative concept and user-experience planning to sketches, user-interface design, animation, sound design, program development, hardware integration and more. Additional collaborations with the museum are in the conceptual stage, she said.\u201cIt\u2019s rather revolutionary,\u201d she said. \u201cDigital technology not only makes it possible for China\u2019s hidden treasures to be accessible by Chinese people, it also helps transmit this knowledge globally.\u201dSuch advances are also making it easier for the current generation of Chinese artists who want to show their work to a wider audience. But in terms of helping them survive, there is not an app for that \u2014 yet.\u201cFor individual artists, there\u2019s really not any complete platform out there,\u201d Mr. Xu said. \u201cIn terms of whether there are digital platforms that enable people to make money off of art, I\u2019d say they exist.\u201d From auctions on the Chinese social media platform WeChat \u201cto every kind of big auction site, these Internet-based platforms already have an obvious benefit,\u201d he said.Yang Kai founded one of those auction sites, 99ys.com, in 2003 to address counterfeiting and quality issues in Chinese art auctions.\u201cWe primarily auction paintings, the majority of which are contemporary,\u201d Mr. Yang said. Almost all of the website\u2019s users gain access to the site via mobile devices, he said, with more than 50 percent using their phones and 40 percent using tablets. Mr. Yang said the site\u2019s record price for an individual painting was 100,000 yuan, or about $15,300.In addition to auction sites and the ubiquitous WeChat, Chinese artists are also marketing themselves and selling via Instagram, Facebook, YouTube and e-commerce sites like Jd.com and Taobao.com.Platforms such as these that rely on user-generated content are more often than not used by artists to sell physical art. New options, such as the EO1 digital art display by Electric Objects of New York, offer a curated and subscription-based platform for artists.Last October, the company joined with the Internet art nonprofit organization Rhizome at the New Museum in New York to offer the Panda Edition EO1, featuring limited-edition art by Ai Weiwei and Jacob Appelbaum. Their \u201cPanda-to-Panda\u201d artwork featured toy pandas stuffed with shreds of printouts of the surveillance documents leaked by the former National Security Agency contractor Edward J. Snowden.\u201cWe primarily work with artists who use or engage with technology in their practice,\u201d said Zo\u00eb Salditch, a founder of Electric Objects who works on the curation side. \u201cWe believe that these artists are making work that represents the present and future of art.\u201dElectric Objects\u2019 other founder, Jake Levine, added: \u201cOur mission is to bring to art what the Internet has already brought to every other category of media. It reduces the cost of distribution to zero, and creates an opportunity for artists to reach and grow their fan base directly.\u201dElectric Objects commissions new and original work from artists, to whom it pays a fee. Artists keep full ownership of their intellectual property while giving Electric Objects a perpetual license to distribute their artwork, Ms. Salditch said. The company wants to include artists from around the world, including Chinese artists.\u201cChina is a hotbed of creative activity,\u201d she said. \u201cI can imagine all sorts of wonderful collaborations.\u201dMr. Xu said it was still early for products such as EO1 in the Chinese market. \u201cIn terms of Chinese consumers in the wider sense, I think this type of digital art platform is still not very visible,\u201d he said.One of the biggest challenges facing artists or companies trying to make money in China on new digital channels for selling art is the ethos of digital media itself, Ms. Cao said.\u201cThe monopolistic sales and collection of art have a conflict that is difficult to harmonize with the \u2018sharing\u2019 and \u2018free\u2019 nature of digital media,\u201d she said.In addition to structural challenges within the industry, there is the possibility that, as digital technology and media become increasingly intertwined with artistic expression in China, governmental intervention could become an issue. Mr. Xu struck a sanguine note when asked about potential government restrictions on freedom of expression by new media artists.\u201cThe Chinese government\u2019s control of the Internet is much more conservative than its cultural policies,\u201d he said. \u201cThe integration of technology and art won\u2019t actually change much, for now.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "For Serious Training, Hold the Carbs at Dinnertime", "Date": "2016-03-09", "News": "Gretchen Reynolds on the science of fitness.Get Well\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Running email for practical tips, expert advice, exclusive content and a bit of motivation delivered to your inbox every week to help you on your running journey. Coming soon.Strategically skipping bread, pasta and other carbohydrates at dinner might improve subsequent athletic performance, provided those low-carb meals are combined with the right types of workouts, according to a new sports nutrition study. Its findings undercut some entrenched ideas about how athletes should eat in preparation for spring marathons and other endurance races.As those of us who are athletes or spend time around them know, diets are a topic of consuming interest for the group, since an athlete\u00e2\u0080\u0099s diet affects how well he or she can train, recover, progress, chisel a physique and compete.But the ideal sports diet remains elusive. Many dietitians and coaches advocate for heaps of carbohydrates at the training table. Carbohydrates, which break down during digestion into sugar, are the body\u00e2\u0080\u0099s first choice as fuel during exercise. But the body\u00e2\u0080\u0099s reservoir of stored carbohydrates is small, and even if athletes supplement their supply during exercise with sugary drinks or food, prolonged or intense exertion generally incinerates much of the body\u00e2\u0080\u0099s available carbohydrates.Consequently, some experts suggest that athletic success may depend in part on making the body better able to use fat as a fuel. Even the leanest athlete\u00e2\u0080\u0099s body is girded with the stuff, theoretically providing enough energy for even the longest, hardest workouts. Low-carbohydrate diets will force the body to turn to fat. But working muscles must become used to burning fat, a process that can make exercising on a low-carb diet difficult in the short term. Indeed, athletes on extremely low-carbohydrate diets tend to struggle to finish hard workouts.So researchers at the French National Institute of Sport, Expertise and Performance in Paris and other institutions began to wonder about the possibilities of modified forms of low-carb diets, and specifically about what they and other scientists call \u00e2\u0080\u009csleeping low.\u00e2\u0080\u009dWith a \u00e2\u0080\u009csleep-low\u00e2\u0080\u009d sports diet, an athlete skips carbohydrates at dinner. In the morning, his or her body should have low reserves of the macronutrient, and any ensuing workouts would force the body to turn to fat, its most abundant fuel. In past studies of the technique, however, it has produced mixed results in terms of whether it improves competitive performance.To test that possibility, they recruited 21 experienced, competitive triathletes who bravely agreed to have their diets manipulated. The scientists ran their volunteers through a simulated triathlon and other tests of their current fitness and pace.Half of the athletes were then randomly assigned to eat a standard sports diet, with large helpings of carbohydrates at every meal and after workouts.The others were put on a sleep-low regimen. With this program, the athletes consumed the same amount of carbohydrates over the course of the day as the other group, but in a different sequence. Virtually all of their carbohydrates were consumed at breakfast and lunch, with none at dinner.At the same time, all of the athletes also began a new training program. In the afternoon, both groups completed a draining, intense interval-training session, designed to increase fitness and deplete the body\u00e2\u0080\u0099s carbohydrate stores. The members of the control group then replenished their carbohydrates at dinner; the sleep-low group did not.Next morning, before breakfast, the volunteers pedaled for an hour at a moderate pace on stationary bicycles. By this time, the sleep-low group was running on carbohydrate fumes and body fat.Afterward, all of the athletes sat down to large, carb-rich breakfasts and lunches, meaning that both groups were flush with carbohydrates for the afternoon interval training.This program continued for four days per week for three weeks. (On the remaining days, the athletes ran, cycled or swam at an easy pace and ate as they chose.)After three weeks, the athletes in the sleep-low group were grumbling about evening hunger.But when the researchers now repeated the simulated triathlon, those athletes in the sleep-low group showed notable improvement. Their times on the 10-kilometer running leg at the end of the race were faster by about 75 seconds, or 3 percent, than at the start of the study. The control group had not improved.The sleep-low volunteers also had lost body fat, while the other athletes had not.These findings suggest, said Laurie-Anne Marquet, a graduate student at the French National Institute of Sport who led the study, that exercising strenuously in the afternoon, depriving yourself of carbohydrates afterward, training gently the next morning and then swallowing a mound of pancakes might be a useful way to improve endurance and performance. The regimen seemed to have increased the athletes\u00e2\u0080\u0099 ability to access fat as muscle fuel, she said, allowing them to exercise harder during the workouts than the control group and gain additional fitness and speed.Such a rigorous routine is not for everyone, of course. Those of us not training for a marathon, triathlon or similar event probably would not enjoy or benefit from sleeping low. Even serious athletes should thread the approach into their training cautiously, Ms. Marquet said, beginning a few weeks before a race and easing off in the days just before the event, when they should down carbohydrates at will.Encouragingly for those tempted by the diet, though, \u00e2\u0080\u009cmost of the athletes\u00e2\u0080\u009d in the study, Ms. Marquet said, \u00e2\u0080\u009chave now integrated this strategy into their training.\u00e2\u0080\u009dRelated:Your health questions answered by Times journalists and\u00a0experts.Get Well's Running email for practical tips, expert advice, exclusive content and a bit of motivation delivered to your inbox every week to help you on your running journey.

Democrats want their presidents to act like unapologetic Democrats, just like Republicans act like unapologetic Republicans 100 percent of the time.This wasn\u2019t the time for compromise. With Trump and Cruz fighting for the nomination, Democrats and Obama should drive the ball hard up the middle and quit trying to be cute and clever.Her comment received more than 2,440 reader recommendations and was the most-recommended comment of the week.Either the G.O.P. refuses to consider the most reasonable option possible, and looks foolish, or Obama gets his nominee and can be respected for making a selection that was actually electable and will make a difference. People hoping for a hard-left candidate aren\u2019t able to see the forest through the trees.They seem to watch a lot of TV (CNN, Fox) and fear that if immigrants don\u2019t take their jobs, terrorists will get to them first. They have American-made cars, flat screen TVs, and fenced-in yards for dogs that are there to protect private property. Their children are christened and they go to mass on holidays.Donald Trump is a kind of political Dr. Phil. He gives them the opportunity to vent deep disappointment, frustration and resentment.His candidacy is a collective catharsis. His rallies are not about policy; they\u2019re about being heard: The supporters I know simply don\u2019t feel heard, not by me, not by our leaders. And unfortunately they don\u2019t engage in civil discourse or civic life because the work of life \u2014 houses, jobs, kids, health \u2014 is enormously weighty.I loathe Mr. Trump and I am terrified of his candidacy. But he has helped me to see that a \u201csilent\u201d if not \u201cmajority\u201d at least portion of his supporters are ordinary working people who feel left behind.He was moderate, had strong economic views, great foreign policy, but sadly people did not recognize this or just could not trust him. Hopefully as he matures and gets more involved with the Senate he can grow onto people, Democratic and Republican alike.In 2008, Hillary Clinton\u2019s candidacy was in the same slow-arcing death spiral that Sanders\u2019s is in now \u2014 so President Obama can empathize with what Clinton is facing.However, Sanders has every right to stay in the race through June, as did Ms. Clinton eight years ago. His candidacy has vociferous and progressive support, though outnumbered in the electoral system we have in place.Even if Sanders doesn\u2019t win, Democrats and the nation both win as Sanders\u2019s message continues to nourish the political soil for future progressive change to take root.Advertisement"}

It is its largest investment round yet.So-called robo-advisers, which offer retail investors low-cost portfolios of exchange traded funds through digital rather than human interaction, have boomed in the past few years and attracted the attention of established financial firms, some of which have scrambled to develop their own offerings and some of which have decided to acquire companies in the sector.Betterment, based in New York, had a $60 million investment round in February 2015, valuing it at $450 million. One of its earlier investors was Northwestern Mutual, a Milwaukee-based insurer that acquired the digital financial planning site LearnVest last year.Wealthfront, a San Francisco rival to Betterment, has attracted investments from Greylock Partners and Marc Andreessen, the Netscape founder and Facebook board member, among others.

{"Headline": "Trade Group Lobbying for Plant-Based Foods Takes a Seat in Washington", "Date": "2016-03-06", "News": "Supported byThe trade associations representing the beef, pork and poultry industries are among the most powerful lobbies in Washington. And they are about to get some company.\u201cWe\u2019re joining the barnyard,\u201d said Michele Simon, a public health lawyer and food policy advocate who is founding the new group, which is starting out with 23 companies including old-timers like Tofurky and newcomers like New Wave Foods that all make protein products from plants.Sales of products incorporating plant proteins grew 8.7 percent over 2014 and 2015 through retailers not including Whole Foods, while overall sales of food products grew 3.7 percent, according to Spins, which collects data on retail sales for the natural and specialty products industries.\u201cAt the highest level, we\u2019re seeing a pretty substantial shift in consumer interest in plant-based diets,\u201d said Jeff Dunn, president of the fresh division of Campbell\u2019s Soup. \u201cThat\u2019s manifesting itself in lots of interest in plant-based protein among companies like us and how it can be used in production.\u201dMr. Dunn says consumer interest in plant proteins is driven by a number of factors, including a belief that they are more healthy and have less impact on the environment than meat. This month, Campbell, which is not a member of the new trade group, is introducing new flavors of juices, three from its Bolthouse Farms brand and three from its 1915 brand, and will note on the packages that they contain plant proteins.\u201cThe challenge with pea proteins was getting the perfect texture and mouthfeel,\u201d said Scott LaPorta, president of Bolthouse.Elizabeth Kucinich, wife of the former congressman and presidential candidate Dennis Kucinich, will represent the Plant Based Foods Association in Washington, and she said it planned to represent a range of companies, not just those whose entire product line is built on plant proteins.Ms. Kucinich has already participated in discussions about food policy in Congress and written a letter to the Agriculture Department expressing disappointment over the failure to include a clear recommendation on reducing red meat consumption in the new dietary guidelines.In general, she said, her goal was to \u201clevel the playing field\u201d so that plant-based foods got the same consideration as meats in debates about school lunches, dietary recommendations and even environmental issues. \u201cIt\u2019s really to make sure we have a seat at the table,\u201d Ms. Kucinich said.\u201cI chose language to evoke a feeling of cheddar, adjectives that would bring it to mind, and they said you can\u2019t do that, it isn\u2019t cheese,\u201d Ms. Schinner said. \u201cThey kept saying it\u2019s not cheese \u2014 so what is it?\u201dThe regulators eventually decided to allow her to call it a \u201ccultured nut product.\u201dNow that the trade association has been formed, she says she has begun using the word \u201ccheese\u201d on her website and Facebook page.\u201cThe face of food is changing, how we make food and the origins of it,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s time for the regulatory system to catch up.\u201dAn article on Monday about a new Washington-based trade group representing companies that are developing foods from plant-derived proteins erroneously included one company among them.

He spoke then with James Estrin about his life and career. The conversation has been edited.While I was at Columbia I was very absorbed and interested in the arts, so when I became involved in photography I always thought of it as applied aesthetics. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a bad philosophy joke.I was doing the Lord\u00e2\u0080\u0099s work \u00e2\u0080\u0094 social/political photography during the day \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and at night I photographed art. At Columbia my field was aesthetics, and I knew quite a bit about art, and I photographed in the course of my career many of New York\u00e2\u0080\u0099s best-known artists, including Jim Rosenquist, Andy Warhol and Roy Lichtenstein.We have families, we belong to countries, we have affections and values that we care deeply about. Finding projects that would be meaningful in connection to these values that I had would be as much purpose as I could find.By 1964 and 1965 I was spending a lot of time with the civil rights movement.The photographs were very important, they were used as evidence in court cases, they were used to help raise money for the movement. Eventually some of my photographs were used in the congressional Kerner Commission. I know that Garry Winogrand famously said that photographs don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t change things. I think that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a very silly thing to say because they do.He loved to laugh too.Segregation was an organized system of terror that was instated and reinforced by the Klan or leaders of communities, and our fellow citizens were victimized. We needed photography to reveal this, to show people exactly what was going on, and the demonstrations progressively peeled away what racism and segregation meant.That night, he and his neighbors expected the Klan: He lived on the end of a dirt road and his neighbors had rifles. The demonstration, going to town had been nonviolent \u00e2\u0080\u0094 once he was home he felt he had the right to defend himself.The Klan came down the road shooting their guns up in the air. When they got close to the house there was a volley. There must have been 20 people out in the field there and they fired back and there was a gunfight. The Klan quickly retreated because they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not heroes, they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re just terrorists.In the \u00e2\u0080\u009960s and \u00e2\u0080\u009970s I got involved in housing, I got involved in the war on poverty, I worked for the Office of Economic Opportunity. It really made a big difference. We know during that decade that poverty was cut from 20 percent to 10 percent. The project I did for the Office of Economic Opportunity was with Indians, particularly in Arizona and North Dakota, living in grass huts and getting modest new homes.I did a lot of work with education. I originated a reading program, which was actually published by The New York Times, called \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe Sidewalk Series,\u00e2\u0080\u009d and I photographed and tape-recorded kids\u00e2\u0080\u0099 play activities. Kids were reading \u201cDick and Jane\u201d at the time, which they didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t relate to. So I brought in the fun and excitement of their after-school activities.Serious photography of social and political nature is not considered art in the same way as social and political art is quite acceptable in painting, music or literature.We picked a little Faulknerian town called Camden, Ala. There was a courthouse and old mansions. Blacks would come into the shop on Saturday, and the first bale of cotton was displayed on the street. Anyway, so I go back to that town as a bellwether for me of what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s changing and what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s staying the same.It hasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t been published, and now I call this project \u00e2\u0080\u009cHome Again.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The schools are desegregated, but not really integrated. Some white children go to the mostly black public schools, but there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a private school. The restaurants have been desegregated.

Mr. Kasich ended up claiming about 24 percent of the vote, and he won 43 percent of those who decided which candidate to vote for in the last week, according to exit polls.Mr. Kasich portrayed his finish in Michigan as an impressive achievement, citing earlier poll numbers that had put his support in the single digits.

{"Headline": "George Martin, Redefining Producer Who Guided the Beatles, Dies at 90", "Date": "2016-03-09", "News": "Supported byGeorge Martin, the urbane English record producer who signed the Beatles to a recording contract on the small Parlophone label after every other British record company had turned them down, and who guided them in their transformation from a regional dance band into the most inventive, influential and studio-savvy rock group of the 1960s, died on Tuesday at his home in Wiltshire, England. He was 90.His death was confirmed by Adam Sharp, a founder of CA Management, a British company that represented Mr. Martin.Mr. Martin helped redefine a record producer\u2019s role in pop music. He was one of a handful of pop producers \u2014 Phil Spector and Quincy Jones among them \u2014 to become almost as famous as the musicians they recorded. And when he left Parlophone, a subsidiary of EMI Records, to start his own production company in 1965, his reputation as the producer of the Beatles helped raise the stature of record production as an independent career, rather than as simply a record label function.A catalogue of Mr. Martin\u2019s major contributions as the fifth Beatle.In the dozen years before he met the Beatles, Mr. Martin produced symphonic, chamber and choral recordings, jazz albums and a string of popular comedy records by Peter Ustinov, Peter Sellers and Spike Milligan. In the 1960s, as the recordings he made with the Beatles rode the top of the charts, he also produced hits by other British Invasion acts, among them Gerry and the Pacemakers, Cilla Black and Billy J. Kramer and the Dakotas. He later worked with a diverse roster of pop and jazz performers, including Ella Fitzgerald, the Bee Gees, Jeff Beck, the Mahavishnu Orchestra, Paul Winter, Cheap Trick, America and Ultravox.His collaboration with the Beatles inevitably overshadowed his other accomplishments. From 1962 to 1970, Mr. Martin produced 13 albums and 22 singles for the group, a compact body of work that adds up to less than 10 hours of music but that revolutionized the popular music world. After the Beatles broke up, he virtually doubled that output, overseeing archival releases drawn from the group\u2019s concerts at the Hollywood Bowl, BBC radio performances and unreleased studio recordings that reveal a great deal about the Beatles\u2019 working process.A modest man who had been trained as a classical pianist and oboist, Mr. Martin always deflected credit for the Beatles\u2019 success, telling interviewers over the years that his own efforts were secondary to the songwriting genius of John Lennon, Paul McCartney and, to a lesser extent, George Harrison. The Beatles, for their part, recognized that Mr. Martin came to the job with a virtually infallible ear for arrangements. His advice and his behind-the-scenes scoring and editing gave some of the Beatles\u2019 greatest recordings their characteristic sound.When the Beatles played \u201cPlease Please Me\u201d for him for the first time, for example, it was in a slow arrangement meant to evoke the style of Roy Orbison, one of their heroes. Mr. Martin told them the song sounded dreary, and insisted that they pick up the tempo and add a simple harmonica introduction. His suggestions transformed \u201cPlease Please Me,\u201d which became their first big hit.Always intent on expanding the Beatles\u2019 horizons, Mr. Martin began chipping away at the group\u2019s resistance to using orchestral musicians on its recordings in early 1965. While recording the \u201cHelp!\u201d album that year, he brought in flutists for the simple adornment that enlivens Lennon\u2019s \u201cYou\u2019ve Got to Hide Your Love Away,\u201d and he convinced Mr. McCartney, against his initial resistance, that \u201cYesterday\u201d should be accompanied by a string quartet.A year later, during the recording of the album \u201cRevolver,\u201d Mr. Martin no longer had to cajole: The Beatles prevailed on him to augment their recordings with arrangements for strings (on \u201cEleanor Rigby\u201d), brass (on \u201cGot to Get You Into My Life\u201d), marching band (on \u201cYellow Submarine\u201d) and solo French horn (on \u201cFor No One\u201d), as well as a tabla player for Harrison\u2019s Indian-influenced song \u201cLove You To.\u201dIt was also at least partly through Mr. Martin\u2019s encouragement that the Beatles became increasingly interested in electronic sound. Noting their inquisitiveness about both the technical and musical sides of recording, Mr. Martin ignored the traditional barrier between performers and technicians and invited the group into the control room, where he showed them how the recording equipment at EMI\u2019s Abbey Road studios worked. He also introduced them to unorthodox recording techniques, including toying with tape speeds and playing tapes backward.Mr. Martin had used some of these techniques in his comedy and novelty recordings, long before he began working with the Beatles.Soon the Beatles themselves became intent on searching for new sounds, and Mr. Martin created another that the group adopted in 1966 (followed by many others). During the sessions for \u201cRain,\u201d Mr. Martin took part of Lennon\u2019s lead vocal and overlaid it, running backward, over the song\u2019s coda.\u201cFrom that moment,\u201d Mr. Martin said, \u201cthey wanted to do everything backwards. They wanted guitars backwards and drums backwards, and everything backwards, and it became a bore.\u201d The technique did, however, benefit \u201cI\u2019m Only Sleeping\u201d (with backward guitars) and \u201cStrawberry Fields Forever\u201d (with backward drums).Mr. Martin was never particularly trendy, and when the Beatles adopted the flowery fashions of psychedelia in 1966 and 1967 he continued to attend sessions in a white shirt and tie, his hair combed back in a schoolmasterly pre-Beatles style. Musically, though, he was fully in step with them. When Lennon wanted a circus sound for his \u201cBeing for the Benefit of Mr. Kite,\u201d Mr. Martin recorded a barrel organ and, following the example of John Cage, cut the tape into small pieces and reassembled them at random. His avant-garde orchestration and spacey production techniques made \u201cA Day in the Life\u201d into a monumental finale for the kaleidoscopic album \u201cSgt. Pepper\u2019s Lonely Hearts Club Band.\u201dGeorge Henry Martin was born in London on Jan. 3, 1926, to Henry and Bertha Martin. As a child, he was a talented and largely self-taught pianist who had perfect pitch and was able to learn classical pieces and popular tunes by ear. While a student at Bromley Grammar School he formed a dance band, George Martin and the Four Tune Tellers. He continued a part-time career as a pianist during World War II, when he was a pilot in the Fleet Air Arm of the British Navy. When one of his performances attracted the attention of a BBC producer, he was invited to play one of his compositions, a piano prelude, on the \u201cNavy Mixture\u201d radio program.After the war Mr. Martin attended the Guildhall School of Music, where he took up the oboe in addition to studying composition, conducting and piano. He worked briefly as a freelance oboist and as a clerk in the BBC\u2019s music library before he was invited to become an assistant to Oscar Preuss, the recording manager at Parlophone Records. When he succeeded Mr. Preuss in 1955, at 29, he was the youngest label manager at EMI.Parlophone was a poor relation among EMI\u2019s labels \u2014 HMV and Columbia were more prestigious \u2014 but it had a varied roster when Mr. Martin joined its staff in 1950. He was first assigned to the company\u2019s classical projects, including recordings by the London Baroque Ensemble and the conductors Malcolm Sargent and Charles Mackerras. But he soon moved on to orchestral pops, with Sidney Torch and the Queen\u2019s Hall Light Orchestra; jazz, with John Dankworth and Humphrey Lyttelton; popular vocal music, with Matt Monro; and comedy, with Mr. Ustinov, Mr. Sellers and the \u201cBeyond the Fringe\u201d troupe of Jonathan Miller, Peter Cook, Dudley Moore and Alan Bennett.For all its diversity, though, Parlophone had little success with rock \u2019n\u2019 roll until Mr. Martin began recording the Beatles. When Brian Epstein, the group\u2019s manager, called on Mr. Martin in early 1962, the Beatles had already been rejected by virtually every British record label, including the other EMI subsidiaries. Mr. Martin turned them down, too.But Sid Colman, the director of EMI\u2019s publishing arm, Ardmore & Beechwood, had heard demonstration discs of some early Lennon-McCartney songs, and pushed EMI to sign the group so that he could publish their music. The company resisted at first, but finally agreed, and assigned the band to Mr. Martin\u2019s Parlophone label.Mr. Martin remained uninterested, assigning the group\u2019s first session, on June 6, 1962, to Ron Richards, his assistant. But Mr. Richards found the Beatles interesting enough to send for Mr. Martin, who took over the session and was quickly won over by their charm and originality.Still, he had doubts. He told the Beatles that their drummer at the time, Pete Best, was not good enough to record. They had their own doubts about Mr. Best, and quickly replaced him with Mr. Starr. Mr. Martin also had qualms about the first Lennon-McCartney songs he heard \u2014 \u201cLove Me Do,\u201d \u201cP.S. I Love You\u201d and \u201cHello Little Girl\u201d \u2014 regarding them as derivative. He helped them find the spark that soon became their hallmark by insisting that they think carefully about their vocal harmonies and such niceties of the arranger\u2019s art as introductions and endings. They quickly internalized his advice.By the end of 1963 Mr. Martin was virtually coining money for EMI, not only with the Beatles\u2019 recordings but also with the hits he was producing for Gerry and the Pacemakers, Cilla Black and others.Mr. Martin did not at first share in the wealth these successes generated. When Mr. Epstein offered him a share of the Beatles\u2019 publishing, he turned it down on the grounds that it would be a conflict of interest. He had, however, been arguing since early 1962 that EMI should pay him a royalty on his productions, instead of a salary. In August 1965, when EMI refused to offer Mr. Martin more than a token bonus, he left the company and formed his own production company, Associated Independent Recording (AIR), along with two other producers from EMI and the competing Decca label. The Beatles insisted that EMI continue to engage Mr. Martin as their producer after AIR was established, as did most of Mr. Martin\u2019s other artists.In 1966, not long after he established AIR, Mr. Martin married Judy Lockhart-Smith, who had been his secretary at Parlophone. They had two children, Lucie and Giles. He also had two children, Alexis and Gregory, from an earlier marriage, to Sheena Chisolm, which ended in divorce. Survivors include his wife and children, as well as several grandchildren.AIR opened its own studio in London in 1970, and a Caribbean branch, on the Caribbean island Montserrat, in 1979. When the Montserrat studio was destroyed in a hurricane in 1989, Mr. Martin decided not to rebuild. But he compiled an album of recordings made at the studio by Mr. McCartney, the Rolling Stones, Dire Straits, the Police, Elton John and others as a charity for the 12,000 people who lost their homes in the storm.In 1993 Mr. Martin opened AIR Lyndhurst, a state-of-the-art studio in a converted Victorian church in London, which has become an important studio for orchestral film soundtrack recording. Mr. Martin remained involved in its operation long after he stopped producing recordings in the late 1990s.\u201cI\u2019m there every week,\u201d he said in 2003. \u201cI listen to my friends who come and do film recording. I love sitting in a 100-piece orchestra and listening. And I still do a bit of writing, and I help a bit with studio work sometimes.\u201dAs a composer, Mr. Martin supplied incidental music to the soundtracks of several films, including the Beatles\u2019 \u201cA Hard Day\u2019s Night\u201d and \u201cYellow Submarine\u201d as well as \u201cLive and Let Die,\u201d \u201cHonky Tonk Freeway\u201d and \u201cPulp.\u201d He wrote the music for a recording of Dylan Thomas\u2019s \u201cUnder Milk Wood\u201d that he produced in 1989, using an entirely Welsh cast of actors and singers. Having made several recordings of his own arrangements of Beatles songs in the 1960s, he periodically conducted orchestras, mostly in Europe and Latin America, in concerts of Beatles music.In the late 1990s, he toured as a lecturer, speaking about the making of \u201cSgt. Pepper\u201d and tantalizing listeners with excerpts from the unreleased session tapes for that album. His last Beatles project was a collaboration with his son Giles, also a record producer, on the 2006 soundtrack for \u201cLove,\u201d the Cirque du Soleil show for which Beatles recordings were remixed and recombined.Mr. Martin was also the host of several television programs, including \u201cThe Making of Sgt. Pepper\u201d in 1992 and \u201cThe Glory of Gershwin\u201d in 1993, and he wrote a handful of books, among them \u201cAll You Need Is Ears\u201d (1979), \u201cSummer of Love: The Making of Sgt. Pepper\u201d (1994) and a lavishly illustrated limited-edition autobiography, \u201cPlayback\u201d (2003). He was made a Commander of the British Empire in 1988 and was awarded a knighthood in 1996.Austin Ramzy contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Afghan Court Confirms Reduced Sentences in Mob Killing of Farkhunda", "Date": "2016-03-08", "News": "Supported byAnother was an Afghan intelligence agent who bragged on Facebook that he had the honor of striking the fatal blow against her. Another man drove his car over her, twice.The country\u2019s first lady, Rula Ghani, making the keynote address for the occasion before a gathering including many women\u2019s leaders, acknowledged the disappointment and tried to assure the audience that the Supreme Court decision in \u201cthe case of our dear martyred Farkhunda\u201d would be reconsidered. And she drew attention to progress for Afghan women under the government of her husband, President Ashraf Ghani. \u201cThe reforms brought in the judiciary system are in favor of women,\u201d she said.Still, there was a growing sense of outrage among the women who had gathered to observe the day.\u201cEven if all those involved would be executed, it is still not enough,\u201d said Maryam, a police colonel who leads a human rights office in an elite unit, and who uses just one name.Of 49 men originally arrested in Farkhunda\u2019s killing, only 13 have so far been given serious penalties \u2014 nearly all of them greatly reduced on appeal. All the death sentences were vacated.The mob murder of Farkhunda on March 19 last year was initially greeted with public jubilation here, even among many government officials, until evidence mounted that she had been falsely accused. Rather than burning the Quran, she had been working to defend it: She was an Islamic scholar who was upset by the shady goings-on at the Shah-Do Shamshira Mosque, one of Kabul\u2019s most popular shrines. Those included un-Islamic practices like fortunetelling and selling amulets, as well as allegations of pimping and prostitution.Nineteen of the people arrested in connection with Farkhunda\u2019s death were police officers accused of failing to intervene to save her; most of the policemen were given token penalties, such as pay reductions or cancellation of leave time while on duty.Thirty other cases were prosecuted, but 17 of those were dismissed by an appeals court. In the remaining 13 cases, the appeals court recommended the reduction of sentences, leading lawyers representing the victim\u2019s family to appeal to the Supreme Court.While the court\u2019s decision was made a month ago, according to lawyers for Farkhunda\u2019s family, it was kept secret until a brief announcement late on Monday by the attorney general\u2019s office.Yalda Nasimi, one of the family\u2019s lawyers, said the family would ask the Supreme Court to reconsider its decision, which was apparently what Mrs. Ghani was referring to. Ms. Nasimi said a petition would be lodged with the court within two months.The controversy surrounding the case led Farkhunda\u2019s family to flee to neighboring Tajikistan, where they remain. \u201cNot only do we oppose the decision of the Supreme Court, but the entire nation is dissatisfied,\u201d said Farkhunda\u2019s brother, Mujibullah Malikzada, reached by telephone in Dushanbe. \u201cI\u2019m not saying that the perpetrators must be lynched the way they lynched my sister. But all I want is fairness and justice, which has not been done.\u201dHasina Safi, the director of the Afghan Women\u2019s Network, a coalition of advocacy groups, said the court\u2019s decision would not lessen the determination of activists to pursue the case. \u201cWe are going to begin again tomorrow to organize on social media, and we are trying to take this case up internationally,\u201d she said. \u201cJustice for Farkhunda is justice for all of Afghanistan\u2019s women.\u201dMany women in government were more circumspect, possibly because of the embarrassment the case has brought to the country at a time when its leaders are emphasizing gains in women\u2019s rights. Five officials of the Ministry of Women\u2019s Affairs who were at Mrs. Ghani\u2019s speech Tuesday were contacted and refused to comment on the Supreme Court\u2019s decision.Of the four men formerly sentenced to death in the case, three had their sentences reduced to 20 years, including the custodian of the shrine, Zainuddin; the intelligence agent, Sharaf Baghlani; and the defendant who drove his car over Farkhunda\u2019s body, Abdul Basheer.Muhammad Yaqoub, the optician\u2019s employee, had his death sentence reduced to 10 years in prison because the appeals court said he was 17 at the time of the crime. Some activists have disputed that he was underage, however, and the original trial court said his age had been determined from faked documents.Baseer Azizi, the spokesman for the attorney general\u2019s office, said that while the reduced sentences were confirmed by the Supreme Court\u2019s decision, the court had also ordered a review of the other cases that had been dismissed earlier. Most of those cases \u2014 believed to number 17, although accounts vary \u2014 involved much lesser penalties.Ahmad Shakib contributed reporting from Kabul, and Alissa J.

{"Headline": "A \u2018Wall of Kindness\u2019 Against a Harsh Reality in Afghanistan", "Date": "2016-03-24", "News": "Supported byKabul JournalKABUL, Afghanistan \u2014 When the Wall of Kindness finally reached Kabul, it was an idea whose time had not quite come.The concept itself is simple: Paint an outdoor wall in a bright color, usually sky blue, decorate it with slogans about how giving to the poor enriches the giver as much as the receiver, then provision the wall with nails so passers-by can hang up clothing to donate.The messages on the walls have varied \u2014 peace, kindness, poetry \u2014 but they have all included this command: \u201cIf you don\u2019t need it, leave it; if you need it, take it.\u201dBut in Kabul no one seemed interested until a 16-year-old named Halima Behroz was watching a televised report about an Iranian wall. She turned to her brother, Abdul Latif, 17, and said, \u201cLet\u2019s do it.\u201dAbdul had some experience painting walls, as a graffiti artist who roams town with a group spray-painting peace slogans and scrawling murals. He rounded up his crew, about 20 high schoolers ages 14 to 17, and with Halima started the Lantern Charity Group.Being well-brought-up, they also got their parents\u2019 permission for the project. They come from middle-class families whose parents support education for boys and girls \u2014 and more than half are girls. They include Sakina Saidi, 14, who has two older brothers (\u201cThey don\u2019t tell me what to do\u201d) in Kabul and a father who runs a food stall in Kuwait and sends money home to pay the tuition for her private school.Sakina\u2019s father told the members of the group that he would match whatever funds they raised to get started, she said, so they pooled their pocket money and savings and soon had 7,000 afghanis, or about $100. That would be enough for spray paint and nails, plus bus fare to transport group members to the future wall.\u201cMy father\u2019s cool,\u201d she said.Money proved to be the least of their problems. The owner of a building in the busy downtown area of Shar-e Naw, which had an invitingly blank wall on a busy street, refused to let them use it, on the grounds that crowds might gather and attract a suicide bomber. They were turned away from Kabul University, told it would be defacing government property.In a jittery capital, they heard the security objection a lot. But here they were, a bunch of high schoolers, comparatively unafraid. What was the adults\u2019 problem? The last suicide bombing, after all, was three weeks earlier; it\u2019s not like they happen every day, and Kabul is a city of five million.Finally, way out on Darulaman Road, the principal of Habibia High School allowed them to use a patch of the compound wall around his institution, a public school but an elite one, where President Ashraf Ghani once studied. They painted their wall salmon, with blue inscriptions, including one, \u201cHumanity is my dream,\u201d a famous line by the poet Afghans know as Maulana, but the rest of the world knows as Rumi. He was a 13th-century Persian, but he was born in Balkh, in what is now Afghanistan.The high school principal, Sayed Shah Bakabuli, was not entirely persuaded. \u201cI gave them my permission because I know it is for a good cause, but I still have my concerns that, God forbid, it should be taken advantage of by the bad guys,\u201d he said.The youths had other problems. After they pounded their nails in, they returned the next morning to find that someone had stolen them all.\u201cI guess they needed nails,\u201d Abdul said, but quickly recovered his composure. \u201cIt\u2019s O.K. We have more.\u201dThen, for frustratingly long periods, they had a Wall of Kindness, but not much kindness. Hardly anyone was leaving garments. Young men would stroll by and mock them.\u201cThey were bullies, looking for a fight,\u201d said another member of their group, Ali Roman, 16, an 11th grader who said his goal in life is to go into business and get rich \u2014 so he can have more money to give to the poor.\u201cWe just told them we\u2019re here to promote peace, not to fight anyone,\u201d Abdul said. \u201cI myself have lost two of my friends to suicide bombers in Kabul. I know how it feels, and I don\u2019t want to lose more friends.\u201d\u201cWhat did they expect?\u201d Sakina said. \u201cA lot of us are girls.\u201d\u201cWe faced so many problems,\u201d said Halima, who like her friends insisted on being interviewed in English \u2014 although she added that she could use Chinese, if preferred. \u201cStreet harassment, many people who are against girls even to go to schools, let alone make a new thing like this.\u201dOne day this month, the group was finding few clients, either givers or takers, at the wall on Darulaman Road, which begins in a squalid slum next to the fetid Kabul River, and ends at the old royal palace, a bullet-and-bomb-riddled monument to the civil war years. The new array of nails sported two T-shirts, another shirt and a pair of camo trousers, plus a jacket.Along came a janitor from the school, Muhammad Hashem, 50, who picked up the shirt for one of his four children. \u201cI don\u2019t know who did this, but it\u2019s great,\u201d he said, explaining that his salary was only 6,000 afghanis ($85) a month, so he wasn\u2019t buying a lot of clothing most months.Kabul\u2019s young humanitarians were conferring recently about their Wall of Kindness conundrum and came up with a new idea. They would go en masse to the homes of rich Kabulis.\u201cWe\u2019ll ask them to give us their clothes,\u201d Sakina said.Then they could seed the wall, and maybe get things going for real.Jawad Sukhanyar contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton Draw Sharp Questions at Fox News Forum", "Date": "2016-03-08", "News": "DETROIT \u00e2\u0080\u0094 The night after a testy Democratic debate, Senator Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton had the chance to confront another adversary: Fox News.On Monday, the news network hosted a forum at which the host, Bret Baier, grilled both candidates on topics that seldom come up at Democratic events, including abortion rights, the national debt and the slaughter of Christians in the Middle East.For Mr. Sanders, the forum gave him a chance to continue his criticism of Mrs. Clinton over her support for the Wall Street bailout, her mixed record on international trade deals and her 2002 vote to authorize the use of force in Iraq. But he also used the question-and-answer session at the Gem Theater here to clarify some of his remarks from the Sunday debate in nearby Flint, Mich., including a comment that white people \u00e2\u0080\u009cdon\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know what it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s like to be poor\u00e2\u0080\u009d or  about \u00e2\u0080\u009cliving in a ghetto.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00e2\u0080\u009cThere is no candidate in this race who has talked more about poverty than I have,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Sanders said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat I meant by that is that in African-American communities you have people living in desperation often being abused by white police officers,\u00e2\u0080\u009d but he added, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI know about white poverty.\u00e2\u0080\u009dPressed on his budget-busting plans for universal health care, Mr. Sanders reiterated his belief that health care is a right for all people. \u00e2\u0080\u009cExcuse me, where does that right come from, in your mind?\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Baier asked. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBeing a human being,\u201d Mr. Sanders replied, \u201cbeing a human being,\u00e2\u0080\u009dBoth Mr. Sanders and Mrs. Clinton said they believed abortion \u00e2\u0080\u0094 a topic that rarely comes up at Democratic debates but that sometimes dominates the Republican stage \u00e2\u0080\u0094 is a decision best left to women, their doctors and their families.\u00e2\u0080\u009cI have been on record in favor of a late pregnancy regulation that would have exceptions for the life and health of the mother,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mrs. Clinton said, adding that she objected to recent efforts in Congress to pass a law that would ban abortions after 20 weeks without exceptions.Mr. Baier aggressively questioned Mrs. Clinton on her handling of the 2011 intervention in Libya that is widely credited with the current instability in the region. As secretary of state, Mrs. Clinton had urged the White House to back the United States-led NATO coalition that ousted Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi\u00e2\u0080\u009cOnce it became clear to him that the people of Libya were trying to get more freedom and hopefully a better future,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said of the uprisings against Mr. Qaddafi during the Arab Spring, \u201che basically said he was going to hunt them down like cockroaches.\u00e2\u0080\u009dLeaving him in power, she said, would have led to many more deaths. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s been a couple years,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mrs. Clinton continued. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThey haven\u00e2\u0080\u0099t been as successful as their neighbor Tunisia, but they are attempting to move forward.\u00e2\u0080\u009dAsked by a 13-year-old in the audience whether she considered Mr. Sanders an ally or an adversary, Mrs. Clinton quickly said, \u201cOh, an ally for sure!\u201d\u201cLike we saw in the debate last night, we air those differences about issues,\u201d Mrs. Clinton told the boy, Samuel. \u201cCompare that to the Republicans and how they behave.\u201dMrs. Clinton has not done a sit-down interview with Fox News, which hosted the last Republican debate, in two years, and she agreed to the forum the day before the Michigan primary after Mr. Sanders said he would attend.Mr. Baier questioned her about her use of a private email server while at the State Department and whether she knowingly sent or received classified emails. \u00e2\u0080\u009cNothing I sent was marked classified or that I received was marked classified,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said.\u00e2\u0080\u009cI have said it wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t the best choice to use a personal email. It was a mistake,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mrs. Clinton said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cHowever, I am not alone in that. Many people in the government, past and current, have on occasion or as a practice done the same.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00e2\u0080\u009cI have the greatest respect for Mike Bloomberg,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mrs. Clinton said of the billionaire philanthropist, whom she worked with as a senator from New York. \u00e2\u0080\u009cHe has to make his own decisions.\u00e2\u0080\u009dAsked which Republicans they have good relationships with, both Democratic candidates, who were not onstage together, hesitated. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIf I tell you that person, it will be a disservice to that person,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Sanders said.Mrs. Clinton named Senator Susan Collins of Maine and Senator John McCain of Arizona, but she added: \u00e2\u0080\u009cI hesitate to mention any more names. It will probably hurt them and I do want to work with them.\u00e2\u0080\u009dSeeming relieved, Mrs. Clinton beamed, \u201cOh my gosh, it went by so fast, Bret!\u201d when the hourlong special had reached its conclusion.\n\t\tFirst Draft provides fast-paced and comprehensive coverage of politics and elections by The New York Times.

{"Headline": "Obama Often Depends on Mail to Tell His Story", "Date": "2016-03-13", "News": "Supported byWhite House LetterSo when it came time this month for Mr. Obama to promote the Affordable Care Act in Milwaukee, Mr. Brown, 32, got the chance to sit down for a lunch with the president, and then introduce him to a crowd of 700 at a middle school there.\u201cI would not be alive without access to care I received due to your law,\u201d Mr. Brown, who recently had surgery to treat his disorder, a chronic inflammation of the bowels, had written to the president. \u201cSo thank you from a dumb young man who thought he knew it all and who said things about you that he now regrets.\u201dBut these days, Mr. Obama is increasingly using the letters in his travels across the country to try to burnish his record and add more emotion to his message. Whenever the president is planning a trip somewhere, Fiona Reeves, the director of the Office of Presidential Correspondence, is asked to pore through her files to find letter writers in the area Mr. Obama may want to meet or feature onstage with him.\u201cThey are, I think, the least-vetted content that he gets,\u201d Ms. Reeves said of the president\u2019s letters. \u201cIf you work at the White House and write something for the president, a lot of people review it to make sure it\u2019s thorough or accurate, or that it\u2019s ready for the president to see it. If you write to the president, you go through this pretty low-filter channel of our volunteers and staff and straight to his desk.\u201dThe letters supply Mr. Obama with piles of ready anecdotes that White House staff members say make policy, and the president, more accessible.\u201cA lot of times it\u2019s easy to talk about issues in terms of the abstract and the statistical, but that doesn\u2019t resonate as much,\u201d said Jason Goldman, the director of Mr. Obama\u2019s Office of Digital Strategy, which draws on the letters to help amplify the president\u2019s message through Facebook, Twitter and other channels. \u201cIt\u2019s this sort of empathy shortcut where you immediately understand this person\u2019s perspective.\u201dA couple of weeks later, it was Brianna Leathers of Sterling Heights, Mich., who in 2009 had written to Mr. Obama in round, bubbly print on lined notebook paper about her fears about the American automobile industry, then teetering on the edge of collapse. \u201cI am 13 years old, and I\u2019m worried about my family\u2019s future in Michigan,\u201d she wrote at the time.Cody Keenan, Mr. Obama\u2019s speechwriter, who began his political career sorting through Senator Edward M. Kennedy\u2019s mail, draws heavily from the president\u2019s letters in drafting his message.\u201cI haven\u2019t lived everybody\u2019s life, and neither has the president,\u201d Mr. Keenan said in an interview. \u201cThe letters can give us a flavor of somebody else\u2019s life. You\u2019ve got to be able to speak to an audience where they are, and they let him do that.\u201dMr. Obama is hardly the first president to receive, respond to or act on letters he receives from ordinary Americans, or to feature real-world stories to help him relate to a remote public.Franklin Delano Roosevelt, he added, \u201ccame on the scene and tried to establish this very personal connection with the fireside chats, and the saying at the time was, \u2018It\u2019s as if the president is in my living room.\u2019\u00a0\u201dMr. Brown never expected his letter would reach the president, figuring instead that it would probably go into an anonymous government inbox somewhere, never to be read by anyone.\u201cThis is like writing to Santa,\u201d Mr. Brown said in an interview. \u201cYou\u2019re certainly not expecting a response.\u201dWhen the White House called asking him to introduce the president, he had little hesitation. He was so concerned that a future Republican president might repeal the health care measure, he said, that he had opted for surgery to remove his colon rather than to continue a less invasive and risky course: drug infusions that relieved his symptoms.\u201cAnyone who would say to me it was better the way it was before this law,\u201d Mr. Brown said, \u201cI just can\u2019t buy that.\u201dAdvertisement"}

They compared retirees with their peers who were still working, looking at such health measures as smoking, alcohol consumption, physical activity, diet and sleep.After adjusting for initial health risks, they found that on average, retirees walked for 17 minutes more a week, and engaged in moderate-intensity exercise 45 minutes more a week. They slept about 15 minutes more a night than they did when they were working.

No. And yet, hundreds of thousands of people (and a few bots) still follow him. That\u2019s because technology still connects us (me) to David.In a sense, that\u2019s what technology has always done. That\u2019s true with planes, trains and automobiles. And that\u2019s true with smartphones, social networks and search engines. They, and other technologies, connect us to people who are not with us, geographically or physically, and make us feel a little less alone in this big confusing world.I still follow her on Facebook. Her emails are still saved in my inbox (though I feel guilty for having not replied to some), as is a video she sent me two Christmases ago explaining how to make her famous chocolate cake.Thankfully, because of that front-facing camera, I get to scroll through pictures of her that she sent over the years.We do so through the digital footprints left behind on Facebook and Twitter, the photos on our smartphones, and all the morsels scooped up by search engines. Technology allows us to connect.So does the good outweigh the bad? For me, yes. And I think it will in the future too, as newer technologies force us to grapple with even bigger ethical quandaries.Take driverless cars, which I believe will have a huge, unknowable impact on society. When that technology becomes widely adopted \u2014 some say this will happen in two years; others say 20 \u2014 many will lament the negatives. Pizza delivery guys, truckers, taxi drivers and countless others could lose their jobs. Hackers and terrorists may turn driverless cars into weapons. Teenagers everywhere will no longer experience the joy of getting a driver\u2019s license.And yet, there will be many positives as well. Roads may be converted into parks. Finding parking may become a thing of the past (as will parking tickets). Driving time may be reclaimed for more productive or enjoyable activities, like watching movies, exercising or sleeping.We will worry about these new technologies. We will question them. We will demand changes. And we should.But in the end, as people use the things we create for harm, there will be a lot more instances when they are used for good. And, most important, when they make us all feel a little more connected, and a little less alone.#gotyermessage.Advertisement"}

This is crucial as he expands his empire beyond e-commerce into areas such as finance. The process isn\u2019t smooth however: Jack has already encountered powerful vested interests such as opposition from state-owned banks alarmed by the rapid growth of his money market fund or plans for an online bank.Alibaba became famous for Taobao, the platform where small merchants or individuals sell a wide range of third-party products \u2014 including fake products, especially in the early days. Merchants who pass off fake products as real can expect to see their store ratings and business suffer. Alibaba can also shut down the Alipay accounts of repeat offenders, and use big data to analyze trading patterns.But Alibaba\u2019s success hangs increasingly on another platform, Tmall, where brand owners sell their own \u2014 real \u2014 products, or via large retailers, directly to consumers. Taobao was vital to Alibaba\u2019s past success. Tmall is the key to its future, as Alibaba generates a commission on every sale. By contrast, on Taobao, Alibaba relies purely on advertising revenue.But China will likely remain beyond Facebook\u2019s grasp. China has hardly stood still without Facebook: Tencent\u2019s WeChat is a dominant player in China already, superior in some important ways to Facebook especially in mobile.

On arrival, Mr. Sauter, 41, was arrested over a prior panhandling incident, but Bambi and Ms. Kask continued with a new friend, Matt Johnson, or Smerph, who grew up in a family of train riders. He taught them the moves. Later the group met up with others, including Deverayn Armstrong, 26, who had been in and out of foster homes before taking to riding the rails.Ms. Kask hopped on her first freight train \u00e2\u0080\u0094 a gondola car full of scrap metal \u00e2\u0080\u0094 near Bowling Green, Ky.

Mr. Kasich plans to focus on Michigan, whose primary is March 8, and his home state of Ohio, which votes on March 15.\u201cI win Ohio, which I expect I will do, it\u2019s a whole new ballgame,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI mean, it\u2019s all back open again.

{"Headline": "First Russian Jets Leave Syria After Putin\u2019s Withdrawal Order", "Date": "2016-03-15", "News": "Supported byThe jets flew home after the Russian Air Force contingent began loading equipment and making other technical preparations necessary to start the withdrawal, the ministry said in a statement.The statement did not specify the number of aircraft. Russia deployed about 50 fighter jets and attack helicopters to the base starting in September.The Rossiya 24 satellite news channel broadcast live footage of the first two fighter jets landing at an air base in the southern city of Voronezh. The first pilot to emerge was repeatedly carried aloft by fellow soldiers on the ground, as a small crowd of well-wishers waved Russian flags and a brass band played.The partial cease-fire in Syria, which began Feb. 27, has proved more effective and durable than expected, significantly reducing the level of violence.Russia has also long maintained a naval repair and refueling station on the coast at Tartus, its sole overseas military outpost.Dmitri S. Peskov, Mr. Putin\u2019s spokesman, said on Monday after the announcement that some forces would stay behind and that both facilities would remain in operation.The deployment of Russian forces helped turn the tide of the war in favor of President Bashar al-Assad of Syria. The sudden announcement of their withdrawal will put pressure on the government in Damascus to be more flexible in peace talks with the opposition.Staffan de Mistura, the United Nations mediator for Syria, praised Mr. Putin in a statement on Tuesday, calling the withdrawal a \u201csignificant development\u201d as peace talks resumed in Geneva.Mr. de Mistura said he hoped the announcement would \u201chave a positive impact on the progress of the negotiations in Geneva aimed at achieving a political solution of the Syrian conflict and a peaceful political transition in the country.\u201dSyrian opposition negotiators, who were to hold their first formal meeting with Mr. de Mistura, also expressed hope that the Russian pullout would give new impetus to the talks.\u201cWe read it as a positive move because Assad is putting a stick in the wheel of the political process\u201d that Russia, together with other powers, had set in motion, Farah Atassi, a member of the opposition\u2019s High Negotiations Committee, said in Geneva. \u201cThis is a very political message to the Assad regime that he cannot rely on them all the time and has to play by the rules.\u201dModern Russia has inflamed conflict in former Soviet republics to create \u201cfrozen zones,\u201d allowing it to influence events and confound its opponents.Although the timing of the announcement caught Western powers by surprise, the withdrawal of the Russian forces was not entirely unexpected. Mr. Putin has achieved his main goals in Syria, including shoring up Moscow\u2019s foremost Arab ally; preventing the West from forcing a leadership change from the outside; and burnishing Russia\u2019s image as a major player on the world stage.In addition, should Mr. Assad require renewed support on the battlefield, the small but effective Russian force could easily be redeployed.But at the same time, heavy Russian airstrikes on the city continued on Tuesday. Footage of the attacks was broadcast on the Lebanese channel Al Mayadeen, which is close to the Damascus government.Seeking to capitalize on the confusion, the Nusra Front, the Qaeda affiliate in Syria, said in statements to the news media that it would begin a new offensive in 48 hours.The Nusra Front has clashed recently with American-backed rebel groups in the northern province of Idlib, where tensions have risen after protests broke out during the recent partial cease-fire.Demonstrators carried the flags of the pre-Baathist Syrian state, as Nusra militants denounced a pro-democracy movement and insisted on the use of its black flag, which carries the Islamic declaration of faith.In the ensuing clashes, the militants forced a major rebel group, Division 13, out of its headquarters in the town of Maarat al-Noaman; protesters later attacked and burned a Nusra Front office.Neil MacFarquhar reported from Moscow, and Anne Barnard from Beirut, Lebanon. Nick Cumming-Bruce contributed reporting from Geneva, and an employee of The New York Times from Damascus, Syria.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Anri Sala Discusses the Impulses Behind His Video Art", "Date": "2016-03-24", "News": "Supported byReached via Skype in his sunny Berlin studio, Mr. Sala came across as modest and direct in discussing a career that is now almost two decades old. He was born in Tirana, Albania, in 1974, and before moving to Berlin in 2003, he studied art in Paris. That French education left its mark: He favors abstract Continental ideas but doesn\u2019t seem to have caught any of the irony or cynicism that can come with French postmodernism. His majestic video and sound installations, on view at the museum through April 10, have that same mix of the complex and the forthright.These are edited excerpts from the conversation.As someone who grew up under a Communist dictatorship, how did you learn the language of contemporary art?Well, contemporary art, as it has evolved in the Western world, was completely forbidden in Albania, from Impressionism onward. Everything that had to do with culture was censored. You were constantly aware not only of what you should say, and what you shouldn\u2019t say, but also of how you should say it, and how you should not say it. Before I entered high school, I participated in a competition for \u201cyoung talents.\u201d I saw the paintings being hung, but when I went to the opening with my parents\u2014I was 10 or 11 years old\u2014the works were no longer there, because the committee had disqualified everything that was \u201cwrong.\u201dSo how did you go from zero exposure to Western contemporary art to being at the center of that world?Well, my mother was a director of the National Library. Everything that was forbidden in the country would be put into what could be called \u201cblack storage,\u201d and there you would have books of Kandinsky or Klee, and I could see some of them. I remember one painting by Magritte \u2014 the man seen from in back, against a mirror, where he is also seen from in back. [The painting was \u201cNot to Be Reproduced (A Portrait of Edward James)\u201d from 1937.] And being so intrigued, and lost \u2014 liking it and not liking it, since I couldn\u2019t understand it.You\u2019ve talked about how we now live in a time ofboundless acceleration \u2014 how has the culture of Twitter and Facebook and instant feedback affected you?It does not directly affect my work, but I\u2019m aware that it affects how my work is perceived and apprehended. Being with your phone, or being with Instagram, or being with a text message affects your awareness of what is really going on in the present moment. In my work, the experience is so important. The presence of the viewers, their trajectory, what they hear\u2014all these things clash with the Internet.A number of your colleagues in video art\u2014Steve McQueen, Omer Fast, Stan Douglas\u2014have moved in the direction of traditional theatrical presentations. Have you had any offers for feature film work?What interests me is the film that a visitor has in his head after leaving my exhibition: how my various films correlate, the space between my films, their relation to the architecture of the space, the way you never lose track that you are where you are. The cinema wants to make you forget that you are where you are.No. In the film, everything which is vertical looks bright and colorful, but everything which is horizontal, on the ground, looks as though the place had come through a war \u2014 the city had started working on its sewers, and that\u2019s why the roads look upside down. Such infrastructure takes much more time, and also more money, while the painting of the buildings was done very quickly, with very little money. The painting project was just the spice that was needed to evoke the flavor of what was to come. My film is a portrait of a project that promises that something will be different in the future.For your 2005 video projection called \u201cLong Sorrow,\u201d you hung the saxophonist Jemeel Moondoc 25 stories up on the facade of a 1960s housing project from West Berlin, then invited him to play free jazz from his perch. What led you to put him in that precarious position?I was in a concert, and suddenly it just came to me.The building was built exactly as the Berlin Wall was being built. Many people from the East had made the choice to live in West Berlin, so the city had to respond by building more apartment units. I was interested in the architecture of those years \u2014 in its very good ideas that didn\u2019t necessarily work.That building happens to be one of the longest buildings in Europe, being 1.8 kilometers [1.1 miles] long, and it was nicknamed Long Sorrow. The whole vibe around the building was completely negative \u2014 but not deservedly, because when you see how it dealt with space, it\u2019s not a complete failure.I added the two I-beams holding spotlights above the musician to make the setting look like a stage. I wanted to show how it would be if every apartment became the stage for someone\u2019s creativity, for how someone relates to the world.Is there a sense that there was a redeeming quality in having this wonderful free jazz floating out into the air in front of a failed building?Yes \u2014 something where things are still at stake, because there are many of the ideals of that architecture that are still at stake.The film opens that possibility, but I try not to confirm it with my words. What I can say is that compositions for the left hand would never have existed without all the mutilation that happened because of the Great War. On the piano, when you play a piece with two hands, the center of your body is in front of the center of the piano. But the moment you are playing with only the left hand, the whole body has to move to the right edge of the piano, to make up for something that went missing. So the effort of the body to make up for the loss speaks about society, about war.In recent pieces, you\u2019ve chosen to engage with classical music, whose relevance is often seen as fading.The detachment from today\u2019s culture is something that interests me. We love many classical pieces, but they are far enough away that they have become like archaeological objects we can approach with some form of objectivity.

{"Headline": "American Tech Giants Face Fight in Europe Over Encrypted Data", "Date": "2016-03-27", "News": "Supported byROME \u2014 Silicon Valley\u2019s battle over encryption is heading to Europe.This week, French lawmakers are expected to debate proposals to toughen laws, giving intelligence services greater power to get access to personal data.The battle has pitted Europe\u2019s fears about the potential for further attacks against concerns from Apple and other American technology giants like Google and Facebook that weakening encryption technologies may create so-called back doors to people\u2019s digital information that could be misused by European law enforcement officials, or even intelligence agencies of unfriendly countries.The recent attacks have pushed many Europeans to favor greater powers for law enforcement over privacy. But opponents say such measures should not undermine the region\u2019s tough data protection rules that enshrine privacy on par with other rights like freedom of expression.This balance between national security and privacy has put major countries in the region on opposite sides of the debate, with Germany and the Netherlands dismissing encryption laws being considered by Britain and France.\u201cFundamental rights are just that, fundamental,\u201d said Nico van Eijk, a data protection expert at the University of Amsterdam. \u201cOf course, there are exceptions for national security reasons. But governments have to be pragmatic.\u201dThat pragmatism has led to a series of new proposals across Europe that, if approved, would give national intelligence agencies renewed powers to compel the likes of Apple, Google and Facebook to hand over encrypted information.And on Tuesday, French politicians will debate proposals to update antiterrorism laws that may hand tech executives prison sentences of up to five years, as well as fine their companies around $390,000, if they refuse to provide encrypted information to the country\u2019s investigators.Amendments to the French law \u2014 itself a response to the attacks in November \u2014 may still pass without the encryption proposals, which are opposed by France\u2019s left-wing government.But politicians and industry executives say Apple\u2019s fight with the F.B.I. has focused a spotlight on how companies\u2019 efforts to protect users\u2019 messages and other data have made it increasingly difficult for European intelligence agencies to obtain such information.\u201cWhen we\u2019re able to recover a cellphone, but authorities have no way of accessing its data, it obviously cripples the work of our surveillance agencies,\u201d said Philippe Goujon, a French politician behind the recent encryption proposals.\u201cSure, this could have repercussions internationally,\u201d he added. \u201cBut there are other countries in the world that have similar legislation.\u201dAll the talk about data privacy can get caught up in political wrangling. But the different approaches have practical consequences for people, too.Europe\u2019s attempts to get access to encrypted data have not gone unchallenged by Apple.Timothy D. Cook, Apple\u2019s chief executive, has, for instance, met with a string of European politicians, including France\u2019s prime minister, Manuel Valls, and Britain\u2019s home secretary, Theresa May, in recent months to lobby for tough encryption technology.And to show that the company is trying to be cooperative, Apple\u2019s executives have also provided unencrypted information, including so-called metadata on people\u2019s phone calls and GPS coordinates, as part of terrorism investigations in Europe, according to a person with knowledge of the matter, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak publicly.Such efforts, in part, have paid off with some European governments that remain skeptical of plans to weaken companies\u2019 encryption technology in the name of national security.Such loopholes, the Dutch government said, would \u201calso make encrypted files vulnerable to criminals, terrorists and foreign intelligence services.\u201dAs pressure in parts of Europe mounts over access to encrypted data, industry watchers say attention is expected to focus on Britain \u2014 a top international market for most American tech companies \u2014 where expanded powers for the country\u2019s intelligence services are likely to come into force by the end of the year. The legislation is the brainchild of the ruling Conservative Party, which has a sufficient parliamentary majority to enact the regulatory changes.Under the proposals, the Investigatory Powers Bill would force Internet and telecommunications companies to hold records of websites visited by people in Britain over the last 12 months. It also would provide the country\u2019s intelligence agencies with a legal mandate for the bulk collection of large quantities of data, while allowing them to hack individual devices under certain situations.Ms. May, Britain\u2019s home secretary, told lawmakers this year that such powers were required to defend the country\u2019s security. She added that the legislation offered sufficient transparency and oversight about how British spies conducted their activities to calm people\u2019s privacy concerns.But for Apple and other Silicon Valley companies, the proposal also includes new powers that can permit the British government to demand that companies remove encryption protections where \u201creasonably practicable\u201d to gain access to digital communications.The British government stresses that such rules would not undermine companies\u2019 services because they may not apply to so-called end-to-end encryption, technology used by the likes of Apple\u2019s iMessage and FaceTime services, as well as Facebook\u2019s WhatsApp Internet messenger.Such concerns, security experts say, could be compounded if other national governments \u2014 either in Europe or farther afield \u2014 followed Britain\u2019s lead by passing similar legislation.Hannah Olivennes contributed reporting from London.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Israel Polarized Over Soldier Who Killed Wounded Palestinian", "Date": "2016-03-30", "News": "Supported by\u201cThe commanders, and I first among them, will continue to give backing to any soldier who errs in the heat of battle against an enemy endangering the lives of civilians and soldiers,\u201d General Eisenkot wrote. \u201cThat said, we will not hesitate to fully implement the law against soldiers and commanders if they deviate from the operational and moral standards according to which we work.\u201dPosters appeared in Tel Aviv soon after the shooting depicting General Eisenkot, who had swiftly condemned it, as the gullible Persian king who initially went along with a plot to kill all the Jews in the story of Purim, the holiday celebrated last week. Urging the general to resign, along with the prime minister and the defense minister, the posters bore the legend: \u201cJewish blood is not to be abandoned. He who rises up to slay you, slay him first.\u201dThe education minister, Naftali Bennett, has accused the leadership of being \u201cquick to pounce on the soldier.\u201d He and other right-wing politicians, activists and the soldier\u2019s family are now waging a campaign against the defense minister, Moshe Yaalon, and the army\u2019s top officers.\u201cThis is a test,\u201d said Udi Dekel, an expert in civil-military relations at the Institute for National Security Studies at Tel Aviv University.\u201cOn the one hand,\u201d he said, \u201cthe army has to be attentive to the feelings of the people.\u201d On the other, he said, \u201cyou cannot run an army based on social networks and relatives.\u201d And the military cannot change the rules of engagement because of a political and public onslaught, said Mr. Dekel, a former brigadier general.The episode began last Thursday, when two Palestinian men stabbed and wounded an Israeli soldier at a checkpoint in the West Bank city of Hebron. His fellow soldiers shot them both, killing one and wounding the other, who was identified as Abed al-Fatah al-Sharif, 21.The accused soldier arrived at the scene about six minutes later, by which time calm appeared to have been restored. The video shows him cocking his rifle and shooting Mr. Sharif, this time in the head, as he lay on the road.Lawyers representing the soldier say he acted to save his comrades in the belief that Mr. Sharif, who was still moving, might have been concealing an explosive belt under his jacket.The soldier did not warn other soldiers or the medical staff to move away from Mr. Sharif, and had Mr. Sharif been wearing explosives, critics noted, the soldier\u2019s shot could have detonated them.The soldier\u2019s Facebook page suggests sympathies with some far-right causes. He told another soldier at the scene that Mr. Sharif had stabbed his friend and \u201cdeserved to die,\u201d according to Israeli news reports.At a hearing on Tuesday, a military judge said the evidence so far was not clear-cut. Prosecutors would not specify what charges they were considering, appearing to have backed off from the idea of a murder charge.About 30 Israelis, two Americans and a Palestinian bystander have been killed by Palestinians since Oct. 1. Israeli forces or civilians have shot dead 180 Palestinians during the same period, most while they were carrying out or attempting attacks, according to the Israeli authorities; the rest were killed in clashes with Israeli security forces.Palestinian officials and human rights groups have accused Israeli forces of shooting to kill in some other instances captured on video where the threat appeared to have passed. Among them was a case in November in which a teenage Palestinian girl who had tried to stab passers-by with scissors was shot by a police officer as she lay on the ground.The military has been clear about its regulations on when soldiers can fire. It says that assailants must be quickly incapacitated, but that once neutralized they should not be killed. General Eisenkot told high school students recently that he would not want a soldier \u201cto empty a magazine at a 13-year-old girl with scissors.\u201dProf. Tamar Hermann, a political scientist who directs surveys for the institute, said that although the Israeli public had attacked the military many times in the past, \u201cI don\u2019t remember ever before a chief of staff being criticized for being too soft.\u201dNow there is growing concern about the mixed messages that may be influencing the soldiers. Speaking in the Israeli Parliament this week Mr. Yaalon, the defense minister, asked: \u201cWhat do you want here? A brutish army that has lost its moral backbone?\u201d\u201cLater,\u201d he said, \u201cwe will be checking if there is a connection between the aggression on the Internet, all sorts of statements made by politicians, and the fact that a soldier decided to act in a way that breaches the law, our values and the open-fire regulations.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Apple Policy on Bugs May Explain Why Hackers Would Help F.B.I.", "Date": "2016-03-22", "News": "Supported byFor all the steps Apple has taken to encrypt customers\u2019 communications and its rhetoric around customer privacy, security experts said the company was still doing less than many competitors to seal up its systems from hackers. And when hackers do find flaws in Apple\u2019s code, they have little incentive to turn them over to the company for fixing.Apple, which has had relatively strong security over the years, has been open about how security is a never-ending cat-and-mouse game and how it is unwilling to engage in a financial arms race to pay for code exploits.The company has yet to give hackers anything more than a gold star. When hackers do turn over serious flaws in its products, they may see their name listed on the company\u2019s website \u2014 but that is it. That is a far cry from what hackers can expect if they sell an Apple flaw on the thriving underground market where a growing number of companies and government agencies are willing to pay hackers handsomely.But security experts, especially those with a stake in such bug programs, said Apple could now be doing more, especially in this day and age where the conventions of finding bugs and fixing them have changed.Just this week, researchers at Johns Hopkins University uncovered a flaw that would allow attackers to decrypt the contents of photos and videos attached in Apple\u2019s iMessage program. The researchers turned that flaw over to Apple for patching.\u201cEspecially with the stakes being as high as they are, if Apple wants to continue to compete in the modern world, they have to modernize their approach,\u201d said Katie Moussouris, a chief policy officer at HackerOne, which companies like Yahoo, Dropbox and now Uber pay to manage their bug bounty programs.The identity of the third party that approached the F.B.I. with the possible way to unlock the iPhone \u2014 which was used by one of the attackers in a mass shooting in San Bernardino, Calif., last year \u2014 remained unknown on Tuesday. The emergence of the third party halted, at least temporarily, a contentious case between Apple and the United States government over whether the company should weaken the security of its iPhone to help law enforcement.The Justice Department has declined to name the third-party person or organization, or to describe the proposed method for breaking into the device. The third party may not have approached Apple for many reasons.In the past, Microsoft\u2019s systems were a more frequent target for malicious-minded hackers, largely because of the prevalence of its products. But as Microsoft began to embrace the hacking community, its security improved.The technology company has been locked in a major legal battle against law enforcement officials over privacy and security.As Apple\u2019s desktops and mobile phones have gained more market share, and as customers began to entrust more and more of their personal data to their iPhones, Apple products have become far more valuable marks for criminals and spies.An Apple spokeswoman referred to an editorial by Craig Federighi, the company\u2019s senior vice president for software engineering, in which he wrote, \u201cSecurity is an endless race \u2014 one that you can lead but never decisively win.\u201d\u201cOur team must work tirelessly to stay one step ahead of criminal attackers who seek to pry into personal information,\u201d Mr. Federighi said. \u201cDespite our best efforts, nothing is 100 percent secure.\u201dApple has long been less visible in the security community compared with other tech companies. The company has shied away from bug bounty programs and instead relied on large testing programs and the work of its security team to spot vulnerabilities, partly because it is disinclined to keep up with a financial arms race of paying for bugs, according to three former and current employees, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly about security matters.Apple has said it will fight to know more about the flaw in the software or hardware that the third party has presented to law enforcement. A senior executive said in a conference call with reporters Tuesday that if the government found the method did not work and tried to force Apple to help break into the phone, Apple would have questions about what was tried, in order to keep its products as secure as possible.If the third-party method does work, the government may dismiss a court order demanding that Apple weaken its security, but keep the process it used to break into the phone under seal. In that case, Apple would have no way of knowing how the government broke into its software or hardware.Exploits in Apple\u2019s code have become increasingly coveted over time, especially as its mobile devices have become ubiquitous, with an underground ecosystem of brokers and contractors willing to pay top dollar for them.Flaws in Apple\u2019s mobile devices can typically fetch $1 million. Last September, a boutique firm in Washington, called Zerodium, which sells flaws to governments and corporations, announced a $1 million bounty for anyone who would turn over an exploit in Apple\u2019s iOS 9 mobile operating system \u2014 the same operating system used to power the iPhone used by the San Bernardino shooter. By November, Zerodium said a team of undisclosed hackers had successfully claimed the bounty.Chaouki Bekrar, the founder of Zerodium, said his company was not the outside party referred to in the government\u2019s court filing on Monday. But Mr. Bekrar added that even if Zerodium had helped the F.B.I., he would not disclose it.\u201cFor every Zerodium, there are a thousand other organizations like Zerodium that are far less vocal about doing what they do and will pay researchers who find this stuff to keep it a secret,\u201d said Casey Ellis, the founder of BugCrowd, a company in San Franciso that helps vendors manage bug bounty programs.Some security researchers said no bounty Apple could offer now would match the reward they could expect from the underground market. Apple has waited so long that the black market for its flaws has become extremely lucrative, perhaps making any bug bounty program the company would create seem late to the game.\u201cApple can embrace security researchers, or try to facilitate programs that will secure its operating system, but it\u2019s never going to be able to compete with what is going on behind the scenes in the black market,\u201d said Jay Kaplan, a former N.S.A. analyst and co-founder of Synack, a company that deploys hackers to weed out vulnerabilities in clients\u2019 systems. \u201cIt\u2019s just not going to happen.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Decorous Demise of the \u2018Establishment\u2019", "Date": "2016-03-01", "News": "Supported byFirst WordsWe have a multicar pileup on Establishment Lane, with fatalities reported. The most mangled vehicle belongs to the defunct presidential campaign of John Ellis (Jeb) Bush.The last time I saw Jeb before the crash, he was speaking at a town-hall meeting in Iowa and seemed to be bracing for something bad. \u2018\u2018I am part of the establishment,\u2019\u2019 the former Florida governor said in a solemn tone, as though he were beginning a eulogy.By the fine manners of the crowd, you gathered that they, too, were establishment-bred. People raised their hands and stood in line and waited for the microphone to be brought over. Everything was calm and orderly, as it was back when Republican presidential campaigns always ran through Establishment Lane.We\u2019ll save \u2018\u2018lanes\u2019\u2019 for another day (or better yet, close them all) and focus here on the wounded \u2018\u2018establishment.\u2019\u2019 What is the \u2018\u2018establishment\u2019\u2019 other than one of those bloviation-chamber words that political types toss around to describe something that might not actually exist in the real world? No one really agrees, except that to be part of the establishment is most certainly a bad look in today\u2019s politics. It represents a catchall designation for \u2018\u2018people in charge\u2019\u2019 \u2014 and implies that they\u2019ve been ensconced too long. The establishment is tired and musty and too comfortable. Yet it is still invoked constantly as a phantom solution: The establishment will step in and bring order to this chaos. They are the parents that will arrive home just as the party has grown out of control, the house is being trashed and the cops are taking names.The establishment used to be a safe space. It represented an \u2018\u2018established or stable condition,\u2019\u2019 according to one of many Oxford English Dictionary definitions. Membership suggested a secure position in the pecking order of American life. You were a made man or (less likely) woman and were assured a swaddling of fund-raising, endorsements and support from the select committee of the club.In return, establishment candidates adhered to certain codes of behavior. They would be gentlemanly and magnanimous in victory or defeat and would write thank-you notes by hand on monogrammed stationery when it was all over. They would wait their turn to run for president and not threaten to run third-party. They would not pursue a floor fight at the national convention or pick a running mate who threw around expressions like \u2018\u2018going rogue.\u2019\u2019 The establishment does not do rogue (the G.O.P. tried that once with Sarah Palin, and it proved not prudent).Subcommittees abound within the establishment. They include the national-security, Wall Street, academic, legal and economic establishments. They all mean the same thing, essentially: a ruling class, mythical in some cases, but always believed to be powerful. The news media has its own establishment, of course, which works in lock step with the other establishments to perpetuate their myths and nourish the same tropes, clich\u00e9s and circular logics that define establishment consensus (or conventional wisdom). Traditional journalists are only part of the media establishment. It also includes Internet personalities, campaign media advisers and Democratic and Republican strategists who pollute our cable news.The various establishments have no borders. No one is proposing that anyone build a big, beautiful wall between any of them. A titan of the business establishment \u2014 Trump, say \u2014 can migrate freely to the media establishment and then maybe one day come to dominate the political establishment (as of now, he\u2019s still confined to Anti-Establishment Lane).It has always been politically expedient to fight the establishment. Insurgent conservatives like Barry Goldwater in the mid-20th century used to rail against the \u2018\u2018Eastern establishment,\u2019\u2019 which implied an elitist, Ivy League and (implicitly) hail-fellow style. Goldwater was anti-establishment in the early \u201960s, as was Ronald Reagan. They built robust followings. Goldwater wound up winning the Republican presidential nomination in 1964, and Reagan ascended to the presidency in 1980, injecting their brands of conservatism into the core of the Republican establishment.Likewise, Bill Clinton and Barack Obama both ran for president as \u2018\u2018Washington outsiders,\u2019\u2019 which suggested anti-establishment credibility. But living in the White House carries with it a lifetime membership in the establishment, with little opportunity for escape.Recent conditions have fostered a particularly lethal stigma against their breed. Grass-roots movements like the Tea Party, Occupy Wall Street and social media (mainly Twitter and Facebook) have energized resistance to the vague establishment. Super PACs have placed huge amounts of political money into the hands of people far removed from the party operatives who used to control the coffers.When the casualties of these anti-establishment days are tallied and the saga is explained, there will be many cautionary tales. Once again, Jeb is the early front-runner. His demise was swift and tidy. He wound up finishing in sixth place in Iowa and fourth in New Hampshire and South Carolina before quitting.Still, the political-media wiseguys and gals remain obsessed with which Republican candidate will inherit the establishment. Around whom will they coalesce? (Everyone keeps using the word \u2018\u2018coalesce\u2019\u2019 \u2014 immediate moratorium on \u2018\u2018coalesce\u2019\u2019!) Clearly, it\u2019s Marco Rubio, the young Florida senator who was elected in 2010 as a first darling of the Tea Party. There is a certain symmetry to his inheritance: The outsider becomes the establishment, for whatever that\u2019s worth now.I was traveling with Rubio in Nevada on the eve of that state\u2019s Republican caucuses last month. His campaign kept pushing out news of his latest establishment endorsement. They were collecting them like snow globes \u2014 Senator Orrin Hatch of Utah, former Gov. Frank Keating of Oklahoma, Representative Peter King of New York, Bob Dole. Rubio seemed almost giddy about the \u2018\u2018Marcomentum\u2019\u2019 he was feeling.\u2018\u2018We\u2019ve had a great day today,\u2019\u2019 he said in an impromptu meeting with reporters on his campaign plane. \u2018\u2018We\u2019ve had a lot of people come onboard and support us today \u2014 the governor of Arkansas, a number of senators and congressmen and local officials, a lot of people who were committed to Jeb.\u2019\u2019 That\u2019s what establishment love has been reduced to: a nice consolation prize and lovely parting gift. Trump won Nevada handily the next day. Rubio left Vegas with the love and blessing of Orrin Hatch.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Cloak of Silence After a South Bronx Killing", "Date": "2016-03-18", "News": "Murder in the 4-0The killing of Freddy Collazo remains unsolved, and the silence that frustrates detectives and torments his family seems to be holding, spawning rumors and threats of revenge.Supported byFor years Freddy Collazo watched death pool in sidewalk cracks and on basketball courts, leaving behind votive candles and bottles of a victim\u2019s favorite cognac. And he ran from the same fate.He fled after a man sliced a knife through his right cheek and ear four years ago at his South Bronx housing project. He dodged two men who jumped him last spring outside Bronx Criminal Court, raining punches as he tried to pull his mother to the safety of a waiting taxi.And in recent weeks, he told people he was being stalked by an armed man near the Forest Houses, where he grew up as a fringe member of a criminal crew called Forest Over Everything.Mr. Collazo never told the police about the threats, his mother said, preferring to bear the burden of his street feuds on his own.On a warm Monday in late February, as the sun sank toward the wiry tree line of St. Mary\u2019s Park \u2014 a hilly tract about 15 blocks south of the Forest Houses \u2014 a hooded gunman crept up behind Mr. Collazo and his cousin at the park\u2019s southern edge and did not miss. The first bullet severed Mr. Collazo\u2019s spine and blew through his heart, killing him before he hit the pavement. His cousin, Luis Cruz, ran.Then the gunman stood over Mr. Collazo, 58 days past his 20th birthday, and with a .45-caliber pistol pumped at least six more bullets into his body, leaving a total of 10 entry and exit wounds.As silence fell over the park, his cousin circled back.\u201cI was crying, right there, like, \u2018Don\u2019t die on me,\u2019\u201d Mr. Cruz said. \u201cI\u2019m telling him, \u2018Breathe, breathe.\u2019 And, like, it was over.\u201dIn a bystander\u2019s video, Mr. Collazo\u2019s body lay in the middle of St. Mary\u2019s Street, his hair cushioning his head against the pavement and his black hightops crossed at the ankle, as a police officer delivered quick pumps to his chest. Faint sirens and the murmur of worried onlookers broke through the late-afternoon quiet.Mr. Collazo had just dropped off gifts for Mr. Cruz\u2019s unborn son: four onesies embossed with monkeys and bananas, six pairs of socks, bibs decorated with cars and a baby bottle.The killing remains unsolved, and the veil of silence that left Mr. Collazo vulnerable to one attack after another \u2014 and that frustrates detectives and torments victims\u2019 families \u2014 seems to be holding, spawning rumors and threats of revenge.At least one friend of Mr. Collazo has been caught with a gun trying to retaliate for the killing, and others have promised to do the same, all of them going after the men who had been hunting Mr. Collazo for years, said an 18-year-old friend who called himself Mr. Collazo\u2019s \u201cright-hand man.\u201dSgt. Michael J. LoPuzzo, the commander of the 40th Precinct detective squad, said Mr. Collazo was \u201cassassinated.\u201dBut Mr. Cruz has told Mr. Collazo\u2019s mother that he will not say who the killer is.\u201cI told him, \u2018Please, you was there, go to the cops and tell them what you know,\u2019\u201d Mr. Collazo\u2019s mother, Glenda Lee Soto, said. \u201cHe told me he\u2019s not going to do it. He\u2019s not going to go down for a snitch. He\u2019s not going to rat nobody.\u201dThe murder created hardly a ripple in the daily pulse of a city that has largely banished fears of targeted violence to impoverished pockets, like Brownsville and East New York in Brooklyn, and Mott Haven, the South Bronx neighborhood where Mr. Collazo was killed. In the 40th Precinct, though \u2014 which recorded his death as its second homicide of 2016 \u2014 it was the latest in a cycle of crew battles and personal feuds that span generations.To understand why killings persist in an era of historically low crime, The New York Times is reporting this year on each murder in the 40th Precinct.In neighborhoods like Mott Haven, a shadow system of street justice holds sway over many young black and Hispanic men, who describe addressing grievances through armed payback because they do not trust the police. Witnesses and crime victims often refuse to speak, creating a vacuum of judicial accountability in which people instead turn to guns and crews, loosely organized groups of young men usually delineated by geography.Crew murders account for many of the killings that persist in today\u2019s New York, leaving detectives to untangle the often petty or impenetrable motives behind them before more violence occurs in retribution. Elected leaders have become numb to the rat-a-tat frequency of such killings, antiviolence activists say.But to delve deeply into a murder like Mr. Collazo\u2019s is to see the layers of fear, loyalty and provocation that can end in death. For Mr. Collazo, who was in drug treatment and on his way to a high school equivalency diploma, life seemed to be a daily struggle against the pull of the street.Detectives have told Ms. Soto they need more credible witnesses in order to move forward. Witnesses do not seem to be saying all that they know. The motive, initially listed as \u201ccrew-related,\u201d may have a long, knotty history. Such are the realities of a crew murder in the 40th Precinct.Of the 120 known crews and gangs in the Bronx, many are rooted in the housing projects in and just north of the 40th Precinct, an area that has one of New York City\u2019s densest concentrations of public housing.Last year, the 40th Precinct had nine homicides \u2014 more than all but 11 of the city\u2019s 77 police precincts \u2014 and recorded the largest jump in major crime citywide. With a third homicide last week, the precinct is now the third-deadliest in the city so far this year, behind the 75th Precinct, in East New York, and the 121st Precinct, on Staten Island. The number of burglaries in the 40th Precinct has more than tripled compared with the same period last year, and felony assaults, robberies and rapes have all increased by at least 50 percent.\u201cCrime is definitely not headed in the right direction,\u201d James P. O\u2019Neill, the chief of department, told the commander of the 40th Precinct, Inspector Carlos Valdez, at a recent meeting on crime statistics and crime-fighting strategies at Police Headquarters, as department leaders pressed the inspector and others on conditions in their commands.A long-term drop in homicides in the precinct \u2014 down from 83 in 1991, mirroring a decline across the city \u2014 has allowed the police to intensify their focus on hard-to-solve killings like Mr. Collazo\u2019s.He left behind a trail of clues: his name in a police database linking him to Forest Over Everything; his rap lyrics, which were dominated by references to \u201ccokeheads\u201d and \u201cdopeheads\u201d; a Facebook post about shots fired by \u201cmy team.\u201d But the mystery over the true motive has had young mothers worrying at public meetings about letting their children play outside and detectives knocking on doors across the South Bronx to reconstruct the provocations and paybacks that made Mr. Collazo a target.\u201cFreddy had problems everywhere, just like every other kid out here that\u2019s gangbanging got problems everywhere,\u201d said the friend who called himself Mr. Collazo\u2019s \u201cright-hand man\u201d and knew him for several years. \u201cHe knew people was after him.\u201dMr. Collazo tended to keep his troubles to himself at the Forest Houses, a complex of 15 buildings just north of the 40th Precinct.He often shut himself in the room he shared with a younger sister, lying on the top bunk of their bed, emerging only to watch cartoons like \u201cCourage the Cowardly Dog,\u201d \u201cArthur\u201d and \u201cScooby-Doo.\u201d Headphones always dangled from his ears. He grew his hair long and liked having two braids hang over his temples.\u201cHe was a funny, funny kid,\u201d Ms. Soto said, recalling his goofy sense of humor. But, she added, \u201cHe suffered inside.\u201dMr. Collazo poured out his feelings first as part of a dance crew, where he was called Freddy Tails and was known for his light feet, and later as an amateur rapper, writing lyrics about his own life under the name Felony Fredo.\u201cFourteen, runnin\u2019 round, I was snatching jewels,\u201d go the lyrics to one song. \u201cI got older since then, never sober / Runnin\u2019 from your crib, show up like Jehovah.\u201dMr. Collazo\u2019s father, who was addicted to heroin, served nearly two years in state prison for drug sales. His parents separated when he was in his early teens.\u201cMy pops wasn\u2019t there, man I think he a crackhead,\u201d Mr. Collazo rapped in the same song. \u201cAnd my mom by herself, and that hurted me the most.\u201dHe got a .32-caliber Smith & Wesson revolver after the 2012 slashing, a necessary precaution, friends and relatives said, for anyone being chased as Mr. Collazo was. It was in his left pocket, loaded with two live rounds, when police officers answering a 911 call for a man shot in November 2013 pulled Mr. Collazo out of a group matching a description of the perpetrators.They also found, in his right pocket, a sandwich bag of marijuana. The gun was confiscated and he faced several serious weapons possession charges. \u201cI got stabbed and robbed a month back so I carry these for protection,\u201d he told Officer Yurantz Assade as he was arrested, according to court papers.But Mr. Collazo was coy, even with close friends, about why people wanted to hurt him. When Ms. Soto asked how she could help, her son acknowledged being in trouble but insisted: \u201cNo questions.\u201dWhen he was sent to jail on Rikers Island, his father, also named Alfredo Collazo, was already there, having been locked up four days earlier on drug charges: In spite of the elder Mr. Collazo\u2019s urging him to do differently, his son had followed his path.\u201cI\u2019m trying to show you and close doors and tell you, \u2018Don\u2019t do this, don\u2019t get into no gang,\u2019\u201d the father recalled telling his son.Ms. Soto bailed her son out, but he did not listen to other relatives\u2019 warnings, either. \u201cLeave those people alone,\u201d his grandfather, Agustin Soto, recalled telling him about his street friends. \u201cHe said, \u2018Yes, Grandpa, I will do what you told me to, Grandpa.\u2019 But it never happened.\u201dMr. Collazo was curious about forging his own allegiances on the street and unafraid of straying from the loose boundaries of his crew. His boldness made him enemies.He had expensive tastes in clothes, favoring name-brand polo shirts. On Facebook groups for selling merchandise he offered a \u201creal Rolex\u201d for $800, size 9\u00bd Air Jordans and G-Star jeans that would have been long for his 5-foot-11 frame. He saved money by leaving cash at his mother\u2019s apartment.\u201c\u2018I need some chicken,\u2019 or \u2018I need bread,\u2019\u201d Ms. Soto recalled her son saying, using slang for money.He popped prescription pills, including Percocet, smoked marijuana in the lobby of his apartment building and sold drugs, sometimes under the banner of Forest Over Everything but just as often on his own.\u201cPeople just care for him too much, so they always made sure he was protected,\u201d said Mr. Collazo\u2019s right-hand man, who spoke on the condition that he not be named and who said he had sold drugs with Mr. Collazo near the Forest Houses.Mr. Collazo dropped out of Herbert H. Lehman High School in the 11th grade, though his mother begged counselors for a way to force him to stay enrolled. His father had a daughter with a different woman, and was living with them in Mr. Collazo\u2019s childhood home, further straining his relationship with his father. He moved in with his mother near 180th Street for short periods, but was always drawn back to the Forest Houses, a more permissive atmosphere, where he helped care for the great-grandmother who raised him, and who was battling uterine cancer.Mr. Collazo was arrested again in April 2014, this time for marijuana, but he was required only to pay a fine. He walked around as if he were invincible, friends said, relying on his crew for protection as his street feuds piled up.His ability to avoid prison time created suspicions among his crew when, later that month, nearly three dozen members of Forest Over Everything and a rival group, Six Four Goons, were arrested in a roundup and charged in a string of attempted murders and firearm purchases, some planned on Facebook.Mr. Collazo appears in the 80-count indictment under his Facebook name, Freddy Staysmack, messaging with a fellow crew member about a gun in June 2012. \u201cU got da 25,\u201d the other crew member, who was charged with conspiring to commit murder, says to Mr. Collazo, according to the indictment. But Mr. Collazo dodged charges.\u201cPeople from his own crew felt like they couldn\u2019t trust him,\u201d the \u201cright-hand man\u201d said, alluding to speculation that Mr. Collazo was cooperating with the authorities. \u201cThat was never the case; he was never working with the cops.\u201dBut the episode stoked Mr. Collazo\u2019s paranoia about who might be after him.\u201cHe realized the streets either bring jail or death,\u201d his 18-year-old sister, \u00d1eca, said. \u201cHe wanted something better. He wanted to live.\u201dLast May, Mr. Collazo entered a residential drug-treatment program in Brooklyn run by Phoenix House, a nonprofit rehabilitation organization, telling people that he would keep getting in trouble if he stayed on the streets and that the program would help him avoid prison.He won a relapse-prevention award in September as he received help with his marijuana habit. A counselor in a course on healthy relationships, Lydia Peterson, recalled his making juvenile jokes early on, but eventually asking serious, if somewhat cryptic, questions about women.\u201cWell, what if I trusted somebody and they betrayed me?\u201d Ms. Peterson said he asked.By October, he had earned a chance to leave each morning to study for his high school equivalency diploma, at the Isaacs Center in Manhattan.He had left a similar program two weeks earlier because he was not allowed to wear a hat, but he was desperate enough to plead for a second chance after a counselor believed \u2014 in error, it turned out \u2014 that he had been involved in a fight during orientation.\u201cHe cried, he cried, and said to please give him another chance because he knows if he\u2019s not here \u2014 if he doesn\u2019t get this opportunity \u2014 he won\u2019t do it anywhere else,\u201d the counselor, Ana Dominguez, recalled.On long walks he told Ms. Dominguez he was trying to overcome a past clouded by difficult family ties and a \u201cbeef here and there.\u201d His anxiety ran so deep that Mr. Collazo once badgered a new student who he thought had been looking at him too much. Ms. Dominguez suspended him for a day and asked him to explain himself in a letter. She said he wrote about dreams of a big house with a wife and children, and when he returned to school he insisted on moving into a more difficult reading group.\u201cSometimes it\u2019s hard for me to live life, but I will if I have to,\u201d she said he wrote on the double-sided note.On a collage he made for Thanksgiving, he wrote, \u201cI am thankful to still be alive after everything I been thru.\u201dBut he also told his counselors that the streets of the South Bronx were still what he knew best, and that he did not know where else to go.Neighborhood crews sometimes begin more as groups of friends than as criminal enterprises. But the stakes rise as crew members obtain guns and move to protect turf.\u201cThe reason we talk about it so much is it is much more violent because of the guns and the easy access to them,\u201d said Assistant Commissioner Kevin O\u2019Connor of the Juvenile Justice Division at the Police Department.Teenagers know where they are allowed and where they are not, though sometimes they get a pass to move through rival turf where a grandmother might live, or where they might play basketball. A strong family life is often all that stops young men from succumbing to the pull of a crew.\u201cI never heard him talk about his father,\u201d Ms. Peterson said. \u201cHe had to resort to finding that love or respect or confidence in the street.\u201dBut some feuds are harder to explain. At the Mill Brook Houses, the dividing lines are within the complex itself: On one side, up a hill, is Killer Brook Up, or KB Up; on the other is KB Down.Along with the crews are localized subsets of notorious national gangs \u2014 Bloods, Crips and Latin Kings \u2014 many of which take shape at Rikers and drive violence across the city.Robert K. Boyce, the chief of detectives, who commanded the 40th Precinct from 2000 to 2003, said the groups attached themselves to certain locations and started battling.\u201cThese alpha personalities, someone\u2019s got to be in charge,\u201d said Chief Boyce, who also commanded all Bronx detectives for three years.Phoenix House was a form of self-exile for Mr. Collazo, free from crew affiliations and far from rival terrain. But in text messages to a friend in January, he described his need for money even as he plunged deeper into his schoolwork.\u201cEducation the key n I\u2019m jus now noticing it now,\u201d he wrote. He added, \u201cI\u2019m litt I jus gotta find a way to get money again now.\u201dThe streets kept a ledger of the violence, and as careful as Mr. Collazo was when he returned on weekend or daytime visits to the neighborhood, rivals eventually caught up to him.\u201cOut here, when someone wants to kill you, they\u2019re going to eventually get to you,\u201d the 18-year-old friend said. \u201cIt only takes a call.\u201dInstead of going to school that Monday morning, Feb. 22, Mr. Collazo went to his mother\u2019s house to retrieve the baby gifts, where she was cleaning out a closet for him in the hopes that a judge, at a court hearing the next day, would let him leave Phoenix House and move home. It was the first school day his teachers said they could recall that he missed. Before he met up with his cousin, he stopped by the Forest Houses, about a dozen blocks south, though he did not see his father.It was hardly home any more. His great-grandmother had died on Jan. 2, pushing him into what his parents described as a serious depression. He was prescribed Xanax, which led to more pill-popping with Mr. Cruz, also 20, relatives said.\u201cI put him in the cab and peaced him,\u201d a friend from Forest Houses recalled of Mr. Collazo\u2019s leaving to meet Mr. Cruz that afternoon. \u201cHe was like: \u2018Bro, yo bro, my grandmother died, I don\u2019t got no crib. Once I leave this program, I ain\u2019t got nowhere to stay.\u2019\u201dHe met Mr. Cruz on the steps of a Bronx courthouse, where Mr. Cruz said he had to hand in paperwork, and then dropped off the gifts, along with his jacket and book bag, at Mr. Cruz\u2019s apartment. They left to shop for sneakers with two other young men in the busy commercial district around 149th Street and Third Avenue before stopping at a nearby building, where one of the other men went upstairs briefly to get changed.That was the last surveillance video investigators have obtained showing Mr. Collazo\u2019s movements before the shooting.Around 3:30 p.m., the legal case manager at school called Mr. Collazo to ask why he had not been in classes. Something sounded off to her.\u201cHe said he wasn\u2019t feeling well,\u201d the case manager, Ciara Lucca, recalled. She reminded Mr. Collazo about the court hearing. \u201cHe said, \u2018O.K., I\u2019m a see you tomorrow in court,\u2019\u201d Ms. Lucca said. \u201cAnd that was it.\u201dThe shooting occurred at 4:21 p.m.\u201cI just heard shots,\u201d Mr. Cruz said in an interview at his apartment, the gifts for his unborn son arrayed on his living-room couch. \u201cI heard shots. I ran. And when I looked back, my cousin was on the floor.\u201dMr. Cruz stuck around the scene long enough to give a police officer his identification card, and then left, police officials said. When investigators found him later, Mr. Cruz said, he told them he saw a hooded man running through the park, and nothing more.Asked in an interview about what he saw or who might have wanted his cousin dead, Mr. Cruz said, \u201cYou want me to look back and look at the bullets?\u201d He said he had been close with Mr. Collazo for many years, before falling out and recently becoming close again, but claimed that there were certain parts of Mr. Collazo\u2019s past that remained a mystery.With only a few, physically distant witnesses and Mr. Cruz\u2019s having left the scene without speaking after he handed officers his ID card, detectives were left to start filling in the vast gaps in Mr. Collazo\u2019s past.In the minutes after the shooting, as a van from the Bronx homicide squad pulled up, detectives on the scene fed Mr. Collazo\u2019s name to colleagues at the department\u2019s Real Time Crime center, at Police Headquarters. Within minutes, an image of his face and his criminal record were sent to the van\u2019s computers and the smartphone of Sergeant LoPuzzo, the 40th Precinct detective squad commander.Departmental databases also confirmed Mr. Collazo\u2019s crew affiliation and detailed his slashing in May 2012; his wounds \u2014 including cuts to his head, ear, left elbow and right middle finger \u2014 were recorded by the police, despite his refusal to talk to officers at a hospital.They also learned that Mr. Cruz was part of the Beekman Crew, also known as the Trey Side Bloods, the police said.That evidence prompted them to send officers from the 42nd Precinct, to the north, and the local housing command, Police Service Area 7, into the projects, as a salve against any retaliation. Ten officers with the Housing Bureau converged on the area around the Forest Houses.The officers made a gun arrest at the Forest Houses, and two more arrests at the Betances Houses, the project nearest the shooting, where a crew known as RRN is based, worried that Mr. Colazzo was killed because he had strayed onto a rival\u2019s turf. They canvassed for anyone else who knew Mr. Collazo.Officers from the Bronx gang and intelligence units asked confidential sources what they had heard about the murder. They also looked at old case files for any mention of Mr. Collazo. They prepared investigative work sheets \u2014 known as DD5s \u2014 for Sergeant LoPuzzo.Chief Boyce said people\u2019s reluctance to speak with investigators \u201cdoesn\u2019t mean we stop \u2014 it just means our task is all the more difficult.\u201dOn the streets, a block-by-block search for physical clues was underway. Some of Sergeant LoPuzzo\u2019s 18 detectives canvassed in an effort to find surveillance video tracing the gunman\u2019s path.Officers collected seven brass shell casings at the scene. Thirteen people had dialed 911; among them were some who told investigators they saw a figure scampering through St. Mary\u2019s Park after the shooting. Some were reluctant to speak candidly, fearing the danger on the street that might await a witness; Sergeant LoPuzzo sympathized, but he also tried to convince them of the importance of talking.\u201cThey\u2019ll tell me, \u2018Listen, I got to live here,\u2019\u201d Sergeant LoPuzzo said. \u201cAnd I\u2019ll beg them, I\u2019ll say: \u2018Listen, I\u2019ll get you moved. As long as you help me with this case, I\u2019ll do something for you.\u2019\u201dA spigot of grief opened after Mr. Collazo was killed.Jaiden, 12, wore his older brother\u2019s sweatshirt, laying on a couch Ms. Soto had bought in the hope that Mr. Collazo could sleep on it when he came home. \u00d1eca leafed through the certificates he had earned in his high school equivalency program \u2014 mathematics, social studies, science. Beads of sweat ran down his father\u2019s forehead as he left the Forest Houses to identify his son\u2019s body.At his funeral the next Sunday, two young men were handcuffed by the police as they entered the funeral home parking lot; the police said they had arrested one person, for having stolen license plates.Later, inside the funeral home, Ms. Soto pleaded with a group of her son\u2019s friends not to seek retribution.\u201cI told them: \u2018Life don\u2019t have to end like this,\u2019\u201d Ms. Soto said. \u201c\u2018If you feel like getting revenge, it\u2019s not going to bring my son back. Change yourself. You don\u2019t want your mother in my shoes.\u2019\u201dThey played a montage of photos from Mr. Collazo\u2019s childhood: He hung on his father\u2019s broad shoulders, dressed up for church and played baseball in the park with his family.Votive candles were arranged in the shape of an F in the lobby of his Forest Houses building, the same spot he stood to hang out with friends. Friends scrawled tributes on the wall \u2014 \u201cF.O.E.,\u201d \u201cFor you we gon bang bang,\u201d \u201cIma put them under dirt\u201d \u2014 and raised their lighters to the ceiling to burn \u201cRIP FREDO\u201d into the beige paint. Some said the crew had been renamed \u201cFredo Over Everything.\u201dThe lobby became choked with marijuana smoke. Mr. Collazo\u2019s raps blared from his friends\u2019 cellphones and echoed off the walls. The group scattered when two officers from Police Service Area 7 arrived, responding to a neighbor\u2019s complaint.But slowly they returned. A young girl in a yellow hooded sweatshirt, her glasses pushed down on her nose, crouched beside the candles, warming her hands as a tear hung at the edge of her eye. \u201cYou all ever cried so much it gave you a headache?\u201d she asked no one in particular.A young man took out a bag of rubber bands, and the friends, no more than 18 years old, aimed and shot them at each other as they chased one another through the lobby. They bounced off the boys\u2019 puffy winter jackets and fell to the floor. It was all just a game.An earlier version of this article misstated the year that Freddy Collazo messaged a fellow crew member about a gun. It was in 2012, not 2011. Because of an editing error, an earlier version, in one instance, misspelled the surname of a legal case manager. She is Ciara Lucca, not Lucia. And \u200balso \u200bbecause of an editing error, an earlier version of a picture caption misstated when friends of Mr. Collazo burned a tribute to him into the ceiling of his building in the Forest Houses. The tribute was made the day after \u200bhe was killed, not after his funeral.Sandra E. Garcia, Nate Schweber and Isvett Verde contributed reporting, and Susan C.

{"Headline": "Long Denied Pensions, Pioneers of the Women\u2019s Game Are Seeing Reasons for Hope", "Date": "2016-03-25", "News": "Supported byFor about 25 years, the women who helped build the Women\u2019s Tennis Association have not been eligible for a pension from the organization.At Indian Wells, a group of them, including the Hall of Famers Billie Jean King and Rosie Casals and lesser-known players like Trish Bostrom, met with the WTA\u2019s new chief executive, Steve Simon, to discuss pension proposals.They left feeling, for the first time, that a pension deal for the WTA pioneers was possible.\u201cThis would be very important and should have been done in the past,\u201d said Casals, who won 12 Grand Slam doubles and mixed doubles titles before retiring in 1988 and then moved into sports marketing. \u201cIf the WTA wants to do something about it, they can. Steve Simon can create his legacy if he addresses the issue.\u201dShe added, \u201cThe new generation of players doesn\u2019t have to worry about their future, and I feel we were responsible for that and we should have benefits of a pension plan, however small, to acknowledge us.\u201dThe WTA was organized at a meeting led by King in 1973 just before Wimbledon. The players agreed to put in a percentage of their prize money to finance the WTA.\u201cWe did take care of the business and make sure it prospered,\u201d Casals said. \u201cBut we fell short on the pension.\u201dThe men\u2019s tour, the Association of Tennis Professionals, started a pension in 1980, and around 1990 it grandfathered in qualifying players whose careers ran from 1972 to 1980. But when the WTA was creating its pension in 1991, those who retired before that year were left out.\u201cWe were very disappointed,\u201d said Pam Teeguarden, who retired in 1985 after 17 years, during which she won two Grand Slam titles in mixed doubles and another in doubles.The men\u2019s players were earning far more in prize money then, and the ATP has donated money to its annual pension fund while the WTA was not contributing money, instead taking it from the players\u2019 prize money, which is how the women\u2019s pension is funded today.JoAnne Russell, who won the Wimbledon doubles crown in 1977, said that in 1990 or \u201991, she was told by Kathy Jordan, the player who led the pension movement, \u201cWe don\u2019t have enough money.\u201dRussell said: \u201cThe decision was really frustrating. It was so shortsighted. The men have been really good to their older members.\u201dMartina Navratilova played well past 1991 and thus qualifies for the pension, but she supported the effort to extend it.\u201cThe women who built the tour got the short end of the stick while they were playing because the prize money was so low, and they have been getting it again with the pension deal,\u201d she said.Casals and Teeguarden said people tried approaching WTA throughout the years to no avail. But last fall, a new movement arose.\u201cThe difference between now and 1991 is social media,\u201d said Teeguarden, who started exploring Facebook only in October.She began chatting with other former players, like Bostrom, who is a lawyer, about the pension.\u201cWithin three days, 150 people had joined the conversation,\u201d Teeguarden said.Another change during the past quarter-century is the growth of the women\u2019s game, thanks to players like Steffi Graf, Monica Seles, Maria Sharapova and the Williams sisters, Serena and Venus. Prize money, sponsorships and television contracts have increased significantly.\u201cWe feel the WTA is now in a favorable position to do this,\u201d Teeguarden said.Teeguarden, Bostrom, Pam Austin and others began researching details for a possible pension plan and including it in conversations with ATP officials.\u201cOur very early estimate is that 200 to 250 women may meet the criteria,\u201d depending on how inclusive the plan is, Teeguarden said.\u201cWe had several different ideas, and more work needs to be done,\u201d Bostrom said.Teeguarden and Bostrom said that their suggestions were a starting point and that they would let the WTA decide on the final criteria. As a result, Teeguarden did not want to divulge the specifics of their various proposals.\u201cI\u2019m thankful that the new leadership seems open to this,\u201d said Bostrom, who had an eight-year career and was ranked as high as fifth in doubles and 30th in singles.Simon praised the women, saying he hoped the WTA could create programs \u201cthat truly embrace our history\u201d and find opportunities to bring these pioneers into the fold, whether it is mentoring younger players or working at clinics or with corporate partners.As for the pension proposal, he said he was \u201crolling up my sleeves and doing some homework.\u201dHe hoped to get back to the group soon with potential options.\u201cIf this is feasible, we will work toward it, and if it\u2019s not, we will move on,\u201d Simon said.Still, the women came away encouraged. Bostrom said she trusted Simon and his colleagues, such as the Women\u2019s Tennis Benefit Association executive Lisa Grattan, while Teeguarden said she was optimistic.\u201cThis is our last best chance,\u201d she added.The players said gaining a pension was as much about recognizing what their peers had gone through to establish the tour as it was about the money.\u201cWe are not expecting a huge windfall,\u201d said Teeguarden, who still teaches part time. \u201cThis will not change our lives drastically.\u201dBut she acknowledged that as the players age, facing hip and knee replacements and other medical problems, \u201cevery little bit helps.\u201dRussell, who also still teaches, said she was fortunate because her father had her saving money from her first paycheck.\u201cBut not everybody is like that,\u201d she said. \u201cFor some, $500 a month would be amazing; $1,000 a month would be nirvana.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Video Shows Texas Police Officer Pepper-Spraying, Motorcycle Riders Say", "Date": "2016-03-15", "News": "Supported byA Texas police officer was removed from his patrol duties and officials were investigating a video that appears to show him pepper-spraying motorcycle riders as they passed his parked cruiser on a highway last weekend.A police spokeswoman, Cpl. Tracey M. Knight, said Tuesday that the department was scrutinizing the video, which had been recorded on a GoPro camera worn by one of the motorcyclists, and that it had also retrieved footage from the officer\u2019s body and dashboard cameras.The department said it \u201ctakes any complaint of officer misconduct very seriously and this incident will be investigated thoroughly.\u201dAbout 3 p.m. on Sunday, callers to 911 reported that 20 to 30 motorcycle riders were racing, stopping, filming themselves and weaving among vehicles on Highway 287.According to transcripts provided by Corporal Knight, callers also said a car had stopped sideways in a lane to block traffic so that the group could pass, and several people were reported to have been standing in the back of a pickup truck, photographing the group.Officer Figueroa responded to the scene and pulled over the pickup, she said. The video shows the officer stepping out of his patrol car while clutching the canister, and then spraying as the motorcycles passed, some of them near him in the lane next to the shoulder, where his car was parked.Texas law requires drivers to slow down to 20 miles below the speed limit \u2014 which is 65 miles per hour \u2014 or move to inner or far lanes if an officer is conducting a traffic stop on the shoulder. But using pepper spray to enforce that is not policy, Corporal Knight confirmed.The driver of the pickup was given a citation for driving without a license, while two people were cited for standing in the bed, Corporal Knight said. She said an ambulance was called to the scene, but its services were refused by all but one passenger in the truck who was apparently affected by blowback from the pepper spray.The motorcyclists\u2019 road trip took place on a windy day after a period of rain, according to Chase Stone, the head of a group of motorcycle riders called East Texas Heat, which took part. The riders often film their trips, some with cameras clipped onto their helmets or hands, and Mr. Stone, 27, usually posts the trips on social media.The footage of Officer Figueroa was captured by the GoPro camera of Jack Kinney, who said he was holding the device when he saw the officer and truck on the shoulder ahead of him.\u201cI was, like, I am going to turn the GoPro on him and rotate it for a cool passing view of an officer,\u201d Mr. Kinney, 32, said in a telephone interview Tuesday from Longview, Tex. As he passed, he added, \u201cI kind of saw in my mirror a cloud or something.\u201d\u201cIt wasn\u2019t until we got back to Longview that we viewed it on the big TV and were like, \u2018Did he really just spray everybody?\u2019\u200a\u201dMr. Stone said he had been on a motorcycle a distance behind Mr. Kinney, and eventually caught up to the others.\u201cBy the time I had passed, people were ducking, covering their mouths, covering their eyes,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople looked in distress.\u201d\u201cWhen I saw the footage I was like, \u2018Oh my gosh,\u2019\u200a\u201d Mr. Stone said. \u201cI thought about it for a second and said this needs to be seen. This was not made to slander anybody or slander law enforcement. It was made clearly to show there are some police officers out there who abuse their authority, in my opinion.\u201dHe said he tagged other members of the group in the Facebook video, and it was then apparently passed around and forwarded or tagged to the police.\u201cIt would have been a disaster if somebody went down because of that,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Comic and the Ping-Pong Champ", "Date": "2016-03-11", "News": "Supported byIn July, as a polite 26-year-old Chinese-born New Yorker named Wu Yue put together a string of table tennis victories at the Pan American Games in Toronto, the cheers from a bearded man wearing a trucker hat were impossible to ignore.Between matches, he offered Ms. Wu advice: Stay calm. She did, and she won the tournament, making her the only American table tennis player so far to qualify for the women\u2019s team representing the United States at this summer\u2019s Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro.Fans of standup comedy, or the sitcom \u201c30 Rock,\u201d would probably recognize the excited fan as Judah Friedlander, the comedian and actor. He is a table tennis fanatic, and has been taking lessons with Ms. Wu since she moved to New York eight years ago, from Beijing.It is an unlikely relationship between a free-associating, scruffy entertainer and a lithe, reserved, disciplined athlete, and the instruction has flowed both ways.Mr. Friedlander attends Ms. Wu\u2019s matches when his schedule permits, and he hopes to travel to Rio this summer to watch her.Their weekly lessons take place at Spin table tennis club on East 23rd Street in Manhattan. Mr. Friedlander showed up on a recent weekday and traded his usual series of fist bumps with patrons and staffers as he made his way to their regular table.\u201cHow\u2019s it going, girl?\u201d he asked as he plopped himself down on the floor next to Ms. Wu.The two could hardly look more different. Ms. Wu, who is also known by her American name, Jennifer, is soft-spoken and neat. She was wearing smart, sponsored athletic gear, and a delicate jadeite necklace.Mr. Friedlander, as unkempt as Frank Rossitano, the schlumpy TV writer he played on \u201c30 Rock,\u201d wore a T-shirt that looked as if it had been stored in his gym bag. He changed from his work boots to his table tennis sneakers. He was affable and constantly conversing with anyone who happened by, from the club owners and star players to the workers sweeping up stray balls on the floor.The two began their one-hour lesson, as usual, with a few minutes of long warm-up rallies, first to the forehand, then to the backhand.Ms. Wu and Mr. Friedlander are both fixtures at the club. It has a downtown, loungey feel and attracts celebrities such as Justin Bieber and Prince, \u201cbut none of them put in the time like Judah does,\u201d said Jonathan Bricklin, a Spin co-founder.\u201cThey\u2019re a fabulously unlikely odd couple,\u201d he said, watching teacher and student practice. \u201cI\u2019m waiting for her to start helping him with his jokes.\u201dMs. Wu grew up in Beijing and came to New York in 2008 at age 17, with the dream of becoming naturalized and earning a spot on the United States Olympic team. Making China\u2019s team was a much tougher prospect, given the many good players vying for spots on a squad that has dominated the sport since it was added to the Olympics in 1988.She began teaching right away, at the Wang Chen Table Tennis Club on West 100th Street in Manhattan, where Mr. Friedlander was one of her first students.Mr. Friedlander, who grew up in Maryland, played table tennis at home but was more interested in soccer. He began playing table tennis in earnest 10 years ago and now plays in amateur tournaments. He takes the game very seriously.When he approached Ms. Wu about lessons, she recalled, \u201cHe didn\u2019t look like an athlete, but then when I saw him play, it was different.\u201dShe would pantomime the proper technique. He would follow.\u201cYou knew two words of English,\u201d he reminded her recently. Soon she knew a few more, including the word \u201cbrain,\u201d which she would say to him, pointing to her head. It was her way of telling him he had a good head for the mental game.\u201cEvery time he plays, he wants to win,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen he plays, he\u2019s not a comedian anymore.\u201dHe takes his paddles on the road and seeks out table tennis clubs. In New York, he plays not only at Spin but outdoors, with the regulars who gather year-round at the concrete tables in Tompkins Square Park in the East Village.\u201cIt\u2019s a mental break from the annoyingness of show business,\u201d he said, adding that the fast-twitch muscle reactions crucial for table tennis can help on the standup stage. \u201cYou have to be thinking so fast,\u201d he explained, \u201cand Ping-Pong is a game where you have to think so fast.\u201dAt Spin, Ms. Wu worked from a large basket of balls, feeding Mr. Friedlander shots as he worked on his return. Then it was time to practice his serve, working on sidespin, backspin and topspin and learning the correct moment for each.Then came more intense rallying that resembled a match. Far from step-by-step instruction, Ms. Wu\u2019s tips were sporadic and brief. His racket was too low. His forehand was too late. His backhand was too early.\u201cAt first, she was teaching me technique,\u201d he said. \u201cNow, it\u2019s more about me not being so dumb as a player.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s only a split second, but that can make the difference between it landing on the table or hitting the net,\u201d said Mr. Friedlander, who constantly stopped to stretch, often swinging a leg up onto the table to loosen a hamstring. When suiting up, he had pulled on elastic leg braces and heat pads for his back and neck.He is plagued with aches and pains in his hip, elbow, wrist and back. \u201cDude, I\u2019m an old guy who\u2019s got lots of chronic stuff,\u201d said Mr. Friedlander, who has been gearing up for some local tournaments.Over the years he has taken lessons from perhaps 10 different teachers, he said, but he has stuck with Ms. Wu, and has steered himself more toward the back-and-forth game favored by female players instead of the power-slam game more popular with men.\u201cI\u2019m older, so for me to play a power game just isn\u2019t realistic,\u201d he said. \u201cAlso the women play, I think, a quicker game than the men.\u201dIn addition to teaching at Spin on weekdays, Ms. Wu trains at the New York Indoor Sports Club in College Point, Queens, and in the basement of the Tenafly, N.J., home of her coach, Santos Shih, who puts her through tough, three-hour evening sessions.Ms. Wu said she played video games constantly as a child in Beijing, and it had left her with poor eyesight.\u201cI couldn\u2019t see a thing, but my mom\u2019s co-worker said maybe table tennis would help, and it worked,\u201d she said.\u201cIn China, table tennis is very organized, and they have tables in school,\u201d she said. \u201cStarting when you are 8 is late. Kids usually start at 5. So other kids were much stronger and I wasn\u2019t as good. But that made me really want to improve, to beat them.\u201dMs. Wu said she first came to New York from China with two teammates to play tournaments, began coaching students and lived in a basement apartment near the Wang Chen club. She now lives mostly in an apartment in Fort Lee, N.J.Mr. Friedlander calls her \u201ca pretty awesome American story,\u201d which included a struggle to pass her naturalization exam to gain citizenship. After his lessons, Mr. Friedlander helped her understand things, like what a state governor is, and American colloquialisms, like the proper order of the colors of the American flag.Initially, she recited them as \u201cblue, white and red,\u201d he recalled.\u201cI\u2019m like, \u2018That\u2019s correct, but never say it that way,\u2019\u201d he recalled. \u201cI\u2019m like, \u2018For whatever reason, in this country, you\u2019ve got to say red, white and blue, even though that\u2019s technically correct.\u2019\u201dHe corrected her when she thought the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. was the country\u2019s first black president, and gave her tips to help her memorize other American political figures.\u201cI just pulled out money, I pulled out quarters, pennies, dimes, and was like, \u2018These are your answers,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cAnd if you look at the city there\u2019s the George Washington Bridge. There\u2019s the F.D.R. Drive. The answers are kind of all around you. The Lincoln Tunnel.\u201dMs. Wu has called Mr. Friedlander from China to help her with paperwork, and when she had technical questions, Mr. Friedlander called Olympic officials seeking answers.He has also offered his own form of coaching. At the Pan Am games in July, Ms. Wu played before a packed arena, and seemed to be unusually nervous, he recalled.\u201cOne thing I do know about is performing under pressure,\u201d Mr. Friedlander said. So he told Ms. Wu how he stays calm onstage.\u201cYou\u2019ve got to not care, and you\u2019ve just got to do it,\u201d he said. \u201cI told her, \u2018Just play, don\u2019t worry about winning. If you\u2019re thinking about winning and the pressure, then you\u2019re not in the moment. You\u2019re not in the zone. You\u2019re not in the flow.\u2019\u201dIn this way Mr. Friedlander has played something of a sports psychologist\u2019s role, according to Sean O\u2019Neill, the director of communications for USA Table Tennis, the sport\u2019s governing body in the United States.He also called the comedian an excellent player with a keen understanding of the game, who has been Ms. Wu\u2019s \u201cNo. 1 supporter.\u201d\u201cThe support he\u2019s given her has definitely allowed her to play more within herself and at ease,\u201d Mr. O\u2019Neill said. \u201cHe has just given her great encouragement and helped promote her.\u201dAt a recent lesson, Ms. Wu bounced lightly on her toes, trading strokes with Mr. Friedlander, who was a bit winded and had sweated through his T-shirt. He planted himself a distance from the table, to better field her faster shots. At times, they whizzed by him in a linear blur, but occasionally he would hit his own dazzling winner.\u201cYes!\u201d he cried, after one such shot. \u201cUnreturnable. That\u2019s what I\u2019m talking about.\u201dMr. Friedlander\u2019s occasional eruptions barely seem to affect Ms. Wu\u2019s deadpan expression. Her demeanor is a foil to Mr. Friedlander\u2019s constant chatter.\u201cMy personality is nothing like his,\u201d she said. \u201cMaybe it\u2019s because in table tennis, you can\u2019t show your opponent anything.\u201dMr. Shih, her coach, said, \u201cIn the eight years she has been here, she has learned more and more English and appreciates his sense of humor more.\u201dShe still turns down Mr. Friedlander\u2019s invitations to his standup engagements.\u201cHe has invited me, but what if I don\u2019t understand, and everyone is laughing but me?\u201d she said.Ms. Wu confessed that she didn\u2019t really get it. The bit is a darker variant of Mr. Friedlander\u2019s \u201cWorld Champ\u201d shtick, in which he calls himself the world champ in anything and everything, including table tennis. \u201cI\u2019m banned from the Olympics; I put too much spin on the ball, and it messes with the Earth\u2019s rotation,\u201d he said. Ms. Wu barely grinned.\u201cWorld Champ\u201d is often emblazoned on his caps, including the one he wore during the lesson, though the words were written in Aurebesh, the alphabet used in \u201cStar Wars.\u201d (Mr. Friedlander had a tiny role in the most recent \u201cStar Wars\u201d film.)He jokes that it is he who has elevated Ms. Wu to the Olympic team.\u201cI\u2019m teaching her, she\u2019s not teaching me. That\u2019s why she\u2019s so good,\u201d he said.Her schedule calls for her to train in Beijing and Japan beginning this month, and return for more tournaments in Europe and the United States before the Olympics.\u201cShe\u2019s trying to get her ranking up,\u201d said Mr. Friedlander, explaining that a higher world ranking would help Ms. Wu in the Olympic pairings.\u201cSo when are the tournaments?\u201d he asked her, as they played. She said she would begin with a few in May, which included one in Croatia, where Mr. Friedlander\u2019s mother has roots.\u201cThey have a lot of lamb there,\u201d he reminded her. \u201cYou don\u2019t like lamb.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Trump is dropping close to $1 million apiece in Ohio and Florida for television ads, two people tracking media spending said, in a signal that the sustained advertising assault against him is taking a toll. Mr. Trump, who has talked about his psychological need to watch his costs as a businessman and who has bemoaned having to spend on television ads at all, made the ad reservations in the last two days. Florida and Ohio hold its primaries on March 15. The states are home to two of his rivals, Gov. John Kasich of Ohio and Senator Marco Rubio of Florida, and a home-state loss for either could knock them out of the presidential race. But more significant, Mr. Trump is on the receiving end of attack ads in Florida that are highlighting a class-action suit against Trump University, his defunct program of real estate seminars, by more than 5,000 former students who say they were cheated out of money. Among the groups airing ads focusing on Trump University are the American Future Fund and Our Principles PAC, which was founded by Katie Packer, a former adviser to Mitt Romney, the Republican presidential nominee in 2012. A member of the influential Ricketts family seeded the group with an early investment of $3 million. Other donors have since stepped in. On a conference call with donors last week, Brian Baker, an adviser to the Ricketts family, walked people through the delegate math and said that funding ads against Mr. Trump was a crucial endeavor. \u201cAmericans\u2019 frustrations and anger are real, and justified, but Donald Trump is not the answer,\u201d Mr. Baker said in a statement. \u201cHis lack of principle when it comes to policy, and his divisive rhetoric, neither unites nor inspires our party \u2014 or our country.

{"Headline": "Humans of New York Founder Takes On Donald Trump", "Date": "2016-03-26", "News": "Supported by\u201cI\u2019ve watched you retweet racist images,\u201d the post read in part. \u201cI\u2019ve watched you retweet racist lies. I\u2019ve watched you take 48 hours to disavow white supremacy. I\u2019ve watched you joyfully encourage violence, and promise to \u2018pay the legal fees\u2019 of those who commit violence on your behalf.\u201dThe reaction was explosive. Within eight hours the post was shared 712,000 times, eventually garnering more than 2.2 million \u201clikes,\u201d 1,131,389 shares and 69,000 comments, making it among the most-shared posts in the history of Facebook. In the process, it turned Mr. Stanton, already a best-selling author, into a web sensation.The clamor had by no means subsided when a boyish, tidily bearded Mr. Stanton arrived the other day at the Starbucks at Ninth Avenue and West 59th Street. Patrons strained for a closer look; one, who identified himself only as Ben, sprang from his chair to approach Mr. Stanton and invite him for coffee. (Mr. Stanton good-naturedly declined.)Safe then to say that for this apparently reluctant Internet star, life has taken an unforeseeable, and perhaps irreversible, turn.Mr. Stanton, who has 17 million followers on Facebook (Mr. Trump has 6.7 million) and two best-selling anthologies of his posts, had, for all that, chosen to largely remain an inconspicuous figure, a camera-toting Everyman, his face all but obscured by a hoodie and FDNY baseball cap.His decision to go public, embracing the role of moral gadfly and guardian of the public weal, came as something of a shock, even to himself.\u201cI saw my decision as a trade-off between upsetting people and making a strong moral statement,\u201d he said.The choice, Mr. Stanton said, did not come naturally. \u201cI was nervous,\u201d he said. \u201cBut eventually I closed my eyes and hit \u2018post.\u2019\u201dIt was the content, not the volume, of the subsequent responses that took him aback. \u201cI thought a lot of the feedback was going to be \u2018Stay out of politics,\u2019\u201d he said, leaning forward intently as the conversation picked up steam. In no way had he anticipated its impact or the avalanche of commentary that followed, much of it echoing or expanding upon his own sentiments. (The Trump campaign did not respond to a request for comment for this article.)It was the sort of validation Mr. Stanton said he has never chased.\u201cI\u2019m not an activist,\u201d he said. \u201cBut in keeping silent about a moral problem, I began to feel a lot of guilt.\u201dIndeed, his post was strikingly at odds with his customary posture as all-but-invisible observer.\u201cOn the blog I use very few words and no photos of myself,\u201d said Mr. Stanton, who draws his income from book sales and speaking engagements, and says he has turned down millions of dollars in online advertising. \u201cI don\u2019t want to rent out the influence of \u2018Humans of New York\u2019 to any third party.\u201dAt Starbucks, he projected a similar intensity, reddening from time to time, describing his work with a missionary zeal. He grasped this reporter\u2019s arm repeatedly to hammer home a point, and from time to time clamped a hand over hers, lest she somehow misinterpret him.\u201cI think there was a power in speaking directly to Donald Trump, rather than writing a think piece about him, \u201d Mr. Stanton said. \u201cIt also gave people who I think feel very strongly about him a chance to speak directly to him.\u201dHis decision arrived by degrees.

{"Headline": "Were Changes to Sanders Article \u2018Stealth Editing\u2019?", "Date": "2016-03-17", "News": "Updated, 10:54 a.m., to add new observations based on reader response.And these two paragraphs were added:But in his presidential campaign Mr. Sanders is trying to scale up those kinds of proposals as a national agenda, and there is little to draw from his small-ball legislative approach to suggest that he could succeed.Mr. Sanders is suddenly promising not just a few stars here and there, but the moon and a good part of the sun, from free college tuition paid for with giant tax hikes to a huge increase in government health care, which has made even liberal Democrats skeptical.Hundreds of Times readers expressed their disappointment or anger in emails to me on Tuesday and Wednesday, as well as on Twitter and Facebook. Many saw these changes as evidence that The Times strongly favors Mrs. Clinton\u00e2\u0080\u0099s candidacy. And some object to the practice of making substantial changes to articles without explaining that to readers \u00e2\u0080\u0093 a practice sometimes called \u00e2\u0080\u009cstealth editing.\u00e2\u0080\u009dDaniel Pereira of Alexandria, Va., wrote, \u00e2\u0080\u009cHow in the world can the Times justify publishing a story and then, after it has been shared many times, changing parts of it wholesale to substantially change the tenor of the article, with no notice that a change had been made?\u00e2\u0080\u009dAnd Sarae Pacetta of Upper Arlington, Ohio, wrote: \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat goes into big changes like this? I\u2019m familiar with corrections, but am curious about how an entire piece gets revised, especially with such a change in content.\u00e2\u0080\u009dMs. Steinhauer, in a response to my email, suggested that I speak to editors because \u00e2\u0080\u009cit was an editing decision.\u00e2\u0080\u009dSo, what happened here? Matt Purdy, a deputy executive editor, said that when senior editors read the piece after it was published online, they thought it needed more perspective about whether Mr. Sanders would be able to carry out his campaign agenda if he was  elected president.\u00e2\u0080\u009cI thought it should say more about his realistic chances\u00e2\u0080\u009d of doing that, Mr. Purdy told me. As first published, he said, editors believed  that the article \u00e2\u0080\u009cdidn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t approach that question.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00e2\u0080\u009cThere was a feeling that the story wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t written into this moment,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Purdy said. After the editing changes, he said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cit got to be a deeper story,\u00e2\u0080\u009d with greater context.Three editors told me in no uncertain terms that the editing changes had not been made in response to complaints from the Clinton camp. Did the Clinton people even reach out?\u00e2\u0080\u009cNot that I know of,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Baquet told me in an email. The article\u00e2\u0080\u0099s immediate editor, Michael Tackett, agreed: \u00e2\u0080\u009cThere\u00e2\u0080\u0099s zero evidence of that.\u00e2\u0080\u009dBut what about changes that affect the tone and substance of an article?Three Times editors told me clearly that they don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t believe that was required here. These changes were \u00e2\u0080\u009cabout nuance and depth,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Purdy said.\u00c2\u00a0In our conversation, Mr. Tackett referred to \u201cthe blessing and the curse of real-time capability,\u201d and he said he made changes to developing stories every day.Fair enough. But in this case, I don\u2019t agree.My take: The changes to this story were so substantive that a reader who saw the piece when it first went up might come away with a very different sense of Mr. Sanders\u2019s legislative accomplishments than one who saw it hours later. (The Sanders campaign shared the initial story on social media; it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hard to imagine it would  have done that if the edited version had appeared first.)Given the level of revision, transparency with the readers required that they be given some kind of heads-up, and even an explanation.So it can be done. And given the importance of reader trust in The Times\u00e2\u0080\u0099s credibility, the paper would do well to give some serious thought to how to do it here.The Times is one of the first major news organizations to take a firm stand against a growing and disliked practice.  \nThe Times has dismantled its environmental pod and discontinued the Green blog.\nThe public editor looks into a test drive of an electric car that caused a storm. The statistical wizard's offer to wager on the outcome of the presidential race is a bad choice. How does The Times decide which comments to post on NYTimes.com? The public editor gets answers from The Times's online commenting managers. \nReaders complained to the public editor over The Times's decision to display a photograph of the unconscious ambassador in Libya.  \nThose who reveal classified material are being punished like never before.When the government asks newspapers to keep quiet, the bar should be very high for saying yes. Editors were asked by the C.I.A. to withhold information and did so for months before publishing it online Tuesday night. Scott Shane, a Times national security reporter, was referred to in the government\u00e2\u0080\u0099s prosecution of a former C.I.A. official.Bradley Manning and WikiLeaks are a major story for The Times, so why was the paper so late to cover the soldier\u00e2\u0080\u0099s pretrial hearing? Just who is it that the United States is killing with strikes by unmanned aircraft in Yemen and Pakistan? The First Amendment matters for many reasons, some of them not on the world stage. The public editor travels to Harvard\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Shorenstein Center. With audio.Is the concept outdated or even more important in the new media era?The journalistic ideal of impartiality is coming under attack. My column for this week.The public editor speaks with Times editors about how they plan to fact-check the first presidential debate. When opinion appears in news pages, it needs to be labeled and displayed as just that. Whatever the conclusions, whatever the effectiveness, of challenging facts, the idea that we have to debate the necessity of the media doing so strikes me as absurd.The Times is reconsidering the use of the term \"illegal immigrant.\"An article coyly wrote around a business name that used an unprintable word according to The Times's standards.A crisis in North Africa and a reader\u00e2\u0080\u0099s query bring up crucial distinctions in usage.Families are rightfully upset by some of the early reporting done on the Newtown, Conn., shootings.The research and development team\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Chronicle tool may distract you while you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re waiting for the returns to come in.Unidentified sources make it difficult for readers to know what to believe regarding negotiations between the United States and Iran. The public editor's judgment is not about immigration reform; it's about clarity and accuracy.  An activist wants The Times to stop using the term \"illegal immigrant\" in its reporting.  After criticism on Twitter and elsewhere, the first sentence of an obituary for Yvonne Brill was changed.A front-page article involving the New York Police Department's internal communication could have provided greater context.A headline ignites a discussion about its \"undermining\" question. News organizations should evaluate the motivations of parents who want to take their child\u00e2\u0080\u0099s story public.Parental approval and the child\u00e2\u0080\u0099s own willingness should rule the day.Readers complained about the absence of people of color in T: The Times Style Magazine.The Times Magazine interviewer offended some high-profile female writers with his questions.Where, after what seemed like women's night on Tuesday at the Democratic National Convention, was the coverage of pay equity, along with gender-economic issues in general?Michael Kimmelman views architecture in terms of public policy as well as aesthetics.The criticism of a new restaurant in Times Square was delicious, even if the food was not. The critic Pete Wells gave his first \u00e2\u0080\u009cpoor\u00e2\u0080\u009d restaurant rating in The Times -- and he did it memorably. Cathy Horyn's work can't please everyone -- but this is ridiculous. Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Oculus Rift Review: A Clunky Portal to a Promising Virtual Reality", "Date": "2016-03-28", "News": "Supported byTech FixA dream of science fiction, which is how Facebook\u2019s Mark Zuckerberg describes virtual reality, is about to come true.Over the last week, I tested the Rift and many pieces of content for the system to see how true Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s words might ring. I can report that while the Rift is a well-built hardware system brimming with potential, the first wave of apps and games available for it narrows the device\u2019s likely users to hard-core gamers. It is also rougher to set up and get accustomed to than products like smartphones and tablets.Here\u2019s a tour through my early experiences of the Rift:The Rift works with technology that some might find anachronistic: a Windows PC, monitor, keyboard and mouse. With many people shifting away from desktop computers toward laptops, tablets and smartphones, finding a place to install the Rift and those other components may be a challenge. In my modest San Francisco apartment, I set up the system in the living room next to my television set. What an eyesore.On first use, the Rift felt sturdy and well made. The adjustable straps made it easy to fit around my head, and the built-in headphones create deep, high-quality sound. My main issue, which I suspect had to do with my face shape, was that I could not adjust the headgear to block out a small space right beneath my nose \u2014 I resorted to taping a piece of paper over it.Emil Rodriguez, an Oculus spokesman, said the headset is designed to take weight off the nose, which is why some people see a tiny space at the bottom of the headset.Getting started with the device took about an hour. Oculus instructs you to run an app that walks you through the process, which includes plugging in the headset and camera, synchronizing an Xbox controller and strapping on the headset.The biggest holdup was finding and downloading content through the Oculus app store. Many games are large downloads of more than 6 gigabytes, so a game took up to half an hour to download.After the \u201cinstall\u201d button was clicked to enable Windows to finish installing a game, there was another hangup: I couldn\u2019t run a game and download another one simultaneously. Instead, I had to quit whatever I was doing in the Rift to download something new. That means it will take many hours to start a nice collection of Rift games.Gamers who play on PCs, PlayStation or Xbox are familiar with these more demanding setups. But those used to unwrapping, say, a smartphone, and getting started after a few taps may find the Rift\u2019s setup laborious.Mr. Rodriguez said only some apps needed to be installed using the computer mouse; most should be able to be installed directly through the headset. He said downloads were paused while apps were running on the Rift to avoid compromising performance.I stood alone in an empty room beside a ferocious dinosaur. A few seconds later, I was crowding around a campfire with a fox, a deer and a rabbit. Then I was perched atop a skyscraper, looking down.These are some of the environments that Oculus places you in in a simulation it calls Dreamdeck, which serves as an introduction to virtual reality. As in an incoherent dream you might have after consuming a batch of special brownies, you jump from one disconnected scene to another.The Dreamdeck app is symbolic of the state of content for the Rift. The first batch of apps and games added up to a confusing, disjointed virtual reality landscape. In my tests, my reaction was more often \u201cWhy would I want to be here?\u201d or \u201cWhy is this in virtual reality?\u201d rather than \u201cWow.\u201dBut a reality in which you are a dead pilot enslaved to fight and die over and over? Hard-core gamers may love this, but I prefer to be in a less depressing place when escaping from actual reality. Put me on a beach where I can look at whales.A better use of the virtual reality headgear was Farlands, a game that involved visiting foreign planets to gather information about alien creatures and plants by taking photos of them. Stepping toward the Oculus camera moved me closer to an alien so I could tighten the frame of the photo. Looking at a place and pressing a button on the game controller teleported me to that location.If you purchase the Rift, you had better have thick skin. The aesthetic of the headgear \u2014 it looks like a pair of black ski goggles with air traffic controller headphones built into the sides \u2014 is not designed to get you a date. And since wearing the Rift makes users less aware of the outside world, videos and photos of them donning the contraption \u2014 and taken without their knowledge \u2014 may end up on Instagram or Facebook. I became a subject of ridicule when my partner was watching TV and I crouched in the middle of the living room while playing the dead space pilot game.The Rift has other consequences for the mind and body. I felt mentally drained after 20-minute sessions. My eyes felt strained after half an hour, and over a week I developed a nervous eye twitch.Oculus recommends Rift owners ease into the headset: Use it a few minutes at a time initially, then gradually increase the amount of time. All Rift users should take short breaks after every 30 minutes of use, the company said.The headset may also leave lasting impressions, or what I call \u201cnerd paint,\u201d on your face. After a long session, the Rift left two sets of parallel horizontal lines under my eyes.The Rift\u2019s graphics, sound and head tracking, which is the device\u2019s ability to follow where the viewer looks, do feel like something out of science fiction. While the system\u2019s setup is somewhat complex, the smoothness of the graphics and the high-quality design of the headgear make virtual reality feel ready for prime time.And yet there may be a higher reward for those who wait to buy the Rift.For one, Oculus has delayed the release of its motion-based controllers, called Touch, until later this year. In my experience, the motion controllers felt much more natural to use in virtual reality applications than a game controller.When it comes down to it, I don\u2019t disagree with Mr. Zuckerberg that this is just the beginning of virtual reality. With about 30 games and a few apps available at Rift\u2019s introduction, there isn\u2019t much to do with the system yet. Oculus will eventually need a larger, more diverse set of content to transcend its initial audience of gamer geeks.I, for one, will be waiting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Race Is On to Control Artificial Intelligence, and Tech\u2019s Future", "Date": "2016-03-25", "News": "Supported byMany of the tech industry\u2019s biggest companies, like Amazon, Google, IBM and Microsoft, are jockeying to become the go-to company for A.I. In the industry\u2019s lingo, the companies are engaged in a \u201cplatform war.\u201dA platform, in technology, is essentially a piece of software that other companies build on and that consumers cannot do without. Become the platform and huge profits will follow. Microsoft dominated personal computers because its Windows software became the center of the consumer software world. Google has come to dominate the Internet through its ubiquitous search bar.If true believers in A.I. are correct that this long-promised technology is ready for the mainstream, the company that controls A.I. could steer the tech industry for years to come.\u201cWhoever wins this race will dominate the next stage of the information age,\u201d said Pedro Domingos, a machine learning specialist and the author of \u201cThe Master Algorithm,\u201d a 2015 book that contends that A.I. and big-data technology will remake the world.In this fight \u2014 no doubt in its early stages \u2014 the big tech companies are engaged in tit-for-tat publicity stunts, circling the same start-ups that could provide the technology pieces they are missing and, perhaps most important, trying to hire the same brains.At the University of Toronto, IBM pursued a start-up called Ross Intelligence that makes a smart legal assistant, and extended a free offer to use its A.I. software, called Watson. For IBM, the financial payoff would come if start-ups like Ross generated sales, followed by a revenue-sharing arrangement. \u201cNo upfront costs at all,\u201d said Andrew Arruda, chief executive of the start-up, which moved last year to Silicon Valley.Now, Google\u2019s A.I. program is drawing additional attention and pointing to a consolidation among tech\u2019s biggest companies.By 2020, the market for machine learning applications will reach $40 billion, IDC, a market research firm, estimates. And 60 percent of those applications, the firm predicts, will run on the platform software of four companies \u2014 Amazon, Google, IBM and Microsoft.IBM is making the broadest entry into A.I. Its Watson unit, set up as a separate division in early 2014, is both a software and a services business, with technology tailored to specific industries. More than 80,000 developers have downloaded and tried out the software, and the Watson division has 500 industry partners, including big companies and start-ups.\u201cIt\u2019s early days, but the long-term goal is to have hundreds of millions of people use Watson as self-service A.I.,\u201d said David Kenny, general manager of the Watson division.In 2015, Amazon and Microsoft both added machine learning capabilities to their cloud software platforms, Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Azure. The companies are using machine learning software to help customers spot patterns and make predictions in vast amounts of data.Microsoft offers 18 machine learning services, including face recognition, text analysis and product recommendations. More A.I. capabilities, analysts say, should be announced at the end of the month, when Microsoft hosts a large conference for software developers in San Francisco.This week at a conference in San Francisco, Google showed off a new speech-to-text transcription service. The company also said its recently introduced vision software for identifying images would be broadly available soon, and it introduced new tools and training aids to help developers build machine-learning applications more easily.Intelligent software applications will become commonplace, said Jeff Dean, a computer scientist who oversees Google\u2019s A.I. development. \u201cAnd machine learning will touch every industry.\u201dAt Facebook, the A.I. vision is, at least for now, limited to its products.Mike Schroepfer, the chief technology officer, noted that Facebook\u2019s image-recognition software was now used to select what pictures or videos to show in a user\u2019s news feed, based on a person\u2019s friend network and interests.\u201cBefore, the photo was a black box to us,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s the most likely form this takes \u2014 a lot of things that add up to make the service steadily better on Facebook.\u201dIf products come first, a platform strategy typically takes shape later for the big consumer web companies. There are millions of Facebook app developers worldwide. Today, only about 1 percent of all software apps have A.I. features, IDC estimates. By 2018, IDC predicts, at least 50 percent of developers will include A.I. features in what they create.\u201cIt\u2019s where the market is headed,\u201d said David Schubmehl, an IDC analyst.The company, which was founded by Mike Tung, a Stanford computer science graduate student, in 2008, recently raised $10 million to compete directly with Google. Even though Diffbot is still being run out of a home near the Stanford campus, Mr. Tung is thinking big.\u201cOur goal is to capture all human knowledge,\u201d he said. \u201cI would like for Diffbot to build an iconic company around data. There are companies focusing on computing, but there is no Amazon of data.\u201dJohn Markoff reported from San Francisco and Steve Lohr from New York.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Obama's Flawed Realism", "Date": "2016-03-18", "News": "Supported byIn all the thousands of words, the fate of the troubled European Union and Nato merit zero reflection. Allies are mostly portrayed as freeloaders. We learn that Angela Merkel, the German chancellor, is \u201cone of the few foreign leaders Obama respects\u201d (a sentiment only partially reciprocated, at best, if my Berlin soundings are correct).Through several interviews with Goldberg, Obama emerges as a realist and an internationalist, in that order, dismissive of the notion that he has undermined American credibility in the world, resolute in defense of his inaction in Syria, skeptical of interventionism, unsentimental about Europe (and most things), and more inclined to view climate change as an existential threat than terrorism.Obama tells Goldberg, \u201cWe have history in Iran, we have history in Indonesia and Central America. So we have to be mindful of our history when we start talking about intervening.\u201dThere is truth to these words. Yet, coming from an American president, they are unusual. Reference to American-backed coups serving strongmen in far-flung lands is not the usual Oval Office fare of America-as-beacon.In electing Obama, a chastened United States chose a left-leaning intellectual. It chose a man sobered by history, childhood years in Indonesia and African-American suffering, disinclined by temperament and experience to beat the drum of American patriotism. This was a radical departure. The chest-thumping American irredentism symbolized by Donald Trump is in part a reaction to Obama\u2019s 21st-century realism. Trump is theater to Obama\u2019s theory, saber rattling to sobriety, America-first to America-in-the-world.\u201cI\u2019m very proud of this moment,\u201d Obama insists.Proud? It is possible to believe that the situation in Syria would be worse if Obama had followed through with punitive strikes. It is possible to believe that ISIS would have emerged, seized vast territory, beheaded Americans, rattled Paris and struck through sympathizers in San Bernardino anyway. It is possible to believe that Putin would have annexed Crimea anyway. It is possible to believe that Putin would have started a war in eastern Ukraine anyway. It is possible to believe that Assad would be stronger as a result of Russia\u2019s military intervention anyway. It is possible to believe that Saudi \u201cObama-is-a-Shiite-in-the-pocket-of-Iran\u201d derangement syndrome and Saudi war in Yemen would have occurred anyway. It is possible to believe that more than a million Syrian refugees would have shaken Europe anyway.It is possible to believe the moon is a balloon.Syria got away with it. The world was put at greater risk. Goldberg writes that Obama believes Churchill\u2019s \u201celoquently rendered bellicosity\u201d was \u201cjustified by Hitler\u2019s rise.\u201d Good to know. Even if Assad did not meet the do-something test.The thing about pendulums is they swing too far. Obama is right on many fronts.

The case has drawn outrage in Italy. Italian officials have vowed to keep up pressure on the Egyptian government to conduct a thorough inquiry, and have dispatched a team of investigators to Cairo. There was no immediate comment from the Italian government after the Egyptian announcement, which thanked the Italian investigators. Several factors had led to the suspicion that Egyptian security agencies had played a role in the student\u2019s death. Several witnesses said they had seen plainclothes security men stopping young men in the area where Mr. Regeni was last seen while on his way to meet friends. When his body was found nine days later, with cigarette burns, broken bones and fingernails removed, many Italian officials became more convinced of an official hand in his death. The Egyptian government has denied any suggestion that security forces were responsible. The Interior Ministry did not say whether their investigation into the student\u2019s disappearance had led to the gang members. The statement said that officers found them in a minibus in the New Cairo district on Thursday, and that the men opened fire when the officers approached. All four men were killed in the shootout. It was not clear whether any officers were killed or injured. In the minibus, the authorities found the body of an unidentified fifth man, in his 30s, according to the ministry. They also found guns and fake police identity cards. At the home of a gang member\u2019s sister, the police found a bag that they said contained Mr. Regeni\u2019s passport, his credit card and cellphones, as well as identity cards from Cambridge and the American University in Cairo, two institutions he was affiliated with.

Daley, a scion of the storied Daley political clan of Illinois, said he was not surprised that protests against Donald J. Trump before his Chicago rally got so out of hand that Mr. Trump canceled it before even taking the stage.And Mr. Daley wondered why the venue was selected in the first place.Mr. Daley, a former chief of staff to President Obama and a son of the late Richard J. Daley, the longtime mayor of Chicago, pointed out in an interview on Saturday that the University of Illinois at Chicago, where the rally was to be held, has one of the most diverse student bodies of any university in the country.It has 17,000 undergraduate students, many of whom come from low-income families. Roughly a quarter are Hispanic, 8 percent are black and 25 percent are Asian. Mr. Daley\u2019s father, who was mayor during the 1968 Democratic National Convention in Chicago that was marred by violence, had championed the creation of the campus.Mr. Daley wondered aloud whether the Trump campaign had picked the site to provoke a reaction. \u201cWhoever picked that location knew what they were doing as far as poking that sleeping dog there,\u201d Mr. Daley said.A spokeswoman for Mr. Trump did not respond to questions about Mr. Daley\u2019s thoughts on the location. It was not the first school that Mr. Trump has chosen for a rally; he has held others at colleges and universities over many months.But Chicago has a history of racial clashes and protests, Mr. Daley pointed out. There has been deep distrust between black residents and the police after a video released last year showed Laquan McDonald, a black teenager, being shot 16 times by a police officer.If anything, Mr. Daley said, it should have occurred to Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign that the venue could be a crucible for problems.Mr. Trump abruptly canceled his rally on Friday night, citing concerns of the Chicago Police Department. Officials with the Police Department denied having given such advice, saying the campaign chose to do it. But for days, it had been reported in the news media and on social media that thousands of people were signing petitions against Mr. Trump\u2019s appearance and planning major disruptions of his speech.Mr. Trump\u2019s allies suggest he has been treated unfairly by protesters who have gone to his rallies with the intention of stopping him from speaking and creating scenarios in which there could be violent clashes.Mr. Daley\u2019s view is different.

But it is far from clear whether his charm offensive will unlock Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s ultimate goal: persuading the Chinese government to lift its ban on the social media service and open it to the country\u2019s almost 700 million Internet users.The few American technology firms that have entered China in recent years have played down their efforts. Though Travis Kalanick, a founder of Uber, frequently travels to China, news of his presence rarely spreads across the Chinese Internet. There was almost no fanfare in advance of LinkedIn\u2019s deal with two closely connected Chinese venture capital shops to enter China, an event that was marked with a blog post.If Mr. Zuckerberg succeeds, it could show other foreign companies blocked in China that they have a potential path into the huge and fast-growing market \u2014 one that calls for them to accept China\u2019s strict controls on discourse and to refrain from rocking the boat. A failure would underscore Chinese distrust of foreign technology companies and cement the idea that the low-profile approach is the only way to gain market access.Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s meeting with Mr. Liu \u2014 a rarity for an American business executive \u2014 underscores the dynamic. Mr. Liu sits on the Chinese Communist Party\u2019s Politburo Standing Committee, the summit of power in China. The meeting serves China\u2019s propaganda purposes, allowing the country to show that one of the titans of America\u2019s new tech-based economy is happy to pay homage to China\u2019s leaders and its style of Internet governance.If there is anyone Facebook has to win over, it is Mr. Liu, who has for years presided over the controls on China\u2019s highly censored and stage-managed media.At the meeting, Mr. Liu lauded Facebook\u2019s technology prowess, but he also emphasized the importance of Internet governance \u201cwith Chinese characteristics,\u201d according to an official state news media account, a reference to censorship and surveillance within China.Mr. Zuckerberg praised China\u2019s progress in building an advanced Internet and vowed to work with Chinese peers to \u201cbuild a better world in cyberspace,\u201d according to Xinhua, China\u2019s official news agency.Facebook did not respond to a request for comment.On Friday, Mr. Zuckerberg posted a photo of himself smiling as he jogged past the Mao Zedong portrait in Tiananmen Square. He avoided mentioning both the violent crackdown on peaceful demonstrators there in 1989 and that morning\u2019s dangerous air pollution levels.During the discussion with Mr. Ma, the Alibaba founder, on Saturday, Mr. Zuckerberg also generally avoided sensitive topics, speaking instead about artificial intelligence and what should motivate entrepreneurs. He also praised China\u2019s emphasis on engineering, saying that he believed it would help solve future labor shortages associated with high-technology jobs.\u201cIn general we\u2019re seeing a huge constraint around the world on the number of good engineers who are graduating from universities,\u201d Mr. Zuckerberg said. \u201cAnd I think this is something that China has gotten really right by emphasizing for a long time.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Who Won the Missouri Primaries? We May Not Know for a While", "Date": "2016-03-16", "News": "It might be a while before we know conclusively who won the presidential primaries in Missouri.Even then, the margins are likely to be tight enough that the runners-up in both contests, Ted Cruz and Bernie Sanders, could seek recounts, a process that could take three more weeks. State law allows a candidate to request a recount if the margin of victory is less than one-half of 1 percent, which was true in both races. As it stands, Mr. Trump leads Mr. Cruz by 1,726 votes and Mrs. Clinton is ahead of Mr. Sanders by 1,531, according to the Missouri secretary of state\u2019s office. A triumph in Missouri would be a psychological victory for the campaigns that come out on top, but it also has significance in the delegate count, particularly in the Republican race, where 52 delegates are at stake.Twelve of those go to the statewide winner. Five go to the winner of each of the state\u2019s eight Congressional Districts. As the votes stood Wednesday, Mr. Trump would win five of the eight Missouri districts, with Mr. Cruz winning the other three, giving Mr. Trump 37 delegates to Mr. Cruz\u2019s 15.But several of those district victories were by very narrow margins \u2014 including one Trump win by roughly 100 votes \u2014 so those results could change.Any change on the Democratic side would most likely be minor, since the party awards delegates proportionate to the statewide vote.

In 2014, the vote approving a constitutional amendment allowing for the \u201cright to farm,\u201d a measure promoted as a bulwark against the overregulation of agricultural practices, and opposed by environmental groups and the Humane Society, was so close that a recount was requested, which affirmed the vote.\n\t\tFirst Draft provides fast-paced and comprehensive coverage of politics and elections by The New York Times.

{"Headline": "Supreme Court to Hear Samsung Appeal on Apple Patent Award", "Date": "2016-03-21", "News": "Supported byDesign patents once covered household items like spoons and fireplace grates \u2014 whose design was central to the product \u2014 and a finding of infringement required the defendant to turn over all of its profits. Samsung argued that this \u201ctotal profit rule\u201d did not make sense in the digital era and would \u201creward design patents far beyond the value of any inventive contribution.\u201d\u201cIn other words,\u201d the company\u2019s brief said, \u201ceven if the patented features contributed 1 percent of the value of Samsung\u2019s phones, Apple gets 100 percent of Samsung\u2019s profits.\u201dDesign patents are far less common than utility patents, which cover how products work. The Supreme Court has not heard a design patent case in over a century.A Samsung spokeswoman, Danielle Meister Cohen, said in a statement that the court\u2019s review \u201ccould lead to a fair interpretation of patent law that will support creativity and reward innovation.\u201d Apple declined to comment.The three design elements at issue in the case, Samsung Electronics Co. v. Apple Inc., No. 15-777, are, in Samsung\u2019s description, \u201ca particular black rectangular round-cornered front face\u201d; \u201ca substantially similar rectangular round-cornered front face plus the surrounding rim\u201d; and \u201ca particular colorful grid of sixteen icons.\u201dIn urging the Supreme Court not to hear the case, Apple said the justices should not reward a copycat.The justices agreed to decide only one of the questions on which Samsung had sought review: \u201cWhere a design patent is applied to only a component of a product, should an award of infringer\u2019s profits be limited to those profits attributable to the component?\u201dThe court appeared to acknowledge the possibility that \u201can award of a defendant\u2019s entire profits for design patent infringement makes no sense in the modern world.\u201d But it added that \u201cthose are policy arguments that should be directed to Congress.\u201d\u201cWe are bound by what the statute says, irrespective of policy arguments that may be made against it,\u201d the court said.David Opderbeck, a law professor at Seton Hall University, said the justices had focused on an important issue.\u201cThe key question is whether damages relating to a design patent should be apportioned in relation to the value added by the patented design or can cover the infringer\u2019s entire profit on the infringing product,\u201d he said.\u201cThe Federal Circuit read the design patent law very literally and held that the entire profits can be recovered,\u201d he added. \u201cIn my opinion, this is a far too literal reading of the statute, particularly because a product\u2019s ornamental design very often is not the primary driver of consumer demand and of the manufacturer\u2019s profits. In some ways, the Federal Circuit\u2019s ruling could allow design patent law to swallow utility patent law, making the ornamental design more important than the underlying technology.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Carrier Workers See Costs, Not Benefits, of Global Trade", "Date": "2016-03-19", "News": "Supported byINDIANAPOLIS \u2014 The fuzzy video, shot by a worker on the floor of a Carrier factory here in the American heartland last month, captured the raging national debate over trade and the future of the working class in 3 minutes 32 seconds.\u201cThis is strictly a business decision,\u201d a Carrier executive tells employees, describing how their 1,400 jobs making furnaces and heating equipment will be sent to Mexico. Workers there typically earn about $19 a day \u2014 less than what many on the assembly line here make in an hour. As boos and curses erupt from the crowd, the executive says, \u201cPlease quiet down.\u201dWhat came next was nothing of the kind.Within hours of being posted on Facebook, the video went viral. Three days after Carrier\u2019s Feb. 10 announcement, Donald J. Trump seized on the video in a Republican presidential debate and made Carrier\u2019s move to Mexico a centerpiece of his stump speeches attacking free trade.Jennifer Shanklin-Hawkins is one of those Carrier workers who listened to the announcement on the factory floor. After 14 years on the assembly line, she earns $21.22 an hour, enough to put her oldest son through college while raising two other children with her husband, a truck driver.And when she saw Mr. Trump talking about Carrier on the news, all she could do was shout \u201cYessss!\u201d at the TV. \u201cI loved it,\u201d she said. \u201cI was so happy Trump noticed us.\u201dIn living rooms and barrooms across Indianapolis, conversations with Carrier workers like Ms. Shanklin-Hawkins crystallize what has become an extraordinary moment in the American political and economic debate. As both political parties belatedly recognize the anxiety and deep-seated anger of blue-collar workers nationwide, the more-trade-is-good bipartisan consensus that has long held sway in Washington is being sundered.What isn\u2019t evident in the video \u2014 or in the furious debate it has spawned \u2014 is that both the company and its soon-to-be former employees are reacting to the same transformative quarter-century of American economic policy aimed at lowering trade barriers and staying globally competitive.\u201cWe have to look around the corner and see how this market will change in order to invest and stay in business for another 100 years,\u201d said Robert McDonough, a senior executive at Carrier\u2019s parent company, United Technologies. \u201cYou can blink and see your market position erode.\u201dThe rub is that the costs and benefits aren\u2019t distributed equally. Global trade has produced big gains for Americans, like more affordable goods \u2014 clothes, computers, even air-conditioners \u2014 and led to a more advanced economy.At the same time, a chronic trade deficit and an overvalued dollar have caused factory jobs to dry up, contributing to a deep divide between the political and economic elite and the rest of the nation. Perhaps a clash was inevitable.Consider the case of Ms. Shanklin-Hawkins. While she says she won\u2019t be voting for Mr. Trump and considers him a racist, she applauds his message on trade. She says she plans to vote for Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, who similarly blasts free trade, but from the left. The two populist candidates may be political opposites, but when it comes to the downside of globalization, Mr. Sanders and Mr. Trump are speaking to her with one voice.In fact, many Carrier workers here say that it was not so much Mr. Trump\u2019s nativist talk on illegal immigrants or his anti-Muslim statements that has fired them up. Instead, it was hearing a leading presidential candidate acknowledging just how much economic ground they\u2019ve lost \u2014 and promising to do something about it.Mr. Trump has repudiated decades of G.O.P. support for free trade, calling for heavy tariffs on Mexican-made goods from the likes of Carrier. This has helped put him within arm\u2019s reach of the Republican nomination.Opposition to trade deals has also galvanized supporters of Mr. Sanders, helping him unexpectedly win the Michigan Democratic primary this month. At the same time, it has forced his rival Hillary Clinton to distance herself from trade agreements she once supported, like the proposed 12-nation Trans-Pacific Partnership and the North American Free Trade Agreement, the 1994 deal with Mexico that is an important part of President Bill Clinton\u2019s political legacy.Exit polls after the Michigan primary , for example, showed that a clear majority of both Republican and Democratic voters believe international trade costs the American economy more jobs than it creates.Nicole Hargrove, a 14-year Carrier worker, said she was an undecided voter and was uncomfortable with Mr. Trump\u2019s attacks on immigrants, particularly Mexicans. \u201cBut I\u2019d like to turn him loose on the financial world,\u201d she said. \u201cMaybe if Carrier had to pay more to bring stuff in, they\u2019d think twice about moving jobs out.\u201dMark Weddle, 55, started work at Carrier 24 years ago and earns $21 an hour running a machine that makes heat exchangers. \u201cI have two brothers-in-law from Mexico,\u201d he said, explaining why he disagrees with Mr. Trump\u2019s anti-immigrant stance.But when it comes to Carrier, \u201cwe\u2019ve all worked our butts off,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd now they\u2019re going to throw us under the bus? If Trump will kick Carrier\u2019s ass, then I\u2019ll vote for him.\u201dThat\u2019s pretty much what Mr. Trump has threatened to do. At rally after rally, to rapturous crowds, he vows to impose a 35 percent tax on Carrier products from Mexico. Then, the laugh line: \u201cI want to do this myself, but it is so unpresidential to call up Carrier.\u201dAnd Mr. Trump vows not to take Carrier\u2019s calls until it agrees to change course. \u201cAs sure as you\u2019re here, they will call me up within 24 hours,\u201d he promises, and say to him, \u201c\u2018Sir, we\u2019ve decided to stay in the United States.\u2019\u201dIt is powerful talk.The relentless loss of American manufacturing jobs, however, goes back nearly half a century, driven largely by forces beyond the control of any president. The advances of technology, the diffusion of industrial expertise around the world, the availability of cheap labor and the rise of China as a manufacturing powerhouse would have disrupted the nation\u2019s industrial heartland even without new trade deals.Nor are tariffs likely to bring many of these jobs back, said David Autor, a professor of economics at M.I.T., who is one of the country\u2019s foremost specialists on the pluses and minuses of free trade. \u201cWe don\u2019t have silver bullets,\u201d he said.\u201cWhen I learned about the impact of trade agreements, the theory was that workers would be \u2018released\u2019 into the labor market and hired back at slightly lower salaries,\u201d Mr. Autor said. \u201cThat\u2019s not what happened. And no amount of cheaper air-conditioners will make these workers whole.\u201dOn a rainy Thursday afternoon this month, after their 6 a.m.-to-4:30 p.m. shift, a dozen Carrier workers gathered at Sully\u2019s Bar & Grill to talk about the decades they had spent at the low-slung, beige-and-white factory across the street.The group was diverse: black and white, male and female, old and young. And until the announcement of the eventual shutdown, most of them said they had loved working for Carrier, assembling furnaces and fan coils, hard as the work could be.The workers in the Indianapolis factory are represented by the United Steelworkers union. As has been the case in the auto industry, the union agreed in 2011 to a two-tier wage system in which new hires were paid less than veteran employees.\u201cI\u2019m more skilled with my hands than I am with my brain,\u201d said Robin Maynard, half joking. He holds two associate degrees, oversees a team of 15 and has worked at Carrier almost 24 years. \u201cBut I like working with my hands.\u201dMs. Shanklin-Hawkins emphasized that she, too, enjoyed her work, despite having little flexibility when it came to setting hours. \u201cI missed football games, graduations, you name it,\u201d she said.Her shifts can run 10 hours a day, six days in a row during summer and fall, when her line is busy, and mandatory overtime can total 20 hours a week. The pay, benefits and pension plan are all good, but it wasn\u2019t just the money that kept her on the assembly line, Ms. Shanklin-Hawkins said.\u201cIt\u2019s pretty cool working there,\u201d she said, describing how she carefully puts together \u201ctubular mixers,\u201d batches of rods that control the air flow in Carrier furnaces. \u201cAnd when you do it for 60 hours a week, people are like family.\u201dIt is painstaking work: Bend the rods, or force them into place, and the line can come to a halt, prompting a tongue-lashing from a supervisor. Despite that, like many of the 12 million American factory workers, Ms. Shanklin-Hawkins says the nation\u2019s leaders have simply lost respect for people who make things.\u201cThey didn\u2019t even thank us for our work,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was wrong.\u201dIndianapolis is far better off than many other cities in and around the Rust Belt. For the most part, it has successfully made the transition to an economy powered by services like health care, logistics and banking. The city\u2019s unemployment rate is 4.6 percent, below the national average of 4.9 percent.But many of the new jobs don\u2019t pay nearly as well as Carrier does. Next to the 49-year-old Carrier plant is an Amazon warehouse that opened in 2011, but with salaries there averaging just over $15 an hour, that\u2019s a lot less than the $20 or more an hour Carrier workers typically earn.Indiana politicians, who granted Carrier tax breaks and other incentives, are furious at the company and want their money back. They are also angry because Carrier\u2019s parent, United Technologies, is a major military contractor that receives $5.6 billion annually from the federal government.\u201cThat\u2019s financed by the taxpayers they just fired,\u201d said Senator Joe Donnelly, Democrat of Indiana. \u201cThey are trying to be the ultimate free rider.\u201dCarrier has said it will return public money in cases where the company has not kept its commitments to invest. But that\u2019s small change for United Technologies, a company with sales of $56 billion annually, more than Walt Disney, Coca-Cola or Goldman Sachs. And, in any case, it won\u2019t bring the jobs back.Carol Bigbee, 59, has worked at Carrier for 13 years. Her 32-year-old daughter has a college degree and the kind of job that many economists say is the future in postindustrial America \u2014 she works in a medical lab. The only problem, Ms. Bigbee said, is that her daughter\u2019s hourly pay is one-third less than her own pay at Carrier.\u201cI think it will be extremely hard to find a job that pays $22 an hour,\u201d Ms. Bigbee said. \u201cYou have to be really blessed to find a job that pays that kind of money.\u201d The few manufacturing jobs left require math tests, something she says she worries she could not pass.The first layoffs won\u2019t begin until 2017, and the final shuttering of the factory isn\u2019t expected to happen until 2019, giving employees time to prepare. In addition, United Technologies has offered to cover the cost of at least four years of additional schooling for Carrier workers. But that\u2019s cold comfort to people who can\u2019t afford not to work or those, like Ms. Bigbee, who are near retirement.She will be 60 in May, making retraining impractical. \u201cIf I were in my 40s, I\u2019d go back to school,\u201d she said.As Ms. Bigbee and her co-workers were talking over beers and Tequila Sunrises at Sully\u2019s in Indianapolis, executives from United Technologies were hosting a gathering of their own in New York City \u2014 at the Plaza Hotel, a property that was once owned, as it happens, by Donald Trump.That meeting was part of \u201cinvestor day,\u201d an annual ritual for many Fortune 500 companies in which management sits down with analysts and shareholders and tells them why their company\u2019s stock is a good buy. Carrier\u2019s message: Moving jobs south of the border is a major part of the company\u2019s strategy to increase profits.Manufacturing products in lower-cost locales isn\u2019t new for Carrier, which has had operations in Monterrey, Mexico, since 1969, decades before Nafta\u2019s passage.But Akhil Johri, the chief financial officer, noted that recent factory consolidation was among the reasons Carrier\u2019s management is eyeing a list of targets for future cuts. \u201cThey are painful\u201d but are necessary \u201cfor the long-term, competitive nature of the business and shareholder value creation,\u201d he said. \u201cWe feel good about being able to execute on that.\u201dUnited Technologies faces pressure from investors hungry for earnings growth in an economy that\u2019s only modestly growing at home, and falling in important overseas markets like China and the Middle East. Although the company\u2019s stock has vastly outperformed benchmarks in the last few decades, the shares have badly trailed the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index over the most recent five years.Wall Street is looking for United Technologies to post a 17 percent increase in earnings per share over the next two years, even though sales are expected to rise only 8 percent. Bridging that gap means cutting costs wherever savings can be found, as Mr. McDonough suggested at the meeting with analysts.Still he rejected the notion that pressure from Wall Street, or corporate greed, or even trade policy, had prompted the factory move to Monterrey. \u201cThis was a really tough decision,\u201d he said. \u201cThis will have a real impact on folks we care about and this community. We\u2019re an American company, but we compete globally.\u201dStaying competitive, raising profits and investing are among the reasons 400 white-collar jobs in areas like engineering and marketing will remain in Indiana.\u201cOur company, with American workers,\u201d he added, \u201cbuilds a heck of a lot of stuff in the U.S.\u201dLess than a three-hour drive south of Laredo, Tex., where the mountains meet the desert scrub near Monterrey, lies one industrial park after another. That\u2019s where Carrier and many other American manufacturers have built gleaming factories.Outside Carrier\u2019s plant on Hermenegildo Galeana Street in the suburb of Santa Catarina, a worker named Antonio Arroyo has nothing but positive things to say about his job, much like his colleagues in Indianapolis until last month. \u201cThe atmosphere is relaxed, a healthy environment,\u201d he said. \u201cEven the temporary workers are constantly trained.\u201dAs in the United States, the day shift starts around 6 a.m. and finishes about 4 p.m., with a break for lunch. Temporary workers, who have contracts lasting from three to six months, earn 163 pesos a day, or $9.40. Permanent workers make 330 pesos for a day\u2019s work, or $19.Hourly salaries in Indianapolis range from $15 to $26 an hour, as they do up the road in Huntington, Ind., where an additional 700 United Technologies jobs will be transferred to Mexico as well.United Technologies is not hurting like the American automakers or steel giants who lost billions when they were caught short by up-and-coming Japanese and South Korean competitors in the 1970s and 1980s. But the company says it fears it could end up in a similar situation if it doesn\u2019t make sure it is among the most efficient manufacturers in the world.Over all, United Technologies earned nearly $7.6 billion last year, and $2.9 billion of that came from the climate, controls and security division that includes Carrier. Those profits aren\u2019t under pressure; in fact, margins in the unit have steadily expanded in recent years.But that\u2019s not good enough, said Howard Rubel, a senior analyst at Jefferies, who notes that United Technologies has vowed to cut at least a half-billion dollars in costs annually for the next few years. \u201cThe stock hasn\u2019t done well,\u201d Mr. Rubel pointed out.United Technologies\u2019 board cut the bonus of its chief executive, Gregory J. Hayes, by nearly half for 2015. Still, with a total compensation package of $5.7 million, he made more last year than Carrier\u2019s factory workers could earn in several lifetimes. But in corporate boardrooms and country clubs, that\u2019s not the point.\u201cIt\u2019s embarrassing,\u201d said Mr. Rubel. \u201cThe stock didn\u2019t do well, and he got dinged. And whether it\u2019s the board or personal pride, no one wants that.\u201dBack in Indiana, smaller bonuses for top executives are the last thing state Representative Karlee Macer wants to hear about these days. Her district includes the Carrier plant, and for all their grit and noise and physical strain, manufacturing jobs aren\u2019t like many other positions available to Americans who lack a college degree, she said. For one thing, they pay more, giving the children of factory workers other options if they so choose.\u201cMy family has all been factory workers, including my grandmother, who came home with burn marks from welding,\u201d she said over breakfast across the street from the Indiana Statehouse. \u201cIs everybody who is not a white-collar worker supposed to earn $12 an hour?\u201dJuan Zertuche contributed reporting from Monterrey, Mexico.Advertisement"}

Mr. Mack said in an interview that he would spend up to $1 million on \u201cThe Committee to Draft Speaker Ryan,\u201d which was formed last week, but has kept its backers secret until now. Mr. Ryan has disavowed the group, which is plowing ahead anyway. Mr. Mack will serve as the honorary chairman of the group. He said he had no animus toward Donald J. Trump, the  front-runner for the party\u2019s nomination. \u201cI\u2019ve never had any fights with him,\u201d Mr. Mack said. \u201cOur parents were friendly. Fred Trump used my father\u2019s contractors to build his house.\u201d But he added, \u201cIt all comes down to winning the election, not dividing our party, and I think that this presidential election has descended into more of a schoolyard scuffle.\u201d  Mr. Mack, who was the ambassador to Finland, said he believed the tone of the campaign had touched \u201cthem all with the finger of pollution.\u201d  Winning a general election would be a struggle for all of the candidates after so much mud has been flung, he added. Mr. Mack said that Mr. Ryan was not aware of the effort while the group was being put into place.The push is expected to include digital ads and other measures.

Mr. Ryan, the party\u2019s vice-presidential nominee in 2012, has been a favorite of conservative opinion makers for years, and last week he criticized Mr. Trump, indirectly, for some of his caustic comments. But Mr. Ryan is not warm to the idea of a group drafting him to be his party\u2019s standard-bearer.

{"Headline": "Hillary Clinton Urges Effort to Improve Struggling Schools", "Date": "2016-03-11", "News": "DURHAM, N.C. \u00e2\u0080\u0094 Hillary Clinton made a pitch for public schools at a get-out-the-vote rally on Thursday, proposing to create a teaching task force that would recruit more young people and midcareer professionals to the country\u00e2\u0080\u0099s struggling public schools.Mrs. Clinton mentioned seeing crumbling schools in rural South Carolina and urban classrooms in Detroit infested with rodents and mold. She said that when she traveled across the country as first lady she would apply what she called \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe Chelsea test\u00e2\u0080\u009d to public schools she would visit.\u00e2\u0080\u009cI would say to myself \u00e2\u0080\u0098Would I send my daughter there?\u00e2\u0080\u0099\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cA lot of places, the answer was yes, and proud to do it, but too many times the answer was no.\u00e2\u0080\u009dThe plan came days after Mrs. Clinton defended teachers\u00e2\u0080\u0099 unions at a Democratic debate in Flint, Mich., on Sunday. Asked by CNN\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Anderson Cooper if unions \u00e2\u0080\u0094 the largest of which have endorsed Mrs. Clinton \u00e2\u0080\u0094 protect bad teachers, she pushed back on the assumption.\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt really pains me,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said, \u00e2\u0080\u009ca lot of people have been blaming and scapegoating teachers because they don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want to put the money into the schools system that deserve the support that comes from the government.\u201dNorth Carolina, which holds its primary on Tuesday, has seen its public schools stripped of funding in recent years. Mrs. Clinton has come under criticism for expressing skepticism of charter schools and teachers\u00e2\u0080\u0099 evaluations, two topics she hardly broached in Thursday\u00e2\u0080\u0099s upbeat address.Instead, Mrs. Clinton tried to make her remarks personal. She talked about studying North Carolina\u00e2\u0080\u0099s public schools as first lady of Arkansas when she was given the task of improving that state\u00e2\u0080\u0099s schools. But since then, she said, Republicans in the state had \u00e2\u0080\u009cslowly eroded\u00e2\u0080\u009d public education. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI am a product of really good public schools,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI had great teachers from kindergarten through high school. They challenged me. They helped me understand the world that I l lived in and what I could do to make a difference.\u00e2\u0080\u009dThe speech on improving public education came on a busy day of campaigning for Mrs. Clinton as she shuttled to campaign events from Florida to Illinois (with a stop in North Carolina on the way) leading up to Tuesday\u2019s voting contests. At a stop in Tampa, she discussed investing in infrastructure.At a late-night rally outside Chicago, Mrs. Clinton discussed manufacturing and job training \u00e2\u0080\u0094 topics that have become central to the race in the Midwestern states where her opponent, Senator Bernie Sanders, has criticized her record on trade deals.\n\t\tFirst Draft provides fast-paced and comprehensive coverage of politics and elections by The New York Times.

{"Headline": "Iditarod Sled Dog Race Lacks Snow, So Alaska Ships Some In", "Date": "2016-03-04", "News": "Supported byAs mushers and their dogs prepare for the Iditarod sled dog race, the fabled trek through Alaska\u2019s wilderness, a warm winter has once again robbed the starting line of an important ingredient: snow.To make sure the dozens of sledding teams are greeted with snow at the start of their roughly 1,000-mile journey, organizers decided to ask the Alaska Railroad to trundle in about 350 cubic yards of it from snowier locales. It is the first time the railroad has had to ship snow from Fairbanks to Anchorage. The shipping service was donated, according to a railroad official.\u201cMoving snow out of the way, we don\u2019t usually bring it to somewhere else,\u201d Tim Sullivan, a spokesman for the railroad, told The Associated Press. According to the National Weather Service, 27 inches of snow has fallen in the Anchorage area since July. The area normally sees about 61 inches in that time.The backup snow arrived on Thursday, the boulder-shaped material filling up several train cars that are designed to flip open and dump out their contents. It is enough snow to blanket a football field up to three inches, but it is apparently not enough to cover the 11-mile track in Anchorage, which will be used for the ceremonial start of the race on Saturday. So the ceremonial course will be eight miles shorter this year, officials said.The larger races continue, but not without concerns. In February, patches of the 1,000-mile Yukon Quest trail were free of snow, which could affect the safety of sled dogs.Alaska\u2019s tourism industry relies on the ability of people to attend a race like the Iditarod \u2014 and some mushers rely on the tens of thousands of dollars in prize money \u2014 but the consequences of warmer winters go well beyond affecting the viability of a sledding race.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": null, "Date": null, "News": "AdvertisementMarch 17, 2016Robert E. ScottJeffrey J. SchottTrade has become an increasingly important part of the United States economy. In the 1960s, exports and imports represented less than 10 percent of U.S. gross domestic product; today the share is closer to 30 percent. As a result, American  exporters sell more U.S. goods abroad than ever before \u2014 and imports give American  consumers more choices at lower prices. Americans have higher living standards because trade enables them to afford more goods.Trade benefits consumers in other ways \u2014 many of the products that are produced in the United States are cheaper and better because they have imported components and raw materials, improving their quality and lowering their cost. Trade thus boosts the competitiveness of products made at home, which, in turn, allows American  producers to sell more abroad and employ more workers in the U.S.For the United States, trade agreements open markets abroad without significant changes in current U.S. trade restrictions. That is because with few exceptions, U.S. trade barriers are already low and U.S. regulatory requirements protecting consumers, workers and the environment are high. Almost all our trading partners have higher barriers; trade negotiations are largely about how much and how fast they will change their practices, upgrade their regulatory standards toward U.S. norms and open their markets to new competition from the United States and other countries. From the U.S. perspective, the benefits are straightforward. We get more access abroad to sell our competitive farm products, manufactured items and services.Why do other countries accept such \"unbalanced\" deals? Because trade pacts require them to undertake domestic policy reforms that they need to do in any event to boost productivity and growth in their economies. Often those countries find it easier to pursue necessary but politically contentious reforms as part of an international accord in which they receive other economic and political benefits. Trade pacts reinforce U.S. political and strategic interests beyond the gains in commercial ties. Recall that the first U.S. free trade pact was in 1985 with Israel, and it is a cornerstone of the U.S.-Israel relationship.  The Trans-Pacific Partnership will similarly cement American ties with the Asia-Pacific region.  It reassures our allies that the United States is a reliable partner that remains engaged in a region facing North Korean adventurism.To say that trade agreements are good for America doesn\u2019t mean that they benefit all Americans.  Some firms can take advantage of the new opportunities and others suffer from increased competition.  Yes, trade deals can displace some workers from their current jobs, but they also create many new jobs in areas where America has a competitive advantage such as business services and high-tech industries. Compared to overall U.S. job creation and dislocation each month, affected largely by technological advances and changes in consumer demand, the impact due to trade agreements is exceedingly small, but positive because, on balance, trade pacts create better and higher paying jobs than the ones displaced. Workers in manufacturing firms that export generally earn wages 12 to 18 percent higher than their counterparts in firms that only serve the domestic market.Of course, the net result is little solace for those suffering loss of job or income.  But the response should not be to make everyone less well off.  Instead, we should be doing more, like other advanced countries, to promote labor adjustment through programs that provide wage insurance, targeted job training and other transition support.  Our political leaders have given such programs short shrift and are now witnessing the political backlash against their inaction.Let\u2019s not forget that trade pacts create commercial opportunities but do not guarantee sales. American  firms and workers face tough competition at home and abroad.  Inadequate investment in educating American children and retraining and retooling  workers is a higher tax on U.S. competitiveness than tariffs and quotas hindering America\u2019s  access to foreign markets.\nIt\u2019s no surprise that voters on the right and the left are uneasy with U.S. trade policy \u2014 and they have every right to be. For years, the United States has consistently run much larger trade deficits than other developed nations, and we have suffered more trade-related job loss as a result. While growing exports tend to support domestic employment, growing imports costs jobs and reduces domestic output. Thus, the size and growth of trade deficits is strongly correlated with trade-related job loss.Workers without a college degree make up more than two-thirds of the U.S. labor force, roughly 100 million people. Thus, the growth of globalization, as encouraged by more than 20 U.S. trade and investment deals, plus the proposed T.P.P., is responsible for transferring approximately $180 billion per year from low- and middle-income workers to those in the top third, and especially to those in the top 10, 1 and 0.1 percent of the population.It is time for a reset in U.S. trade and international economic relations. We must put an end to unfair trade practices such as currency manipulation, which is the single largest cause of U.S. trade deficits and trade-related job losses. The United States needs to develop a results-based approach to trade negotiations that is designed to rebalance global trade and ensure that the benefits of trade are broadly shared, and not funneled to those with the most wealth and power in our society.\nRob\u2019s comments on job losses are not supported by the actual data.  Over the last year, total U.S. private sector, non-farm employment went up by 2.6 million jobs, and the unemployment rate fell from 5.5 percent to 4.9 percent -- a level most economists consider to be near full employment.  Yet Rob suggests that U.S. trade with the 11 other countries in the Trans-Pacific Partnership cost us 2 million jobs in this period!The basic fallacy in Rob\u2019s analysis is the assumption that trade deficits increase overall U.S. unemployment.  Over the last 25 years, we have implemented a large array of trade agreements.  During that period, the U.S. trade deficit has fluctuated generally in line with U.S. economic performance.  The deficit grows when times are good and shrinks when the economy slows.The simple answer is that Rob cites real problems but misdiagnoses the causes.  As I said earlier, the source of many stresses in the U.S. labor market is a combination of technological advances and under-investment in U.S. human and physical infrastructure; the impact of trade agreements is relatively minor but positive.\nJeff claims that \u201cthe impact due to trade agreements is exceedingly small, but positive because, on balance, trade pacts create better and higher paying jobs than the ones displaced.\u201d But he is wrong on both counts. Trade deals have both cost jobs and pushed workers into lower paying ones.The majority of our trade deficits and manufacturing job losses are because of currency manipulation by China and about 20 other countries, including Japan, Malaysia, Singapore and Vietnam in the proposed Trans-Pacific Partnership. These policies act like a subsidy of 30 to 40 percent on all of their exports to the United States, and a tax on all of our exports to those countries, and to all other countries where we compete with their exports (essentially, the rest of the world).

Mr. Cruz comes in third with 15 percent, followed by Mr. Rubio at 7 percent.Like Mr. Rubio in Florida, Mr. Kasich\u2019s candidacy rests on a strong performance in Ohio. The poll shows him winning among women and holder voters. He is also seen as being better on social issues and more empathetic to the needs of voters.Quinnipiac\u2019s Ohio poll also shows Mr. Trump leading Mr. Kasich by 6 points, with the rest of the pack lagging far behind.The surveys were conducted over the weekend while voters were going to the polls in other states and the outcomes could sway voters next week. CNN\u2019s poll had a margin of error of plus or minus six percentage points, while Quinnipiac\u2019s margin of error was plus or minus four percentage points.On the Democratic side, CNN/ORC found that Hillary Clinton holds wide leads over Senator Bernie Sanders in both states. She tops him 63 percent to 33 percent in Florida and 61 percent to 34 percent in Ohio.After pulling off a stunning upset in Michigan this week, Mr. Sanders will be looking to extend his momentum and demonstrate that he can defy the odds\u00c2\u00a0again.Both Florida and Ohio are \u201cwinner-take-all\u201d states.

{"Headline": "Can David McVicar Bring Peace to the Opera Wars?", "Date": "2016-03-18", "News": "Supported byThe Scottish director David McVicar was running on and off the stage of the Metropolitan Opera recently, rehearsing his new production of Donizetti\u2019s \u201cRoberto Devereux\u201d \u2014 making sure the crowds never took the focus off the prima donna, helping the tenor make the most of his final exit before his death, and even delivering a funny, occasionally profane motivational speech to the chorus.It was the kind of attention to detail that has made him one of the go-to directors of Peter Gelb\u2019s reign as general manager of the Met. \u201cRoberto Devereux\u201d will be Mr. McVicar\u2019s fifth opera at the Met this season, making him an important figure as the company tries to chart a new theatrical course at a moment of precarious finances and when the most polarizing, bitterly fought-over aspect of opera is no longer dueling composers or rival singers but opposing styles of direction.Neither orthodoxy holds much appeal for Mr. McVicar.\u201cIt\u2019s just two polarities of tradition to me, and I\u2019m interested in neither,\u201d Mr. McVicar said.\u201cI don\u2019t think style is important,\u201d he said. \u201cI think finding the intrinsic truth of the piece is the important thing.\u201dThe debate over directorial style has taken on added resonance in recent years as a number of leading opera companies, including the Met and the English National Opera in London, have struggled with falling attendance. Every opera fan seems to have an opinion about what to do: Shake things up to attract new audiences! Return to tradition to avoid alienating your base! The challenging financial picture has significantly raised the stakes for new productions at the Met, which has invested heavily in them during the Gelb years, at a moment when the company has had to cut the wages of its work force and rely even more on the largess of wealthy patrons.At the Met, Exhibit A in the simmering debate over style has been Puccini\u2019s \u201cTosca.\u201d Early in his tenure, Mr. Gelb replaced Franco Zeffirelli\u2019s lavish 1985 production, a crowd favorite with a grand scale and hyper-realistic sets, with a much more austere, R-rated version by Luc Bondy.So it is notable that now that the Met has decided to retire the Bondy staging, it has turned to Mr. McVicar to direct the next production, which will open on New Year\u2019s Eve 2017. (That will be another big year for him at the Met: His star-studded new production of Bellini\u2019s \u201cNorma\u201d will open the season, featuring Anna Netrebko and Joyce DiDonato.)This year, a fifth of the Met\u2019s productions are by Mr. McVicar, a tally swelled by the fact that the company is doing his three installments of the Donizetti so-called \u201cTudor Trilogy.\u201d It gives him a big role in shaping the company\u2019s production style \u2014 and makes him one of a handful of directors, a group including Mr. Zeffirelli, Otto Schenk, John Dexter and Nathaniel Merrill, who have similarly dominated seasons at the Met during the past three decades.\u201cNobody blinked at our \u2018Pearl Fishers\u2019 being set in the present, and in fact I think traditional opera lovers loved it,\u201d Mr. Gelb added in a telephone interview. \u201cBut obviously they wouldn\u2019t \u2014 and didn\u2019t \u2014 feel the same way about \u2018Tosca,\u2019 even though that wasn\u2019t set in the present, it was just set in a set that wasn\u2019t as beautiful as Zeffirelli was.\u201dMr. McVicar, for his part, is charting his own directorial path: He neither deconstructs the operas he directs nor feels bound by conventions of period or style. He will no longer accept work in Germany, where, he said, \u201cthe production style is now so navel-gazing and so extreme, and has been excluding the audience for a quarter of a century.\u201d But he lamented that a dark, abstract, violent production of Verdi\u2019s \u201cAida\u201d that he did in London failed to catch on. \u201cA lot of the public didn\u2019t get it, didn\u2019t like it,\u201d he said. \u201cThey wanted pyramids.\u201dHe did not set out to become an opera director. Born in Glasgow in 1966, Mr. McVicar was initially drawn to the theater and studied at the Royal Scottish Academy of Music and Drama. At first he hoped to become a designer, then an actor, and finally a director; an invitation to stage Mozart\u2019s \u201cIl Re Pastore\u201d at Opera North in Leeds when he was in his mid-20s set him on a new path. He received a knighthood for his work in opera in 2012.\u201cI know some people would describe me as weak conceptually, because the concepts of the productions are never the dominant feature,\u201d Mr. McVicar said in an interview at a bar near the Met after a day of rehearsals. \u201cIt\u2019s never like, screaming at the audience.\u201dIn an age in which many opera companies, including the Met, often turn to theater directors and film directors who add a valuable \u201cOscar-\u201d or \u201cTony-winning\u201d to marketing materials, Mr. McVicar is something of a throwback: an opera director through and through. \u201cThis is the art form I have chosen to dedicate myself to,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m not going to make any films, you know? Hollywood can exist without me.\u201dAnd while he named no names, he said that he had seen \u201clots of really good, really intelligent drama directors fall on their faces when they try to do an opera.\u201d Some, he said, did not understand how opera singers were different from actors. Others did not seem to know the works thoroughly enough. Some did not understand how to move a chorus gracefully on- and offstage.He said that some even start rehearsals with read-throughs of the text, as if it were a play. \u201cAnd I think, Oh no, no, no, no, no,\u201d Mr. McVicar said. \u201cYou\u2019ve just alienated the entire cast in one fell swoop, and you\u2019re never going to get them back because what you\u2019ve said is, we can divorce the music, and music is their point of connection to the text.\u201dThe soprano Sondra Radvanovsky, who is starring as Elizabeth I in \u201cRoberto Devereux\u201d and earlier this season sang the title roles in his productions of \u201cAnna Bolena\u201d and \u201cMaria Stuarda,\u201d marveled at his attention to detail.\u201cHe was here this morning at 9 o\u2019clock when I was getting my makeup done,\u201d she said, adding that he also attended costume fittings and personally oversaw other small details.Mr. McVicar, who has worked with several designers on his other Met productions, designed \u201cRoberto Devereux\u201d himself, setting it in a handsome, candlelit Jacobean theater as a sort of play within a play, saying that Donizetti\u2019s opera, which the Met has never done, should not be weighed down with production touches.\u201cFrom the brass chords that open \u2018Tosca,\u2019 there is a sense of scale, of opulence for its own sake,\u201d Mr. McVicar said. \u201cI\u2019m not talking about sheer decorative overloading. I\u2019m talking about grandeur in the best possible sense. That expectation has to be met.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll confine myself to saying I think it will deliver the \u2018Tosca\u2019 I think New Yorkers want to see,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s not the reason I\u2019m doing it. I\u2019m not pandering to anyone. It\u2019s my response to that piece in this theater. It\u2019s what I think it needs to be.\u201dAn article last Sunday about the Scottish opera director David McVicar misspelled part of the name of the production he is directing at the Metropolitan Opera. It is \u201cRoberto Devereux,\u201d not \u201cRoberto Devereaux.\u201c The article also misspelled the surname of a soprano in the production. She is Sondra Radvanovsky, not Radvanovksy. And an accompanying picture caption misidentified one of the three singers shown rehearsing. The singer at the right is Mariusz Kwiecien \u2014 not Matthew Polenzani, who is also in the production.Advertisement"}

The remark, in substance, did not stray far from traditional American policy. But his blunt language rattled some Israelis, who worry that it might mean a less supportive United States.  Mrs. Clinton wasted no time in seizing on those fears. Her speech was a thunderous affirmation of American solidarity with Israel, with promises to buttress Israel\u00e2\u0080\u0099s military, combat anti-Semitism, police Iran on its nuclear program, crack down on Iranian proxies like Hezbollah, and thwart efforts to boycott Israeli products.\u00e2\u0080\u009cWe must repudiate all efforts to malign, isolate and impugn Israel and the Jewish people,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said.The speeches from Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Trump promised to sharpen the foreign-policy contrast between them as they pivot toward a potential general election clash. Mrs. Clinton played up her credentials as a commander-in-chief and accused the Republican candidates of lacking either experience or the will to extend American leadership in the Middle East.\u00e2\u0080\u009cWe have to get this right,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said of the election.Referring to the Republican lineup later in the day, Mrs. Clinton said it would give a glimpse of a foreign policy that would \u00e2\u0080\u009cinsult our allies\u00e2\u0080\u009d and \u00e2\u0080\u009cembolden our adversaries.\u00e2\u0080\u009dMrs. Clinton also declared she would allow no daylight between the United States and Israel on the peace process. In a potential rift with the White House, she said she would oppose a United Nations Security Council resolution that sought to impose the contours of a two-state solution. President Obama is contemplating such a move before he leaves office, though he may instead opt to lay down parameters for a deal in a speech.\u201cI would vigorously oppose an attempt by any outside party to impose a solution, including by the United Nations Security Council,\u201d she said. Mrs. Clinton reaffirmed her support for Mr. Obama\u00e2\u0080\u0099s nuclear deal with Iran, but she repeated her warning that she would use military force, if necessary, to punish Iran for violating the terms of the agreement.After the speech, the Republican National Committee released a statement critical of Mrs. Clinton\u2019s remarks and questioning her long-term commitment to Israel.\u201cHillary Clinton\u00e2\u0080\u0099s speech was an attempt to whitewash a record of undermining Israel\u00e2\u0080\u0099s interests when she was secretary of state,\u201d the statement said. \u201cAs the chief architect of the Obama administration\u00e2\u0080\u0099s foreign policy, her support for policies like the disastrous Iran nuclear deal and her boasting of being called the Obama administration\u00e2\u0080\u0099s \u00e2\u0080\u0098designated yeller\u00e2\u0080\u0099 for Israel calls into question her commitment to our closest ally in the world\u00e2\u0080\u0099s most tumultuous region.\u201d \u00e2\u0080\u009cOur history, our faith and our values teach us that we cannot sit idly by when others are singled out for derision and when intolerance is fed,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Greenblatt wrote, describing Mr. Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s comments about immigrants and Muslims.In that speech, which was less warmly received than Monday\u00e2\u0080\u0099s, Mrs. Clinton described the American role in the peace process as, if not neutral, than as an honest broker between the two sides. \u00e2\u0080\u009cOur credibility in this process,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cdepends in part on our willingness to praise both sides when they are courageous, and when we don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t agree, to say so, and say so unequivocally.\u00e2\u0080\u009dMrs. Clinton\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Democratic rival, Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, is the only presidential candidate not addressing the conference.

{"Headline": "Rafael Nadal Threatens Lawsuit Over Renewed Doping Allegations", "Date": "2016-03-15", "News": "Supported byDiscussing Sharapova\u2019s announcement on the French show \u201cLe Grand 8\u201d last week, the former French minister of health and sport Roselyne Bachelot accused Rafael Nadal.\u201cThey just don\u2019t reveal positive tests or the sanctions given in tennis,\u201d Bachelot said in French. \u201cBut curiously, you will learn that a tennis player had an injury that keeps him or her off the courts for months, like the famous injury of Rafael Nadal that kept him off the court for seven months \u2014 it\u2019s very certainly due to a positive test.\u201dIn that seven-month stretch Bachelot mentioned, in 2012 and 2013, Nadal missed the Olympics and the United States Open, citing knee problems, and then missed the Australian Open, citing a stomach virus.In the wake of Bachelot\u2019s remarks, an unlikely constellation of Spanish sports organizations, including the soccer team Real Madrid, quickly rallied behind Nadal, and on Sunday, Nadal thanked those who had supported him. He then lashed out at Bachelot with uncharacteristic vitriol, saying that although he had heard similar accusations a couple of times before, \u201cthis is going to be the last one because I\u2019m going to sue her.\u201dHe added: \u201cI am tired about these things. I let it go a few times in the past. No more.\u201dNadal also pledged to sue anyone else who made a similar comment in the future.Many of the previous accusations and insinuations directed at Nadal also came from France, where he has had his greatest dominance, winning the French Open nine times.The next year, Nadal was angered by a puppet show on French television, \u201cLes Guignols,\u201d which featured a skit in which a Nadal caricature used his urine to turbocharge a sport utility vehicle. Nadal threatened to sue the program for \u201cunacceptable and damaging insinuations,\u201d but no suit was ever filed.Just before last year\u2019s French Open, the cover of the French satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo featured a musclebound tennis player with a headband like Nadal\u2019s stuck with syringes.Nadal said Sunday that he did not pursue legal action against his accusers in the past because he did not think that they were serious.\u201cBut a minister of France should be serious,\u201d he added. \u201cThis time is the time to go against her. We\u2019re going to sue her.\u201dThe International Tennis Federation supported Nadal.\u201cThe accusations by Roselyne Bachelot against Nadal are not only surprising, they are also incorrect,\u201d the federation\u2019s statement said. \u201cThe names of all players sanctioned for a violation of tennis\u2019s anti-doping programme are announced publicly, as demanded by the rules of the programme and the worldwide anti-doping code.\u201dSharapova has drawn fractured responses, even if her case is far more clear-cut than the allegations aimed at Nadal. Many tennis players expressed a desire to withhold judgment. The French player Kristina Mladenovic, though, castigated Sharapova.\u201cI respected her for her career but not for the person that she is because she wasn\u2019t polite or nice; let\u2019s be honest. So with what\u2019s happening now, there won\u2019t remain a lot of people to like her.\u201dThe retired American player Ashley Harkleroad, who hit a career-high ranking of 39th in 2003, suggested in a Facebook post that Sharapova\u2019s use of meldonium explained why Harkleroad was winless against her.\u201cI\u2019m really disappointed because LIKE YOU, I dedicated part of my life to tennis, but I always did it HONESTLY!\u201d Harkleroad wrote. \u201cNo wonder I always lost, I never stood a chance.\u201dEugenie Bouchard, who lost to Sharapova in the semifinals at the 2014 French Open and in the quarterfinals at last year\u2019s Australian Open, expressed deep disappointment as well.\u201cTo think of your childhood idol and wonder if it was a lie, it really affected me a lot,\u201d Bouchard told reporters.John Isner, though, said he could not pass judgment on Sharapova for taking a substance that was not banned until this year.\u201cI\u2019m going to take her word for the fact that she was using it for the issues she was having with her health,\u201d Isner, the top-ranked American man, said, adding, \u201cI\u2019m not going to call her a liar or anything like that.\u201dAnd Ana Ivanovic, a longtime rival of Sharapova\u2019s who lost to her in the 2008 Australian Open final, said, \u201cI think it\u2019s just a little bit sad that some people will doubt such a good career.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Lawmakers have responded to the attack by adopting measures strengthening security along the border, as well as at schools, embassies, the offices of international organizations and diplomatic residences.Government officials said Monday that three militants had been killed in the attack, not six, as they reported Sunday. The authorities have also found what they say appears to be the cellphone of one of the gunmen.In the hours after the Grand-Bassam attack, expressions of outrage about the ruthlessness of the assault, whose victims included sunbathers and people gathered for a beachside Sunday brunch, poured in from France, the United States and other countries.The identities of the civilians who were killed have not been released by the authorities, but officials counted among the dead Ivorians and other Africans, as well as Europeans. The resorts drew a crowd of locals and expatriates.On Monday, French officials said four French citizens had been killed. Also, the Goethe Institute in Abidjan confirmed the death of Henrike Grohs, a German who was the director of the institute and a member of the large arts community in the city.Tributes to Ms. Grohs, who was described as a cultural ambassador to Ivory Coast, were posted on Facebook. One said she \u201cbreathed and disseminated the joie de vivre, to those who knew her, sharing the beautiful, the good, the true.\u201dIt was early in the afternoon on a sunny day when gunmen stormed the beaches of at least three hotels \u2014 L\u2019\u00c9toile du Sud, the Wharf and Koral Beach \u2014 where people were swimming and enjoying a poolside buffet.What had been a palm-lined, peaceful scene turned into a bloody tableau, with gunshot victims crawling across patios, sunbathers sprinting to safety and bodies strewed across the blood-soaked sand. A child was among the victims, witnesses said.Ms. Burton, a regional manager at Search for Common Ground, a group that works against violent extremism; her husband; and their two young daughters had gone to Grand-Bassam to get out of the city, a trip they made every couple of weeks, she said. The family, from Belgium, tried a new beach on Sunday, at the Nouvelle Paillote hotel, not far from the Wharf.Just as they were finishing lunch at the hotel restaurant, they heard what sounded like shooting. The couple gathered their children and hid in the kitchen, but the cooks assured them that there was no need to worry, and the noise soon stopped.The family went back to their table, ate dessert and asked for the check. Then the shooting started again, louder this time, and much closer. A worker hustled them into a small room off the kitchen where they hid with a few other terrified guests. Then staff members started yelling, \u201cThey\u2019re coming!\u201d\u201cWe could hear shooting, then boom, boom, boom,\u201d said Ms. Burton, who speculated that the louder noise had been from grenades.The family decided to sprint to a safer place. Ms. Burton took Elinor\u2019s hand, and her husband grabbed that of the couple\u2019s other daughter, Marion, 2. In the confusion, the parents lost each other.Marion, terrified and sobbing, and her father ended up hiding in a hotel room with a group of other people after pounding on the door and convincing them that they were not terrorists.Ms. Burton, dragging Elinor, ran into a hallway lined with three toilet cubicles. She opened the first door she came to. Two people, an older man who was a tourist and a local teenager, were already inside the small, sweltering room. She stuffed herself and Elinor inside.From the bathroom, Ms. Burton sent text messages to her husband as guns were fired outside. She could see through a tiny window that men were walking past the toilets. Sweat was dripping down everyone in the stifling room. Elinor was silent.At one point, the shooting quieted, and a man and a woman in the toilet cubicle next to hers walked outside. But Ms. Burton\u2019s group decided to stay where they were.In all, they waited two hours in the small bathroom until soldiers arrived and told everyone it was safe to come out.When she emerged, Ms. Burton said, she saw a dead soldier on the ground. She also spotted the worker who had shown them into their first hiding place off the kitchen. He was covered in the blood of another woman who had stayed behind to hide there. The terrorists had found her and killed her.Later, Ms. Burton came across the man in the adjacent toilet cubicle who had ventured out. He showed her his torn pant leg where a bullet had grazed it. The woman who left with him had been shot.On Monday, Ms. Burton reflected on the bloody afternoon in Grand-Bassam, the very kind of violence that she spends her workdays trying to stop. People without jobs and without hope are angry, she said, and they are easy recruits for terrorist organizations.\u201cPeople don\u2019t have an option to make their life a success, so they turn to violence because they don\u2019t know what else to do,\u201d she said.Ms. Burton\u2019s organization has concentrated on peace-building work largely outside Ivory Coast, but now it will turn its attention there as well. \u201cIt makes our work more relevant,\u201d she said.Saskia de Rothschild contributed reporting from Paris.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Charity-Minded Lemonade Stand Meets Silicon Valley Churn", "Date": "2016-03-08", "News": "Supported byDeal ProfessorIf you think starting a social network business is hard, try selling lemonade.This was one of the many things I learned while catching up with Eric Harr and his attempts to turn his daughter Vivienne\u2019s social media stardom into a social purpose, for-profit business.Make a Stand\u2019s for-profit orientation raised interesting issues about the intersection of a for-profit company and charity. Was it O.K. for a company to have a charitable purpose and also to profit? Here, Make a Stand was building on new thinking put forth in a popular TED talk by Dan Pallotta, founder of the AIDS Ride \u2014that the nonprofit world was starving itself, and instead should encourage innovation and development, and, yes, even profit.Whatever your opinion of their idea, Mr. Harr and Vivienne exuded optimism and energy in those early days. They were going to change the world, an \u201cincredible journey\u201d as Mr. Harr put it.A year would pass before I caught up with the Harrs, and their enthusiasm remained. Vivienne was still the showpiece, still wearing princess dresses and, as Mr. Harr said, still his boss. She had met the Dalai Lama and traveled the country for her cause, writing a children\u2019s book for good measure.Fast-forward a year later to today. I wanted to catch up with Eric Harr. Before I did, I looked online. The website for the lemonade business was dark and the Facebook page had stopped being updated in December.The app business seemed to have taken a hiatus. It had begun in fall 2014 but then quickly went silent. However, it was started this year for another round of beta testing. The company had now been renamed simply Stand (stand.tc).I downloaded the app. There seemed to be a measure of activity, with people creating new stands, as they were called, crowdfunding for animals and other social causes. There was no huge explosion of posts, though, and only a steady flow of a few stands every day.Vivienne was still involved, was part of the Clinton Global Initiative and speaking at events on behalf of the business. Vivienne\u2019s 6-year-old brother had even helped out, starting a $6,500 stand for \u201cHeforshe,\u201d the United Nations\u2019 push to support women.There were some other signs that all was not well. I looked up Mr. Harr\u2019s Twitter feed, and between his nonstop promotion of new stands were phrases that entrepreneurs rely upon, like this one from the other week: \u201cFounders: as you go through the @bhorowitz \u2018struggle\u2019 \u2014 and you will \u2014 the key is to find your sense of grace and composure and lean into it.\u201d A Not Eric Harr account had popped up on Twitter, attacking him and Stand at every opportunity.So I contacted Mr. Harr and got the update. Stand continued to prosper, he said, raising close to $3 million in funding and growing to a team of 12 employees. Mr. Stone had even agreed to be chairman of the board.Mr. Harr was still filled with enthusiasm, but there was some weariness in his voice and a frankness I had not seen before. There had been some \u201creally dark times\u201d and \u201cdeep challenges\u201d as the product had not become an instant hit. Attracting users remained challenging because fund-raising apps are \u201ca dime a dozen.\u201d Mr. Harr put his best face on it: They had validated their concept, had hosted over a thousand \u201cstands\u201d and had raised thousands of dollars for charity.The lemonade business appeared to be doing much worse. When I asked about the nonfunctioning website, Mr. Harr told me the business was on hiatus, seeking funds. He hadn\u2019t been involved in over two years. He had handed off the business to \u201cfolks we trusted\u201d with \u201cexperience\u201d but \u201chired guns may not have been the best thing\u201d over a founder. It seemed that distribution was a problem and that although the lemonade now had four flavors, the social cause of donating 5 percent of revenue to end slavery had not propelled it to success.Mr. Harr simply seemed to have found more comfort in the app world. As he put it, the \u201cthick neck beverage folks feel like bullies\u201d while the web developers like Mr. Stone were the \u201cbullied.\u201d He preferred the \u201ckind and gentle.\u201d Vivienne was still involved but primarily for big rollouts. She is a sixth-grader now, he said.Mr. Harr acknowledged that the app was still trying to find a foothold. Stand was going to try again with a reboot, this time with a focus on what he termed \u201cGeneration Z.\u201d Stand\u2019s research and initial apps had discerned that this younger generation had empathy but also wanted fun and rewards. In addition, the Stand app was \u201ctoo Instagram and not enough Tinder.\u201d The new version of the Stand app, coming in a few weeks, would be for millennials to achieve rewards for altruism and sharing.Mr. Harr gave the example of sourcing your social friends to clean a beach. Stand had teamed with Toms Shoes and others, so once you completed your cause, you would then take a photo and get free Toms shoes and other prizes for your social entrepreneurship. The idea was to have young people compete and everyone would win. The new version of the Stand app would be about making compassion more fun.Mr. Harr\u2019s story is ultimately about venture capital and entrepreneurship. The Facebooks and Ubers are what you talk about, but day in and day out are thousands of other businesses, struggling through \u201cdark times\u201d for a model that can scale up often in a competitive environment where everyone is trying to mimic their ideas. They try and then if they don\u2019t get things right, they try again or run out of cash. And sometimes it works. Twitter, after all, took three years to get off the ground. Other businesses have crashed and burned as they ran out of time. And this is in the Internet world with its low costs and easy scalability. In the real world of selling lemonade, it is even harder to depend on mercurial things like finding a distribution outlet for your product.In the case of Stand, all of this is complicated by the idea of trying to do good while also making a profit. But even the space for giving is crowded with names like Chuffed and Plumfund.The search for success continues for Stand. I wish the Harrs, who seem so sincere in wanting to do good, the best of luck and whatever magical fairy dust is needed to succeed in the roller coaster world of entrepreneurship.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Donald Trump\u2019s Son Calls Interview With White Nationalist Inadvertent", "Date": "2016-03-03", "News": "Donald J. Trump Jr. said on Wednesday that he inadvertently gave an interview to a white nationalist radio host who has been promoting it on his website as a major exclusive that will air this weekend. The comments from Mr. Trump came after a day of uncertainty, as aides to his father\u2019s presidential campaign said they were unaware of such an interview, particularly since Mr. Edwards said he had been at a rally for Donald J. Trump in Memphis recently, giving the impression the interview had taken place there. Mr. Edwards, host of the Political Cesspool show, said on his website that he received press credentials for a Trump rally in Memphis and had a 20-minute interview with the younger Mr. Trump, which he will air on Saturday. The show has been cited by groups such as the Anti-Defamation League and the Southern Poverty Law Center for fomenting hate and promoting white ascension, as well as anti-Semitic views. On his website, Mr. Edwards showed himself in the press area at the Trump rally and also speaking with some reporters. In the Bloomberg interview, Mr. Trump said that he had been on a phone line with a different radio interviewer and that Mr. Edwards suddenly joined the conversation. \u201cHe was brought into the interview without my knowledge,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cHad I known, I would have obviously never done an interview with him.\u201d He added, \u201cThe way the media is spinning it is as though I voluntarily spoke with this guy and I knew his background, rather than I was essentially duped by him being in the room and asking an inane question where I clearly could not have ever known what or whom I was talking to. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s very unfair, and typical of the way much of the media has handled us.\u201dThe episode is the latest flap involving white nationalists for the elder Mr. Trump, who has retweeted accounts connected to white supremacists and who has been under fire for initially declining over the weekend to disavow the support of David Duke, a former Ku Klux Klan leader.Earlier Wednesday, before the younger Mr. Trump\u2019s comments, a spokeswoman for the campaign said that it did not personally vet each person applying for rally credentials and that nearly 200 people attended the Memphis rally. The spokeswoman, Hope Hicks, added: \u201cThe campaign had no knowledge of his personal views and strongly condemns them. Donald Trump Jr. was not in attendance, and although he served as a surrogate for his father on several radio programs over the past week, to his knowledge and that of the campaign, did not participate in an interview with this individual.\u201d But Mr. Edwards insisted on his website that the interview took place and that he is being mistreated by the media. \u201cMy show, The Political Cesspool, promotes a proud, paleoconservative Christian worldview, and we reject media descriptions of our work as \u2018white supremacist,\u2019 \u2018pro-slavery\u2019 and other such scare words,\u201d he wrote. \u201cAs I clearly wrote in yesterday\u2019s article, in no way should anyone interpret our press credentialing and subsequent interview with Donald Trump, Jr. as any kind of endorsement by the Trump campaign.\u201d By JONATHAN MAHLERIntentionally or not, Mr. Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s campaign is mobilizing white supremacists, so much so that he has their support despite awkward attempts to publicly disavow it.\n\t\tFirst Draft provides fast-paced and comprehensive coverage of politics and elections by The New York Times.

{"Headline": "A Father, a Son, a Disease, and a Camera", "Date": "2018-01-18", "News": "Ms. Borowick, 30, hopes the book will help people not only connect with her family\u00e2\u0080\u0099s story but perhaps learn from it: what truly matters and why do we wait until someone is on their death bed to truly understand what it means to live?How do you sum up a life in 20 words or less? This was the challenge as my siblings and I struggled to decide what would be carved on our mother\u00e2\u0080\u0099s footstone. You get a list of adjectives from which to choose: beloved, devoted, loving, and caring\u00e2\u0080\u0094but she was so much more in her 59 years than these simple, predetermined descriptions. She was generous, thoughtful, creative, selfless, curious and so much more.On birthdays, she would decorate our bedrooms while we slept so we\u00e2\u0080\u0099d wake up surrounded by feelings of love and joy. And each time I came home to visit, there was always a cooked artichoke waiting for me on the stove\u00e2\u0080\u0094my favorite, and she knew it. You can see why this task took us more than a year to complete. The hardest of all, of course, was the bookend the footstone represented, and maybe we weren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t ready to accept this.Death may be a universal experience, but every family experiences it so differently. After the third diagnosis of my mother\u00e2\u0080\u0099s breast cancer, my father learned he had pancreatic cancer. Our family lost its bearings. How could we have both of our parents in simultaneous treatment, together, for stage-four cancer? This reality took some getting used to, but time was not on our side and I think my parents were aware of this.As a photographer, I needed to find a way to process what we were going through as a family and naturally my camera became that therapeutic tool. It gave me a safe distance from the reality of what was unfolding in front of me\u00e2\u0080\u0094I was losing my parents and there was nothing I could do about it. In a world that was spiraling downward rapidly, my camera became my lifeline and documenting our story brought a different kind of healing to our pain.Here is when they taught us a lesson in courage. Rather than wallowing in their own sadness and grief, they chose to spend their final months living life. Yes, there was chemo, but there were also family dinners, late night movies, spontaneous vacations, and fireside chats. And I photographed this. I captured every moment because I needed to hold on to each memory, each frame. I wanted to hold onto the essence of who my parents were and who my family was, before the moments passed and they were gone.There is no cookie-cutter way of dealing with death. Fortunately, my family never quite fit the mold. A spoon full of Fluff to help the chemo pills go down? Mom certainly thought so. Swapping out a traditional Jewish shroud for his favorite Lawrence Taylor Giants Jersey for his burial clothing? Dad pretty much demanded it. And along that same rhythm, there I was, camera in hand, photographing both of their funerals.When the time came to bury Dad, and Mom 364 days later, almost everything had already been taken care of because my parents wanted to talk about their deaths, a conversation many actively try to avoid. We knew which plots they wanted; we knew their medical requests for their final days. Heck, we even knew what my father wanted said at his funeral because he wrote his own eulogy. Mom spent her final weeks banking blood at the local hospital to be used for future research after she was gone and also made a request for a sustainable wood casket so in death she would be doing what was best for the Earth.While these last three years have been the most difficult of my life, they have also been beautiful and filled with love, life, and lessons I will always hold on to. The Borowick way to share the many lessons would be in the form of a list, written on a colorful Post-It note. While I can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t give you the paper note, I can give you the list.Always be kind, no matter what the circumstance.Life is a gift, and we were never promised longevity.The people you love live on inside of you.They are already imprinted in the person that you are.Talking about death allows you to focus on and appreciate life.Courage isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t the absence of fear, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s knowing that you are afraid and doing it anyway.Eat dessert first.And I have my photographs, my record, which hold tight the moments of joy and pain, and together tell the story of what it truly means to live. So, even though I only had 28 years with my Dad and 29 with my Mom, I feel like I won the lottery."}

Trump returned to Illinois on Sunday morning less than 48 hours after protesters and security concerns prompted him to call off a rally in Chicago.The audience at the airplane hangar where Mr. Trump spoke in Bloomington was far different, and friendlier, than the contentious scene on Friday. Mr. Trump told supporters that he felt bad for those who had waited hours to hear him speak in Chicago, but said the decision to call off that rally had been prudent because of a \u00e2\u0080\u009cmassive crowd\u00e2\u0080\u009d that included many protesters.\u00e2\u0080\u009cThey all showed up at the same time,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Trump told his audience in Bloomington, a city more than 100 miles southwest of Chicago that is predominantly white. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt was totally organized. Troublemakers, troublemakers.\u00e2\u0080\u009dA handful of protesters, including one who tore apart a campaign sign, also sought to disrupt Sunday\u00e2\u0080\u0099s rally, but with varied success.

Mr. Meskauskas said he planned to vote for Mr. Trump because \u00e2\u0080\u009ca lot of the stuff he says is the same stuff I say,\u00e2\u0080\u009d particularly on immigration.Before the rally, Cydney Williams, 54, of Bloomington, said immigration was also her \u00e2\u0080\u009cmain issue,\u00e2\u0080\u009d and that she was attracted to Mr. Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s stance.

At one point, Mr. Trump brought a man to the stage who said he immigrated to America legally as a child and supported Mr. Trump.

Mr. Trump\u2019s allies believe the Utah is likely to favor Senator Ted Cruz, who has a stronger organization and has performed better in such caucus states. The state has a substantial Mormon population, and the group hopes that Mr. Romney\u2019s appeal to Mormons will be decisive in achieving a Trump loss there. The ad uses clips of Mr. Romney\u2019s recent speech in Salt Lake City denouncing Mr. Trump. It is aimed less at influencing large groups of voters, and more at reaching out to people who respect Mr. Romney, including G.O.P. leaders in Washington. \u201cAs we have said all along, Our Principles PAC will continue to educate the voters about who Donald Trump really is,\u201d said Brian Baker,  the senior strategist for the PAC. Despite Mr. Trump\u2019s overwhelming delegate lead, strategists with the Our Principles PAC have argued that he will likely have a tough time accruing the 1,237 delegates needed to clinch the nomination. \n\t\tFirst Draft provides fast-paced and comprehensive coverage of politics and elections by The New York Times.

{"Headline": "John Jodzio\u2019s \u2018Knockout\u2019", "Date": "2016-03-25", "News": "Supported byWhen you purchase an independently reviewed book through our site, we earn an affiliate commission.The title story of \u201cKnockout\u201d features a neck pinchhold to knock humans and other animals unconscious: \u201cThe giraffe was very elegant in the way it fell, slowly dropping to its knees and then gently tipping over on its side with a slight puff of breath.\u201d The protagonist loves that his buddy knocks him out and writes a few words or draws an octopus on his butt, and he reciprocates with his own words and sketches. He finds this exchange poignant, a chance \u201cto finally be able to communicate some of my struggles with another human being.\u201dJohn Jodzio\u2019s entire collection is tremendously funny and well written, every story inventive and a pleasure to read. At each finish, though, there\u2019s a noticeable emptiness. The endings are truncated and unsatisfying, and this is partly because the characters aren\u2019t quite real. They\u2019ve been sacrificed for oddity. In the same way George Saunders\u2019s much praised \u201cTenth of December\u201d is limited by being only about morons, Jodzio\u2019s work is limited by being only about freaks involved in freakish events.\u201cChet\u201d begins with someone dying from an elk bite. Then a demented priest tries to dig him up, and our protagonist, who works in a family-run power plant (odd enough in itself), Tasers him and also Tasers others, including a little kid who attracts crows and can foretell death. \u201cInside Work\u201d features a nut job who hides bottles of cologne, cocktail napkins and a chicken taco under her breasts and then forgets about them. There are several panty stealers and stalkers, a gratuitous burning man in the road, a bounty hunter who tracks down roommates who try to leave him, a woman who never lets her kid out of the house, attacks from eagles, an anthropologist carried off for sacrifice and a boy who ties a bag of poop to helium balloons, then sends his dead dog aloft, then his sister\u2019s actor-boyfriend. All fun, but we don\u2019t care that the boyfriend is going to die, because we haven\u2019t cared about or believed anyone here. One of the stories is intentionally speculative (wounded Canadian soldiers enduring an American attack due to global warming), but in \u00adother stories, Jodzio is aiming for Chekhovian endings that fail because they lack earlier dramatic development and believable weight and are about people who are only ideas.The final story, \u201cOur Mom-and-Pop Opium Den,\u201d does offer more fully developed relationships, a dramatic arc, an important decision and consequences. The setting is richly imagined, and the switch from hardware stores to opium stores, competing against Opium Depot, is a brilliant bit of the unreal. The only weakness is that the protagonist is desperately missing his ex-fianc\u00e9e in the same way that most of the protagonists in this collection are desperately missing an ex.\u201cKnockout\u201d is an enormous improvement, though, over Jodzio\u2019s two earlier collections. \u201cGet In if You Want to Live\u201d is a small volume of short-shorts with accompanying illustrations. Interesting to look at but short on substance. The stories are funny and odd but deeply about nothing and embarrassingly male. You can think of them as upscale Beavis and Butt-Head. The stories of Jodzio\u2019s first collection, \u201cIf You Lived Here You\u2019d Already Be Home,\u201d are more sustained, there\u2019s a desperation and loneliness to the characters, and lives are put under pressure, but each one still falls short.I don\u2019t want to undervalue how pleasurable it is to read Jodzio. His tales are a hoot. And their shortcomings are not entirely his fault. Lack of substance in fiction is celebrated now more than ever before. Because of blogs and Facebook, etc., readers are increasingly happy with reading about nothing. But I want something I can read twice or six times, and my second time through \u201cKnockout\u201d there was nothing left to find.David Vann\u2019s latest novel is \u201cAquarium.\u201d Advertisement"}

She didn\u2019t get her looks from her father or me, and we would find her beautiful no matter what. But people we meet love to point out how \u201cgorgeous\u201d and \u201cstunning\u201d she is. I worry that she may begin to internalize the message that her looks are her most important attribute. But saying, \u201cShe\u2019s really smart, too,\u201d seems like a bragging response to a compliment. And I don\u2019t want to chastise people who mean well. Any thoughts?ANONYMOUSWell, I Facebook-stalked your family (from the info on your note), and the bad news is that your daughter is pretty adorable. I also have enough experience on the playground to know that little boys are disproportionately asked what they like to do, while girls are more often reduced to their clothes or hair or general prettiness. So I share your concern.For starters, acknowledge the compliments in the friendly spirit in which they were given. A smile and thanks will do fine. Better to make this a teachable moment for your daughter than for clueless adults who think it\u2019s O.K. to walk around commenting on people\u2019s looks. What\u2019s more, I know many adult women who still feel traumatized by their mother\u2019s scrutiny of their appearance as girls. Who knows how a 6-year-old would hear her mother\u2019s quibbling with a stranger over her prettiness?Then take one more step. \u201cYou know, we\u2019re lucky, because Janie is also very kind\u201d (or \u201c\u2026 good at math,\u201d or whatever quality you want to emphasize). I don\u2019t think that sounds like a braggadocio. Most people will understand that you are only compensating for their statement about her gorgeousness. But even if they don\u2019t, it\u2019s more important to give your daughter a compass that\u2019s based on character and deeds than a looking glass that requires a constant stream of external adoration.

It seems like a violation of their privacy.\u201d If she disagrees, just repeat gently, \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I can\u2019t.\u201d If calling her strikes you as too uncomfortable, try a note. But an email (even one that you think is warmly written) may strike her as chilly.Another possibility: Offer to post about her project on social media, inviting friends who are interested to contact her. Her feelings may still be hurt, depending on her emotional makeup. But you will have done what you can by refusing a friend kindly.I am a 38-year-old woman. For the last 12 years, I have lived with my older sister and younger brother in a house my sister and I bought. I now have a boyfriend, and things are getting serious between us. But even before meeting him, my siblings insisted he could never spend the night. So far, I have respected their wishes. But my boyfriend lives an hour away, so we are spending far too many hours in the car. We would also like to have an adult relationship.

{"Headline": "Instagram May Change Your Feed, Personalizing It With an Algorithm", "Date": "2016-03-15", "News": "Supported byFor years, we have been trained to view web postings from our friends in a certain order. Refresh the top of your various \u201cfeeds\u201d \u2014 the running column of content on some versions of Facebook, Twitter and Instagram \u2014 and you will see the latest news at the top. The further back you scroll, the older the material gets.\u201cOn average, people miss about 70 percent of the posts in their Instagram feed,\u201d Kevin Systrom, co-founder and chief executive of Instagram, said in an interview. \u201cWhat this is about is making sure that the 30 percent you see is the best 30 percent possible.\u201dMore broadly, the change reflects the adjustments that occur time and again on the consumer Internet. In the early days of the web, users largely congregated around portals like AOL and Yahoo, before Google gained ground, beckoning people to type in queries to find exactly what they were seeking. Then, social networking ushered in the era of the feed: a simple, linear way to gather and display the content contributed by your friends and family worldwide.While feed-based networks have grown dominant over the last decade, they must be reinvented to keep audiences coming back and staying longer. That is especially true as older networks face newer competitors like Snapchat \u2014 which is almost entirely focused on the camera as the user interface \u2014 or text messaging apps like WeChat in China.\u201cThese companies want to always, always give you the next best thing to look at,\u201d said Brian Blau, a vice president at Gartner, an industry research firm. \u201cIf an algorithm can give you much more engaging content more frequently, you\u2019ll stick around longer.\u201dYet changing Instagram\u2019s feed will most likely be tricky and may arouse the ire of fans, who are accustomed to the way their photos and messages are ordered. Many web companies have faced complaints when they altered the way their feeds were presented.When Facebook moved away from a reverse chronological feed in October 2009, for instance, users revolted almost instantaneously. Facebook-hosted groups like \u201cChange Facebook back to normal!!\u201d sprang up and quickly attracted hundreds of thousands of followers. Twitter, too, faced intense criticism last month when it said it was experimenting with moving away from its reverse chronological feed.\u201cI like how I can open the app and see what my stepsister Ashley is doing today with my niece and nephew, right in that very moment,\u201d she said. \u201cI want to judge what\u2019s important, not have some algorithm tell me what it thinks is important.\u201dInstagram said that the change would not be quick or jarring, and that it would start the shift in a series of small tests with a single-digit percentage of user groups before deciding whether to introduce the changes broadly.Instagram plans to rely on its machine -learning technology and a mix of signals to determine the order of photos and videos in users\u2019 feeds, including the likelihood a person will be interested in the content, the timeliness of the posts and the relationship between the two users. As they are now, posts will be clearly stamped with the date they occurred.Mike Krieger, Instagram\u2019s co-founder and chief technology officer, said the changes to the feed may be less disruptive than those of other networks, considering Instagram is centered almost entirely on photos, not words.\u201cLook at my feed now. I follow accounts from all over the world,\u201d Mr. Krieger said, noting that 75 percent of Instagram\u2019s audience is outside the United States, and many of the users he follows post content he would otherwise miss while he\u2019s sleeping. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t really matter to me what time it is.\u201dThe shift will not affect Instagram\u2019s advertising products, which already use and rely on similar targeting principles to serve ads to users. If the changes go well, they could serve to bolster Instagram\u2019s business. The more time people spend using Instagram, the more often the company is able to serve people ads.The idea to adjust how photos and videos are presented in Instagram feeds has been discussed at the service\u2019s Menlo Park, Calif., offices for months. Mr. Systrom said he often found himself waking up in the morning and scrolling back through his feed to see all of the posts he missed while he was asleep, but guessed that he probably missed a great deal of the \u201cbest\u201d material from the 613 people he follows.Mr. Systrom said he was also mindful of how people might react to the change.\u201cIf it\u2019s one thing we do really well as a company, it\u2019s that we take big change slowly and deliberately and bring the community along with us,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not like people will wake up tomorrow and have a different Instagram.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Convoy Sees Itself as the Uber of Local Trucking", "Date": "2016-03-23", "News": "Supported byBut the expression has not become so overused as to have frightened away a prominent group of investors from the next big industry they are eager to Uberize: trucking.Convoy, a start-up in Seattle founded by former Amazon employees that has created an on-demand service for local truckers, plans to announce on Wednesday that it has raised $16 million in a new investment round led by Greylock Partners. New investors also include Jeff Wilke, a top Amazon executive, and Kevin Systrom, the co-founder and chief executive of Instagram.Reid Hoffman and Simon Rothman from Greylock and Hadi Partovi, a serial entrepreneur who now runs the nonprofit Code.org and who previously invested in Convoy, have joined the company\u2019s board of directors. Last year, Convoy raised $2.5 million from a group of investors including Jeff Bezos, the chief executive of Amazon, and Marc Benioff, the chief executive of Salesforce.Convoy began its service last year with the goal of giving local truckers \u2014 who specialized in jobs that could be completed in a day \u2014 a more efficient way to connect with clients who needed goods shipped.Local trucking is a heavily fragmented industry, populated by small operators, many of them with 10 or fewer trucks. Matching truckers with clients is typically handled by brokers, who do much of their work by phone, said Dan Lewis, the chief executive of Convoy, who has worked at Amazon.Convoy gives truckers a smartphone app that they can use to accept a job from shippers. An Uber-like interface allows their clients to see the truck on a map as it heads to its destination. Mr. Lewis said Convoy charged truckers a fee that was less than the roughly 25 percent of the value of a job that a broker typically received.\u201cWe\u2019re going to help you keep your truck full,\u201d Mr. Lewis said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to get you more work. People are always looking for their next load.\u201dMr. Lewis said the company was operating in Oregon and Washington, and had thousands of truckers active in its network. He said companies that had used its service to ship goods included Scotts Miracle-Gro and a division of Nucor Steel. He said Convoy\u2019s revenue had been doubling every month since the company began.Investors were drawn to the company by the prospect that Convoy could collect a toll on a large industry. Local trucking, including transport of hazardous material, gravel and other specialized loads, is an $80 billion-a-year industry, by some estimates.\u201cConvoy has one of those unique chances to disrupt a big, old industry that hasn\u2019t really changed much since it started,\u201d said Mr. Rothman of Greylock, a venture capital firm that has invested in LinkedIn, Airbnb and other companies.The challenge with any on-demand business, though, is getting buyers and sellers of services to use the system early on, when there is not much volume in the marketplace. And in the case of Convoy, it was not the first company to come up with an Uber-like idea for trucking.A start-up called Cargomatic, founded several years ago, operates an on-demand trucking service in the San Francisco, Los Angeles and New York areas. Jonathan Kessler, the chief executive and co-founder of Cargomatic, which is based in Venice Beach, Calif., said the company had been used by thousands of drivers and shippers. Cargomatic has raised $17 million from investors.Mr. Partovi, who was an early investor in Facebook, said Convoy had the potential to be a large business because of the size of its market.\u201cLocal trucking alone is a big enough market to build a Facebook-sized business,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Climate Policy\u2019s Advocates Take Page From Same-Sex Marriage Playbook", "Date": "2016-03-29", "News": "Supported by\u201cThe reason there is all this focus is that this is arguably the most important environmental regulation ever,\u201d said Richard L. Revesz, the director of the Institute for Policy Integrity at the New York University School of Law. This week, the institute and several other groups will file briefs in support of the E.P.A.\u2019s position in the case.At stake is a sweeping federal rule intended to cut the emissions of planet-warming greenhouse gases from coal-fired power plants. While environmentalists see the rule as the largest step ever taken by the United States to tackle climate change, the coal industry sees it as a huge threat.The issue can be overwhelming. The science is complicated. We get it. This is your cheat sheet.Meanwhile, the vacancy on the Supreme Court after the death of Justice Antonin Scalia last month has also heightened the national impact of decisions by lower courts. If the decision by the Federal Circuit Court is appealed to the Supreme Court \u2014 as is widely expected \u2014 and the eight justices are evenly split, the decision of the lower court will stand.\u201cIf the Supreme Court is divided 4 to 4, it would make sense that you want to pour resources into the outcome of the lower court, if that\u2019s the one that\u2019s going to matter at the end of the day,\u201d said Allison Orr Larsen, a law professor at the William and Mary Law School.The campaign by the advocates kicked off Tuesday morning, timed to highlight the E.P.A.\u2019s Monday afternoon filing of its legal briefs in the case and an expected Tuesday court filing by about 20 states and other outside groups, such as the Sierra Club and Natural Resources Defense Council, which support the rule.The groups backing the administration began posting quotable excerpts from the legal briefs on Twitter and Facebook on Tuesday. Several more such events are planned for this week, and the public relations push will escalate for the next eight weeks, culminating in a rally outside the federal courthouse on the day of the hearing.The White House is aware of the campaign, but is not coordinating with the groups or planning any messaging of its own, said Thomas Reynolds, who until last week directed climate change communications efforts for the White House, but this week moved back to a similar position at the E.P.A.While developing the campaign, the environmental advocates closely examined the messaging tactics of the same-sex marriage efforts \u2014 particularly the message that the issue affects individual lives beyond the gay community.\u201cOn gay marriage, it was that everyone has a friend, a neighbor, a sibling who could be impacted,\u201d said Joshua Dorner, a strategist at the Washington political communications firm SKDKnickerbocker, who worked on the same-sex marriage public relations campaigns ahead of the Supreme Court argument. The same message could be applied to a campaign on climate change, \u201cshowing how it directly impacts people\u2019s lives,\u201d he said.To that end, the environmentalists will deploy several mayors, like Dawn Zimmer of Hoboken, N.J., who will speak at news conferences over the coming months in support of the climate rule.But the plaintiffs in the case, including over two dozen states and the nation\u2019s largest coal companies, are not planning a similar public campaign. Those groups began planning their legal attack on the administration\u2019s climate change rules long before they were made final, and are expected to focus their attention on the legal arguments.\u201cThere\u2019s people on both sides of the aisle who specialize in this kind of thing, but the idea that you\u2019re going to affect these judges on the D.C. Circuit and their clerks is ridiculous,\u201d said Michael McKenna, a Republican energy lobbyist who is closely involved in the legal and public relations strategy for the coal companies. \u201cIt may work at the Supreme Court level. But every judge and clerk I\u2019ve ever met at this level would be insulted at the suggestion that they could be influenced by something like this. It\u2019s a colossal waste of money.\u201dUltimately, it may be impossible to know the impact of campaigning in the courts. \u201cThe theory is that you want to influence them just like you influence any other citizen,\u201d Ms. Larsen said of the judges. \u201cBut the only person who knows the influence of something like that is the judge herself.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "An American Olympian Prepares, on the Enemy\u2019s Turf", "Date": "2016-03-15", "News": "Supported byRIO DE JANEIRO \u2014 Courtney Thompson, a veteran setter on the United States women\u2019s national volleyball team, stepped from the side door of the stifling hot gym and into a cool ocean breeze. The beach was close enough that waves could be heard crashing onto the sand. Sugarloaf, the bullet-shape mountain with a cable car to the top, familiar from Rio postcards, loomed overhead.It was winter back home, but midsummer in Brazil. Thompson\u2019s American teammates were scattered around the globe, in at least six countries on three other continents, playing in the type of professional indoor volleyball leagues that do not exist in the United States.But Thompson was here playing in Superliga, which might be the best women\u2019s league of them all, where almost the entire Brazilian national squad was clustered onto a few powerhouse teams. The United States and Brazil are fierce rivals and favorites to win the gold medal at the Summer Olympics in Rio. And Thompson had infiltrated enemy territory, like a spy doing reconnaissance for the Americans, on a team from Rio de Janeiro.\u201cThat\u2019s what they tease me about,\u201d she said. \u201cThey\u2019re learning about me, too. I may take a few tips back, but that was not my intent.\u201dTeammates called out to her. In a few months, Thompson will be on the other side of the net, perhaps with a gold medal at stake. Until then, she was here to learn.Brazil\u2019s two Superligas \u2014 one for men and one for women \u2014 are among the top professional volleyball leagues in the world. In Brazil, indoor volleyball and beach volleyball trail only soccer in popularity. Superliga games are routinely on television, and top players of both sexes are nationally known and recognized.But only about half of Brazil\u2019s national men\u2019s team stays home to play in Superliga, unable to resist the bigger paydays and growing talent pools offered in places like Russia, Poland and Italy. And there is no Superliga men\u2019s team in Rio de Janeiro.But the women\u2019s Superliga, while facing similar competition for talent around the world, has managed to keep most of the top Brazilian women at home. Only a couple of team members ventured overseas this season. The rest played together, or often against one another, on Superliga teams like Osasco and Sesi, in S\u00e3o Paulo. The best team all season, and for most of the league\u2019s history, has been the one in Rio de Janeiro, now named Rexona-Ades after its current sponsor, a deodorant. While Brazil\u2019s final roster will not be named until summer, as many as four of the 12 players are expected to come from Rio\u2019s team. With Thompson, it is basically a global all-star team.\u201cWalking around the streets, it\u2019s very different than the U.S.,\u201d Thompson said. \u201cPeople will say: \u2018Hey, Courtney! You\u2019re the American! How\u2019s it going?\u2019 I sat down at a restaurant the other night and the guy across from me, a Brazilian guy, said: \u2018Courtney, good to see you. How\u2019s the season?\u2019 You don\u2019t get that ever in the U.S. And the level of play? I\u2019m playing with half their national team.\u201dThompson came to Rio not just to play in Superliga, but to learn from Bernardo Rezende, known as Bernardinho. A two-time Olympian as a setter in the 1980s, Bernardinho coached the Brazil national women\u2019s team for a decade and has coached the men\u2019s national team since 2001.As Brazil\u2019s economy and the value of its currency, the real, collapses, it is increasingly difficult to keep Superliga filled with the best Brazilians and to attract outsiders. Top players might make 400,000 reais (about $108,000) per season in Brazil, Bernardinho said, but could command 600,000 euros (roughly $665,000) in well-financed leagues in places like Turkey.The two members of Brazil\u2019s national team who played the season overseas (one in Russia, one in Turkey) were looking for money, Bernardinho said.\u201cIt\u2019s not about whether they are going to grow, technically speaking, or if it\u2019s a stronger league,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s about the comparison of currency. When foreign players come here, they know they won\u2019t be getting the best contract. They could be abroad and make more money. But they like to grow and increase their level of playing.\u201dThat is what attracted Thompson. She wanted to do anything she could to make the United States Olympic team again, and she thought Brazil and Bernardinho offered the best chance. Her American teammates were spread across the globe. Four played for the same team in Italy.Thompson liked the style of play in Brazil, which she had seen from the other side of the net. It is a bit like soccer, the \u201cbeautiful\u201d game, full of speed, skill and finesse but moving toward size and power.\u201cThey play fast,\u201d Thompson said of the Brazilians. \u201cThey know the game well. It\u2019s almost like a dance. It\u2019s very fluid. Their ball control is very good; their defense is good; they see the game well. They\u2019re not always the most physical \u2014 of course, their national team is \u2014 but as a whole, they\u2019re just smart. And you can tell that when you\u2019re playing with them.\u201dShe said that the Brazilians have at least one built-in advantage over the Americans \u2014 volleyball is part of the national consciousness.\u201cThey grow up around the game, it\u2019s so popular,\u201d Thompson said. \u201cWe play twice a week, and the men play twice a week, so four nights a week you see really high-level volleyball on television. That\u2019s the way to learn. You watch it; you go out and try to do it. It\u2019s like watching video \u2014 you just don\u2019t know it.\u201dStill, Superliga can feel far from big-time sports like soccer in Brazil and football, basketball and baseball in the United States. Practice is at an un-air-conditioned gym on a military base (with extraordinary views). Most team members ride bikes or walk to the games at the Tijuca Tennis Club, set deeply into one of central Rio\u2019s compact, leafy neighborhoods. The gymnasium there, with its high, arched ceiling and capacity of about 3,000, has the feel of an old college field house, with four rows of seats on three sides (20 reais, or about $5), plus 10 rows of concrete bleachers above them (15 reais).The matches are spirited, family-friendly affairs, with banners, T-shirt guns and a mascot. Banners and photos of each player hang on the wall over one end of the gym. But while game results make their way into newspapers and onto television, few members of the news media come to practices or games, and the league does not track results or statistics online. The team\u2019s website is a Facebook page \u2014 though one with more than 450,000 likes.The volleyball, however, is world class. The eight-team playoffs, which started last weekend, attract sellout crowds, and Rio usually moves at least some matches to nearby Maracan\u00e3zinho, an arena with a capacity of nearly 12,000, that will be the site of the Olympic volleyball tournament in August.The intensity ratchets up several notches, especially between teams loaded with Olympians.\u201cSuperliga has most of the best Brazilian players,\u201d said Rio\u2019s Gabriela Braga, known as Gabi, an outside hitter expected to star at the Olympics. \u201cThe playoffs get really, really hard, so we play at a great, high level, and a high physical level. It gets us in good shape for the Brazilian national team.\u201dThe women on the national team see Superliga as an advantage, and most are willing to give up more money for the chance to stay home, play in front of familiar faces and prepare for the Olympics in ways that the Americans cannot.\u201cPlayers want to come here because we\u2019ve won the last two Olympics, and people around the world wonder, What are they doing in Brazil that is so good?\u201d said the defensive specialist Fabiana Alvim, a two-time Olympic and eight-time Superliga champion in Rio who is known as Fabi. \u201cWe get enough money to compete. And the teams can play.\u201dThat is what attracted Thompson. When she arrived in the fall, it did not take her long to see what she had gotten into in Brazil.\u201cWe played at Osasco, our big rival, right before Christmas,\u201d she said of a match in the S\u00e3o Paulo suburbs. \u201cProbably one of the coolest opposing gyms I\u2019ve ever been to. It was packed when we walked in there, and you could hear booing before we got out of the locker room. It was fun, you know? I think everyone here is pretty passionate, in all walks of life. It\u2019s a really fun place to live and see their culture. But they aren\u2019t afraid to let you know they\u2019re not happy, those fans. I love it. But also, when you\u2019re doing well, it\u2019s the coolest thing you\u2019ve ever seen.\u201dThompson and the rest of her American Olympic teammates, wherever they are around the world, will come see for themselves in just a few months.Helena Rebello contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

Mr. Sanders tried to capitalize on his win, dispensing with the pleasantries and the desire he once professed to avoid negative attacks.Mrs. Clinton seemed well prepared to critique Mr. Sanders\u00e2\u0080\u0099s record on immigration-related votes, pressing him as a sympathizer of militiamen who wanted to round up people in the country illegally. Mr. Sanders sounded uncomfortable as he described his opposition to a comprehensive immigration bill in 2007, when he said that it would lead to more depression of wages for American workers, the same position that organized labor held at the time. Mr. Sanders tried to say he took that position because he found the guest-worker program to be \u00e2\u0080\u009cakin to slavery,\u00e2\u0080\u009d as critics of it have said. But that was a bit of a pretzel twist, and in reality, Mr. Sanders\u00e2\u0080\u0099s 2007 position will not hurt him in the Midwest, particularly in Illinois and Ohio, which also vote on Tuesday.Mrs. Clinton faced some of the toughest questions of the night, in what seemed like a lopsided effort by the moderators as they approached the two candidates. She flashed some annoyance, but held it in check for the most part. And she struck a poignant note when she acknowledged that she was not a gifted politician. Yet she seemed uncertain of exactly how to attack Mr. Sanders, hitting him from the left at times and making an imprecise case against him over his votes related to the government bailout of the automobile industry after the fiscal collapse of 2008.Thursday night, the pendulum swings back to the Republican side, where the four remaining candidates will gather for a debate, also in Miami.\n\t\tFirst Draft provides fast-paced and comprehensive coverage of politics and elections by The New York Times.

John Kasich of Ohio in his home state, where he is seeking a critical win in Tuesday\u00e2\u0080\u0099s primary.GREEN, Ohio \u00e2\u0080\u0094 Mitt Romney, in his latest attempt to help stop Donald J. Trump, joined Gov. John Kasich of Ohio on the campaign trail on Monday as Mr. Kasich tries to pull out a victory in his home state.At an air museum between Akron and Canton, where Mr. Kasich\u2019s campaign bus pulled in next to a World War II-era bomber, Mr. Romney highlighted Mr. Kasich\u00e2\u0080\u0099s experience in Congress and as Ohio\u00e2\u0080\u0099s governor.\u00e2\u0080\u009cUnlike the other people running, he has a real track record,\u201d Mr. Romney said in introducing Mr. Kasich at the town hall style event. \u00e2\u0080\u009cHe has the kind of record that you want in Washington, and that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s why I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m convinced that you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re going to do the right thing tomorrow.\u00e2\u0080\u009dIn remarks lasting under four minutes, Mr. Romney did not mention Mr. Trump, nor did he give an explicit, broad endorsement of Mr. Kasich. But he came close; saying that \u201cAmerica is looking to Ohio to do a job interview,\u201d he told voters that Mr. Kasich was \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe guy that Ohio needs to vote for.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00e2\u0080\u009cAmerica\u2019s counting on you,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Romney said.Afterward, Mr. Kasich observed, \u201cHow things would have been different if the election results had been different four years ago, huh?\u201d Mr. Kasich said it was \u201cso nice of Mitt to come out and support me here in this effort to win this state.\u201d He went on to highlight and praise Mr. Romney\u00e2\u0080\u0099s work on the 2002 Winter Olympics, which he said had been \u00e2\u0080\u009cfalling apart.\u00e2\u0080\u009dHe said that the Olympics could have been a global embarrassment, one that would have been almost \u00e2\u0080\u009cas bad as people slugging it out at a campaign rally,\u00e2\u0080\u009d a reference to the violence at Mr. Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s rallies.Mr. Kasich, who has accused Mr. Trump of creating a \u00e2\u0080\u009ctoxic environment,\u00e2\u0080\u009d asked the audience to \u00e2\u0080\u009cthink of the images that have been broadcast across this world of the way we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re picking a president here.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou think they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not using that for propaganda, to send a message to people that America\u00e2\u0080\u0099s broken?\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Kasich asked.Mr. Romney\u00e2\u0080\u0099s appearances with Mr. Kasich seemed to carry the risk of putting off some voters. Mr. Romney\u00e2\u0080\u0099s intervention in the Republican race this month, and his instructions to voters to stop Mr. Trump, drew contempt from some rank-and-file Republicans.There was evidence of that reaction as Mr. Kasich campaigned on Monday.At an earlier event in Youngstown that did not include an appearance by Mr. Romney, Adam Rutushin, a retired pharmacist who is running for county office, brought up Mr. Romney, and not in a positive way.Mr. Rutushin supports Mr. Kasich, but expressed disappointment in Mr. Romney, saying before the event that he did not like his asserting himself in the race. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe important thing is that the people choose,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt shouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be engineered.\u00e2\u0080\u009dBefore the event here, another Kasich supporter, Carole Miller, a retired schoolteacher, said Mr. Romney could help Mr. Kasich\u2019s chances in Tuesday\u00e2\u0080\u0099s primary. But she was not eager for Mr. Romney to play a lasting role in the presidential race.\u00e2\u0080\u009cI think it\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be helpful for Kasich,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThen he should butt out.\u00e2\u0080\u009dBut he welcomed Mr. Romney\u00e2\u0080\u0099s help on Monday.\u00e2\u0080\u009cHe\u2019s going to come in and be positive,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Kasich told reporters in Youngstown. \u00e2\u0080\u009cHe\u00e2\u0080\u0099s going to talk about me.

{"Headline": "Alabama Prison Uprisings Come as State Grapples With How to Fix System", "Date": "2016-03-15", "News": "Supported byATMORE, Ala. \u2014 When the video appeared on Facebook, it was as compelling as it was shaky and shocking: Using a contraband device, a state prisoner recorded and narrated nearly a minute of a prison riot here that had already led to a fire and the stabbings of two officials, including the warden.\u201cIt\u2019s going down,\u201d the man said, his voice muffled by a makeshift white bandanna.\u201cWhat we have today in Alabama makes it dangerous for not only the inmates, it makes it dangerous also for our guards and our wardens and anybody who is involved in this situation,\u201d Gov. Robert Bentley said Tuesday during a visit to the William C. Holman Correctional Facility, the site of Alabama\u2019s execution chamber and of two outbreaks of violence since Friday night.In part because of decades of severe sentencing laws that Alabama has only just begun to pivot away from, Mr. Bentley, a Republican, is presiding over a corrections system that is under extraordinary stress from overcrowding.\u201cWhen there\u2019s overcrowding in a facility, it leads to tremendous levels of tension between inmates, between inmates and staff, and it puts a strain on all of the resources of the facility,\u201d said Michele Deitch, a senior lecturer at the University of Texas who was a court-appointed monitor for the Texas prison system. \u201cThe combination of all of those things can very easily lead to violence.\u201dWhen unrest that lasted for hours erupted here late Friday, there were only 17 guards supervising more than 900 prisoners at Holman, which was built in the late 1960s and designed to accommodate 581 inmates. (State officials say the facility\u2019s capacity can be stretched, uncomfortably, to more than 1,000 prisoners.)Jefferson S. Dunn, the corrections commissioner, said Tuesday that the bedlam began when a guard was stabbed while trying to break up a fight between prisoners. The warden, Carter Davenport, was attacked when he and other officials arrived at the dormitory, where about 100 prisoners were being held. The men set a fire \u2014 Mr. Bentley said they might have used baby oil as an accelerant \u2014 before emergency response teams used tear gas to quell the uprising.The unrest resumed in the same dormitory Monday morning, Mr. Dunn said, when a guard was \u201cmet with resistance\u201d after one inmate stabbed another, and prisoners ultimately barricaded the area. The episode ended within hours, but Holman remained on lockdown on Tuesday. When Mr. Bentley toured the complex, a tactical squadron of state troopers augmented his traditional security detail.\u201cPart of the prison sentence is punishment,\u201d Mr. Bentley said in Holman\u2019s visitation room, not far from barbed wire, brick guard towers and signs of allegiance to the University of Alabama Crimson Tide. \u201cWe know that. But you\u2019ve got to protect people.\u201dAlthough Republicans control the Legislature, Mr. Bentley\u2019s prisons plan has hardly zipped through the State House, where lobbyists for the construction industry have expressed concerns that the work would go to out-of-state firms. Other critics have questioned the governor\u2019s assertions that the project would save the state money over the long term. On Tuesday morning, State Senator Greg Albritton, who represents this area, stood a few feet away from Mr. Bentley and would not commit to voting for the governor\u2019s proposal.The plan\u2019s detractors have also voiced pointed questions about their fears that Alabama officials have devised an expensive, high-profile strategy that would do little to change the culture of the state\u2019s prisons.\u201cI don\u2019t think the problem has anything to do with the physical state of these prisons,\u201d said Bryan Stevenson, the executive director of the Equal Justice Initiative, an Alabama-based group that has criticized and sued the state over its prisons. \u201cThere are some reforms that are needed there, but if we think that building supermax prisons is going to solve the problems that we have, we are really being delusional.\u201dMr. Stevenson, who condemned Holman as one of the Deep South\u2019s \u201cplantation prisons that have long, difficult, ugly histories of abuse and isolation,\u201d added, \u201cWe have done just horrific things to the culture and climate in these prisons, so we\u2019re going to have to have a complete reorientation.\u201dWorries that the courts might again seize control of Alabama\u2019s prisons, as the Council of State Governments recently warned was a possibility, have helped shape the debate in Montgomery, the state capital.\u201cYou don\u2019t have a lot of choices here,\u201d State Senator Cam Ward, the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, said in an interview. \u201cEither you\u2019re going to spend some money and do some construction and major reforms within the sentencing process, or the federal government or a federal court is going to come in and say, \u2018You\u2019re going to do it, and you\u2019re still going to pay for it.\u2019\u00a0\u201dThis month\u2019s uprisings and their graphic display, people on both sides of the debate said, showcased the urgency and depth of the troubles here. But still, some worried that in the absence of an agreement, or before one, the turmoil in the prisons could worsen.\u201cIt\u2019s tragic, frankly, that it requires violence and fires and stabbings to get people to pay attention to the dire conditions in these prisons,\u201d said Mr. Stevenson, who has represented Holman prisoners. \u201cUnfortunately in these circumstances, conditions usually get worse rather than better, especially for the incarcerated people. That\u2019s my fear.\u201dJack Begg contributed research.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Father, a Son, a Disease, and a Camera", "Date": "2018-01-18", "News": "Domestic violence against women is commonplace in Armenia, Ms. Hayrapetyan said, yet until recently it was rarely discussed in public. Still, she knew the reality: Growing up, a neighbor girl\u00e2\u0080\u0099s father had killed her mother, but it was discussed only in furtive whispers, if at all.\u00e2\u0080\u009cNo one can say the real numbers of physical abuse cases because it is considered normal and acceptable by most people,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Ms. Hayrapetyan, 35, said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe police often don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t record cases.\u00e2\u0080\u009dAt times she was too late and had to photograph funerals.In one case, she photographed family members gathered around the body of Maro Guloyan at her wake at her parents\u00e2\u0080\u0099 home. As relatives checked the body for marks, Ms. Hayrapetyan clearly saw bruises shaped liked fingers grasping the neck.For the family, the marks confirmed their belief that Ms. Guloyan was murdered by her husband. He and his relatives had claimed she committed suicide. The case was not brought to trial in Armenia, but the Women\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Resource Center of Armenia took the case to the European Court of Human Rights, where Ms. Hayrapetyan\u00e2\u0080\u0099s photos were entered as evidence.When women marry in Armenia, Ms. Hayrapetyan said, they usually move in with the husband\u00e2\u0080\u0099s family, which can leave them isolated from their own family \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and vulnerable to abuse by their husband and in-laws. Ms. Hayrapetyan sees domestic violence as an outgrowth of a culture in which mothers and sisters serve the boys, and when the boys grow up, their wives serve them.\u00e2\u0080\u009cMen never do housework and they never share in child-rearing,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThey think it\u2019s normal to forbid women to do things. They think it\u2019s normal for women to only be in the kitchen and take care of kids. This is how fathers teach their sons.\u00e2\u0080\u009dMs. Hayrapetyan has three young children of her own, and she has photographed much of the project carrying at least one child in a sling. She struggles to make sure that neither of her two boys nor their older sister feels entitled or limited by gender.Since she started her project, more women have begun speaking out against spousal abuse in Armenia, but not much has changed, Ms, Hayrapetyan said.\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe police are not doing anything and the government is not protecting these women,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she added.Not surprisingly, female photographers have struggled in Armenia. When Ms. Hayrapetyan started in 2005, there were few successful female photographers. After World Press Photo held workshops there from 2004 through 2006, more women entered the profession, but they often faced discrimination: Two of her friends were rejected for news photographer jobs explicitly because they were women.\u00e2\u0080\u009cWe\u00e2\u0080\u0099re trying to not only\u00c2\u00a0take photos but help others,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Ms. Hayrapetyan said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe task is not to be the greatest photographer alone. The task is to have an educated photography community and to empower women in Armenia because they have so many problems here.\u00e2\u0080\u009d"}
{"Headline": "25 Songs That Tell Us Where Music Is Going", "Date": "2016-03-10", "News": "By Nitsuh AbebeBy then, though, the song had become such an intense focus of discussion at the digital water cooler \u2014 to the point where it felt difficult to turn on a computer without someone\u2019s views about \u201cFormation\u201d and its various sociopolitical valences reaching out and grasping for your throat \u2014 that my not having heard it acquired some kind of political dimension. A decision had to be made. Either I needed to dutifully consume this object of conversation and develop an opinion about it or I needed to develop a defense of why I hadn\u2019t yet done so.The point being: Here, for a moment, was music that actively dragooned me into paying attention to it, based not primarily on sound, performance or composition, but on the rolling snowball of perspectives, close readings and ideological disputes accreting around it.It\u2019s songs that do this now; individual songs and mass opinion, working in tandem. This wasn\u2019t always the case. We\u2019ve spent the past century or so trying, in creaky and convulsive ways, to figure out what music is even for, and how we intend to use it. When and where will we listen to it? Will other people be there? Should people own music? Who should write it \u2014 the performers? What\u2019s a normal amount to release at once? How will we find out about it? Will there be pictures? Are you absolutely, definitely sure we have to pay money for it? For the moment, there\u2019s only one answer to these questions that seems to connect strangers in a truly monocultural way: We shall gather in huge, fawning riots around towering pop singles to trade politicized takes on them.It\u2019s not the worst thing. One of the great tricks of pop music is that no matter how much we like to imagine it\u2019s about musicians expressing themselves, it tends to be more useful as a way for listeners to figure out their own identities: Each song lets us try on a new way of being in the world. For a long while, the idea was that young people could use music to shape their style \u2014 their clothes, their haircuts, their sense of cool. Then came high-speed Internet and a touching enthusiasm for the idea of playlists: With so much of the world\u2019s music at our fingertips, we\u2019d express our intelligence and taste by playing D.J. and curator, sorting through songs to assemble our own reflections. That didn\u2019t last, either. Showing off your eclectic, handpicked treasures? This has become such a common online performance that there\u2019s no one left in the audience.So these days it\u2019s the song, and the scale of the event surrounding it. One song, one digestible thing, with millions of people standing in a circle around it, pointing and shouting and writing about it, conducting one gigantic online undergraduate seminar about it, metabolizing it on roughly the same level that cable-news debate shows metabolize a political speech. This is an ever-greater share of the public life of music. A song like \u201cFormation\u201d isn\u2019t set up as a story, or an interior monologue \u2014 it\u2019s set up as Beyonc\u00e9, the public celebrity whose biography you already know, addressing the world, like an op-ed with drums. Thus can we argue not about what the song says to us, but about what we think the rest of the world needs to be told, and whether Beyonc\u00e9 is telling it right. What do we make of her dancers\u2019 Black Panther styling? Is she \u201callowed\u201d to work with beloved artists from New Orleans or use references to the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina? How does the song sound through a feminist lens, through a queer lens, through an anticapitalist one? Can we have a conversation about her daughter\u2019s hair, and also about police violence? People talked about these things until, three days in, I\u2019d been quoted every last line of a song I still hadn\u2019t heard.How the pop star won us back with a disappearing act.By Mary H.K. ChoiThe second single from \u201cPurpose,\u201d Justin Bieber\u2019s fourth studio album, \u201cSorry\u201d is an infectious confection \u2014 a Dorito for your ears. There are two official videos for it: a dance video that stars a diverse cast of young women who seem to have been dressed by magpies let loose in a Delia\u2019s catalog; and a lyric video, which is sort of like that footage they use in karaoke bars, but slightly more polished. Between the two, there have been well over 1 billion views. At no point in either does the Canadian heartthrob appear. He simply doesn\u2019t need to.In previous years, by contrast, he was everywhere. He had transformed in the public eye from a teen-star brat to a grown-up brat, with the D.U.I. arrest to prove it. He had become a hollow hashtag of a person. When he visited the Anne Frank house, he wrote in the guest book that he sincerely hoped Frank would have been a \u201cBelieber.\u201d Not only did he come off like Joffrey Baratheon with a Hitler-youth haircut, his callow bad-boy affectation reeked of a keening need to be cool \u2014 anathema, as any teenager can tell you, to actually being cool. But the backlash to the backlash is here, and much like both videos, it has less to do with Bieber \u2014 the actual Bieber \u2014 than you\u2019d expect.Because get this: The most inspired part of Justin Bieber\u2019s reinvention is its erasure of all previously identifiable Bieberish elements. \u201cSorry\u201d is unlike anything Bieber has made in the past. It has been classified as \u201ctropical house\u201d and \u201cdancehall,\u201d but everyone seems to agree on one thing: It\u2019s a banger. The song is about a relationship Bieber has screwed up, and in the lead-in to the hook, he asks, \u201cIs it too late now to say sorry?/\u2019Cause I\u2019m missing more than just your body.\u201d But by the time the actual chorus arrives, Bieber lets the production take over: All you hear is a cooing arpeggio that feels like a gentle breeze on your brain. It\u2019s the best part of the song, and Bieber seems to appear in it only as a sample.This song is a triumph of music over narrative in the hellscape that is the pop music-industrial complex. Consider, for example, the confusing, protracted drama of Kanye West\u2019s latest album release, which involved a huge fashion show, several tweet storms and title changes all leading up to \u201cThe Life of Pablo,\u201d a record that\u2019s being finished in real time on a platform no one wants to pay for.So what is it, exactly, that we want from Bieber? Likability? Yes, Justin Bieber is a contrivance. Yes, Justin Bieber\u2019s lyrics are insipid \u2014 worse still, disingenuous. Yes, his tattoos stink. Yes, he\u2019s lousy at skateboarding. But what does any of this actually matter? In case you missed it, Bieber won. You used to hate him, and now it\u2019s pointless. So who\u2019s sorry now? \u2666Even if you can\u2019t score tickets, the cast album is its own transcendent experience.By Wesley MorrisThere\u2019s being locked out of heaven. Then there\u2019s being locked out of \u201cHamilton.\u201d And with all due respect to Bruno Mars (and God), being locked out of \u201cHamilton\u201d is crueller \u2014 as farce, but still. The musical is sold out \u2014 for, like, ever. And the resale market has achieved spit-take-level hilarity. To wit, this Craigslist ad: \u201cI bought tickets for the wrong night. These are legitimate \u2018Hamilton\u2019 tickets for Friday March 11, 8 p.m., purchased though Ticketmaster. I just want to get back what I paid for them. Great seats! $933.80 per ticket.\u201dBack on Earth, there\u2019s the cast album: a 46-number souvenir for an experience most of us won\u2019t be experiencing. At less than $20 on iTunes, however, where it has been in and out of the Top 10 for months, and Amazon, this is a more-than-adequate substitute for the budget-conscious. It\u2019s a gateway to obsession. To know someone who has this album is to know someone who needs a restraining order.This is to say that the cast recording is its own experience. In an age in which the album is notional \u2014 musical Tupperware \u2014 this one works as a complete concept and doubles as its own playlist, crammed with jams. There are King George\u2019s long-distance interludes, in which, under the mostly brown circumstances, white power sings the same, out-of-style song over and over and over. Meanwhile, the first five numbers alone \u2014 \u201cAlexander Hamilton\u201d; \u201cAaron Burr, Sir\u201d; \u201cMy Shot\u201d; \u201cThe Story of Tonight\u201d; and \u201cThe Schuyler Sisters\u201d \u2014 get halfway to a greatest-hits collection. Pilfered dabs of R.&B., show tunes, rock and rap recombine until identifying whatever you think you\u2019re hearing becomes its own sport.The rapping that Hamilton, played by Lin-Manuel Miranda, the show\u2019s creator, does at the start of the song sounds like some sweaty couplet from LL Cool J\u2019s \u201cI Need Love\u201d from 1987. The \u201cnos\u201d from the ensemble echo the \u201cwhoas\u201d and \u201cheys\u201d from Naughty by Nature\u2019s \u201cHip-Hop Hooray,\u201d from 1993. When Miranda gets to the chorus (\u201cLord, show me how to/Say no to this/I don\u2019t know how to/Say no to this/But my God, she looks so helpless/And her body\u2019s saying, \u2018hell, yes\u2019\u201d) handclaps and guitar licks gently join the percussion and bass line. And suddenly all I can hear is Champaign\u2019s 1981 love jam, \u201cHow \u2019Bout Us.\u201d Pairing those Greek-chorus \u201cnos\u201d with the ecstatic sounds of a harp as Hamilton and Mrs. Reynolds (presumably) do it generates moral tension. The bass line is where \u201cSay No to This\u201d gets both its erogenous nerve and antique heat. Your head spins as the song proceeds to combine sounds from a half-dozen old-school districts.The Karl Ove Knausgaard of grumpy independent musicians.By Sam Hockley-SmithMark Kozelek, who used to front an epically moody band called Red House Painters, is known as something of a jerk. Onstage, when not singing in a voice like crumbling granite, he says things that usually end up offending somebody: hipsters, women, journalists, the band on the next stage. But on the records he now releases as Sun Kil Moon, he examines his life with plain-spoken brutality, saving the most cutting remarks for himself.\u201cI Watched the Film the Song Remains the Same\u201d occupies more than 10 minutes of \u201cBenji,\u201d the album he released in 2014. It begins as the story of the first time Kozelek saw the Led Zeppelin concert film \u201cThe Song Remains the Same\u201d as a child; it ends as a song about nostalgia, chronic sadness and the way people drop in and out of your life. One moment Kozelek\u2019s admiring the electric piano on \u201cNo Quarter\u201d; the next, he\u2019s sharing memories of being a \u201cvery melancholic kid,\u201d or apologizing for the time he punched a classmate in school. The way he writes isn\u2019t so different from Karl Ove Knausgaard, also in his late 40s; both men spent long careers skirting the spotlight, then found new renown when they started excavating their own biographies for details.So on \u201cBenji,\u201d Kozelek sings about his relationship with his parents, about buying lampshades, about death. A second cousin\u2019s death sets him thinking about family; James Gandolfini\u2019s sets him thinking about his prostate troubles. He approaches each topic as if flipping through a disorganized photo album, and the more insular and lived-in the details, the more enthralling they seem. At the end of \u201cI Watched the Film ... ,\u201d he says he\u2019s headed to Santa Fe to visit a friend he hasn\u2019t seen in 15 years. Close Googlers can deduce that friend must be Ivo Watts-Russell, who signed Red House Painters to his 4AD label back in 1992; Kozelek, grave and grateful, says he\u2019s going to New Mexico just to say thank you. \u2666How to chart your own path in a post-label music industry.By Jenna WorthamWatch the virtual-reality film that accompanies this article by downloading NYT VR.The women in attendance seemed especially mesmerized by Sydney Bennett \u2014 better known as Syd tha Kyd \u2014 the frontwoman, whose Tiger Beat sex appeal gave her performance a depth charge. Bennett, 23, brown-skinned with a blond-tinged Mohawk, has the swayback stance of an adolescent skater and dresses like one too: On the \u201cKimmel\u201d set, she wore black vans, a black T-shirt and black jeans low on her hips. As she sang, she roamed across each quadrant of the small stage, staring deep into the throng, as if to find out whether her crush had bothered to make an appearance at the show. To create her stage presence, Bennett studied the R.&B. singer D\u2019Angelo, whose 2000 video for \u201cUntitled (How Does It Feel)\u201d features nothing but his extremely defined and extremely nude upper body dripping with sweat for four and a half minutes. It showed. Bennett flirted with the crowd, peeking at them through her heavily lashed eyes, shooting sly smiles at fans and gently lifting her chin to acknowledge those she knew \u2014 among them, her mom, Janel, and her godmother, Sheryl.The TV appearance was a rarity for the members of the Internet, who, as their name suggests, live online and work from home. Two of the band\u2019s three albums were created and recorded almost entirely at the house where Bennett lives with her parents in L.A.\u2019s Mid-City neighborhood. But their most recent record, last year\u2019s \u201cEgo Death,\u201d caught the attention of the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences, and it was nominated for a Grammy in the Best Urban Contemporary Album category. (Past nominees in the category include Frank Ocean, Rihanna and Beyonc\u00e9.) The \u201cKimmel\u201d performance was a dip into mainstream media that the Internet has largely succeeded without.The band\u2019s name itself hints at an irreversible and inevitable shift in the way music works. For decades, the music industry fancied itself an apparatus for tastemaking, but as technology has made labels\u2019 role less relevant, that has ceased to be the case. Listeners decide what\u2019s popular now, and record labels have to find a way to attach themselves to it. Aside from a few big-name acts, most artists are doomed to languish in relative obscurity with middling profits. This is usually seen as a tragedy \u2014 the death of a musical middle class \u2014 but it has also presented an opportunity for artists to avoid the suffocating effects of the label machine. And so the Internet has carved out an entirely new corner of R.&B., thanks mostly to Bennett: an androgyne who sings seductive incantations about falling in and out of love with women.After the performance, a small constellation of cousins, little sisters and girlfriends milled about, snacking on doughnuts in the greenroom and helping the band pack up. After the equipment was loaded into a caravan of modest sedans and S.U.V.s, the band stood in a circle behind the studio, and someone produced a celebratory blunt. As the smoke drifted overhead, the conversation turned to the next day.The group needed to practice for the first stop on their upcoming tour, which would start a few days later in Japan. Jameel Bruner, who plays the keyboard, wouldn\u2019t be able to come until he was done with his shift at Amoeba Music, where he works as a clerk. There was drama to discuss, too. The 17-year-old guitar player, Steve Lacy, had been photographed smoking weed, and someone had texted the picture to his mother, who was not happy. Despite the chilly El Ni\u00f1o air, the band lingered, seeming reluctant to leave and break the spell of the evening. They eventually agreed to regroup at their home base, Bennett\u2019s house, to make sandwiches, catch their performance on \u201cKimmel,\u201d smoke again and, eventually, crash.The new virtual-reality film from NYT VR takes you inside Sydney Bennett\u2019s home studio as the Internet prepares for a world tour. You\u2019ll experience the rehearsal process as Bennett teaches her band a new song, then get onstage with the band as they perform it for the first time.Turner may have been reacting to the banality of the question, but his answer also illuminated a changing dynamic for rap, which has historically been categorized by regional sounds. People Turner and Bennett\u2019s age are defined by a completely different geography, the social networks and websites they spend their time on. Odd Future was the epitome of this new statelessness: They were neither engineered by a label nor hometown heroes, but something wildly different.Odd Future dominated many conversations about pop culture and the future of music by the end of 2010. They had released all of their early work \u2014 a barrage of clever mixtapes, striking artwork and bizarro music videos \u2014 for free on Tumblr and YouTube. Their sound was prodigious. And not only was their music different but they also looked different too, a bunch of black weirdos who skated in their free time and moshed onstage.The frenzy surrounding Odd Future reached its peak in 2011: Cartoon Network gave the group their own television show; plans for an Odd Future retail shop were in the works. Labels were desperate to sign deals with the group, and Sony Music Entertainment succeeded. The crew had the upper hand and persuaded the label to give them their own imprint, and to award each member a cushy solo record deal. Bennett, the D.J., got one, too.Music came naturally to Bennett. Though her parents are 9-to-5 people \u2014 Janel is a city clerk and her father, Howard, owns a manufacturing company based in China \u2014 her uncle, Mikey Bennett, is a producer in Jamaica. (He co-wrote Shabba Ranks\u2019s 1993 hit \u201cMr. Loverman.\u201d) When she was young, the family took vacations to the island, and Bennett hung out in the studio and watched her uncle work. \u201cAt some point, I started listening to music a little differently,\u201d Bennett said. \u201cRather than being like, Yo, this is dope \u2014 who made this? it started being like, I wish I made this.\u201dWhen she was 16, her parents let her transform their guesthouse into a studio, where she worked on her own songs and recorded local musicians. In high school, she took music-technology classes and piano lessons; at night, she devoured beat-making tutorials and messed around with music software. She downloaded tracks from LimeWire (a file-sharing network like Napster) and remixed them using Pro Tools and GarageBand. She didn\u2019t need much capital to be a producer, just good Google skills and a wealth of persistence and patience.Bennett gravitated toward artists who had pioneered brand-new sounds: The sonic spaciness of Missy Elliott, the stanky soul of Erykah Badu and the acid jazz of Jamiroquai. Pharrell Williams, the original black skater weirdo, is her patron saint. And like most kids interested in music and living in Los Angeles in the mid-2000s, Bennett knew about a teenager named Tyler Okonma who called himself Tyler, the Creator. He had a sizable following on MySpace, where he released his music. \u201cHis production drew me in,\u201d she told me. \u201cIt didn\u2019t sound like what everyone was making \u2014 it was different and hot.\u201d Bennett noticed that one of the people at the top of his friend list was a kid named Matt Martin (who goes by Matt Martians). She browsed through his page, listening to the songs he posted, too. She admired his ability to create deeply complex soundscapes, and she eventually messaged him, seeking advice on ways to advance her own style.The two became friends, trading feedback on songs, which put her into Okonma\u2019s orbit. And when Okonma needed a place to record the early Odd Future mixtapes, Bennett offered up her home studio. She produced some of their early tracks and eventually became the group\u2019s D.J. In old footage of early Odd Future shows, Bennett plays songs from a laptop on a table at the back of the stage. Tomboyish, in a muscle tee and a short haircut, she crackles with the manic energy that Odd Future shows were famous for. She was generally indistinguishable from the boys in the group.From the beginning, Odd Future was meant to be a galaxy of loosely knit projects; the whole point was for the members to collaborate and spin off solo efforts. Christian Clancy, one of the group\u2019s managers, had also been a marketing executive at Interscope Records, and around 2011 he took notice of Bennett and Martin\u2019s tight friendship and encouraged them to start recording together. After all, they liked the same sounds: jazz, old-school slow jams, neo-soul. So they began experimenting, and these experiments would eventually lead to the formation of the Internet.Odd Future was a rare example of a viral sensation with lasting power; the music industry is rife with the ghosts of web talents who couldn\u2019t be repackaged as megastars. The terms of the Internet\u2019s deal with Sony \u201callowed us to shape ourselves,\u201d Bennett says. The band is artistically cocooned, trying to create, as she sees it, an entirely new style of R.&B., one that includes all types of desire. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t a conscious thing,\u201d she emphasizes. \u201cI just like women.\u201dBennett personally related to the themes that lent Okonma\u2019s music its emotional gravity: alienation, isolation, loneliness. She felt they shared a connection, one born of \u201cnot being a typical black kid or even a popular kid.\u201d But eventually the hypermasculinity and caustic sense of humor wore on Bennett, who is naturally low-key. She made tearful calls to her mother from the road, wondering aloud whether she should quit. Bennett also struggled with depression, worsened by the stress of touring and feeling disconnected from her family and her girlfriend at the time. She says that no one in the group \u2014 other than Martin \u2014 seemed to care. \u201cI couldn\u2019t talk to any of them about it,\u201d she says. \u201cWe weren\u2019t all that close, and they never seemed to want to hear it.\u201dNot long after, Bennett began training her little brother, Travis \u2014 who goes by Taco \u2014 to take her place as Odd Future\u2019s D.J. Her musical experiments with Martin had begun to congeal into the core of their first album, \u201cPurple Naked Ladies,\u201d an amorphous but promising collection of experimental jam sessions and fuzzed-out, vibey tracks. One morning while Odd Future was on tour, when the group was watching the sun crest over a beach in Australia, Bennett broke the news that she was leaving. She says it was not well received. It felt like a divorce, like a family \u2014 however dysfunctional \u2014 falling apart.\u201cThey weren\u2019t happy about it,\u201d she says. \u201cI was their get-out-of-jail-free card. It\u2019s easy to say they aren\u2019t homophobic because Syd is there.\u201dBennett\u2019s exit came at a time when gender norms were blurring. Artists now feel more emboldened to hint at sexual fluidity; it\u2019s edgy, if not outright trendy. Musicians like Wiz Khalifa and Jaden Smith have been photographed wearing skirts and dresses. Angel Haze and Shamir have said they\u2019re genderqueer. But being openly gay can still feel especially difficult in the world of hip-hop and R.&B., where artists who are suspected of being closeted can face harsher scrutiny. Lesbianism is often fetishized, made into a hypersexualized performance. While Young Thug can get away with wearing nail polish, female artists who give off an even slightly masculine air, like the rapper Dej Loaf, are hounded about their orientation.Minya Oh, the hip-hop journalist who goes by Miss Info, thinks Bennett has benefited from upheaval in the industry. \u201cI\u2019m sure that on some level of the major-label and old-establishment industry, there are execs and agents who think homosexuality is a liability,\u201d she says. On the other hand, she adds, \u201cthere are more and more handlers and mentors and facilitators who will see a new artist who is gay as either an opportunity to tap into a new market or, at worst, just a talking point.\u201d But even more important than all that, Oh says, is that artists like Bennett may not even have to pander to the mainstream anymore: \u201cAs fragmented as music audiences are these days, it would be difficult to alienate fans who are already bunched into nomad tribes.\u201dBennett\u2019s outward manner is so nonchalant and mellow it can start to seem like an affectation, but as soon as the words left my mouth, Bennett put down her forkful of pancake and slid me a sideways look, the kind you give someone when your patience is wearing thin but you still feel obligated to be polite.The Internet \u2014 the network \u2014 has a way of normalizing fringe ideas, marginalized identities and emerging artists that old media tends to ignore. It has done such a good job, you could argue, that people like Bennett \u2014 black, queer and weird \u2014 can exist without the burden of having to represent something larger. Bennett will never be something she\u2019s not. She\u2019s not looking for validation from record labels, or even really from audiences. Later that night, as thousands of Mexican teenagers rushed the stage, singing along in English and screaming her name, Bennett looked completely at home, and completely herself. \u2666A song as salve in an age of rancor.By George SaundersHow does a song work? What does it actually do? It doesn\u2019t instruct, exactly, or teach, necessarily. A song, I\u2019d say, causes the listener to assume a certain stance. Through some intersection of melody/lyrics/arrangement, it causes a shadow-being within us to get a certain expression on its face and fall into a certain posture. (Argent\u2019s \u201cHold Your Head Up,\u201d for example, would cause my 1970s teenage self to assume a, well, Thor-like posture: stoic, windswept, capable of enduring any hardship while, you know, holding my head up.)How does the song accomplish this? Was that the intention? I\u2019m not sure. Like much of Wilco\u2019s work, it\u2019s fundamentally a damned good popular song (simple chords, compelling melody), rendered symphonic by a process by which the song, seemingly rebelling against its own simplicity, seems to be seeking higher levels of emotionality via sonic complexity. This led me to assume the song had to be a result of weeks of arranging. But reportedly the band recorded it in one take, learning it from the songwriter Jeff Tweedy as the tape rolled. The song starts with a catchy eight-note guitar riff, to which it keeps returning, like a well-intentioned guy steering back to his mantra. Via inventive instrumental fills and a false ending (from which it rejuvenates with renewed purpose), it manages the strange task of seeming contemplative while escalating like crazy. It puts me in mind of a group of lifelong pals on a front porch, trying to musically solve some existential problem they can\u2019t quite articulate.The effect of all of this on the listener \u2014 this listener anyway \u2014 is transformative. Listening to \u201cOne Sunday Morning\u201d (every time) fixes me \u2014 like some sort of aural medicine. I feel a positive alteration in my body and mind: a renewed sense of humility at the sadness of the world, and a corresponding resolve to keep trying to be better; freshly reminded of the stakes of being alive, and of the fact that there are, at my disposal, more positive resources than I am currently employing. In this, \u201cOne Sunday Morning\u201d serves, for me, as a reliable 12-minute prayer. \u2666The radical act of ending an album in midsentence.By Jace ClaytonAt first, I thought my MP3 must have been corrupted. There\u2019s a springy, up-tempo beat that kicks off \u201c\u201906,\u201d the last track on Vince Staples\u2019s 2015 debut double album, \u201cSummertime \u201906,\u201d whose 20 songs are stark portrayals of a childhood caught between gangs and the police in Southern California. A lengthy instrumental stretch in \u201c\u201906\u201d gives the listener a break. When Staples appears with a fulsome \u201cGood mornin\u2019! Hope you had a good time last night\u201d and starts rapping, it\u2019s one of the most optimistic-sounding moments on the album. He\u2019s midway through the first verse (\u201cI\u2019m finna bring the gang in the buil\u2014\u201d) when the song cuts to a blast of loud static, followed by silence. The effect is so jarring that it can easily be mistaken for an error, a glitch in the stream.When I learned that this tear into white noise was intentional, I was shocked. This went beyond breaking the rules. \u201c\u201906\u201d plays an entirely different game than most music. Its words and sounds don\u2019t matter. What matters here is the rupture. The track uses white noise to depict a kind of death, yet it\u2019s also the sound of a channel being changed or a TV or radio shutting off: Someone is controlling this switch. A young man has been unexpectedly silenced. When it\u2019s over for him, it\u2019s over for the listener, too.His compressed rhymes sparkle with aphoristic detail. The opening lines of \u201cSummertime \u201906\u201d are \u201cHey, I\u2019m just a nigga until I fill my pockets/And then I\u2019m Mr. Nigga, they follow me while shoppin\u2019/I feel like Mick and Richards, they feel like Muddy Waters/So tell me what\u2019s the difference, so tell me what\u2019s the difference?/My momma was a Christian, Crip walkin\u2019 on blue-waters.\u201d The references multiply into serious depth. Yet before we have time to consider the Rolling Stones\u2019 relationship to the blues or how churches and gangs may offer similar types of belonging or anything else, Staples has raced ahead to end the verse with a punch: \u201cUber driver in the cockpit look like Jeffrey Dahmer/But he lookin\u2019 at me crazy when we pull up to the projects.\u201dThere are no radio-friendly singles here. Staples likes to call out things as they are, but he is not a stern moralist; if he were, he probably wouldn\u2019t have landed his gig as a brand ambassador for Sprite. (\u201cDifferent \u2019cause I\u2019m just like you\u201d he says in a recent national TV ad for the soft drink.) The preternaturally gifted rapper dresses in unflashy T-shirts and jeans. He\u2019s straight edge (no alcohol or drugs), a shrewd experimentalist with a complex politics.The song that precedes \u201d\u201906,\u201d \u201cLike It Is,\u201d clues us in to what the shocking signal crash might mean. Over a lurching, industrial beat, Staples explains: \u201cYou looking at a person, telling them that they story don\u2019t matter really no better than me/walkin\u2019 down the streets tryna shoot at somebody.\u201d To deny the validity of another person\u2019s story, he says, is to deny them life. And even when one can voice his or her mind freely, to be a successful black rapper is to perform your persona before a predominantly white audience, whose aggregate opinion determines your worth. This is a problem Staples continually addresses, whether discussing how one of his ambitions is to leave the rap game (and move on to more reliable ways of earning a living) during interviews, or in songs like \u201cLift Me Up\u201d: \u201cAll these white folks chanting when I asked \u2019em \u2018Where my niggas at?\u2019/Goin\u2019 crazy, got me goin\u2019 crazy, I can\u2019t get with that.\u201d Rapping about it only aggravates the paradox; those lines have been among the most quoted in reviews of his album, used to praise his self-awareness.Then comes the static.Staples knows that possibilities for mainstream black visibility are few and fraught. Black entertainers in the celebrity spotlight mark one extreme, the grainy videoclips of African-Americans dying at the hands of the police, whose name-recognition is always posthumous, another. How to speak against that? You can\u2019t. You can only unplug.\u201c\u201906\u201d adds to a growing body of work by black artists who flirt with disappearance in order to trouble the idea of representation itself. In \u201cConcerto in Black and Blue,\u201d David Hammons\u2019s 2002 piece for a series of pitch-black rooms in a large SoHo gallery, visitors were invited to explore with tiny blue flashlights. Their looking was the only thing to see. When the dancer-choreographer Storyboard P performs for video, he exploits the camera\u2019s two-dimensional limitations to create on-screen moves that appear simultaneously awkward and impossibly fluid. He dances as if he doesn\u2019t want to be captured, in gravity-defying bends and evasions \u2014 all escape, no center. The poet Claudia Rankine, in her 2004 book \u201cDon\u2019t Let Me Be Lonely,\u201d opens each section with an image of a TV showing static. \u201cThe years went by and people only died on television,\u201d she writes. \u201cIf they weren\u2019t Black, they were wearing black or were terminally ill.\u201dThe jagged conclusion of \u201c\u201906\u201d asks what it might mean to turn away from self-representation in sound. White noise is a spray of pitches and volumes that contains all audible frequencies. It is constant and patternless. Quite literally, it\u2019s the sound of undifferentiated possibility. One can think of Staples\u2019s provocative noise as the opposite of a stereotype, or freedom in sonic form. His signal fritzes into static with a snarl of hope: Noise and silence mark the edges of what can be considered music. To end an album like this points to a world beyond the song and to hands manipulating the transmission. What can be said outside the culture\u2019s limiting expectations, and who might we become if we learn to listen to it? \u2666A singular voice, aching with desperation and resolve.By Carlo Rotella Price usually drops down in pitch when she sings the second syllable of \u201cbottle,\u201d but sometimes she takes it up a bluesy interval instead, turning a honky-tonk lament into a call to arms. The two deliveries of the line play up countervailing qualities of desperation and resolve in her voice. Together they make it sound as if she\u2019s exerting considerable strength of character to keep despair and bad luck from carrying her song off the road and headlong into a telephone pole. This instantly detectable tension in her voice causes listeners to become alert, even alarmed, the moment she starts singing.\u201cHurtin\u2019 \u201c is the first single from Price\u2019s album \u201cMidwest Farmer\u2019s Daughter,\u201d which will be released by Jack White\u2019s Third Man Records on March 25. She\u2019s being rolled out with the fanfare appropriate to the next big thing out of Nashville, as the appearance on Colbert suggests, but she\u2019s not on country\u2019s standard ing\u00e9nue track. At 32, having weathered lean times and near misses, she\u2019s more of a hard-bitten classicist. Her album title evokes Loretta Lynn\u2019s \u201cCoal Miner\u2019s Daughter,\u201d and her diction, especially the way she chews on the word \u201cpain,\u201d raises echoes of Tammy Wynette; her mask of barroom bravado over tender vulnerability recalls Merle Haggard; and her band, the Price Tags, favors old-school arrangements, with Luke Schneider\u2019s pedal-steel guitar weaving prominently around her voice.As attention has built around Price, she has sometimes found herself placed in a cohort with Chris Stapleton, Sturgill Simpson and other scruffy dissenters who have recently made inroads into the dominion of the bro acts currently ruling Nashville\u2019s major labels and country radio. As the underground rocker-turned-\u201dcountry/garage\u201d producer Jonathan Bright has suggested, if current Nashville stars like Luke Bryan and Florida Georgia Line are the equivalent of M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce and other such glam-pop acts who dominated rock in the late 1980s, Price and company could be part of country\u2019s long-awaited back-to-basics riposte. Roots-music boosters are always announcing that the inevitable cyclical swing back to hard-country twang has begun, but listening to Price \u2014 or watching the growly, uncute Stapleton clean up at the Country Music Association Awards last November \u2014 you can begin to believe that maybe it\u2019s really happening.The songs on \u201cMidwest Farmer\u2019s Daughter\u201d mine the experience of further hard knocks. Her parents lost the family\u2019s corn-and-soybean farm in Buffalo Prairie, Ill., and her father went to work as a prison guard. Price endured a run of professional disappointment and personal sorrow after arriving in Nashville in 2003. With her husband, Jeremy Ivey, who plays bass in the Price Tags and writes songs with her, she tried her hand at rock and soul and made a brief, unhappy foray into writing commercial country music. Serially turned away, ripped off and let down by operators in the music industry, she grew used to selling her meager possessions to pick up and start over, waitressing, hoping for some luck. \u201cI can\u2019t count all the times I\u2019ve been had,\u201d she sings in \u201cThis Town Gets Around,\u201d her ode to the lecherous manager, fraudulent publicist and other Music Row animals who preyed upon her.Five years ago she gave birth to twin sons, one of whom died of a rare heart ailment two weeks later. She sank low after that and couldn\u2019t pull herself out of it. Drinking didn\u2019t help. \u201cIt just snowballed,\u201d she says. \u201cI felt as if I was cursed, some kind of running cosmic joke.\u201d A long weekend in the Davidson County jail after a drunken-driving incident persuaded her to get help and break the downward momentum. \u201cWeekender,\u201d a jail song on the album, is a good girl\u2019s rueful acknowledgment that the women in lockup are tougher and less fortunate than she is. \u201cThey were hard, and I was really scared,\u201d she says. \u201cThey could tell by your shoes that you were just a weekender.\u201dShe and Ivey sold their car to finance the recording of \u201cMidwest Farmer\u2019s Daughter\u201d at Sun Studio in Memphis. The album was rejected all over Nashville and eventually picked up by a label they didn\u2019t even consider approaching. Despite having a Nashville office, Third Man Records isn\u2019t widely known for producing country music (though Jack White produced a comeback album for Loretta Lynn in 2004). But Price\u2019s habit of putting vocal soul shadings into even the most straight-ahead country songs makes her an impure traditionalist, and therefore a surprisingly good fit for Third Man. Ben Swank, who runs the company with White and Ben Blackwell, says, \u201cWe\u2019re coming from a punk-rock, indie-rock background that discovered blues and American music in reverse,\u201d an aesthetic that tends to value emotional power over stylistic orthodoxy.Swank believes that Price\u2019s career travails might have fortuitously delayed her album just long enough to allow Third Man to take advantage of a new openness to \u201ca classical sound\u201d in country music. Another name for that sound is Americana: high-gloss corporate country\u2019s earthier foil and partner, which embraces not only folk traditions but also vintage commercial styles drawn magpie-fashion from bygone eras. Pointing in particular to the career of Stapleton \u2014 who went from writing pop-flavored radio fare for established stars to become a major-label juggernaut singing spare, bluesy songs in the outlaw country mold \u2014 Swank says: \u201cNow there are others who have knocked on the door. If she had come along two years earlier, maybe it\u201d \u2014 the next-big-thing buzz \u2014 \u201cwouldn\u2019t have happened.\u201dPrice\u2019s son, Judah, climbed on and off her lap as a stylist enlarged her blond hair. Friends and family were temporarily shooed away as she put on something tight and fringed. Foot traffic milled in and out of other dressing rooms along the hall, and from one came a furious burst of picking as a bluegrass band warmed up.Out on the main stage, Price sang her allotted two songs, ending with \u201cHurtin.\u2019 \u201c The band came to a full stop for her honky-tonk cadenza: \u201cThat don\u2019t touch . . . the paiiiinnnnn . . . you put . . . on . . . meeeeee,\u201d with a slow-rising two-note flourish on the final word. Robust applause followed, and then Mike Snider, the banjo player who serves as one of the Opry\u2019s chief traditionalist voices, said: \u201cGood job, Margo, you sweet little old thing. Good to have somebody come out here and sing country again.\u201d There was laughter, some knowing and some a little too hearty, in the crowd and among the house musicians onstage and the insiders thronging the wings. \u201cBy golly,\u201d Snider said, \u201cthat was stronger than new rope.\u201d \u2666The world\u2019s greatest session drummer confronts the machine age.By Jeff HimmelmanChamberlain, 48, is a session player paid by the project, a below-the-radar rock star who often shows up only in the liner notes. If you watched MTV in the \u201990s, you heard him drumming with Pearl Jam in their \u201cAlive\u201d video or with Fiona Apple or Tori Amos or the Wallflowers. He has appeared on records by everyone from Bruce Springsteen and David Bowie to Frank Ocean and Kanye West, toured with the Indigo Girls and Soundgarden, spent a season as the drummer for the \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d band. He played drums on the \u201cFrozen\u201d soundtrack for Disney. In a world of dwindling recording budgets and increased automation, he could well be the last one drumming before software takes over completely.At Blackbird Studio in Nashville, Urban told Chamberlain that he had \u201cJohn Cougar\u201d down on his acoustic guitar, but it felt too formulaic. He\u2019d been listening to the rapper Kendrick Lamar and wanted a groove that could not only propel the song but inspire an altogether new sound for it. Chamberlain assembled a drum loop \u2014 a small-scale mechanical repetition born more of hip-hop than country \u2014 and then played live drums over the loop, deepening the timbre and also providing accents and fills when the movement of the verses seemed to require it. Urban pronounced the whole package \u201csexy\u201d; in the sought-for moment of inspiration, he would put down his acoustic guitar in favor of an electric bass. Within a couple of hours, the drums-bass-and-voice opening and the entire vibe of the song were effectively complete. The catchy arrangement and on-the-nose country twang of the title and chorus eventually sent \u201cJohn Cougar\u201d to the second spot on Billboard\u2019s U.S. Country Airplay chart.This is the work of the modern session drummer, and it is why, when a major-label project needs drums, Chamberlain is often the first person producers call. When we met in Los Angeles in February, he posed his value proposition as a question: \u201cWhat can you add to a situation that\u2019s totally out of context but works?\u201d Chamberlain is good enough at playing his instruments \u2014 and at reading what producers and artists want \u2014 that they\u2019re willing to pay him well to make that kind of determination for them. And so he lives at an odd intersection, or perhaps a vanishing point; part virtuoso whose skills have never been more relevant, part John Henry figure, hammering away as music is increasingly composed and performed by machines.\u201cI do more and more work out of my studio because nobody has a budget anymore,\u201d he told me. \u201cThe Keith Urbans of the world can fly me to the studio because people still go to Walmart and buy country records.\u201d For the people who can\u2019t afford to fly him out, Chamberlain offers his services remotely from Van Nuys. He has a full recording studio set up: a control room stocked with vintage gear and a large soundproof tracking room where two drum kits sit miked and ready to go. There are drums everywhere, more than anybody should rightly own, stacked on top of each other and hanging from racks: multiple rock kits, a Brazilian pandeiro, Tibetan bells, a 40-gallon oil can rigged with a spring that Chamberlain pounded with evident joy and a built-in cupboard with 20 slots for different snares, each of which is filled. He has a vintage Ludwig Supraphonic (\u201cWhat John Bonham would have played\u201d), a 1930s Slingerland Radio King (\u201cFat and dead\u201d), a 1900s snare with a calfskin head. As he finished giving me a tour, he said: \u201cYou know sample libraries? These are the physical versions of the samples.\u201dWhen I stopped by, Chamberlain was tracking drums for a British singer named Hattie Webb. The first track had some programmed electronic drums already attached as a guide; Webb\u2019s producer had asked Chamberlain, via email, to \u201cbuild it, make it electronic-y with some acoustic elements.\u201d Chamberlain listened to the song twice, charting out its structure on a legal pad, and then he went into the tracking room, where he had a little setup that he called his \u201celectronic/analog kit\u201d \u2014 a small kick drum, a tiny snare that he had purpose-made for work like this and a cymbal with holes in it to sharpen the sound.He cued up the track and then, without any practice, played along with it, sounding so much like the programming that it was almost hard to believe it could be a live performance. And yet his playing also ebbed and flowed in ways that the programmed drums didn\u2019t, or couldn\u2019t. After that single immaculate take, Chamberlain returned to the control room, listened for about 30 seconds and said, \u201cThat sounds cool.\u201d He then set about making a drum loop to go along with the part he had just played. Within an hour or two, the track acquired shaker, tambourine and four flourish-filled runs on a full drum kit, just to give the production team some different options.Chamberlain is an elegant player; no movement is wasted. He plays with a traditional underhand grip, which is more often associated with jazz than rock. Sometimes, looking at him, you can\u2019t believe the range and sheer volume of sound he\u2019s producing. By 6:30 p.m., Chamberlain finished the second of the tracks Webb had sent to him and uploaded both to his Dropbox account to be accessed by the producers in England. Then he went home to make pasta with his wife.North Texas State (now the University of North Texas) accepted him into its music program on a scholarship, but he lasted less than a year. One of the percussion teachers threw a plastic piece of excrement at him while he was performing; another banged a gong in the middle of a piece and yelled, \u201cGo practice!\u201d It wasn\u2019t exactly the atmosphere he had imagined. \u201cI just wanted to play drums,\u201d he says. He didn\u2019t help matters by getting himself thrown out of his dorm for smoking pot. For a while he slept in his practice room with his head on the pillow in his kick drum.After he left school, Chamberlain moved to the Deep Ellum neighborhood of Dallas, about 40 miles away, where he played in several bands, often just for food or enough cash to put gas in his car. He eventually found himself living next door to Brad Houser, the bass player for Edie Brickell & New Bohemians, and after some problems with their original drummer during the recording of their first album, the band hired Chamberlain to tour with them. \u201cWhat I Am,\u201d the first single off \u201cShooting Rubberbands at the Stars,\u201d blew up so fast that his first major gig with the band outside Dallas was on \u201cSaturday Night Live.\u201d Chamberlain had just turned 21. He toured with Brickell for a couple of years and recorded a second record, \u201cGhost of a Dog,\u201d with the band, which broke up around the time Brickell married Paul Simon. (The band, without Chamberlain, has since reunited.)Chamberlain spent a summer touring with Pearl Jam, then returned to \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d as drummer for the house band \u2014 a job that for many musicians would be a career capper. TV gigs in general, and the \u201cS.N.L.\u201d gig in particular, offer the kind of steady, high-paying work that is pretty much impossible for musicians to find anywhere else. After a year, though, Chamberlain decided to move to Seattle. \u201cI had a whole house with a buddy of mine in a decent part of town, we could play music in it all day long and we each paid $250 rent,\u201d he told me, laughing. \u201cHow do you beat that?\u201dIn 1994, Chamberlain got a call from a little-known band called the Wallflowers, fronted by Bob Dylan\u2019s son Jakob. The band liked Chamberlain\u2019s drumming on \u201cGhost of a Dog\u201d and wondered if he\u2019d help them out in the studio. That work resulted in a single called \u201cOne Headlight\u201d that helped the band sell several million records. The Wallflowers\u2019 manager also represented a new and promising artist named Fiona Apple, and he asked if Chamberlain would play the drums for her too. Both albums \u201cdid really well,\u201d he told me, in characteristically understated fashion. \u201cSo that\u2019s kind of how you end up being a session musician. If you\u2019re not in a band, you\u2019re the guy who played on those records.\u201dChamberlain\u2019s network of producers and friends has continued to expand, and that\u2019s mostly how he gets his work. Over the last 15 years, he has played hundreds of sessions with some of music\u2019s biggest names, put out several side-project records and toured with Tori Amos and others whenever he could. A high-level studio musician in Los Angeles like Chamberlain can pull in as much as $2,000 for a day of work, though Chamberlain\u2019s rates fluctuate widely, depending on whom he\u2019s working with. He acknowledged that, with changes in the music business brought on by streaming and other technological innovations, \u201cthe herd is getting thinned\u201d in terms of the number of artists with sizable recording budgets. But demand for his services remains strong. In a poll to be published later this year, the readers of Modern Drummer have named him the best studio player in the business.Ryan Gruss, the Loop Loft\u2019s chief executive, showed me the sheet he had prepared for a previous session with the legendary drummer Omar Hakim, who has played for the likes of Michael Jackson, Madonna and Miles Davis. For Hakim, Gruss had typed out descriptions of beats and suggested tempos to go along with them, but there was no such list for Chamberlain. As an engineer got the kit sounding right in the control room, Chamberlain roamed over the drums and settled into a rhythm that Gruss liked. They set up a click track \u2014 a metronome that plays in Chamberlain\u2019s headphones \u2014 at the same tempo, then Chamberlain let loose for about five minutes, cycling through grooves, chorus feels, different patterns of the same basic beat.Over the next four hours, Chamberlain would roll through nine other grooves and five different setups, swapping out drums and cymbals in search of new sounds and textures. For one set of beats, he moved to the small \u201celectronic/analog kit\u201d and played it with Brazilian shakers instead of sticks. The 1900s snare with the calfskin head made an appearance and, somehow, sounded almost entirely synthetic and computerized, which Chamberlain hadn\u2019t anticipated. The Loop Loft team was happy just to sit back and watch, one of them muttering \u201cJesus\u201d under his breath whenever Chamberlain really let fly.\u201cI\u2019m a working musician,\u201d Chamberlain said to me at one point, with an emphasis on \u201cworking.\u201d Because he\u2019s not a songwriter or a member of a band, he doesn\u2019t get many residual checks or royalty payments \u2014 what musicians refer to as \u201cmailbox money.\u201d Even when times are good, he has to hustle. Sometimes he\u2019s in the studio with the Loop Loft; sometimes he\u2019s the guy Adele\u2019s producers call when she\u2019s writing in Los Angeles (for a track that didn\u2019t make her latest record); sometimes he\u2019s the guy the billionaire Paul Allen hires for a vanity rock project featuring, among other top-tier musicians, the Eagles guitarist Joe Walsh. (Sample song title: \u201cSix Strings From Hell.\u201d) Even on days off, Chamberlain goes into his studio and practices for a couple of hours.When the Loop Loft session was over, Chamberlain wandered in and out of the control room, packing up his gear for another recording stint with Keith Urban. This time the sessions would include the Welsh bassist Pino Palladino, one of the most respected players around. Instead of adding drums to a previously recorded track, Chamberlain would be playing live with Palladino in the studio. Chamberlain loves playing live above all else, for those moments when the music takes an inexplicable turn but somehow everybody stays together. No machine could match it. \u201cWith great musicians,\u201d he said, \u201cyou feel like you can\u2019t do anything wrong.\u201d \u2666A pop star claims a little time for herself.By Doreen St. F\u00e9lixMusical duets are usually ordered by heterosexual difference and its various dramas. As in: She gives, he takes. He pleads, she refuses. They may reconcile, but the performers always observe the classic sex distinction \u2014 making the circumstances of the female vocalist a good barometer for the circumstances of female speech in general.But Rihanna, pop\u2019s great maven of self-gratification, is a known loner, and she flouts that kind of reciprocal identity all the time. So it follows that even on her latest album\u2019s true duet, she would choose a vocal mirror, not a vocal foil. On \u201cConsideration,\u201d the first track on \u201cAnti,\u201d Rihanna and the genre-fluid singer SZA are two branches of the same river, braiding in and out. The women put on their respective versions of a placid attitude \u2014 Rihanna sings with cheek, SZA cheerlessly. Each is calm but, you suspect, coursing toward some possible furor. They sing into each other; their vocal registers match so closely that on first listen, you might even miss that Rihanna isn\u2019t singing by herself. The closeness approaches uncanny, suggests an erotics of the self. Rihanna\u2019s voice sinks into SZA\u2019s, which rises back into Rihanna\u2019s, the voices first crossing on these: \u201cWhy you ain\u2019t ever let me grow?/When I look outside my window/I can\u2019t get no peace of mind.\u201d If \u201dAnti\u201d has a thesis, it\u2019s this declaration of insolence.I almost used the usual expression \u2014 a \u201cdeclaration of independence.\u201d Then I remembered how secretive the two women sound, the complete disinterest the lyrics communicate. The way Rihanna likens herself to our most uncivil cultural child, Peter Pan: \u201cI came fluttering in from Neverland/Time can never stop me.\u201d I hear her indignation; I hear a clear defection from the typical girl-power conceit. \u201cConsideration\u201d could not care less about sounding like a feminist anthem in the proper way, one that telegraphs passive misandry in the service of forcing female communion. It\u2019s an anti-anthem, a song for the individual in a world full of cheap calls to solidarity \u2014 a misanthrope\u2019s chorus, built for people who would rather be alone, unseen and isolated from the work of being a girl. (\u201cWould you mind giving my reflection a break/from the pain it\u2019s feeling now?\u201d) Michael Jackson, long reviled for his identification with the boy Peter Pan, might have originated this kind of audacity, refusing to relate to society as much as society wanted to relate to him.Rihanna often returns to Barbados, the landmass that bore her. Like that island country, \u201cConsideration\u201d connects to nothing outside itself; it\u2019s a salve for those of us seeking mental and political quiet, an adult lullaby castigating the spectacle of public life. The song is haughtily against the \u201coutside\u201d; it invokes the private air of an enclosed room. I\u2019d like to stay inside, too, looking out the window, listening to the echo of my own voice. \u2666Riding a lo-fi sound to semifame.By John Wray\u201cI\u2019ll see discussions sometimes, on message boards online, about the sound I get from my guitar,\u201d Mac DeMarco said one overcast February afternoon as we drove around Far Rockaway, Queens. \u201cIt\u2019s kids, mostly, trying to figure it out: \u2018How does he get that freaky tone? What kind of pedals? What amp?\u2019\u201d He turned to me and grinned, showing the gap between his teeth. \u201cWhat they don\u2019t realize is that the guitar I\u2019ve played since I was 16 is a no-name piece of garbage that I bought at a pawnshop for about 30 bucks. It\u2019s got a loose neck, its pickup magnet is broken into tiny pieces and the pick guard is a piece of siding that I got from my Hasidic neighbor\u2019s house in Montreal.\u201d He laughed. \u201cFor a while there were bugs living in it. Actual bugs. It was cute.\u201dWe were driving along Rockaway Beach Boulevard in a borrowed car, because DeMarco\u2019s station wagon wouldn\u2019t start. At the owner\u2019s request, DeMarco was grading the CDs in the glove compartment with a pen: B+ for Morrissey, C- for Belle and Sebastian, an enthusiastic A+ for the Grateful Dead. \u201cMy life is stupid right now,\u201d he told me. \u201cI put a pair of my sneakers on eBay a while ago \u2014 partly to raise money for this girls\u2019 rock camp in Brooklyn, but mostly just as a joke \u2014 and some dude pushed the bidding up to 21 grand.\u201d He grinned again. \u201cIt turned out he didn\u2019t have the money, because he was, like, 13 years old. But that\u2019s still pretty sick.\u201dGiven the turn DeMarco\u2019s career has taken, his attitude of giddy disbelief makes perfect sense. In the course of four albums in as many years \u2014 \u201cRock and Roll Night Club,\u201d \u201c2,\u201d \u201cSalad Days\u201d and \u201cAnother One,\u201d all released by the pint-size Brooklyn label Captured Tracks \u2014 DeMarco has progressed from quasi squatter to bona fide indie-rock star, playing sold-out shows from New York to Los Angeles and basking in a degree of Internet fame that he finds hard to comprehend. In \u201cBacker,\u201d a bleakly hilarious clip, featuring none of his music whatsoever, DeMarco impersonates a depressed loser from Edmonton who guides cars into parking spots for a living. It has received around 400,000 views on YouTube. \u201cSalad Days,\u201d his 2014 breakout album, has been played more than five million times on YouTube, more than the Wu-Tang Clan album \u201cA Better Tomorrow,\u201d released the same year. DeMarco\u2019s brand of fame, however, is far from the rarefied, untouchable variety that stars like the RZA or Jack White enjoy: The more famous DeMarco gets, the more accessible he seems to become. \u201cKids think of me as a guy who\u2019d hang out with them and actually enjoy myself,\u201d he told me. \u201cAnd they\u2019re basically right.\u201dThe house he rents in Arverne, Queens, is an unprepossessing four-bedroom cottage in a lower-middle-class neighborhood, with cigarette butts peppering the lawn. When I rang his bell, he came to the door in boxers and a rumpled Hugo Boss T-shirt, greeted me with slightly bleary-eyed politeness, then led me past guitar cases and piles of laundry and a cluster of half-inflated party balloons to the kitchen, where Kiera McNally, his girlfriend of five years, was baking gluten-free banana bread. Over a cup of diner-style coffee \u2014 from an industrial steady-drip machine that DeMarco pointed out to me with pride \u2014 I asked what the repercussions of inviting hundreds of thousands of fans to his house had been.\u201cIt\u2019s cold outside now, so it isn\u2019t too bad,\u201d DeMarco said. \u201cRight after the EP came out, in August, we were averaging maybe 50 kids a day.\u201d He glanced toward McNally, who was diplomatically focusing on the banana bread. \u201cThe only thing that bugged me about it, personally, was the feeling I got that some of them hadn\u2019t even heard my music. I\u2019m basically a meme to a lot of these kids. It can get a bit weird.\u201dThe music DeMarco makes has been enthusiastically received by critics, but reviews of his albums can be frustrating to read: They tend to lean heavily on labels like \u201cslacker rock,\u201d \u201cchill wave\u201d and \u201cblue wave,\u201d to name only a few. \u201cWhat the hell does \u2018blue wave\u2019 even mean?\u201d DeMarco said. \u201cI have no idea.\u201dThe first song of his that I heard, \u201cBlue Boy,\u201d from \u201cSalad Days,\u201d is a bright, airy trifle, almost a lullaby, in which heartfelt advice to an insecure friend \u2014 \u201cNo use acting so tough/come down, sweetheart, and grow up\u201d \u2014 is subtly undercut by the ever-so-slightly camp vocals and even more so by the lead guitar, which seems to drift woozily in and out of tune. King Sunny Ade came to mind as I listened, as did Jerry Garcia, an acknowledged influence, but I found it nearly impossible to pin down the music I was hearing, or even to date it. Like many of DeMarco\u2019s best songs, \u201cBlue Boy\u201d sounds like the work of someone who spent his formative years combing through record-store bargain bins, carefully discarding anything that might conceivably be characterized as tasteful. It\u2019s an approach that has yielded dividends for musicians in the Internet age before \u2014 Washed Out comes to mind, as does Ariel Pink \u2014 but none of those artists\u2019 albums can claim five million YouTube plays.The family has musicians on both sides: a lyric soprano, a jazz saxophonist, an uncle who lives in London and sings standards. Agnes herself had a stint, as a teenager, singing at parties and weddings around Edmonton.At 16, Mac started recording songs in his room, by himself \u2014 the way he still records all his music \u2014 and playing in a band called Belgium with two friends from high school, Alec Meen and Peter Sagar. \u201cWe were trying to sound melodic and indie, like Pavement or Dinosaur Jr., even though all I knew how to play were Jeff Beck-style blues riffs,\u201d he told me. \u201cThey kept the band going after I moved to Vancouver, which was fine with me; it was pretty much their thing, anyway. I always hated the name Belgium.\u201dIn Vancouver, where he lived for a time in the boiler room of a printmaking studio for 200 Canadian dollars a month, DeMarco continued recording songs, posting them on Myspace under the name Makeout Videotape. \u201cThe first time you\u2019re out somewhere and some guy comes up to you and says: \u2018I heard that song you put up online. Pretty cool,\u2019 it\u2019s the weirdest thing,\u201d he told me, shaking his head. \u201cI got to be part of a scene that had started around this club called the Emergency Room, with bands who were already touring in the U.S. They were all these great, noisy, lo-fi bands, and I halfway fit in, mainly because I had no idea how to record. But I was trying to write Beatles songs the whole time.\u201dWhile performing at a music festival in Calgary, DeMarco reconnected with McNally, whom he knew in high school, and within the year they moved to Montreal together. \u201cWe had a hard time in Montreal,\u201d he told me. \u201cI worked the night shift at this cheap grocery store called Segal\u2019s, a 50-cents-for-a-wheel-of-brie kind of place.\u201d The job at Segal\u2019s, joyless though it was, provided a pivotal ingredient in his evolving aesthetic: a daily dose of schmaltzy classic rock. \u201cHearing that kind of music all the time \u2014 Dire Straits, Toto, Van Halen \u2014 it affected me,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can either embrace that stuff or let it drive you insane.\u201d He paused for a moment. \u201cTo tell you the truth, I\u2019m not a big Dire Straits fan, even now. But I found something in those songs that I could use.\u201dAfter a barely perceptible hesitation, he played the songs gently, sincerely and with a devotion and skill that were never entirely obscured by the grin on his face or the jokes he cracked. (\u201cA D.U.I.? I don\u2019t think so. I take a helicopter to work. I\u2019m Billy Joel!\u201d) Before his third and final song \u2014 \u201cStill Together,\u201d the closing track on \u201c2\u201d \u2014 he brought McNally out onstage to join him, beaming like a schoolboy, and kissed her lovingly but chastely on the cheek. I was reminded, watching them together, of something DeMarco told me on our drive. \u201cGrowing up in Edmonton, the horizon is so far away, you don\u2019t even realize it\u2019s there,\u201d he said. \u201cThis might all be over in six months, but there\u2019s nothing wrong with my life now. Not a thing.\u201d He nodded to himself for a moment. \u201cThe only thing I\u2019ve got to do is fix my car.\u201d \u2666Let\u2019s get it on. Or not.By Jia TolentinoCharlie Puth\u2019s brand is blandness: he\u2019s a pop star for the age of sponsored content. A fresh-faced, vanilla-flavored, Berklee-trained 24-year-old, Puth landed three singles on Top 40 radio in the year before he released his 2016 debut album, \u201cNine Track Mind.\u201d His style is marked by retro aesthetics and an almost haunting level of glibness, as encapsulated by his first single, the recent radio smash \u201cMarvin Gaye.\u201dYou may think you\u2019ve never heard \u201cMarvin Gaye,\u201d but it\u2019s possible you just haven\u2019t listened to it. It\u2019s a song that tends to register via alternate senses, a clamminess on the nape of your neck or a cloying taste, like children\u2019s cough syrup, in the back of your mouth. The platinum-selling doo-wop duet features the artist Meghan Trainor (who, like Puth, has thus far used her considerable songwriting talent to create songs so depthless they feel like waxworks).It\u2019s a song about sex that induces not lust but a feeling of desolation. \u201cLet\u2019s Marvin Gaye and get it on,\u201d sing Puth and Trainor brightly. \u201cYou got that healing that I want. Just like they say it in the song: until the dawn, let\u2019s Marvin Gaye and get it on.\u201dThe chorus feels like a bouncy castle inflated with hot air and ghosts, but in a technical sense, it\u2019s perfect. Its phrasing follows the classic AABA doo-wop format, and its four-chord progression (I, vi, IV, V) is emblematic of the genre: These are the ice-cream chords of \u201cHeart and Soul,\u201d \u201cBlue Moon\u201d and \u201cPlease Mr. Postman.\u201d Tweaked, the same progression can take on depth and winsomeness \u2014 with a 7th thrown in, you get \u201cUnchained Melody\u201d and with a 9th, \u201cEvery Breath You Take.\u201d But with the exception of a verse that has Trainor singing over a beat Puth describes (inaccurately) as a \u201chard-ass distorted 808\u201d drum machine, the track replicates the late \u201950s with unimaginative servility. Sonically, it lives a decade and a half before the song it\u2019s referencing; Marvin Gaye released \u201cLet\u2019s Get It On\u201d in 1973.In 1965, Gaye recalled to his biographer, he was listening to one of his songs playing on the radio when it was interrupted by a news bulletin about the riots in Watts. \u201cWith the world exploding around me, how am I supposed to keep singing love songs?\u201d No such scruples trouble Puth, who wrote his track as a \u201cmusical icebreaker,\u201d he told Billboard. \u201cIf you hear it on the radio or at a bar, it\u2019s a way to say: \u2018Hey! Let\u2019s Marvin Gaye and get it on.\u2019\u201d And so \u201cMarvin Gaye\u201d got its new use and meaning as a pickup line, dreamed up by an artist whose means is glibness and end is comfort, who can\u2019t imagine the fight that Gaye\u2019s love was built on, who sings about sex as if it\u2019s his due rather than a port of call in a storm. \u2666Who gets to say how black people see themselves?By Marlon James \u201cButterfly\u201d arrived at an unprecedented moment in pop. Black artists, as they conquered the mainstream, were getting even blacker. Kanye might have gotten there first (at least he probably thinks so) with \u201cNew Slaves\u201d and \u201cBlack Skinhead,\u201d and now even Beyonc\u00e9 is place-checking New Orleans and image-checking the Black Panthers. But Kanye was still speaking to the white gaze, the hatred and desire in it, and taking revenge by getting all black-sex-machine on somebody\u2019s white wife. \u201cButterfly\u201d is instead Toni Morrison circa \u201cSula\u201d: not looking outside for either validation or opposition. Black love, black empowerment, black history and black wisdom are explored so deeply and intelligently that you assume that conservative media fetish, black-on-black crime, will never show up. But then, in the third verse of \u201cThe Blacker the Berry,\u201d when Kendrick is waxing lyrical on Trayvon Martin\u2019s death, it does. All of a sudden \u201cBlacker\u201d becomes a song about black accountability while black men are being murdered and the implausible logic of slamming two ideas into the same thought. I was right there with him until that third verse.You can\u2019t be a hip-hop head and not be hit by \u201cThe Blacker the Berry.\u201d It brings the boom-bap from the get-go, dropping funk on the one, like an update of the drum break that opens NWA\u2019s album \u201cStraight Outta Compton.\u201d And even though I was tired of people\u2019s mapping anger onto blackness, Lamar\u2019s detonation of rage and wit was (and is) unmatched in hip-hop. He grabs at stereotypes as if they\u2019re slipping out of his fingers (\u201cMy hair is nappy,\u201d he says. \u201cMy nose is round and wide\u201d) and throws them right back at whoever would deploy them. He\u2019s not even rapping so much as spitting fire, jumping on a line, retracing it, firing it back at you, like the boxer Jack Johnson when he said: \u201cI\u2019m black, they never let me forget it. I\u2019m black, all right, I\u2019ll never let them forget it.\u201d Kendrick fuels his \u201cI\u2019m black\u201d with the knowledge that ain\u2019t a damn thing changed. He leaves it to the Jamaican DJ Assassin to bring backup in the chorus, drawing the line from plantation to street corner and the switch in who controls black self-determination, from the \u201cwhips left scars \u2019pon me back\u201d to the \u201cthe big whip parked \u2019pon the block.\u201dThe last couplet on the second verse echoes the first, with a crucial change: \u201cYou sabotage my community, makin\u2019 a killin\u2019/you made me a killer,\u201d turns into, \u201cHow can I tell you I\u2019m making a killin\u2019?/You made me a killer\u201d \u2014 and the different spin on \u201ckilling\u201d weighs a ton. In the first instance, exploitation and indifference make him a killer. In the second, his success comes from America\u2019s obsession with his assuming he looks like one. It was almost unbearable to anticipate what this prophet of rage was going to drop next.And then he dropped it.I could feel the verse pulling away from me as soon as he got halfway into it. It turned into call-and-response, me and this third verse, which went a little something like this:\u201cIt\u2019s funny how Zulu and Xhosa might go to war. ...Remind me of these Compton Crip gangs that live next door.\u201dMe: Hold up, K-dot, what is this you\u2019re dropping? No, dude, those are two nations going to war. And fine, war is hell, but if Britain and France aren\u2019t called thugs for Waterloo, if Lancaster and York aren\u2019t called bangers despite literally being family killing family, then why do Zulu vs. Xhosa get compared to gang warfare? Because it weakened them both in the face of the real enemy? Either all war is hell, or all war is thuggery. I\u2019m fine with either, but not with a special distinction when Africans do it.Kendrick continues:\u201cSo don\u2019t matter how much I say I like to preach with the PanthersOr tell Georgia State \u2018Marcus Garvey got all the answers\u2019Or try to celebrate February like it\u2019s my B-DayOr eat watermelon, chicken and Kool-Aid on weekdaysOr jump high enough to get Michael Jordan endorsementsOr watch BET cause urban support is importantSo why did I weep when Trayvon Martin was in the streetWhen gangbanging make me kill a nigga blacker than me?Hypocrite!\u201dMe: No, brother, no! Here was a black man invoking the detestable slogan of black-on-black crime to prevent himself from mourning the unjustifiable homicide of a black boy by a Neighborhood Watch vigilante. All I could think was: Where the hell was Kendrick going?\u201cWhat happened to [Michael Brown] should\u2019ve never happened,\u201d he said. \u201cNever. But when we don\u2019t have respect for ourselves, how do we expect them to respect us? It starts from within. Don\u2019t start with just a rally, don\u2019t start from looting. It starts from within.\u201dKendrick wasn\u2019t the first, and he won\u2019t be the last, to make the statement that black deaths are in some way blacks\u2019 fault and that black lives might be a matter of personal responsibility, right down to clothing choice. The idea that a sudden dose of self-respect is part of what is needed to stop the police from killing us is not only ludicrous \u2014 Amadou Diallo wasn\u2019t a gangbanger, but he was shot at 41 times anyway; I think we can assume that the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. had it all right within, but that didn\u2019t protect him from being brutalized by all sorts of authority, nor did his dressing impeccably prevent him from arrest \u2014 it is also old. It\u2019s a belief that the black person has a role to play in the erasure of hate toward herself. That kind of thinking almost suggests that racism makes sense.But racism makes no sense. It is perverse and aberrant yet such a constituent part of the American make up, so normalized in all its forms, that it\u2019s no surprise that the black person would scramble for answers as to why it exists. And in scrambling for answers, you look everywhere, even within: Did I do something to bring this on? Was a part of this outcome in even the slightest way my fault?Fact is, black people have always believed in respectability politics. It\u2019s also at the core of the non-American black\u2019s perspective on race, and I should know, because as a non-American black, I\u2019ve traded in that belief for years. It\u2019s particularly acute with us Jamaicans. Our stories are everywhere: How despite racism, or rather the black American\u2019s self-destructive perception of it, we worked hard to excel and gain respect. We achieved. Everybody knows how hard we Jamaicans work. That\u2019s why I have that job and you, black American, do not. Maybe you should stop whining about your troubles and own up to your laziness. Maybe if you do what I did, you would be manager of that Chase branch on the corner, just like me.Bootstrappism is the chocolate echo of white racism. You can find it in black self-help and how-I-became-a-millionaire books. Prince with \u201cAmerica,\u201d Ice Cube with \u201cLook Who\u2019s Burning.\u201d Lauryn Hill berating black girls who get hair weaves to look like Europeans. Nearly every time Steve Harvey addresses black people. President Barack Obama telling Morehouse College students at their 2013 commencement that there\u2019s \u201cno time for excuses,\u201d a lesson that the fact of their existence proved they didn\u2019t need. It\u2019s a road that leads to the granddaddy of the bootstrap, Bill Cosby, who declared in a 2004 speech that black kids were being shot because they were going around stealing Coca-Cola and poundcake.But Kendrick\u2019s conclusion is far more sophisticated than anything Cosby has ever said. In fact, it\u2019s not a conclusion at all. It was Kendrick doing what he does better than anybody else: complicating a discussion at exactly the point where everybody, including me, tries to simplify it. And this is what he was aiming for all along, questioning what even many black people would never dare question, arguing that yes, every argument, even this one, has two sides. More sides. Adding layers we might need but don\u2019t want. And that\u2019s what he did next, not on wax, but on MTV.\u201cKnow who I am first,\u201d he said. And then he said more than that:\u201cWhen I say, \u2018Gangbanging made me kill a nigga blacker than me,\u2019 this is my life that I\u2019m talking about. I\u2019m not saying you; you might not even be from the streets. I\u2019m not speaking to the community, I\u2019m not speaking of the community,\u201d he continued. \u201cI am the community.\u201dFast-forward to near the end of 2015, and I\u2019m on a flight to New York. Thirty thousand feet above everything, I put on \u201cButterfly,\u201d and something that never happened before happens. This incredible clarity, as if I\u2019d been listening to the soul brother all year but only now was finally hearing him. And then I got to that song, No. 13, the sticking point, the one reason I hadn\u2019t been able to join the best-of-the-year showering of praise, and I realized something that felt sudden yet inevitable. That this song, with its booming beat, the loudest on the record, that seemed to herald it as some global political statement, was in fact Kendrick\u2019s most deeply personal. Almost implosive. That the moment wasn\u2019t about we at all, it just sounded that way. It\u2019s his most \u201cI\u201d moment, reflecting a reality that I couldn\u2019t possibly connect to, only witness and try to understand. It\u2019s as personal as Ice Cube\u2019s \u201cDead Homiez.\u201d He\u2019s not speaking to the community or for the community. He\u2019s speaking for himself or, rather, a version of himself. The smarter me looked in the mirror and asked: \u201cWell, who\u2019s the one playing representational politics here? Who is the one expecting the black man to be Everyman, black man to reflect the universal good will, or at the very least a carefully curated black rage directed at a carefully identified target?\u201dHip-hop has always been about spinning clever fictions, doing what great narratives do: inventing stories that tell the real truth. But post-Biggie and Tupac, it\u2019s so easy to fall hard for hip-hop\u2019s insistence on keeping it real that I\u2019m surprised how easily I still fall for it, thinking that \u201cButterfly\u201d is either confessional or reportage, when it\u2019s neither. We do this over and over, judging artists of color based on a warped idea that legitimacy can come only from experience. You would think I would know better, given that as a novelist, I deal with the same assumption in nearly every interview. One journalist even congratulated me for escaping the ghetto through \u201cthe power of the pen and not the gun.\u201dMy last novel was about Jamaican gang members manipulated by politicians into an attempt on Bob Marley\u2019s life. Young men, murderers before 15, murdered before 18. Nearly everybody assumed that I had experienced some of this. In fact, the first time I heard a live gunshot was watching Martin McDonagh\u2019s play \u201cA Behanding in Spokane.\u201d And once each interviewer was convinced that there was no blood on my hands, then came the skepticism, the disbelief, the doubting: By what authority was I telling these stories? As if knowledge, talent and imagination weren\u2019t enough for a writer of color to make art; as if a work of art can\u2019t be personal and fictitious at the same time, invented and meaningful.And here I was doing the same thing to Kendrick. He was just a man wondering how someone gets to be part of the Black Lives Matter conversation when black lives don\u2019t matter to him. How someone can feel rage at murder while being fine with suicide. He was exploring these themes as concepts \u2014 you know, that thing that artists do. He was posing tricky, difficult questions, for which there were no answers, getting into the middle of his song, feeling it, breathing it, but still inventing. I wonder how much of what I thought my problem was with \u201cThe Blacker the Berry\u201d stemmed from me doing what is still being done to me: Questioning the black gaze, assuming that it must have sprung from something other than the storyteller\u2019s gift. That it must be autobiography or documentary. I\u2019ve never listened to Radiohead\u2019s \u201cA Wolf at the Door\u201d and wondered if Thom Yorke ever paid ransom money for his kidnapped children. Or thought Johnny Cash ever murdered anybody or knew anyone who did. Just like those songs, \u201cThe Blacker the Berry\u201d is several things at once, but mostly, at its essence, it\u2019s just that thing we call art. \u2666Rap and politics, inseparable as ever.By Bijan StephenRap is rooted as much in place and time as it is in rhythm and bass; it\u2019s hyperlocal and organic, if not always cage-free. (Free Max B!) You can tell a song\u2019s provenance from its sound; you can hear what was happening when the record was pressed. A cultural ferment, frozen in amber.Killer Mike & El-P, a.k.a. Run the Jewels, continue to push boundaries with their latest music video. Watch it in virtual reality. Download our NYT VR app.Earlier on the album, on \u201cClose Your Eyes,\u201d Killer Mike, El-P and Zack de la Rocha \u2014 former frontman of Rage Against the Machine \u2014 rap about a prison riot. Listening makes the blood rush to your cheeks, your heartbeat pulse behind your eyes. The value of the album is held between those two songs: It captures the variegated sides of black life in America and its specific feeling, a dizzying mix of frustrated helplessness and joyous survival.Perhaps it\u2019s not surprising that the group\u2019s aesthetic choices are very Public Enemy, which is to say, pretty \u201cretro.\u201d Public Enemy was among the first acts to grasp that for all its durability as an art form, rap is inescapably tied to the black experience. It\u2019s always political, because to live as a black person in America is to be politicized. Run the Jewels gets this. If you listen closely, through their artful grandstanding, you can hear a radical politics. Which is another way of saying the truth; listen, and hear the world change. \u2666A sound like the music on a holistic-medicine website \u2014 but cool.By Max ReadIt used to be, if you wanted to vibrate at the same frequency as the Mayan spacemen, you needed to move to a Southwestern city that specialized in horse art. It used to be, if you wanted your aura photographed, you had to go to a cramped Chinatown crystal shop. These days, there\u2019s a boutique around the corner from my apartment in Brooklyn with a pop-up aura-photography tepee. On a whim, I went to have my aura\u2019s picture taken, only to learn the photographer was fully booked days in advance. New Age is back, and turning up where you wouldn\u2019t have expected it a few years ago \u2014 in places where the young and culturally sophisticated congregate. Places that are, for lack of a better word, hip.It used to be, if you bought an album from a small Vancouver electronic-music label, you could expect some kind of weird minimal techno. These days? You get CFCF\u2019s \u201cThe Colours of Life,\u201d a 40-minute instrumental suite that layers airy synths, noodling guitars, marimbas and, God help us, panpipes over simple, propulsive rhythms. You could talk about it in terms of record-nerd touchstones \u2014 \u201cThe Colours of Life\u201d sounds a bit like the minimalist composer Steve Reich in places, or the Krautrock god Manuel G\u00f6ttsching in others \u2014 but really, it sounds as if it should be advertised on basic cable with stock footage of candles. Or like a cassette tape you would buy from a bookstore with an entire section devoted to \u201cAngels.\u201d Or like seduction music played by a barefoot European man with a soul patch. Do you catch my drift? It\u2019s cool, but it sounds as if it were recorded using a dreamcatcher as a pop filter. It sounds like the music for a 40-minute director\u2019s cut of an airline commercial. It sounds like a poster of a wolf. It sounds like a hologram sticker of a dolphin. It sounds like a tattoo of an open eye. It sounds like the font Papyrus. It\u2019s also really, really good.The assumption always seems to be that the New Age revival is weird, if not insincere in some unspecified, \u201cironic\u201d way. Why would urban-dwelling gentrified-Brooklyn types embrace the atavistic philosophies of conspiracy theorists and mononymous zither players? One answer is that this is how cool works: Things that used to be uncool become cool, and vice versa.But I think maybe it\u2019s the wrong question in the first place. We live in an age of aggressive positivism, a world overtaken by metrics and markets. To accuse New Age revivalism of insincerity \u2014 reducing the possibilities of belief to a binary \u2014 is to miss the point. The gentle woo-woo spirituality of New Age is attractive because it refuses the grinding realities of life spent in the shadow of Wall Street and Hollywood and Silicon Valley. Why wouldn\u2019t people overwhelmed by a slick and well-capitalized culture machine seek their pleasure in something defiantly corny? You can lie, and you can cook the books, but you can\u2019t fake a vibe. If a 40-minute New Age symphony can make you feel good \u2014 instead of harried or judged or pandered to \u2014 why should you care that it sounds like the soundtrack to a 1980s nature documentary? \u2666Is Coldplay bland? The future won\u2019t care.By Jeremy GordonA band that signs up to play the Super Bowl halftime show is making a declaration of immense confidence in its ability to hold a spotlight. It would seem contradictory for that band to then immediately cede that spotlight, but that\u2019s just what Coldplay did. They were contracted as the headliners at this year\u2019s game, but they wisely let Beyonc\u00e9 and Bruno Mars \u2014 both infinitely more charismatic \u2014 take control. As those two stars hit the stage, ready to trade hits and dance moves, the band\u2019s singer, Chris Martin, clung to the background, as if worried he might burst into flames if everyone appeared in the same frame.Coldplay\u2019s deference masks a steady success: For nearly two decades, they\u2019ve written a great many memorable songs, combining earnest Hallmark sentiments with anthemic melodies, worming their way into impressionable hearts and onto the charts. They\u2019re successors to U2, another band that crystallized the ineffable grandeur of the human experience into countless four-minute, radio-ready rock songs. Millions of Super Bowl viewers knew what it meant when Martin sat down at his piano, preparing to bang out the opening chords to \u201cClocks.\u201d As the rapper Future put it in a widely circulated tweet: \u201c#Coldplay legendary forever.\u201dThis brand of wide-screen pop attracts easy put-downs: edgeless, corny, white. But music has never lacked anodyne cornballs who didn\u2019t get their props until years later. Phil Collins used to symbolize the worst of slick \u201980s excess, but over time he has been recognized for his pop craftsmanship and technical innovations (especially the big drum sounds \u2014 you know, that fill in the middle of \u201cIn the Air Tonight\u201d \u2014 that blew a million rappers\u2019 minds). Jokes about how mawkish he seemed in the \u201980s are increasingly irrelevant to young people, who can care only so much about what anything seemed like before they were born.This is likely to be Coldplay\u2019s trajectory, too. Like Phil Collins, Michael McDonald, Abba or any number of desperately unhip artists, their \u201cimage\u201d will evaporate, while their songs will weather the years. In 2009, the Brooklyn band Grizzly Bear conscripted McDonald to sing a version of one of their singles, \u201cWhile You Wait for the Others,\u201d at the peak of their own rarified cool. Chris Martin might be asked to fill a similar role for tomorrow\u2019s Grizzly Bear. Imagine it: Sincerity will once again be on its way out of music, only for a familiar and tender voice to ring throughout the future blogosphere. Because when it\u2019s no longer certain what\u2019s cool, what will be more comforting than an elder statesman who never worried about it to begin with?A few weeks before the Super Bowl, Coldplay and Beyonc\u00e9 released a music video for \u201cHymn for the Weekend,\u201d a collaboration from the band\u2019s most recent and potentially final album. High-profile pop songs like this are conceived as nothing less than events, ready to be performed at mega-happenings like the Super Bowl halftime show. The actual Super Bowl halftime show featured both Coldplay and Beyonc\u00e9 but not the song. Martin said \u201cHymn\u201d was too new and wouldn\u2019t have been \u201cquite right.\u201dWhat his audience wanted was the warmth of familiarity. They wanted \u201cClocks.\u201d The live performance would have been an event, but Martin knows there will be plenty of opportunities in the future. The band is built to endure. \u2666Jeremy Gordon is deputy news editor for Pitchfork.Yes, darling, but is it feminist?By Jamie Lauren KeilesAs good-and-evil Christian morality falls out of fashion among the women in my social universe, a new binary has arisen to organize our outlook. In the heavens, there is all that is feminist: Beyonc\u00e9 singles, the selfie, menstruation ads on the subway and the dream of a woman in the White House. In hell, there is everything else. There are no nonbelievers, and there is no limbo. As new things come into being, we sort them accordingly by asking ourselves, \u201cIs this feminist?\u201dBy June 2015, Fetty Wap\u2019s \u201cTrap Queen\u201d had already claimed its place as the hot song of the summer. Beyond just the pleasures of a classic party anthem \u2014 an infectious hook, synth chords to ramp up your heart rate \u2014 the song offers an American love story for the ages. Fetty is a drug dealer weak-kneed for the girl who can match his hustle. When he cooks crack, she cooks crack with him. When he dreams of Lamborghinis, he dreams in matching pairs. Fetty\u2019s queen doesn\u2019t ride in the passenger seat. The couple make money together, and they spend it together too \u2014 at strip clubs, on weed, on gifts for each other. It\u2019s a vision of a love we can believe in, even outside the dreamland bubble of a rom-com plot. What could be more romantic than two equals teaming up to build their fantasy in a difficult and unjust world?For a summer, \u201cTrap Queen\u201d was everywhere. It would ultimately spend 25 weeks in Billboard\u2019s Top 3. We sang about cooking crack with our babies in the aisles of Duane Reade and on the dance floors of bat mitzvahs. Like Fetty himself, we landed seasonal crushes with \u201cHey, what\u2019s up? Hello!\u201d as our deceptively simple opening line. Rattling trap snares drowned out the sound of ice-cream-truck jingles, and summertime was better for it. But eventually it came time to ask the inevitable: Is \u201cTrap Queen\u201d feminist?I wonder about the purpose of this exercise. Why, in order for \u201cTrap Queen\u201d to be good, must we find a way to wedge it inside the narrow boundaries of white women\u2019s feminism? Is it not good enough on its own? Feminism and \u201cTrap Queen\u201d both spent the last year exploding ever further into the mainstream, and in both cases, we\u2019re still struggling to nail down exactly what they mean. Is the gutted, feel-good pop feminism of that Bustle post the same one that moves a panel of black women to declare Fetty Wap a feminist? Or perhaps the more important question is this: If \u201cTrap Queen\u201d is declared feminist in one system, does it suddenly belong to all feminists, regardless of race, of class or of circumstance?In the year that conversations about identity finally entered the small-talk realm of white folks, we seem to have lost sight of the fact that not everything is created for us \u2014 not even all feminist things. Identity politics is not always about identifying. \u201cTrap Queen\u201d is an immaculate song \u2014 a compelling love story and a true club banger. Perhaps, in the future, we can find a way to say so without needing to claim it for ourselves. \u2666A magnificently cheesy ballad that we\u2019ll never stop listening to.By Jody RosenLionel Richie\u2019s \u201cHello\u201d begins discreetly, almost sneakily, floating a sour little synthesizer melody over tiptoeing piano chords. The song crept into the collective consciousness in similarly stealthy fashion. It arrived in late 1983, buried on Richie\u2019s \u201cCan\u2019t Slow Down,\u201d the second solo album by the former Commodores singer. Reviewers took little notice of \u201dHello\u201d; Richie was ambivalent, cutting the song from \u201cCan\u2019t Slow Down\u201d at one point during the recording sessions before reinstating it. But when \u201cHello\u201d was released as a single in February 1984, it shot to No.1 on Billboard\u2019s Hot 100 and topped charts across the globe.In the decades since, \u201cHello\u201d has never said goodbye. It\u2019s one of those adult-contemporary ballads that has taken up residency in the ether, seeping from the walls of dentists\u2019 offices and tinkling on the phone line while you await a customer-service representative. It\u2019s a song, in other words, that has been judged soothing and innocuous enough to serve as Muzak \u2014 not necessarily an insult, but definitely a misapprehension of the fearsome beast that \u201cHello\u201d is. The song\u2019s narrator is a lovelorn weirdo who is both hapless \u2014 \u201cTell me how to win your heart/For I haven\u2019t got a clue/But let me start by saying/\u2018I love you\u2019\u201d \u2014 and vaguely sinister. The refrain, \u201cHello? Is it me you\u2019re looking for?\u201d sounds benign, but in the video, a dazed-looking Richie stalks the halls of an art school, mooning over a blind sculptor at least 15 years his junior.The revival of \u201dHello\u201d is a curiosity \u2014 a piece of pop flotsam borne back into the mainstream by the Internet\u2019s swirling surf. But it\u2019s also a testament to the magnetism of Lionel Richie, 66, a more durable presence, and a finer musician, than many have cared to admit. The meme-ing of \u201dHello\u201d has coincided with a wider Richie resurgence. \u201cTuskegee\u201d (2012), Richie\u2019s 10th studio album, was a surprise hit that paired the singer with country stars in new renditions of \u201dEasy,\u201d \u201cSay You, Say Me\u201d and other chestnuts. Richie has spent several years barnstorming arenas, quietly re-emerging as a top-grossing touring act. Last June, he played the Glastonbury music festival in England, drawing raves and a crowd of nearly 200,000, the festival\u2019s largest.Back in the \u201980s, I had mixed feelings about Richie: affection for his inescapable hits and regard for his craftsmanship, tinged with disdain I had absorbed from rock critics. He had been the Commodores\u2019 resident softy, the maudlin voice of \u201cThree Times a Lady,\u201d almost too genteel for the band\u2019s tame brand of funk-soul. Critics offered respect, but scorn leaked through: \u201cunctuous,\u201d \u201cmilquetoast,\u201d \u201cwhite-bread.\u201d The bottom line: Richie was talented, but too slight and sappy to be taken seriously.Today he stands as the biggest \u201980s pop star who is not quite canonized. He has sold tens of millions of records worldwide, most of them in the \u201980s, when he strode lofty heights alongside Michael Jackson, Madonna and Prince. But Richie couldn\u2019t match the charisma of those dynamos, and unlike all of them, he has gotten nowhere near the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. The industry celebrates his hit-making: There was an all-star Richie tribute at last month\u2019s Grammys. Still, the highest sort of esteem is denied him.A reappraisal may be in order. What hits me hardest is the robust beauty of Richie\u2019s voice \u2014 a smooth baritone roughened by hints of grit \u2014 and the casual virtuosity with which he puts it to use. Listen to the 1981 Diana Ross duet \u201cEndless Love,\u201d in which Richie enfolds his partner\u2019s rather colorless singing in plush, precise harmony vocals, airlifting the song to its rightful place: the honeymoon suite of a very posh hotel. That mix of understated and overwrought is pure Richie. He deploys one of pop\u2019s subtlest skill sets in the service of ferociously corny songs.The miracle is that Richie makes such sentiments stick. Credit his melodic gift and his knack for arrangements that wash over listeners in cresting, tumbling waves. \u201cHello\u201d is typical, with stately verses that open into a wind-whipped chorus. When the song rears up into its final refrain (\u201c\u2019Cause I wonder where you are ... \u201c), the effect is that of a unicorn rising on its hind legs, mane flashing, to meet the purple dawn.In short, Richie is a great singer-songwriter and a world-historical cheeseball. A century-plus of pop history has not erased the squeamishness we feel when faced with ballads like Richie\u2019s. Today\u2019s music critics have largely abandoned old snobberies, embracing commercial pop in all its gaudy splendor. Yet songs like \u201cHello\u201d remain for many a bridge too far, a musical pleasure we still take with a side helping of guilt.But pop culture has evolved a nifty system, allowing us to luxuriate in music we pretend to hold at arm\u2019s length. The campy karaoke performance, the TV comedy sketch, the \u201cRickroll\u201d \u2014 these bring songs back to us under the cover of irony. It\u2019s canon-making, 2016 style: We mock-venerate old records as kitsch and, lo and behold, they get inscribed in the Celestial Songbook.Richie knows how this game is played \u2014 how to laugh at himself, politely, and all the way to the bank. Last fall, he appeared on \u201cThe Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon,\u201d or rather, his disembodied head did: Richie played the role of the Lionel Richie bust, duetting with Fallon in a \u201cHello\u201d spoof. When Richie performs, though, the irony melts away.That\u2019s what happened at Glastonbury, where a crowd of mostly white rock fans greeted Richie in high tongue-in-cheek mode, waving banners with slogans lifted from memes. But when the opening strains of \u201dHello\u201d sounded, the throng erupted, joining Richie in a singalong as joyously cathartic as any you will hear. Suddenly, \u201cHello\u201d wasn\u2019t a tacky \u201980s artifact \u2014 the song was a communal hearth fire, casting a rosy glow over 200,000 souls. It was an example of pop\u2019s mysterious sorcery, the way that certain alchemical blends of music and words strike us right in the gut, circumnavigating our high-minded aesthetic ideals and studied postures. It was a reminder that some of the most powerful songs are the most gauche, scrambling together beauty and vulgarity, exquisite craftsmanship and appalling taste, exalted chivalric love-oaths and the queasy come-ons of a dork with a mullet. As for that Clay Head From the Lionel Richie \u201cHello\u201d Video: It works equally well as a platter for your cream-cheese dip and a bust on pop\u2019s Mount Rushmore. \u2666The master producer opens up his workshop.Photographs by JRA \u2018classical\u2019 musician with legions of unclassical admirers \u2014 including Kanye West.By Mark LevineA few years ago, Shaw, then 30, shocked the classical-music world by becoming the youngest-ever winner of a Pulitzer Prize in music. Shaw won for a piece she wrote for the cultish vocal group Roomful of Teeth, which specializes in otherworldly sounds that hardly suggest the word \u201cclassical,\u201d and which she is a member of. In swift fashion, Shaw emerged as the face of a flourishing scene of young composers \u2014 people like Nico Muhly, Gabriel Kahane and Missy Mazzoli \u2014 who were blurring the lines between classical and indie music. For the previous month or two, raw video footage from a fund-raiser held by the Democratic National Committee in San Francisco, and attended by President Obama, had been circulating online, showing Shaw singing a long, hypnotic, wordless introduction to Kanye West\u2019s performance of his song \u201cPower.\u201dIn Iowa, Shaw came onstage and sat cross-legged on her chair among the string players. Small and pixieish, she could easily have passed for a college student. She prefaced her work \u201cBy & By,\u201d a setting of three gospel songs, by saying that she was hoping to restore some authenticity to commercialized old-time music, and then began singing in an unadorned, incantatory alto shaded with both sorrow and fervor. Her slow, ribbonlike phrases, hovering just this side of harmonic resolution, might have risen from the Middle Ages as much as from the middle of Appalachia. The players plucked their instruments with picks, banjo-style, and occasionally broke into odd, agitated strumming or sawed away at their strings with the wooden part of the bow. Shaw and JACK could seem to be drifting into different songs, Shaw\u2019s vocals lost in plaintiveness while the quartet fought through bouts of improvisatory chaos. But the strewn-out pieces of sound kept finding their way back to one another. For all the hints of disruptiveness in the music, this was crowd-pleasing stuff, and the young members of the audience responded with shouts.Not long after the concert, Shaw and I struck up a phone and email correspondence. She grew up in Greenville, N.C., where her mother, a violin teacher, started her on the instrument at 2. \u201cI was a straight-up suburban Suzuki kid,\u201d she told me, reared on a strict diet of classical music. \u201cI lived under a rock for many years.\u201d She went to Rice University to study violin, then moved on to Yale for a master\u2019s in performance. While there, she sang in church choirs for $15 an hour to help pay the bills and got a job as an accompanist for dance classes, work that required her to improvise music on demand for a variety of rhythms, tempos and styles of movement. \u201cIf you\u2019re a good accompanist,\u201d she says, \u201cno one notices you. It\u2019s a way of making music to serve something that\u2019s larger than you, but something that\u2019s very human and simple, which is dance.\u201dAfter Yale, she moved to New York and gravitated toward the edges of the classical-music scene. She played a lot of thorny contemporary music, which often left her yearning for the full-bodied pleasures of traditional harmony, and which set her to wondering what she might have done differently had she written the score herself. She had also developed into a specialist in Baroque violin and sang early music in the choir of Trinity Church in Lower Manhattan. In 2009, she heard about an a cappella group that was being put together to explore vocal practices rarely found in standard classical music. \u201cIt was a gig, yes, but what a crazy adventure to learn things like throat singing and yodeling,\u201d she says.That summer, the group, Roomful of Teeth, met for the first time in a three-week residency at Mass MoCA, the contemporary art museum in North Adams, Mass. The eight young members settled in to study with a master throat singer from Tuva, a region of southern Siberia. The group\u2019s director, Brad Wells, invited them to write music for their first performance. Shaw worked late into the night after each day\u2019s rehearsal, \u201ctrying out these chords,\u201d as she puts it, \u201cand moving things around. I had it in my mind that I wanted to hear a mass of people talking, saying things that didn\u2019t have any particular content. Then I wanted to hear the talk break down into a guttural sound, \u2018vocal fry,\u2019 with no words, just vowels \u2014 the kind of thing kids do, just play with sound. And then I wanted to hear that strange sound turn into a big, beautiful chord, sung by all eight of us, a split second later.\u201dAfter 10 days, Shaw had a draft of a piece, \u201cPassacaglia,\u201d to take to rehearsal. It gave the group a chance to practice some of the effects they had been working on, like the lawnmowerish textures of throat singing and the sudden transition between head and chest voice that characterizes yodeling. There was a spoken text \u2014 from \u201cWall Drawing 305,\u201d by Sol LeWitt, on display at Mass MoCA \u2014 which, torn from context, came across as surreal and vaguely menacing. The work\u2019s opening harmonies, though, were straight from classical tradition. The audience at the first concert cheered and applauded when the swarming, crackling sounds of the vocal meltdown in \u201cPassacaglia\u201d resolved, suddenly and triumphantly, by returning to the piece\u2019s opening D-major chord.The following two summers, Roomful of Teeth returned to Mass MoCA, and Shaw wrote three more pieces, which she put together as a four-movement work called \u201cPartita for Eight Voices.\u201d The range of vocalizations expanded to include whispers, sighs, grunts, gasps, murmurs, whoops, heavy breathing. For a work written by a relative novice, \u201cPartita\u201d bristled with assurance. On a lark, Shaw wrote a check for $50 and submitted \u201cPartita\u201d to the Pulitzer committee, thinking it a useful way to get the high-profile judges to listen to Roomful of Teeth. She was walking along the Hudson on a spring afternoon when a friend called to tell her she had won the prize. Nine months later, Roomful of Teeth, which had mounted a Kickstarter campaign to help finance its first recording, which included \u201cPartita,\u201d won a Grammy. The group now has bookings for close to 75 performances this year.Last May, Kanye West heard Roomful of Teeth perform \u201cPartita for Eight Voices\u201d at Walt Disney Concert Hall in Los Angeles and came backstage afterward to meet the group. \u201cHe just seemed like someone who is honestly curious and interested in finding something new,\u201d Shaw recalls. \u201cWe exchanged phone numbers and started talking.\u201d West asked Shaw to produce a new version of his song \u201cSay You Will,\u201d a track from his 2008 album \u201c808s & Heartbreak.\u201d \u201cThere was no assignment given,\u201d Shaw says. \u201cI just did what I wanted to, and he really liked it.\u201d West released the remix on SoundCloud and added Shaw to the legion of collaborators on his new project, \u201cThe Life of Pablo,\u201d bringing her to Los Angeles for three weeks of studio work. She ended up co-writing, co-producing or contributing vocals to several songs.\u201cI\u2019m not really allowed to talk about it,\u201d Shaw told me. But she went on: \u201cThe work was really fun. It was like being given an amazing coloring book and being told to use all your crayons, use your paint and scissors, anything at all.\u201d At first, Shaw had little familiarity with West\u2019s music. She recognized an affinity, though. \u201cEverything is tightly, tightly controlled, held back, held onto. And then the moment comes and it just breaks out, everything explodes.\u201d Shaw paused seriously for a moment, then laughed. \u201cI kinda love that.\u201d \u2666\u2018Mr. Worldwide\u2019 speaks in pan-Caribbean code.By Julianne Escobedo ShepherdThere\u2019s a reason Pitbull christened himself \u201cMr. Worldwide\u201d: The bombastic party rapper is a global phenomenon. He also tends to be served a global helping of ire. In February, he closed out the Grammy Awards with his reggaeton single \u201cEl Taxi,\u201d in a slot normally reserved for rock music (and, occasionally, rock-rap hybrids); by the song\u2019s end, several Twitter users, including the \u201cBroad City\u201d comedy writer Chris Kelly, had likened the performance to the Zika virus.Jamaica and Cuba have enjoyed a friendly relationship since the early 1970s, when the former lobbied the Organization of American States in support of the latter. More important, though, there\u2019s Miami, the spiritual home of the \u201cEl Taxi\u201d sensibilities \u2014 where Caribbean immigrants have for decades melded and commingled culture and influence, with itinerant communities cross-pollinating and building off one another. Chaka Demus certainly approved of \u201cEl Taxi\u201d building on his original, \u201cthe biggest dancehall song of all time,\u201d as he told The Jamaica Star. (Besides, he said, \u201cI have lost track of the amount of persons who have copied the song already.\u201d)Diasporas live and thrive in these sonic interchanges, which work almost like a code among the communities that create them \u2014 a point of conversation among very different peoples whom the mainstream holds equally at arm\u2019s length. Pitbull described himself, in a 2015 Billboard interview, as \u201cthe epitome of the American dream, the underdog, the fighter, the forever hungry, forever appreciative.\u201d Some may be reasonably allergic to the strobe-light pulse of his Miami party zone. But every beat clearly illustrates the way immigrants have learned to flip that disdain to their advantage. \u2666The return of perfectly imperfect soul.By Amanda PetrusichThe R.&B. singer D\u2019Angelo once took a 14-year retreat from his public. After a tour for the 2000 platinum-selling \u201cVoodoo\u201d \u2014 during which grown women were reportedly shrieking, nightly, for D\u2019Angelo to reveal his carved abdomen, then so acutely defined that it seemed unreal, phantasmagoric \u2014 he split, using booze, drugs and solitude to numb his disappointment with a business that seemed to have everything backward. \u201cI\u2019m going to go in the woods, drink some hooch, grow a beard and get fat,\u201d is how he put it to his friend and collaborator Questlove.The decade-plus of pop music that D\u2019Angelo sat out was driven, in large part, by neurotic precision. Some of this is surely attributable to the Swedish superproducer Max Martin, who favors a punchy, airless, symmetrical approach to rhythm. You hit the beat and hit it squarely. Martin\u2019s aesthetic is ubiquitous \u2014 he has worked with Taylor Swift, Katy Perry, Adele, Maroon 5 and dozens of others \u2014 and doesn\u2019t allow for much creative meandering. In the Martin era, so much pop music has been violent in its fastidiousness: no stumbling, no retreat, no lackadaisical exhalations.It\u2019s not that \u201cReally Love\u201d is muddy or inexact \u2014 although by Martin\u2019s yardstick, it probably is \u2014 but that it\u2019s gentle, unstressed, forgiving of itself. This is not so unusual in R.&B. and soul, formative genres for D\u2019Angelo, but it has become anomalous within pop. While a listener might find it easier, at first, to holler along with a more fastidious singer like Taylor Swift (It is extraordinarily satisfying! Shouting each fixed syllable! Participating in the one! And only! Way! The song! Allows for!), D\u2019Angelo\u2019s vocal performance encourages something softer and less preordained. Even the few seconds of gritty crackle included at the end \u2014 a turntable\u2019s needle jerking into a run-out groove \u2014 suggest a way to quiet the mind, let the edges blur a little, like when you accidentally fall asleep in a poolside chaise, drink still in hand. It is hard, now, not to read D\u2019Angelo\u2019s departure as a reiteration of a creative ethos, writ larger; slowness, here, is not ignoble or archaic. It feels, instead, like a subversive act: a revolution of patience. \u2666From a jailed star, a soundtrack for Jamaica\u2019s cynical politics.By Miriam MarkowitzThat is, the party\u2019s political opposition, the Jamaica Labour Party, was too weak to have committed the crime. Riffing on another line from \u201cWeh Dem Feel Like,\u201d Vaz exhorted his listeners to \u201cload up the guns,\u201d before a D.J. played a few bars of the song. In newspapers for days afterward, politicians and private citizens denounced Vaz for his carelessness: On the eve of an election, a time when Jamaica\u2019s fragile political peace has historically been rived by violence, Vaz had channeled the menace of Vybz Kartel.Jailed on suspicion of murder in 2011 and convicted in 2014, Kartel is Jamaica\u2019s pre-eminent entertainer and a quandary for the political class, which has long defined itself in opposition to the nation\u2019s popular music \u2014 first reggae and now dancehall, its rude, raucous up-tempo successor. Jamaican artists like Buju Banton, Bounty Killer and Beenie Man popularized dancehall abroad in the \u201990s, and later crossover stars like Sean Paul and Shaggy scored stateside hits with \u201cGimme the Light\u201d and \u201cBoombastic.\u201d But dancehall\u2019s influence is even more profound, having grown from an indigenous genre into the ghost in the pop-music machine. It seeded the evolution of rap, drum and bass and electronic dance music, and has infiltrated American pop from Justin Bieber to Beyonc\u00e9. \u201cWork,\u201d the newest single from the Barbadian superstar Rihanna, is effectively dancehall, as was her first hit, \u201cPon de Replay\u201d in 2005.Here in Jamaica \u2014 where dancehall is the soundtrack to life, blasting every day and late into the night from car stereos and jury-rigged home speakers, in rum bars and barbershops \u2014 Kartel remains the genre\u2019s reigning monarch, despite having spent the last five years in prison. Born Adidja Palmer, Kartel built his reputation with graphic songs about guns, sex and unapologetic social transgressions, like bleaching his skin. His empire has extended beyond music to products, including a line of cake soap and \u201cdaggering\u201d condoms, named after a dance move in which a couple simulates rough sex on the dance floor. In 2014, he was convicted of murdering an associate, Clyde (Lizard) Williams, who disappeared in 2011 and whose body was never recovered. Kartel, who maintains his innocence, has continued to dominate the airwaves and awards circuit and somehow seems to be recording music in prison; a new album, \u201cViking (Vybz Is King),\u201d appeared last year.As the two political parties fought to form the next government, Vaz was not the only politician to take his cues from Kartel and dancehall. In November, Andrew Holness, the Jamaica Labour Party leader, toured Montego Bay wearing Clarks, Jamaica\u2019s most fashionable footwear, whose prices doubled on the island in 2010 after Kartel penned an ode to the British brand. Holness tweeted a picture of himself dusting off a brown shoe in Kartel\u2019s preferred style, the \u201cdesert boot,\u201d and Twitter went wild. \u201cA weh yuh get dah new Clarks deh daadi?\u201d Holness wrote, echoing the question posed to Kartel by Popcaan, another dancehall superstar and Kartel\u2019s now-estranged prot\u00e9g\u00e9.The People\u2019s National Party, meanwhile, has its own house D.J., Foota Hype. In January, Lisa Hanna, the party\u2019s minister for youth and culture and a former Miss Jamaica, posted lyrics on Instagram from \u201cSchool,\u201d one of Kartel\u2019s newer songs, in which he implores students to study hard and to refrain from bleaching their skin. Hanna might have been returning a compliment paid to her by Kartel, who late last year released a song, \u201cBoss Lady,\u201d that praised Hanna and also Portia Simpson Miller, then the prime minister.In their appeals to dancehall fandom, these politicians hoped to inspire an electorate exhausted by empty promises. Since 1989, when the previously socialist-leaning People\u2019s National Party embraced economic neoliberalism, the ideological gap between the two parties has collapsed. Jamaica\u2019s debt-to-G.D.P. ratio has reached 125 percent, making it one of the world\u2019s premier debtor states; I.M.F.-imposed austerity measures have yielded high unemployment rates and a declining standard of living. For young people \u2014 almost half of whom would, according to a recent poll, relinquish their Jamaican citizenship to live abroad \u2014 party politics is increasingly dispiriting. Dancehall is the perfect accompaniment to their mood: a jaded and bacchanalian lament for the Jamaican future as envisioned by its young.In \u201cWeh Dem Feel Like,\u201d Kartel asks about his enemies, \u201cDem skin too tough fi bleed?\u201d \u2014 a fitting question, too, regarding Jamaica\u2019s frequently violent politics. All told, before the voting, at least four people were shot to death at campaign events, and dozens more were injured in a stampede. When the votes were tallied last month, the nation got what it expected: a virtual tie between two nearly identical parties, with the Jamaica Labour Party eking out a slim majority. Vaz, Holness and Hanna won their seats handily. It was considered, by Jamaican standards, a peaceful election. \u2666110 million views and counting.By Jayson GreeneWhere on earth is the monoculture in 2016? It\u2019s clearly not dead. There is a song out right now: It\u2019s called \u201cStressed Out,\u201d and it is by a group called Twenty One Pilots. I discovered it recently, while poking around online during an office lunch break. As I watched the video play in its tiny YouTube window, I was dismayed to discover something. This song, by this group, of whose existence I had not been even dimly aware, had been viewed 110 million times.Bowled over, I consulted the Billboard charts and saw that \u201cStressed Out\u201d by Twenty One Pilots was the No. 3 song in the nation. (And seriously: Twenty One Pilots? Was this name invented by a spambot? Was their Twitter icon an egg?) A sense of the uncanny crept in: What else didn\u2019t I know about? Where was I, in relation to everyone else? Digging around more, I learned that the duo used to loiter outside a Chick-fil-A in their hometown, Columbus, Ohio, hawking tickets to their shows. Now, just a few years later, they\u2019re scheduled to play 75 arenas and counting in 2016. Their success has a certain \u201cAlex from Target\u201d feel to it, in which incomprehensible unseen forces conspire to lift an arbitrary phenomenon up into the national spotlight.In pop culture, \u201cincomprehensible unseen forces\u201d can reliably be shortened to just \u201cteenagers.\u201d And sure enough, dipping into Tumblr and Vine and Twitter \u2014 alone, again, on my office lunch break \u2014 reveals the band has a deep and devoted learner\u2019s-permit fan base. The appeal of \u201cStressed Out\u201d for teenagers is easy enough to grasp: It sounds like a cheery telegram from turn-of-the-century MTV \u2014 a kind of singsong rap that transforms, in the chorus, into emo pop. The backbeat instantly recalls Eminem\u2019s \u201cMy Name Is,\u201d and the verses take you back to Crazy Town\u2019s \u201cButterfly.\u201d Sometimes Tyler Joseph, their singer, picks up a ukulele, in the manner of so many YouTube stars. The whole thing is like a microhistory of the last 20 years of suburban white people.Music can take you to unexpected places.By Jazmine HughesI\u2019ve held onto that idea \u2014 a song as a route \u2014 ever since. The trick to music, though, is that it doesn\u2019t really take you anywhere; you take yourself. The song is just the ticket, the map, the conduit. You arrive at the destination entirely on your own.That sound brings me directly to my grandmother\u2019s church in Roanoke, Va., where I received my first blessing as a human baby (I don\u2019t remember), learned my first proper hymn (I don\u2019t remember) and, as a toddler, stood up on the pew and interrupted the service in which my Mema received special accolades from the pastor (I don\u2019t remember, but I wish I did). Hearing an organ is my own vibrant Sunday morning: slicing the thick air with a paper fan, tightening my stomach muscles to quiet any rumbling until lunch, trying not to sweat out my freshly pressed hair, searching for a lesson within the sermon that I could believe in. The song made me 2 again, then 5, then 12 and then (and now) 24, in the room but ever-so-slightly out of place, seeing love and trying to feel it. \u201cSunday Candy\u201d took me down South, took me back, put me back into my grandmother\u2019s lap for four generous, holy minutes. Church, still, is a strange sort of refuge: I never want to go, but I\u2019m always glad I went. I really go only whenever I visit my grandma.\u201cSunday Candy\u201d ends the way my grandma\u2019s church service always began: with the choir. The superb, slowed-down version Chance performed on \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d in late 2015 is as close to a hip-hop gospel song as I\u2019ve ever heard, due mostly to the outsize presence of that choir with its call-and-response approach to repetition. Chance ends the performance with a breathless, ecclesiastical freestyle not unlike the climax of a sermon, marrying the spiritual transcendence of a Sunday service with his artistic one.In buttoned-up Bulgaria, a viral sensation who plows through every taboo.By Mac McClellandBorn in Bulgaria\u2019s only women\u2019s prison (his mother was arrested for selling imported clothes before the fall of Communism), Azis was, he says, marked since birth \u201cto be different.\u201d He was gay in a culture that rejects homosexuality and Roma in a country \u2014 one of several \u2014 that continues to persecute the group. \u201cBeing gay and being Roma are highly discriminated against in Bulgaria,\u201d Azis continued. \u201cThey\u2019re both words that people here hate. For me, I\u2019m carrying the burden of the two.\u201dNonetheless, Azis\u2019s mother was determined to make her son a star, and after she got out of prison, she dragged him to endless auditions. But \u201cnobody wanted a Gypsy kid,\u201d Azis went on. \u201cThey just didn\u2019t want a Gypsy in their choir, a Gypsy standing in front, on TV, anywhere; it was beyond imagination to have somebody like me there.\u201d Eventually, this string of humiliations \u201ccrushed\u201d his mother. They moved to West Germany when Azis was 8. He returned to Bulgaria a few years later, after the wall came down; his mother\u2019s dream became his own the night he sang in a restaurant with live accompaniment. \u201cI felt really intoxicated by performing,\u201d he recalled. In his early 20s, he signed with a music agency in Sofia and a year later won best artist at a Bulgarian music festival. Within two years, he sold out the country\u2019s biggest stadium, where, with Communism more than a decade gone, he took the stage wearing high-heeled red leather boots that went up to his crotch.Now 38, Azis has dropped what he calls his \u201cdiva\u201d look. This is partly because he\u2019s \u201ctired and too old for everything\u201d \u2014 it takes him three hours to get into drag \u2014 but also because he no longer feels the need to make statements. \u201cNowadays, you can see boys in tight jeans holding hands on the street. And there is a street in Sofia where you can have sex with a transsexual.\u201d He laughed, a full throaty chuckle like a glamorous Disney villain. \u201cI\u2019ve done what I could to change people\u2019s perceptions,\u201d he later added. \u201cI showed that you can be Gypsy and you can be intelligent, you could be gay and you can be cool. That\u2019s it. I cannot do the very same thing for 20 years.\u201d\u201cHabibi\u201d may take its name from an Arabic endearment, but he insists he\u2019s not trying to imply that, in Bulgaria, Arabs may suffer a fate similar to the Roma. (A recent Amnesty International report noted that migrants live in terror of \u201cxenophobic hate crimes\u201d and admonished Bulgaria to address this climate of fear.) Rather, he explains, it\u2019s that Arab barbershops are trendy in Bulgaria. He has seen young people talking about them on Facebook.One day, the diva look will be back, he promises. In the meantime, he\u2019s considering recording a song entirely in English for American audiences, for whom he does have a message, however apolitical. \u201cI want them to know about Bulgaria,\u201d he said. \u201cI want to tell them that it\u2019s a small but very beautiful country, the nature here is amazing, the people are very friendly, especially in the countryside, and we have the most delicious feta cheese.\u201d \u2666On composing music, and your death, while dying.By Will HermesThere\u2019s a tradition of \u201cdeath poems\u201d in some Asian countries, and as a generation of outspoken musicians shuffles off our coil, the farewell album has become a Western equivalent. John Coltrane\u2019s \u201cExpression\u201d might be considered a forerunner. Warren Zevon made \u201cThe Wind\u201d after a diagnosis of inoperable cancer. On the last of Johnny Cash\u2019s \u201cAmerican Recordings\u201d series released during his lifetime, he performed Trent Reznor\u2019s \u201cHurt\u201d as a sort of deathbed confessional, then closed with \u201cWe\u2019ll Meet Again,\u201d a World War II-era send-off that was the smirking existential finale of \u201cDr. Strangelove.\u201dOther late works tilt toward consecrating summary, like Bach\u2019s \u201cMass in B Minor\u201d \u2014 or the new album by Loretta Lynn, still hale at 83, which reprises pointed favorites like \u201cEverybody Wants to Go to Heaven\u201d (\u201cbut nobody wants to die\u201d). Lou Reed\u2019s parting shot was extreme, even for him: a harsh art-metal collaboration with Metallica that reimagines Frank Wedekind\u2019s violently sexual \u201cLulu\u201d plays. But Reed was always a button-pusher. \u201cThe greatest disappointment/Age withered him and changed him,\u201d he snarled on \u201cJunior Dad,\u201d a song as mercilessly cleareyed as Reed\u2019s signature \u201cHeroin.\u201d Bowie is said to have called \u201cLulu\u201d his friend\u2019s \u201cgreatest work,\u201d a judgment colored, perhaps, by his own exit-music plans.In an era when our deaths are generally scripted by a profit-driven medical establishment, these conscious farewells are inspiring. Death is one of life\u2019s main events: Shouldn\u2019t it be our own composition? Reed died at home, surrounded by friends and family, with a posthumous, invite-only tribute at the Apollo Theater. There was no public funeral service for Bowie, only a final photo left on Instagram taken shortly before he died \u2014 the former and eternal Ziggy Stardust looking dapper in a designer suit, rakish hat and no socks, grinning widely, ready for his next act. \u2666Digital Design: Rodrigo de Benito Sanz and Linsey Fields.A picture caption on March 13 with an article about Sydney Bennett, leader of the band the Internet, misspelled the surname of the band\u2019s bassist. He is Patrick Paige II, not Page.An article on March 13 about the rapper Kendrick Lamar and his song \u2018\u2018The Blacker the Berry\u2019\u2019 paraphrased incorrectly the lyrics of a song by Lauryn Hill. She criticized black women who wear hair weaves that look European; she did not say that they got the weaves from Koreans.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "You Married Them Once, but What About Twice?", "Date": "2016-03-03", "News": "Supported byField NotesAfter 22 years, the divorce didn\u2019t work out for Sagan Lewis and Tom Fontana.They tried to maintain a severed union. And for more than two decades, they were successful. Ms. Lewis, a former actress, lived in the verdant tangle of Hawaii and then Arizona; he moved to the cobblestones of the West Village.She had a child on her own; he wrote and produced some of the most hard-edge, violent shows on television. They saw each other on occasion and still loved each other, but were not, emphatically, a couple.And yet, something kept bringing them together again. Finally, as if orchestrated by a Hollywood show-runner, in July, the woman who found comfort in the red rocks of Sedona and the man who lives in a 10,000-square-foot building in Manhattan, remarried.\u201cI realized I loved Sagan more than having all this space to myself,\u201d said Mr. Fontana, 64, the Emmy- and Peabody-award winning writer, producer and creator of TV shows including \u201cHomicide,\u201d \u201cOz\u201d and \u201cBorgia.\u201d \u201cBy this point in our lives, all that crud \u2014 career, ego, agenda, being obstinate because you think you\u2019re right \u2014 is gone. There\u2019s no more testing.\u201dThey are not alone in their cycle of marriage, divorce and remarriage \u2014 to each other. Phil Collins, the chronicler of failed relationships, recently reconciled with his third ex-wife, Orianne Cevey, after an eight-year separation (and $48 million divorce).\u201cWell, you know, we realized we made a mistake,\u201d Mr. Collins told \u201cCBS This Morning\u201d in an interview this week. He recalled that his son Matthew from that marriage told him: \u201cHe just wished that it would happen. I was very moved.\u201d The singer added, \u201cIt\u2019s simple: We missed each other.\u201dThey join the ranks of Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton; Natalie Wood and Robert Wagner; Melanie Griffith and Don Johnson; Judith Sheindlin (Judge Judy) and Jerry Sheindlin; and Marie Osmond and Stephen Craig, who became her third (and first) husband.The idea of a marriage reprise has seeped into popular culture, too, \u201cThe Parent Trap\u201d notwithstanding. In the 2009 film \u201cIt\u2019s Complicated,\u201d the divorced couple, played by Meryl Streep and Alec Baldwin, consider reconciling, much to their children\u2019s dismay.\u201cVery, very few try to start over again,\u201d said Nancy Kalish, a former psychology professor at California State University, Sacramento, who has been studying divorced couples for decades.Most divorced people \u201cdon\u2019t ever want to speak to each other again, and some struggle to do so for the good of their children,\u201d she said. Of the ones who do reconcile, she said, those who have been most successful in rebuilding their former marriages were much younger when they parted and had been separated a long time.That\u2019s what happened with April and Mike Davidson, of Grand Ledge, Mich. They met when she was 18 and he was 25; by the time she was 30, she was the mother of five.\u201cIt sounds so clich\u00e9, but I completely lost who I was,\u201d said Ms. Davidson, now 38. \u201cI became \u2018Mike\u2019s wife,\u2019 and \u2018so and so\u2019s mom.\u2019 We\u2019d put the kids to bed and then argue.\u201dShe went back to school, made friends of her own and took a job. She was happier, she said, but her newfound independence threatened her husband.They tried couples therapy to no avail; in 2009, they divorced, negotiating the terms of their split in a draft Google document. They amicably co-parented, and dated other people.She was flooded with rage, she said, and called her ex and vented. But instead of lobbing daggers back at her, he invited her out for coffee. She went.\u201cThere was this spark that scared the hell out of me,\u201d she said. \u201cI hadn\u2019t looked a him without bitterness in years.\u201d He walked her back to her car, and as if propelled by some supernatural force, she leaned over and kissed him.In June 2012, three years after their divorce was final, he moved into the house Ms. Davidson had purchased following the dissolution of their union.\u201cPeople really can change through loss,\u201d said Wendy Paris, author of \u201cSplitopia: Dispatches From Today\u2019s Good Divorce and How to Part Well.\u201d \u201cThey don\u2019t change through criticism in a contentious marriage.\u201d\u201cAfter divorce, your ex still has your words in her head,\u201d Ms. Paris said. \u201cShe could change into someone you get along with a lot better. Also, you might change. You could become more confident and reconnected to important parts of yourself once you\u2019re no longer locked in the adversarial position-taking that often develops in a bad marriage. That confidence or clarity can translate into being more generous and magnanimous of spirit, more accepting.\u201dMs. Weiner-Davis concurs, saying, \u201cVery often they come to the relationship with a new maturity and a willingness to learn how things got in disrepair to begin with, and they\u2019re more willing to take a look at what each person can do differently so that they don\u2019t find themselves in the same position again.\u201dLogistics and practicalities play a role; so does sheer exhaustion. Exploring the scintillating world of Tinder may seem appealing to someone who\u2019s been in a committed relationship for eons. But after a while, they may conclude that the devil they know just may be better than the devil they don\u2019t know (or, more pointedly, don\u2019t know as well.)\u201cIt\u2019s hard to be a single parent, responsible for child care and house and mortgage,\u201d she said. \u201cTrying to blend two families and two schedules is such a challenge.\u201dAnd then there\u2019s the fact that people grow in different ways, and their needs and wants don\u2019t always align \u2014 until, miraculously, they do.This was the case with Mr. Fontana and Ms. Lewis, who met in 1978, when she auditioned for the Williamstown Theater Festival in Massachusetts, and he was the \u201cartistic director\u2019s slave.\u201dThey lived together in New York, and then Mr. Fontana got a writing job in Los Angeles on the show \u201cSt. Elsewhere,\u201d which was produced by Bruce Paltrow, who wrote a part for Ms. Lewis on the show.On Dec. 18, 1982, Mr. Fontana and Ms. Lewis married in the backyard of the Paltrow family\u2019s home in Santa Monica, Calif.The couple continued for a few years, each growing dissatisfied with their lives. Not with each other, but with their circumstances. Mr. Fontana was unhappy with Los Angeles. \u201cI found it empty,\u201d he said.Ms. Lewis said she found herself less career focused and more spiritually depleted. But New York wasn\u2019t her dream; she was inspired by hiking the Santa Monica Mountains and staring at the Pacific Ocean.When they finally came to the conclusion in 1993 that they should split, they did it with \u00e9lan, with a Final Anniversary Party. At the bottom of their invitation was this request: \u201cIf you must bring a gift, bring two.\u201d\u201cI was sad when we split up,\u201d Ms. Lewis said. \u201cTom\u2019s such a great human being. It was like, \u2018Why am I needing to do something else when I have this great guy?\u2019 If he\u2019d been a jerk, it would have been easy. It was hard for both of us but we knew it was necessary. He understood that I needed to explore other worlds.\u201dMs. Lewis moved to Maui, and then Sedona, where she taught acting workshops and became program director at the Sedona International Film Festival. About three years after she and Mr. Fontana divorced, she discovered she was pregnant. It was a shock: she and Mr. Fontana had been told that she was unable to have children.Ms. Lewis always planned to raise her son, Jade Scott Lewis, alone. But Mr. Fontana was a part of his life. The three spent some holidays together in New York or Omaha, where she was born, and it was always comfortable. And then a few years ago, after they visited in New York, Mr. Fontana found himself missing her more than usual.\u201cJade was coming to N.Y.U. for grad school, I was here,\u201d he said. \u201cI thought, why weren\u2019t we a family?\u201dAt Christmas 2014, he proposed. She accepted, and they were remarried in July 2015. The couple then took the wedding celebration on tour, with parties in New York, Los Angeles, Omaha and Buffalo, where Mr. Fontana has family. They have upcoming events in Sedona and Maui.Their grand New York party took place Dec. 19 at the Tribeca Rooftop \u2014 35 years and one day after their first wedding. The invitation was an updated version of their original invitation of the two of them kissing, along with this phrase: \u201cAfter 22 years, the divorce didn\u2019t work out.\u201dBoth stress they wouldn\u2019t have had it any other way. Ms. Lewis attributes the split for Mr. Fontana\u2019s artistic prowess. \u201cIf Tom and I had stayed happily married and not gone our separate ways, I\u2019m not sure those shows would have happened,\u201d she said. \u201cI think in his being alone, in life without a mate, I think he really explored the edges of humanity in his writing mind. He went places that I may have said, \u2018Oh, don\u2019t do that.\u2019\u201d\u201cWhen you\u2019re going to write shows like \u2018Homicide\u2019 and \u2018Oz,\u2019 you are testing the extremes in life,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019re going to the darkest place. But there was redemption on both shows, too.\u201dMs. Davidson also believes that divorcing was the best thing she and her husband could have done (they got re-engaged in the spring of 2013; while they refer to each other as \u201chusband\u201d and \u201cwife,\u201d they have not yet legalized the titles).\u201cWe just raced through life from 21 to 31,\u201d she said. \u201cWe lived such an epically fast rate that there was no time for growth. We were both teaching our kids this is what marriage looks like: two people who are unhappy. I don\u2019t want them to feel that way.\u201dStill, their reconciliation wasn\u2019t that smooth. Friends and family were confused: they had taken sides, but were now being told to forget everything they had heard about the other person.Their daughter Josephine, who was 9 when her parents separated and 12 when they reconciled, was furious.\u201cI asked why they would get divorced if only to get back together,\u201d said Josephine, now 14. \u201cThey said they just needed a break from each other and they\u2019re able to be more compatible now. I\u2019m definitely glad now. They seem happier than they did before. But I thought it was kind of dumb to split up and have the kids get used to that situation and then randomly get back together without any notice.\u201dMr. Davidson said: \u201cOur relationship started with a power imbalance, which continued during our marriage, even through ample evidence that it was unhealthy. When it finally fell apart, I was unwilling to make the change that was needed. Instead of embracing equilibrium, I clutched tighter than ever to hold on to control. It took a long time to understand this, and it\u2019s certainly not something I\u2019m proud of, but it was an important lesson. Equality is the foundation of our new relationship.\u201d\u201cAnything that happened that reminded me of the past brought up angry feelings, and we had to experience all that again,\u201d April Davidson said. \u201cBut instead of glossing over it, we had to hash it out. It was messy, but good messy.

{"Headline": "A Father, a Son, a Disease, and a Camera", "Date": "2018-01-18", "News": "What happens to a town of 4,000 when the country\u00e2\u0080\u0099s largest detention center for immigrants opens its doors there? That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the question we at Black Box traveled to Dilley, Tex., last year to try and answer.Late in 2014, the Department of Homeland Security opened the South Texas Family Residential Center, the largest detention center in the country, in Dilley. It was designed as a response to the thousands of women and children \u00e2\u0080\u0094 many of whom were seeking asylum from the violence running rampant in their home countries \u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00c2\u00a0who had crossed the border en masse the previous summer. The center was made to hold as many as of 2,400 women and children as they worked their way through the immigration system.But before the center opened and the name Dilley became synonymous with the immigration debate, the town was a speck on a map, an hour and a half north of the Mexican border. Who were the people who lived there, and what did they have to say?Noel Perez, the town\u00e2\u0080\u0099s administrator, called bringing the detention center and its promised 600 jobs a no-brainer. But Mr. Perez remembers a time when, as a young Mexican-American running for local office \u00e2\u0080\u0094 one of the first in the region \u00e2\u0080\u0094 he lost the election because of tacit racism. Nowadays, most in Dilley can trace their lineage to Mexico within a generation or two, although that wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t always the case. Over the last 50 years, the town has flipped from being a quarter Hispanic and three-quarters white to the inverse. Soveida Obregon, the 76-year-old mother of Dilley\u00e2\u0080\u0099s current mayor, still talks about the town she knew growing up, divided by railroad tracks: A mud school for Mexicans on one side and a brick one for the Anglo, or white, kids. To this day, the cemetery still has a white section and a Mexican section.To explore bigger themes in the immigration debate in the United States, we gathered materials that painted a rich portrait of a town, its residents and their unwilling and unwelcome guests, all at the center of one of the most volatile debates in America \u00e2\u0080\u0094 who belongs here, and under what circumstances?Many in Dilley, including its Hispanic residents, are unsure what to think of the detention center and the families inside. The jobs didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t flow as promised. From the perspective of a town where a third of the population lives below the poverty line, the women and children inside detention seem to be treated awfully well. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhy do they get everything, when we work so hard to get the little we have?\u00e2\u0080\u009d wondered folks all over Dilley.And yet we also spent time with women and children who had been released from the center and found their way to the Mennonite House, an hour north in San Antonio. The house, overseen by the immigration nonprofit Raices, is a refuge where just-released families spend their first hours outside detention in America before heading on to where they would wait for the outcome of their asylum cases, be it Idaho, Arizona or Long Island.Among its residents was Mirza Dalila, a young mother who fled gang violence in Honduras with her daughter, and another woman and her daughter who had been kidnapped in Veracruz, Mexico, on their journey to the United States. Despite these traumatic experiences, they described detention as a worse ordeal. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI was desperate to get out of there, because truly, being there was a nightmare,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Ms. Dalila said of her time in Dilley, decrying the prisonlike conditions for women and children who went there seeking asylum.But reality is never black-and-white. After months of contentious back-and-forth, the families in the detention center are being cycled out in weeks, instead of months, and the future of family detention is in question. Yet women and children continue to surge to the border in record numbers, fleeing unchecked violence in their home countries, while the administration has doubled down on the necessity of family detention.As the political campaigns rage on, these families and the towns they\u2019re housed in have become talking points in presidential platforms. But for the formerly detained families, and the long-term residents of Dilley, the issue isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t abstract \u00e2\u0080\u0094 it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a defining facet of their lives."}
{"Headline": "This Man Is Trying to Reinvent the Pennsylvania Ballet", "Date": "2016-03-17", "News": "Supported byPHILADELPHIA \u2014 \u00c1ngel Corella knows a thing or two about \u201cDon Quixote,\u201d a ballet in which he had few rivals during his reign as a star dancer with American Ballet Theater. So at a recent rehearsal of his new production at the Pennsylvania Ballet, where he is artistic director, he had some practical advice to offer.\u201cWhen you come in, there should be a moment when you stop, so we can actually see your eyes \u2014 connect with us and then go,\u201d Mr. Corella said, demonstrating with a flourish. \u201cIt\u2019s like you\u2019re talking to us: \u2018Hello everyone. Here we go. You\u2019re having a good time? You\u2019re going to have a better one.\u2019\u201dMr. Corella, 40, seems to be having a very good time these days as he works to reinvent the Pennsylvania Ballet, where he has made top-to-bottom changes since becoming artistic director in 2014. He has brought on new artistic staff, new administrative leadership, new dancers from all over the world and a new approach to programming.This month, he will return to New York, the site of his triumphs with Ballet Theater, to show off his revamped troupe at a run at the Joyce Theater (March 29 through April 3) featuring works made for its dancers.\u201cIt feels like a whole new company,\u201d Mr. Corella said the other day in his office here, which he explained had no desk because he still likes to do most of his work in the studio.Now, Mr. Corella is throwing himself into all aspects of his new company, from leading company class twice a week to hiring dancers to bringing more contemporary choreographers on board to creating the new \u201cDon Quixote,\u201d which had its world premiere at the Academy of Music here on March 3.He even helped with the costumes, as part of a broader effort to give his \u201cDon Quixote\u201d a bit more Spanish flavor. While teaching in Barcelona last summer, he used his down time to tool around the city on a Vespa, buying shawls and peinetas (decorative Spanish combs), to outfit his dancers. His mother embroidered the matador costumes.Mr. Corella\u2019s hiring and his mandate for change are part of a conscious effort to reinvigorate the company. Like other performing arts organizations nationally and locally, including the Philadelphia Orchestra, which emerged from bankruptcy protection in 2012, the ballet had been facing serious fund-raising challenges and flat ticket revenues. In 2013, the company hired Michael M. Kaiser, the director of the DeVos Institute of Arts Management, to draft a master plan \u2014 and he urged the troupe to think big.\u201cThe Pennsylvania Ballet is a great company, but it was quiet,\u201d Mr. Kaiser recalled in a telephone interview. \u201cThe dancers were wonderful, it was doing some excellent work, but it had a very small family of donors, and it was relatively quiet on the ballet scene.\u201dBut big changes carry risks. The choice to do \u201cDon Quixote,\u201d a crowd-pleaser, raises questions about the identity of the company, which was founded in 1963 by Barbara Weisberger, a prot\u00e9g\u00e9e of George Balanchine, and which is still known for dancing Balanchine. Mr. Corella said he hoped to expand the company\u2019s repertory in two directions, reaching back with classic story ballets and forward by adding more contemporary works, while continuing to dance the repertory that is so central to its history.\u201cI\u2019m bringing in some new choreography, some new choreographers, and keeping the Balanchine tradition,\u201d he said. \u201cBut looking into the future with open eyes and open arms, because unfortunately Balanchine is not among us to do any more new works.\u201dNext season will feature three story ballets \u2014 Mr. Corella\u2019s new adaptation of \u201cLe Corsaire,\u201d a revival of Ben Stevenson\u2019s \u201cCinderella,\u201d and, as always, George Balanchine\u2019s \u201cThe Nutcracker.\u201d There will also be world premieres of works by Brian Sanders; Nicolo Fonte; and the company\u2019s choreographer in residence, Matthew Neenan, as well as company premieres of works by David Dawson, Nacho Duato and Christopher Wheeldon. Each mixed bill will feature some Balanchine.Mr. Corella said the program at the Joyce \u2014 \u201cKeep\u201d by Mr. Neenan, \u201cThe Accidental\u201d by Trey McIntyre and \u201cGrace Action\u201d by Mr. Fonte \u2014 was chosen to give a wider audience a sense of where the company stands.His urge for the company to proclaim itself informed one of the first things he did after his arrival, when he had trouble finding its new, but still unfinished, complex of studios on North Broad Street: He asked for a big sign saying \u201cPennsylvania Ballet.\u201d\u201cIt creates an identity,\u201d he said, \u201cfor everyone to recognize.\u201dAdvertisement"}

The Justice Department said the companies decided who would win the leases and the winner would allot an interest in the leases to the other company. \u00e2\u0080\u009cHis actions put company profits ahead of the interests of leaseholders entitled to competitive bids for oil and gas rights on their land,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said William J.

Mr. McClendon, an audacious chief executive at Chesapeake until he was forced to step down three years ago, became a billionaire as the company aggressively outbid competitors for land leases and drilled highly productive wells in virtually every major shale gas field in the country. Chesapeake\u00e2\u0080\u0099s stock price has been sinking for five years now, especially since it was revealed that Mr. McClendon had taken a personal stake in Chesapeake wells and used it as collateral for up to $1.1 billion in loans used mostly to pay for his share of the cost of drilling those wells. Gordon Pennoyer, a spokesman for Chesapeake, said the company was cooperating with the antitrust investigation and did not expect to face prosecution or fines related to the matter.This creates a culture of \u00e2\u0080\u009chaves\u00e2\u0080\u009d and \u00e2\u0080\u009chave-nots,\u00e2\u0080\u009d where a vote is worth everything or nothing.

Asahi Group Holdings of Japan has also agreed to buy Peroni and Grolsch, as well as parts of SABMiller\u00e2\u0080\u0099s European operations, for about $2.8 billion. The complexity is a result, in part, of the constant jockeying among exchanges to win business from the biggest traders, many of which are so-called high-frequency trading firms that make money by capitalizing on small changes in prices. RBC Capital Markets, found that the New York Stock Exchange, Nasdaq and other exchanges make frequent small tweaks to their prices, influencing trading behavior in ways that are hard for even sophisticated investors to understand. At one exchange highlighted in the research, EDGX, the pricing tiers, for example, include the \u00e2\u0080\u009cInvestor Tier,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the \u00e2\u0080\u009cUltra Tier,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the \u00e2\u0080\u009cMega-Step-Up Tier 1\u00e2\u0080\u009d and the \u00e2\u0080\u009cMega-Step-Up Tier 2,\u00e2\u0080\u009d among others. These tiers, though, were just the first layer of complication that big investors have to navigate to determine the price of buying or selling a stock. The research is likely to strengthen the hand of IEX, a company that is  asking regulators for approval to become an official stock exchange. The founders of IEX were the protagonists in the Michael Lewis book \u00e2\u0080\u009cFlash Boys\u00e2\u0080\u009d and are hoping to provide a more straightforward way to trade stocks.

For years, the president nurtured close ties to Silicon Valley, tapping the youthful talent there to help him reshape the federal government\u2019s aging technology infrastructure and seeking out leading executives for private advice and millions in campaign cash.\u00a0That partnership was in part a result of a philosophical affinity between Mr. Obama and technology executives that included broad agreement about gay rights, immigration, civil liberties and health care. Mr. Obama has repeatedly said he remains a fierce defender of civil liberties, including the right to privacy.Within the administration, there is a division over encryption between the F.B.I., along with other law enforcement agencies, which says it must have a way of breaking into encrypted devices, and the intelligence community, which worries that the same techniques could be used against the American government. In his comments, which were greeted with polite silence, Mr. Obama said he, too, supported the development of strong encryption to make sure that the government can protect banks and critical infrastructure. And he said he wanted proper oversight of law enforcement. But, he said, technology executives who are \u201cabsolutist\u201d on the issue are just wrong.\u201cThis notion that somehow our data is different and can be walled off from those other trade-offs we make, I believe, is incorrect,\u201d he said.Mr. Obama spoke broadly at the music, film and technology festival about the need for technology to be used to support civic life and the functioning of democracy.He became the first sitting president to visit the festival, which in the past three decades has become a mecca for the high-tech, social-media set. He made his comments during an hourlong conversation with Evan Smith, the editor in chief of The Texas Tribune.At the festival, the president sought to make the case that the technologies behind today\u2019s entertainment and communication apps should also be directed at solving the problems of voter turnout, access to information and civic engagement. \u201cWe want to create a pipeline where there is a continuous flow of talent that is helping to shape the government,\u201d he told the audience. Mr. Obama is something of a technology geek, so his presence at the festival does not come as much of a surprise. He enjoys dinners with technology moguls and has tapped the wealth of Silicon Valley for his two presidential campaigns.He has talked to his closest advisers about creating a high-tech presidential center when he leaves office, in part to help visitors engage with his legacy and in part to encourage better use of technology in society.Still, questions about how to harness the power of Twitter, Facebook and Snapchat to help government are not always clear, especially when the companies involved are, above all, designed to make money for their shareholders.This spring, the White House will host what it is calling a summit meeting on civic engagement, and aides said the president would use it to continue the conversation about the role that technology could play.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Hamas Commander, Accused of Theft and Gay Sex, Is Killed by His Own", "Date": "2016-03-01", "News": "Supported byMr. Ishtiwi, 34, was a commander from a storied family of Hamas loyalists who, during the 2014 war with Israel, was responsible for 1,000 fighters and a network of attack tunnels. Last month, his former comrades executed him with three bullets to the chest.Adding a layer of scandal to the story, he was accused of moral turpitude, by which Hamas meant homosexuality. And there were whispers that he had carved the word \u201czulum\u201d \u2014 wronged \u2014 into his body in a desperate kind of last testament.Mr. Ishtiwi, who is survived by two wives and three children, was not the first member of Hamas\u2019s armed wing, the Izzedine al-Qassam Brigades, to be killed by his own. What was unprecedented was the way his relatives spoke out publicly about it.The family was considered Hamas royalty for having sheltered leaders wanted by Israel, including Mohammed Deif, the Qassam commander in chief lionized by Palestinians. Mr. Ishtiwi\u2019s mother even sent Mr. Deif, who has lost an eye and limbs but has survived repeated assassination attempts by Israel, a tearful video message in which she entreated him to release her son.\u201cHe is harsher than other leaders \u2014 he wants his army to be pure,\u201d Mr. Madhoun said in an interview. \u201cThose who are in the Qassam are the most important people in Gaza. There is a need, they say, to show that these people are not untouchable.\u201dQassam put out a statement on Feb. 7 announcing Mr. Ishtiwi\u2019s execution, but its spokesman, and those of Hamas over all, have refused to comment since. A senior Hamas official, however, confirmed some facts and the broad contours of the case on the condition that he not be identified, saying he did not want to be seen as meddling in an affair considered embarrassing for the Hamas movement and tragic for the family.Mr. Ishtiwi was 19 when he joined Qassam, following three of his five brothers into the force. One, Ahmad, was killed in an Israeli strike in 2003.He became a commander in Zeitoun, his own gritty neighborhood in Gaza City. During the 2014 war, Israeli bombs smashed his family\u2019s apartment building and his second wife\u2019s house.It was five months after that deadly battle subsided, on Jan. 21, 2015, that Mr. Ishtiwi was summoned to an interrogation by Qassam military intelligence officials. Officers doing a kind of after-action investigation of the war suspected that he had diverted money allocated to his unit for weapons. \u201cDo you have money?\u201d he was asked, according to relatives. \u201cHow do you spend it?\u201dHe admitted that he had kept money meant for the brigades, and thus, said his sister Buthaina, 27, \u201cbegan the telenovela of torture.\u201dThe Hamas official said Mr. Ishtiwi\u2019s quick confession had aroused suspicion that he was hiding something bigger.A dragnet investigation began, drawing in Mr. Ishtiwi\u2019s soldiers. Qassam officials found a man who claimed he had had sex with Mr. Ishtiwi and provided dates and locations. They concluded that the missing money had been used either to pay for sex or to keep the man quiet. If Israeli intelligence officials knew Mr. Ishtiwi was gay, the officials surmised, perhaps he had given them information in exchange for keeping a secret that, if uncovered, would have made him an outcast in his society.On Feb. 15, 2015, two of Mr. Ishtiwi\u2019s siblings visited him at a Qassam base.\u201cMahmoud, we heard the things they are saying about you! Is it true?\u201d his sister Samia, now 39, recalled asking. Mr. Ishtiwi nodded yes.Suspicious, Samia turned to the two guards flanking him. \u201c\u00a0\u2018Is he agreeing because you filled him with beatings?\u2019\u00a0\u201d she recalled asking. \u201cThey said, \u2018He confessed without us giving him even a slap.\u2019\u00a0\u201dBut then, she said, she saw her brother raise his hand, revealing the word \u201czulum\u201d written in pen three times on his palm. She did not have a photo to prove this.Still, Mr. Ishtiwi sought to reassure her. \u201cLet the brothers take their procedures,\u201d Samia recalled him saying of Hamas. \u201cPut a summer watermelon in your stomach,\u201d an expression that means \u201cdon\u2019t worry.\u201dIn his next meeting with relatives, on March 1, Mr. Ishtiwi told his brother Hussam that he had been tortured since his fourth day in detention. Six weeks later, when his wives visited, they sneaked out a note, of which Human Rights Watch shared a photograph. \u201cThey nearly killed me,\u201d it says. \u201cI confessed to things I have never done in my life.\u201dBy June 7, when Samia visited her brother at a Qassam base near Gaza City\u2019s used car market, Mr. Ishtiwi \u201clooked destroyed,\u201d she recalled.\u201cI asked, \u2018Why are you crying, brother?\u2019\u00a0\u201d she said. \u201cAnd he said, \u2018I have been wronged, wronged.\u2019\u00a0\u201dRelatives said Mr. Ishtiwi had told them he had been suspended from a ceiling for hours on end, for days in a row. He was whipped, and guards blasted loud music into his cell, banishing sleep.Samia said he had raised his trouser leg to show her that he had carved the word \u201czulum\u201d into his skin with a nail, as a message in case he was killed. This could not be confirmed.She also said Mr. Ishtiwi had given her two pages crammed with writing, describing the abuse and proclaiming his innocence. The family would not share the letter, but several of Mr. Ishtiwi\u2019s siblings said that it listed episodes in which rival commanders had made errors that led to the killing of Qassam fighters in the 2014 war, and that it accused them of orchestrating his detention.Buthaina and Samia said they had shown the letter to Ismail Haniyeh, the leader of Hamas in Gaza, at his home on June 15. (Mr. Haniyeh did not respond to requests for comment.) They said they had asked Mr. Haniyeh if their brother could have a lawyer. No. Red Cross visits? No. An internal committee to review his case? Perhaps.They returned on July 2 with dozens of relatives and neighbors and tried to pressure Mr. Haniyeh by chanting outside his home against Hamas, a rare event. Police officers hit some of the demonstrators, people who were there said, and a senior Hamas spokesman publicly accused them of being violent.After a sleepless night, Buthaina posted about the situation on Facebook, breaking months of silence. \u201cWe are children of this movement,\u201d she said. \u201cWe thought that we would resolve the matter between us.\u201d Instead, she said, \u201cThe trust was broken.\u201dAug. 10 was the last time the family saw Mr. Ishtiwi.Later, his mother sent her emotional eight-minute video to Mr. Deif, the Qassam chief, begging him to save Mr. Ishtiwi\u2019s life. She reminded him that she had sheltered him at great personal risk. She pleaded, \u201cFree my son!\u201d Mr. Ishtiwi\u2019s family continued to press officials for his freedom. The last such meeting, with a senior Hamas preacher and two other men at the family\u2019s rented home in Zeitoun, lasted until 2 a.m. on Feb. 7.It was later that very day, after Mr. Ishtiwi said afternoon prayers, that he was killed.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "A Pitch for Kindness Outside Trump Tower in Midtown Manhattan", "Date": "2016-03-15", "News": "If there has been one constant in the tempestuous presidential campaign of Donald J.

{"Headline": "Ortega vs. the Contras: Nicaragua Endures an \u201980s Revival", "Date": "2016-03-07", "News": "Supported by7 PhotosNUEVA SEGOVIA, Nicaragua \u2014 He calls himself Tyson, wears tattered United States Army fatigues and carries a beat-up AK-47.Mr. Ortega\u2019s family, friends and allies enjoy newfound luxuries like beachfront homes and expensive cars. They control fuel companies, television stations and public construction projects, which has many critics comparing his family to the right-wing Somoza dynasty that Mr. Ortega helped topple in 1979.And now rebels are vowing to do the same to him.\u201cDaniel Ortega wasn\u2019t anything, and now he owns half of Nicaragua,\u201d Tyson said.The contras of today, often nicknamed \u201cthe rearmed,\u201d are a shadow of what they once were. They complain they are broke and say the reason they are not more successful is that they do not have international aid, as they did during the Reagan administration.Still, skirmishes in rural areas around the country as recently as last week have left police officers, civilians and soldiers dead, a violent expression of the broader anger brewing against the government.\u201cIt\u2019s a legitimate social cause,\u201d Gonzalo Carri\u00f3n, the director of the Nicaraguan Center for Human Rights, said of the protests against Mr. Ortega.The government denies that politically motivated rebels in the country still exist, despite occasional attacks on police stations and the killings of Sandinistas and known contras. Even when a caravan of Sandinistas was attacked by gunmen after an anniversary celebration in 2014, leaving five dead and 19 wounded, the authorities blamed \u201ccriminal groups\u201d for the massacre.\u201cThere are no armed groups in this country,\u201d Julio C\u00e9sar Avil\u00e9s, the army chief, was widely quoted as saying last year. \u201cI have said it on multiple occasions.\u201dHuman rights organizations accuse the armed forces of a secret assassination campaign. Last summer, a man known as a rebel leader was ambushed and killed in his house. Two people were also killed last year when a backpack sent to rebels by a trusted courier exploded. The most notorious contra leader was gunned down in 2011, and his successor was found full of bullets in a ditch in Honduras a year later.\u201cIt is a silent, dirty war that is not recognized,\u201d said Bishop Abelardo Mata, a Roman Catholic leader who has served as something of a mediator between the two sides. Without any nations backing the rebels, he added, some of them \u201chave resorted\u201d to raising money by working for drug trafficking organizations.\u201cThe army is killing people who were contras in the past,\u201d said Jos\u00e9 N. Rodr\u00edguez, 38, who was injured in the backpack bombing last year. \u201cThey are mounting operations against us by paying off civilians. It is very difficult to win if they pay people off.\u201dRafael Antonio Lanzas, a contra rebel who lost his right eye in the bombing, agreed, saying, \u201cThere are not so many fighters, because they are killing them.\u201dRecovering in a hide-out, the men said they had joined the rebels because they felt targeted for their conservative political beliefs, so they dug up rifles that had been buried for decades.Their mission, Mr. Lanzas said, often involves proselytizing about the newfound riches of the Ortega family and its associates.Venezuela has provided Nicaragua with hundreds of millions of dollars\u2019 worth of oil a year on preferential terms, and the government acknowledges that much of it is invested in private companies closely tied to the Ortega family and its allies.\u201cTo me, it seems they are stealing from the Venezuelans,\u201d said Mr. Carri\u00f3n, the human rights advocate. \u201cThey did not struggle to be chumps.\u201dThe economic turmoil battering Venezuela may prove to be a much bigger threat to the Ortegas than the fledgling rebels. Even so, the oil that Nicaragua has already received in recent years has reshaped the image, and the lifestyles, of the leftist Sandinistas who overthrew a dictatorship in the 1970s.\u201cWe started seeing people in the hierarchy of the ruling party buying luxury cars and $350,000 houses in cash,\u201d said Octavio Enr\u00edquez, an award-winning reporter at Confidencial, a newsmagazine. \u201cWe started to see a new social class.\u201dMr. Ortega\u2019s children and some of their spouses hold top leadership posts at television stations acquired by the government under murky circumstances. His daughter-in-law runs the national chain of gas stations that receives Venezuelan oil. One of Mr. Ortega\u2019s sons, Laureano, who works for the government\u2019s investment promotion agency, was photographed wearing a $47,000 Rolex.The Sandinista party treasurer, Francisco L\u00f3pez, runs the state-owned oil company and a quasi-public entity that has doled out contracts to his own family company to build houses for the poor, Confidencial has reported. Like several other officials, Mr. L\u00f3pez did not respond to requests for an interview.\u201cI would see him coming in from his trips to Venezuela with a diplomatic valise filled with cash,\u201d said Rodrigo Obreg\u00f3n, who worked as a manager at the quasi-public company and attended high school with Mr. L\u00f3pez. \u201cHe and members of his family would close the door and count all night.\u201dMr. Obreg\u00f3n said he lost his job when he refused to sign a rosy audit of the company\u2019s finances.\u201cThe Ortega-Murillo family is getting richer while the country people starve,\u201d a rebel who calls himself Commander Rafael said about the president and his wife, Rosario Murillo. \u201cThey don\u2019t understand resolving things the nice way. They understand weapons.\u201dThe president\u2019s office did not respond to repeated requests for comment. But Bayardo Arce, the president\u2019s economic adviser, who was an original member of the Sandinista directorate during its first time in power, dismissed the issue of Sandinista wealth as a controversy manufactured by the opposition.Mr. Arce defended the use of Venezuelan oil money to fund private companies as a new way of using international development funds, no more improper than the millions of dollars in aid that the United States gives to Nicaraguan civic groups to promote democracy, human rights and governance.He said the Ortega administration must be doing something right. In January, the World Bank projected Nicaragua\u2019s economy to grow by 4.2 percent in 2016, one of the highest rates in Latin America.\u201cOur No. 1 goal is to take this country out of poverty,\u201d Mr. Arce said. \u201cWho decided that the person who believes in social justice has to be barefoot?\u201dMr. Arce, a successful businessman, lives in a handsome home recently built on a 12-acre property confiscated during the war. Though middle-class protesters in the city and contras in the countryside are deeply skeptical of the wealth that has revolved around Mr. Ortega, polls show that the president enjoys strong support.It is no wonder: 38 percent of the Venezuelan oil is used to fund social projects. More than 35,000 houses have been distributed among the poor in the past two years, according to a government website. World Bank statistics show that the poverty level dropped six percentage points from 2005 to 2009.\u201cHe might have an expensive car, but the other presidents before him had their luxuries but did not help the people,\u201d Veronica Aguilar, 55, said of Mr. Ortega.Ms. Aguilar said she met Mr. Ortega in person when she signed up for Houses for the People, a government program that distributes houses to the poor at favorable prices.\u201cHe came over and said \u2018Hello,\u2019 like he knew me!\u201d she said.Her experience underscores the difficulty the rebels face. Few people have a stomach for more war. Many low-income people have benefited from Mr. Ortega\u2019s administration and are hardly bothered by complaints about its excesses.\u201cI won the lottery!\u201d said Ileana Rivas, 62, Ms. Aguilar\u2019s neighbor. She said she got her house by calling a government agency \u2014 and the first lady called her back personally.\u201cYou don\u2019t see those pathetic cases of desperate people in the street that you saw 10, 15 years ago,\u201d said Alejandro Mart\u00ednez, a successful Sandinista businessman who is also an economist. \u201cThere is a distribution of wealth to people who were marginalized before.\u201dThe rebels are not buying it. In a sign of the new allegiance the socialist administration has to the country\u2019s richest people, the government has lifted import taxes for luxury items like yachts and helicopters.\u201cNobody goes to war because they like it,\u201d said Tyson, the rebel. \u201cThe Nicaraguan people are getting robbed.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Googling Is Believing: Trumping the Informed Citizen", "Date": "2016-03-09", "News": "About a week before he used the national political stage to ask viewers to think about Donald Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s \u00e2\u0080\u009cfinger\u00e2\u0080\u009d size, Marco Rubio told the audience during another recent Republican presidential debate to Google \u00e2\u0080\u009cDonald Trump and Polish workers.\u00e2\u0080\u009d They did.Nonetheless, Rubio\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Google gambit and Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s (non)reaction to it, reveals an interesting, and troubling, new change in attitude about a philosophical foundation of democracy: the ideal of an informed citizenry.This is one reason philosophers have always been worried about the ebb and flow of information, and who controls it. Plato argued in \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe Republic\u00e2\u0080\u009d that the fact that democracies couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t control that flow and point it toward truth was one reason they often dissolved into tyranny. In a different vein, Noam Chomsky argued in the 1980s that consent was being \u00e2\u0080\u009cmanufactured\u00e2\u0080\u009d by Big Media \u00e2\u0080\u0094 large consolidated content-delivery companies (like this newspaper) that could cause opinions to sway one way or the other at their whim. Knowledge is power; capture it and you capture power in a democracy.An anthology of essays from The Times\u2019s philosophy series, published by Liveright.The political importance of information \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and the fear that it can be manipulated \u00e2\u0080\u0094 has not changed. What has changed is how we are informed about politics or anything else, or how we aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t. The Big Media that worried Chomsky 30 years ago is largely a thing of the past; many of the largest newspapers are gone, and others are shadows of their former selves. In the halcyon early days of the Internet, when we began excitedly exploring the information Garden of Eden, still free of the shadow of social media, it was easy to think that knowledge itself had become democratic, and that Plato\u00e2\u0080\u0099s worry had at last been shown to be bankrupt. But the worry hasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t gone away \u00e2\u0080\u0094 it has just changed form.The worry is no longer about who controls content. It is about who controls the flow of that content. It is no coincidence that we are now seeing Big Data companies like Facebook sponsor presidential debates. Nor is it a coincidence that people are increasingly following the election on social media, using it both as the source of their information and as the way to get their view out. Consent is still being manufactured, but the manufacturing is being done willingly by us, usually intended for consumption by other people with whom we already agree, facts or no facts.It really isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t a surprise that Rubio would ask us to Google for certain facts; that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s how you and I know almost everything we know nowadays \u00e2\u0080\u0094 it is a way of knowing that is so embedded into the very fabric of our lives that we don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t even notice it. What else could Rubio ask us to do to fact-check Trump? We used to say that seeing is believing; now Googling is believing.Of course, in many ways following that norm \u00e2\u0080\u0094 Google it! \u00e2\u0080\u0094 can help us realize the Jefferson ideal of an informed citizen I sketched above. That ideal, recall, emerges out of the simple fact that reasonable action requires knowledge, and reasonable political action requires political knowledge. And Google places more politically important information at our fingertips than ever before. So if the ideal of being informed means having more information available for uptake, there is a case for saying that we are now closer than ever to realizing that ideal. That is behind the thought, commonly voiced in the early part of this century, that the Internet has \u00e2\u0080\u009cdemocratized\u00e2\u0080\u009d knowledge.One reason for thinking so is that searching the Internet can get you to information that would back up almost any claim of fact, no matter how unfounded. It is both the world\u00e2\u0080\u0099s best fact-checker and the world\u00e2\u0080\u0099s best bias confirmer \u00e2\u0080\u0094 often at the same time. Group polarization on the Internet is a fact of digital life. Liberals \u201cfriend\u201d liberals and share liberal-leaning media stories and opinions with them; conservatives friend conservatives, and do the same.And the flow of digital information is just as prone to manipulation as its content \u00e2\u0080\u0094 even when that flow is directed at an audience larger than our own immediate circle. Take an example: Search for \u00e2\u0080\u009cwhat really happened to the dinosaurs\u00e2\u0080\u009d and one of the top results is likely to be from a site called answersingenesis.org \u00e2\u0080\u0094 not, I suggest, a good source of information on the T-Rex. But it illustrates how canny use of search engine metrics can be used to push an agenda. No wonder Trump and his followers on Twitter immediately shrugged off Rubio\u00e2\u0080\u0099s inconvenient truths; there is nothing to fear from information when counterinformation is just as plentiful.That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s why the real worry here isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t about the regrettable if obvious fact that citizens are less informed than our ideals demand. Nor is it simply the amusing specter of candidates\u00e2\u0080\u0099 shouting competing Googling instructions at the audience like so many carnival barkers. The real worry concerns our faith in the ideal of an informed citizenry itself. That worry, as I see it, has two faces.Read previous contributions to this series.Second, the danger is that increasing recognition of the fact that Googling can get you wherever you want to go can make us deeply cynical about the ideal of an informed citizenry \u00e2\u0080\u0094 for the simple reason that what counts as an \u00e2\u0080\u009cinformed\u00e2\u0080\u009d citizen is a matter of dispute. We no longer disagree just over values. Nor do we disagree just over the facts. We disagree over whose source \u00e2\u0080\u0094 whose fountain of facts \u00e2\u0080\u0094 is the right one.And once disagreement reaches that far down, the daylight of reason seems very far away indeed.More From Fixes \u00bbMore From Private Lives \u00bbMore From Couch \u00bbMore From The Stone \u00bbMore From Moviegoers \u00bbMore From The End \u00bbMore From Draft \u00bbMore From Anxiety \u00bbMore From Menagerie \u00bbMore From Disunion \u00bbMore From Bedside \u00bbMore From The Conversation \u00bbMore From The Great Divide \u00bbMore From Errol Morris \u00bbFollowAdvertisement"}

John Kasich in that state\u2019s primary on Tuesday, giving fresh momentum to efforts to stop Donald J. Trump a day after a debate in which his rivals declined to take a swing at the leading Republican presidential candidate. Alex Conant, Mr. Rubio\u2019s spokesman, made the comments in an interview with CNN. He said that he hoped supporters of Mr. Kasich and of Senator Ted Cruz would support Mr. Rubio in his home state primary in Florida, and that he would suggest Mr. Rubio\u2019s backers in Ohio do the same by supporting Mr. Kasich there. \u201cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099m just stating the obvious,\u201d Mr. Conant said. \u201cIf you are a Republican primary voter in Ohio and you want to defeat Donald Trump, your best chance in Ohio is John Kasich, because John Kasich is the sitting governor, he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s very close to Donald Trump in some of the polls there.\u201dHe said the reverse was true in Mr. Rubio\u2019s home state, suggesting that supporters of Mr. Kasich and Mr. Cruz back Mr. Rubio there. The remarks dovetail with a strategy proposed by Mitt Romney, the party\u2019s 2012 nominee, who urged Republicans opposing Mr. Trump to coalesce around the leading non-Trump candidate in coming nominating contests to deny the nomination to the Manhattan businessman.Mr. Conant said that \u201cJohn Kasich is the one candidate in Ohio that can beat Donald Trump \u00e2\u0080\u0094 that\u2019s stating the obvious, that is indisputable.\u201dIn a news conference in West Palm Beach, Mr. Rubio echoed the sentiment, but did not go as far in urging his supporters to back Mr. Kasich in Ohio. \u201cClearly John Kasich has a better chance than winning Ohio than I do,\u201d Mr. Rubio told reporters. And if Ohioans concluded that the best way to stop Mr. Trump was to vote for Mr. Kasich, the Florida senator said, \u201cI expect that\u2019s the decision they\u2019ll make.\u201dAsked directly if he was urging his people to vote for Mr. Kasich in Ohio, he said of his spokesman, \u201cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll leave it for John to make that argument.\u201dAnd Mr. Cruz, speaking in Orlando on Friday, dismissed the strategy, indulging in a laugh when asked about it.\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the Washington establishment\u00e2\u0080\u0099s last gasp: \u00e2\u0080\u0098Let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s divide things up. Let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s play games,\u00e2\u0080\u0099\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Cruz said in a taped interview with Fox News. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s real, real simple. How do you beat Donald Trump? You beat him.\u00e2\u0080\u009dMr. Cruz argued, as he has for weeks, that he was the only candidate still capable of doing so.Those hoping to defeat Mr. Trump acknowledge that if he wins either Ohio or Florida, it becomes much harder to deny him the nomination. But Chris Schrimpf, a spokesman for Mr. Kasich, naturally welcomed the idea of having Mr. Rubio\u2019s supporters back the governor in Tuesday\u2019s voting in Ohio.\u201cWe agree with the Rubio campaign that the best chance to beat Donald Trump in Ohio is by voting for John Kasich, and in that spirit, Senator Rubio should immediately tell his Super PAC to stop attacking the governor.\u201dMatt Flegenheimer and Thomas Kaplan contributed reporting.\n\t\tFirst Draft provides fast-paced and comprehensive coverage of politics and elections by The New York Times.

{"Headline": "Poll Watch: Majority Says Supreme Court Nominee Deserves a Vote", "Date": "2016-03-22", "News": "Fifty-three percent say the Senate should hold a vote on President Obama\u00e2\u0080\u0099s nominee, while 42 percent  say the Senate should wait until next year for the new president to nominate someone. The poll finds views sharply divided by party, with three-quarters of Democrats wanting a vote on Judge Garland and two-thirds of Republicans opposed. Independents are closely divided.A wide majority of Americans, moreover \u00e2\u0080\u0093 more than seven in 10 \u00e2\u0080\u0093 think Senate Republican leaders are refusing to hold hearings mostly for political reasons rather than because they think delay is best for the country. That view is shared by nine in 10 Democrats, three-quarters of independents and even a slim majority of Republicans.The poll finds that the issue of which judge sits on the Supreme Court is a consequential one to most Americans, with 68 percent saying it is at least very important to them. That includes 37 percent who call it extremely important; in 2005, fewer \u00e2\u0080\u0093 22 percent \u00e2\u0080\u0093 said so. Majorities of very liberal and very conservative Americans say it is extremely important to them (54 percent and 55 percent, respectively). Republicans are more apt than Democrats or independents to say so.     Yet, not surprisingly, few have formed an opinion of Judge Garland, who was nominated less than a week ago and is on the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. Twenty-one percent express a favorable view of him, while 7 percent have an unfavorable view and the rest have no opinion yet. Among those who have been following news about the appointment very closely, 40 percent have a positive view of him, compared with 15 percent negative. The nationwide telephone poll was conducted March 17-20 on cellphones and landlines with 1,252 adults and has a margin of sampling error of plus or minus three percentage points. This is one of an occasional series of posts taking a deeper look at polling during this campaign cycle.\n\t\tFirst Draft provides fast-paced and comprehensive coverage of politics and elections by The New York Times.
