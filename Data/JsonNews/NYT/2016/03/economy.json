{"Headline": "The Death of the Latin American Left", "Date": "2016-03-22", "News": "Supported byOp-Ed ContributorThe \u201cpink tide\u201d is ebbing. Why has this happened now? And what can the left learn as it recedes from power?Since Hugo Ch\u00e1vez\u2019s 1998 election in Venezuela, moderate or hard-line left-of-center parties, movements and leaders have ruled much of Latin America. Left-wing incumbents were re-elected, or their handpicked replacements won handily. With a few important exceptions, these administrations governed well, improved their constituents\u2019 lives and enacted sensible macroeconomic policies.The recent defeats largely stem from this economic reality. But not exclusively. Too many Latin American leftist leaders fell prey to the region\u2019s endemic corruption \u2014 and underestimated growing intolerance to it. By the time some governments, like Chile\u2019s and Bolivia\u2019s, started to focus on the issue, it was too late. They had become as deeply enmeshed in Latin America\u2019s tradition of corrupt practices as their conservative predecessors, civilian or military, elected or imposed.There were other mistakes, too. While several leftist governments \u2014 in Chile, Brazil, Uruguay and, up to a point, Bolivia \u2014 resisted authoritarian temptations, many did not entirely. Some muzzled the press, stacked the judiciary, harassed opposition leaders and tampered with electoral systems. Others failed to deal with growing crime and violence.Given the poor state of the economy and the ubiquity of corruption scandals, the left looks likely to continue losing elections: in Brazil, if new ones are held soon; in Ecuador in 2017; and through a recall vote in Venezuela, perhaps later this year. One day, though, leftist parties will win again. When that time comes, the left of tomorrow should learn two lessons from the beginning of this century.First, saving money for bad times is not just a biblical precept. If the left is in power when the next commodity boom comes along, governments need to make provisions for the future. Venezuela and Ecuador should take advantage of higher oil prices \u2014 if they come \u2014 to create contingency funds under autonomous management. Chile and Peru should do the same with copper.The region\u2019s new middle classes applauded the building projects and health and education programs that were paid for with commodity-boom cash. They deplored the cuts to these efforts, no matter how justified or inevitable they may have been. But left-wing governments should find ways to maintain those programs when revenues shrink. The way to do it is not to pray for more diversified economies \u2014 Latin America has never had those and won\u2019t for a long time \u2014 but rather to manage resource-based economies more wisely and presciently.But the rainy-day dollars need to be looked after transparently. Which takes us to the second lesson: The causes of corruption across the region \u2014 a lack of accountability, a culture of lawlessness, weak institutions and civil society \u2014 can affect politicians of the right and left alike. There was no reason to expect that if the old Venezuelan politicians took bribes and traded favors that the new Bolivarian elite would not. Mr. da Silva\u2019s Workers Party came from humble origins in the labor movement, but the fact that it never signed a sweetheart contract when it was in the opposition turned out to be meaningless. Latin American parties should take heed.In the end, the left-wing surge of the early 2000s may have been undone by high expectations as much as anything else. When oil prices fell and Ecuador\u2019s government was no longer able to pay for new roads and more schools, the country\u2019s people got angry because the growth to which they had become accustomed disappeared. When Mr. da Silva was charged with corruption, it showed that he had failed to deliver the change he promised. The leftists came into power with high hopes and big dreams, only to see themselves exposed by their enemies. The best thing to happen to Latin America in recent times has been the clamor for integrity in government; next time around, the left should take up this banner, instead of neglecting it.Jorge G. Casta\u00f1eda, Mexico\u2019s foreign minister from 2000 to 2003, is a professor at New York University.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Europe\u2019s Illiberal Democracies", "Date": "2016-03-09", "News": "Supported byParis \u2014 Twenty-five years ago, in February 1991, the leaders of Poland, Czechoslovakia and Hungary met in Visegrad, a Hungarian town overlooking the Danube. Those three countries had recently broken free of the Soviet bloc; their newly elected leaders, Lech Walesa, Vaclav Havel and Jozsef Antall, had taken an active part in the liberation. Two, Mr. Havel and Mr. Walesa, had been jailed for their activities.The Visegrad meeting had one central purpose: to accelerate the integration of the three countries into a free, democratic and prosperous Europe, through NATO and what was then the European Economic Community of 12 member states. Western European leaders looked favorably on the Visegrad Group: Central Europeans could practice regional cooperation before joining the adults\u2019 group of what would become the European Union.Visegrad was where the kings of Bohemia, Hungary and Poland parlayed in 1335. Since then, these nations had gone through many wars and occupations, their borders redrawn several times, or even dissolved altogether.Today, the Visegrad bloc is experiencing a resurgence of sorts. In a splintering familiar to Central Europe, the Visegrad Three became four: Czechoslovakia ceased to exist in 1993, giving way to the Czech Republic and Slovakia.All four joined the European Union in 2004. But when they get together today, it is to fight the union. Over the centuries, they have been dominated by Prussia, Austria, Germany and Russia; in 2016, the common enemy is Brussels. To Western Europeans, it is unsettling to see a new East-West divide emerging, threatening to fracture the European Union itself.The Visegrad countries\u2019 opposition to Brussels is different from Britain\u2019s. They don\u2019t want to leave the union, they just refuse to abide by some of its rules. The Romanian-born French political scientist Pierre Hassner has reminded us of the concept of \u201ccollective neurosis,\u201d a notion devised by the Hungarian philosopher Istvan Bibo in his 1946 book \u201cThe Misery of the Small Eastern European States.\u201d Bibo described the existential angst of Eastern and Central European states leading sometimes to \u201cpolitical hysteria.\u201dPolitical hysteria reigns today over the European Commission initiative to assign refugee quotas to each member state. Mr. Havel and Mr. Antall, the voices of reason, have passed away. Mr. Walesa, the hero of the Solidarity movement, is fighting accusations of collaborating with Poland\u2019s former Communist authorities. In parliamentary elections in Slovakia, where Prime Minister Robert Fico has indulged in fierce anti-immigrant rhetoric, a far-right party with neo-Nazi ties just won 14 seats.The new rulers in Warsaw, Prague, Bratislava and Budapest flatly refuse Muslim refugees. They don\u2019t want the ethnic, religious and cultural homogeneity of their societies to change. They see multiculturalism as a failed model.Hearing such messages from Donald J. Trump or Marine Le Pen is bad enough, but from the leaders of these new democracies?The way these leaders practice democracy, bending the rule of law as far as they can within an elected government, is equally unsettling to the older democracies of Western Europe. Another French political scientist, the Czech-born Jacques Rupnik, has identified two converging trends.\u201cWe are witnessing a democratic regression and identity-related tensions on migration, and both phenomena are strengthening each other,\u201d he told me. \u201cThe same nationalist conservative authoritarianism at work in domestic politics also applies to the response to the refugee crisis, notably different from the European Commission\u2019s and most other member states\u2019 responses.\u201dOnce the poster children of post-Communist transition, these countries were not supposed to take such a turn. With its so-called goulash socialism, Hungary was the most liberal of the Soviet satellites and eased peacefully into democratic rule. Poland was more restless, but once it had been the catalyst for the collapse of Communism, it managed the shock therapy of moving to a market economy with impressive discipline. The Czechs and Slovaks, it was hoped, would behave as Mr. Havel\u2019s enlightened heirs.But no Communist country had ever experienced these radical shifts to democracy and market economics. Only Czechoslovakia had enjoyed genuine democratic rule, between the two world wars. The end of the Cold War made Europeans euphoric: Once democratic institutions were built, free elections held and centralized economies replaced with capitalist ones, everyone assumed the job was done.Joining NATO and the European Union was the icing on the cake. In 2008, with \u201cend of history\u201d hubris, a World Bank report proclaimed that the transition was over. Mission accomplished.Obviously, it was not. The effort to transform the economy was so demanding for the new democratic elites that little attention was paid to nurturing a new political culture. Modern Hungarian and Polish politics look riven with the legacy of Communism, trouble with sharing power, conspiracy theories and exclusionary discourse toward opponents.Another, overlooked, factor is that most people in these countries are still poor. Despite nonstop economic growth since 1992, Poland\u2019s gross domestic product is only 68 percent of the European Union\u2019s per capita average. When Poland\u2019s foreign minister, Witold Waszczykowski, says the world should not move in one single direction \u2014 \u201ctoward a new mix of cultures and races, a world of cyclists and vegetarians\u201d \u2014 he is rejecting the progressive social values perceived as part of the Western European economic model.The Visegrad bloc has welcomed European Union subsidies, so crucial to their development. But we in Old Europe never really insisted that a democratic culture and diversity were also part of the deal; we didn\u2019t think we had to.Is the rise of so-called illiberal democracy threatening the union\u2019s cohesion? Maybe. But Euroskeptic populist movements are far from a purely Central European phenomenon; they are also on the move in the union\u2019s founding member states. Twenty-five years after the Visegrad summit, Europe is still searching for unity \u2014 but the mood has shifted: from solidarity to recrimination.Sylvie Kauffmann, the editorial director and a former editor in chief of Le Monde, is a contributing opinion writer.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Donald Trump Laces Into Japan With a Trade Tirade From the \u201980s", "Date": "2016-03-07", "News": "Supported byTOKYO \u2014 Donald J. Trump has often aimed his raucous brand of disparagement at foreign countries during his presidential run. There is China, \u201cripping off\u201d the United States on trade and stealing its jobs. And Mexico, closing its eyes to a flood of migrants and drugs across the border.But his preoccupation with Japan is perhaps more unusual, if not anachronistic.Mr. Trump chastised Japan last week in a Republican candidates\u2019 debate, naming it along with China and Mexico as countries where \u201cwe are getting absolutely crushed on trade.\u201d He has previously accused Japan of manipulating its currency to achieve an unfair economic advantage, and of exploiting its military alliance with the United States to protect itself at little risk and cost.His complaints are reminiscent of another era, when Japan\u2019s economy was booming and its companies were buying trophy American assets like movie studios and Rockefeller Center. Since the 1990s, though, Japan\u2019s growth has been mostly flat, and trade friction much more subdued, even as the United States continues to run large trade deficits with Japan.Whereas Japanese officials once feared so-called Japan-bashing by Americans, today they are more likely to lament \u201cJapan-passing,\u201d a shift in attention to places viewed as more dynamic, like China.\u201cTrump\u2019s comments on Japan remind me of the period from the late 1970s to the mid-1990s, when Japan was considered a serious rival to American economic pre-eminence,\u201d said Glen S. Fukushima, a former United States trade official who is now a senior fellow at the Center for American Progress, a liberal policy group. \u201cIt\u2019s interesting that despite the two-decade stagnation of the Japanese economy, Trump is now reviving the idea of Japan as an economic rival robbing America of jobs.\u201dMr. Trump\u2019s ascendance has begun to cause serious unease in Japan. Even if his run ends short of the White House, the worry is that an election dominated by such talk could leave the United States more closed to trade and less willing to defend its allies.\u201cMy friends in the Foreign Ministry are in a state of panic,\u201d said Kiichi Fujiwara, an expert on international politics at the University of Tokyo. \u201cThis is the first time in a long time that we\u2019ve seen straightforward protectionism from an American presidential candidate.\u201dMajor Japanese newspapers published critical editorials a day after Mr. Trump\u2019s sweeping victories in the Super Tuesday primaries last week.\u201cIf there is a big shake-up in American politics, there is a danger that Japan could become an outlet for popular dissatisfaction with the spread of inequality and other issues,\u201d The Nikkei financial daily said.One concern is that Mr. Trump\u2019s rivals will shift to more isolationist positions to counter him. Last month, Hillary Clinton, the Democratic front-runner, who is also contending with skepticism on trade from her party rival, Bernie Sanders, criticized China and Japan in an opinion piece published in American regional newspapers.Mrs. Clinton has also backed away from her support of the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a 12-nation trade deal that includes Japan and is awaiting ratification by the participating countries. She helped promote the deal as secretary of state.\u201cWe\u2019re already drawing up new laws and regulations, but it could all unravel,\u201d said a senior Japanese official involved in the deal, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the discussions are confidential. \u201cOur best hope is to ratify it quickly, along with other countries, to put pressure on the U.S. to follow through.\u201dAs he does with China, Mr. Trump accuses Japan of taking American jobs.After his victories on Super Tuesday, he called out Komatsu, a Japanese manufacturer of construction machinery, saying the weak yen gave it an unfair advantage over its American rival Caterpillar. He pledged to use equipment from Caterpillar and John Deere, another American manufacturer, to build his promised wall on the border with Mexico to keep out illegal immigrants.Globalization has stirred the public anxiety over jobs that Mr. Trump is seizing on. Japan exports more than twice as much to the United States as it buys.But globalization has also blurred lines between foreign and domestic companies in ways not accounted for in Mr. Trump\u2019s criticisms.In addition to its factories in Japan, Komatsu has plants overseas, including three in the United States \u2014 though it imports key components, like hydraulic pumps and motors, from Japan, where it also keeps its high-paying design and engineering operations. Caterpillar and John Deere are much the same, manufacturing at home and overseas but keeping engineering mostly in the United States.Still, Mr. Trump\u2019s attacks could play well in places like Michigan and Ohio, important primary states.Their economies have suffered as manufacturing has moved abroad. Carmakers and unions, still influential forces in those states, have been vocal critics of the way Japan\u2019s government has let the yen depreciate.\u201cThe last thing I want to do is come off as defending Donald Trump, but there is an issue with the yen,\u201d said an official at the United Automobile Workers union, which traditionally supports Democrats.Japan\u2019s currency has fallen as much as 40 percent against the dollar since 2012, though it is up somewhat this year. The decline has made Japanese carmakers like Toyota and Honda more profitable by increasing the value of their overseas sales.Japanese officials say the yen\u2019s fall is simply a side effect of domestic policies aimed at ending persistent deflation, not a deliberate effort to gain an edge in trade. Yet Prime Minister Shinzo Abe campaigned openly in 2012 for weakening the yen to aid Japanese manufacturers.\u201cJust because the Japanese government no longer repeats that, doesn\u2019t mean the goal has changed,\u201d said Stephen E. Biegun, Ford\u2019s vice president for international governmental affairs.No one can accuse Mr. Trump of coming to the issue late. He has been saying many of the same things for decades.\u201cThey come over here, they sell their cars, their VCRs. They knock the hell out of our companies,\u201d he told Oprah Winfrey in 1988. In a Playboy interview in 1990, he said: \u201cFirst they take all our money with their consumer goods, then they put it back in buying all of Manhattan.\u201dOn military matters, Mr. Trump has expressed dissatisfaction with the United States\u2019 decades-old alliance with Japan. It obliges the United States to go to Japan\u2019s aid if Japan is attacked. But Japan is not obliged to do the same, because of its war-renouncing Constitution, which was imposed by occupying American forces after World War II.Mr. Abe says he, too, is unhappy with the \u201cunbalanced\u201d alliance. He has been trying to carve out a more active role for Japan\u2019s military, despite opposition from constitutional experts and much of the Japanese public.If the United States turned toward isolationism, the Japanese prime minister would be emboldened. But it would be a delicate balancing act. An American disengagement from Asia in the face of an increasingly assertive China and North Korea would be a harrowing situation for Japan\u2019s leaders.\u201cThe U.S. has been saying for some time that Japan needs to bear more of the burden for regional stability,\u201d said Jiro Aichi, a member of Parliament from Mr. Abe\u2019s Liberal Democratic Party. \u201cTrump is saying it in a more extreme way, but it\u2019s a fact that Japan has to do more.\u201dJonathan Soble reported from Tokyo and Keith Bradsher from Hong Kong.Advertisement"}

Egypt\u2019s Financial Crisis Hits the Rich", "Date": "2016-03-10", "News": "Supported byCAIRO \u2014 Gucci Corner is the nickname for a bustling plaza at the private American University in Cairo, where well-heeled students hang out between classes and strut their imported fashions.Zeyad Mohamed, 19, a business student, said he was shocked to discover on a recent visit to a Mercedes-Benz showroom that his desired model would not be available for 18 months. \u201cNormally I\u2019m not interested in politics \u2014 if it doesn\u2019t affect me, I don\u2019t care,\u201d Mr. Mohamed said, reflecting a disengagement that is typical among well-to-do youth. \u201cBut this is a problem. And things are getting more expensive.\u201dWealthy Egyptians were among President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi\u2019s most ardent supporters after he seized power in 2013, favoring stability and a harsh crackdown on Islamists, even at the cost of civil liberties. But that loyalty is being tested now, as Egypt\u2019s severe shortage of foreign currency cripples businesses, impedes luxury imports and crimps their lifestyles. And that has prompted a tide of unusually sharp criticism of Mr. Sisi.Mr. Sisi is using what scarce resources he has mainly to help the poor \u2014 and the seven million people on the state\u2019s payroll \u2014 by propping up the value of Egypt\u2019s currency. Politically, that makes sense: Mr. Sisi is mindful of the popular protests that drove President Hosni Mubarak from office in 2011. Even so, the poor have suffered from shortages of some staples, like cooking oil, while the rich are confronted with restrictions that amount to a sharp pinch, if not quite pain.\u201cThat\u2019s what\u2019s new \u2014 the suffering of the rich,\u201d said Ibrahim Eissa, a prominent journalist who was once among Mr. Sisi\u2019s loudest advocates, but who recently published a withering attack on the president\u2019s policies. Mr. Eissa said: \u201cNo class or demographic is happy now, from Alexandria to Upper Egypt. Sisi isn\u2019t satisfying anyone.\u201dStringent new government regulations restrict the use of Egyptian credit cards abroad and limit purchases of foreign currency. Business people seeking American dollars have scrambled to the black market, where the price has jumped 20 percent in recent months. Meanwhile, their families are faced with sharp rises in supermarket prices, long waits for luxury cars and worries about obtaining enough dollars or euros to pay for foreign vacations or for their children to study abroad.Last weekend at U Bistro, a lounge with a buzzing bar filled with local high rollers, the price of the dollar was \u201call people are talking about,\u201d said Dina Alhassani, an education consultant at one of the tables. \u201cPeople are worried,\u201d she said. \u201cThere\u2019s a sense of anxiety about what comes next.\u201dThe worsening currency crisis \u2014 one headline this week spoke of a \u201cdollar fever\u201d \u2014 is one of several woes facing Mr. Sisi, who is also under fire for rights violations by his security forces. The strain appeared to show in a recent speech where he lashed out at critics, urged them to \u201cshut up,\u201d and told the audience, \u201cPlease, do not listen to anyone but me.\u201dThe hectoring, emotional tone of that speech drew derision on the Internet. After Mr. Sisi rhetorically offered to ease the crisis by \u201cselling\u201d himself, one Internet user set up an eBay page with his picture, offering a \u201cslightly used field marshal\u201d for sale. The page attracted bids of over $100,000 before it was shut down.Such mockery can be dangerous to practice inside Egypt, where many Sisi critics languish in jail. But the widespread mirth that the gag inspired seemed to illustrate how the president\u2019s aura has dimmed.In Mr. Sisi\u2019s defense, government officials point to external factors driving the crisis. The country\u2019s already-struggling tourism industry, a crucial earner of foreign exchange, was devastated after a Russian airliner crashed in the Sinai Desert on Oct. 31, probably as a result of a bomb. The country\u2019s tourism minister says that the slump has cost Egypt $1.3 billion in revenue since then, and that the number of visitors to the country was down 44 percent in January.The wealthy make up only a small fraction of Egypt\u2019s 90 million people, while 26 percent of the population lives below the poverty line, according to the United Nations. And they are increasingly living apart, in Palm Beach-style gated communities ringing Cairo, far from the crumbling infrastructure and chronic poverty of the city center.But it is really businesses large and small that have been bearing the brunt of the currency crisis. General Motors has a car plant in Egypt, but it had to temporarily halt production recently because it could not get the parts it needed. Foreign airlines have threatened to curtail flights to Egypt because of rules blocking them from repatriating profits. For a time, British Airways stopped selling tickets in Egyptian currency.At the Gezira Sporting Club in Zamalek, an island in central Cairo, wealthy parents said they were struggling to pay their children\u2019s tuition at private schools that require payment in dollars or euros. \u201cSisi has lost popularity with the upper segment of society,\u201d said a businessman, Ashraf Omran. \u201cHe gave a good story, and people want to believe in it. But you need to follow through. We haven\u2019t seen that.\u201dThe argument has been most heated on influential TV stations that were once staunchly pro-Sisi but have now adopted a more critical tone. \u201cI hated that speech,\u201d Youssef al Hosseiny of ONtv said, referring to Mr. Sisi\u2019s much-derided remarks last week. \u201cHe looked isolated, and he looked angry. He\u2019s been in power for just 20 months. It\u2019s too early to be isolated.\u201dThe president\u2019s popularity has been hurt by more than just the economy, Mr. Hosseiny said. The recent imprisonment of a TV evangelist, a novelist and a poet, all on charges related to religion and public morality, has stoked worries about free speech. Government critics are regularly prevented from leaving the country, including the journalist Hossam Bahgat and the human rights advocate Gamal Eid.And after a policeman shot and killed a taxi driver two weeks ago in an argument over a fare, a furious crowd surged through the streets, defying laws banning public protests.Still, there remain plenty of Egyptians, rich and poor, who continue to see Mr. Sisi as a bulwark against the instability that has roiled other countries in the region.At a sale for imported designer fashions on the banks of the Nile last weekend, Hala Mahmoud defended the president. \u201cPeople are trying to frame Sisi, as if he did something wrong,\u201d she said. \u201cBut he\u2019s a military man, and we face a lot of problems here.\u201dTo older Egyptians, the shortages of luxury goods recall earlier periods of economic belt-tightening in the 1990s and 2000s. \u201cWe understand it,\u201d said Hany Genena, chief economist at Beltone Financial, an investment house in Cairo. Noting that many foreign investors see Egypt as an attractive medium-term bet, he said, \u201cJust forget the next two years.\u201dYoung Egyptians may have less patience. At the American University in Cairo, Nada el Halaswany, a recent graduate, said her family had voted for Mr. Sisi. But the hotel her father manages on the Red Sea is virtually empty now, and she is applying for jobs in Dubai, United Arab Emirates.\u201cI don\u2019t see any positive change on the horizon,\u201d she said.Advertisement"}

In late 2014, it agreed to a 1.2 billion euro ($1.3 billion) loan agreement with the International Monetary Fund, under which it is required to shore up its finances by, among other things, privatizing state industries.Improved relations between Serbia and Kosovo are seen by the European Union as a prerequisite for the two countries to join the bloc.Because of an editing error, an article on Saturday about a decision by the president of Serbia, Tomislav Nikolic, to dissolve Parliament as the government seeks a new mandate to pursue an economic agenda it regards as essential to qualify for membership in the European Union misidentified the newest member of the union.

{"Headline": "Obama Declares a New Partnership After Talks With Argentine Leader", "Date": "2016-03-23", "News": "Supported byMr. Obama, the first American president to hold high-level talks with an Argentine leader in 20 years, used his visit to try to jump-start collaboration on defense and security issues, as well as energy and climate change.\u201cThe United States stands ready to work with Argentina through this historic transition in any way that we can,\u201d Mr. Obama told reporters, fielding questions beside Mr. Macri after they met at the Casa Rosada, the president\u2019s office.\u201cUnder President Macri, Argentina is reassuming its traditional leadership role in the region and around the world,\u201d Mr. Obama said. \u201cOn a range of areas, we discussed the way in which the United States and Argentina can be strong global partners to promote the universal values and interests that we share.\u201dOn Thursday, he will visit a riverside memorial park here that honors thousands of people associated with leftist ideology who were systematically kidnapped and murdered during the dictatorship, a gesture toward human rights activists who were infuriated by the timing of his visit.\u201cWe are absolutely determined to do our part as Argentina continues to heal and move forward as one nation,\u201d Mr. Obama said. \u201cI hope this gesture also helps to rebuild trust that may have been lost between our two countries \u2014 and that\u2019s a principal message that I have not only for Argentina but for the entire hemisphere.\u201dStill, Mr. Obama was vague when an Argentine journalist asked him what the American government\u2019s role had been in the brutal dictatorship, saying he did not want to rehash 100 years\u2019 worth of United States involvement in Latin America. \u201cThere are moments of great success and glory, and there are moments that were counterproductive, or contrary to what I believe America should stand for,\u201d Mr. Obama said.Mr. Macri declined to guess at what the documents would show about Washington\u2019s role in the dirty war, which lasted from 1976 until 1983, but he said Argentina had a right to find out.\u201cWe all need and we are entitled to know what the truth is,\u201d he said.The talks, coming immediately after Mr. Obama\u2019s historic visit to Cuba, were somewhat overshadowed by the groundbreaking nature of that trip and by the terrorist attacks in Brussels on Tuesday. Both presidents paused on Wednesday to offer their condolences to the Belgians and to condemn the latest violence.But the warm tone of Mr. Obama\u2019s meeting with Mr. Macri was in stark contrast to President George W. Bush\u2019s visit in 2005, when he went to a summit meeting of Western Hemisphere nations seeking to push through a free-trade agreement for the Americas.A decade later, both Mr. Ch\u00e1vez and Mr. Kirchner are dead, the momentum sapped from their leftist movement, and Argentina\u2019s new center-right government is pursuing cozier ties with Washington.\u201cThis is the beginning of a new phase of mature, intelligent, constructive relations in which the only concern for us both is to improve the quality of life of our people,\u201d Mr. Macri said. He called Mr. Obama an \u201cinspiring\u201d leader who had shown him and others around the world that by challenging the status quo, it was possible to bring about major change.Mr. Macri, the scion of a wealthy family and a former mayor of Buenos Aires, is also repositioning Argentina internationally, courting global business leaders and welcoming his counterparts from Europe and the United States.The moves reverse the strategy of his predecessor and Mr. Kirchner\u2019s widow, Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez de Kirchner. Her nationalist policies often hindered trade and investment, and she reveled in pitting herself against Argentina\u2019s business establishment and the United States, preferring to cultivate ties with Russia and China.Mr. Macri has moved to end a prolonged debt dispute by reaching an agreement with litigating hedge funds in New York, although the deal still requires approval from the Argentine Senate.Mr. Obama declined to comment Wednesday on the agreement because it is pending in a United States court, but he called Mr. Macri\u2019s approach \u201cconstructive,\u201d comparing it to his own decisions early on in his presidency to address the American financial crisis.\u201cSometimes, short-term pain and taking decisive action early is the right thing to do, rather than putting it off to ma\u00f1ana, and then you end up having a perpetual set of problems and you never restore the kind of stability and trust that\u2019s necessary,\u201d Mr. Obama said.The president was taking in as much Argentine culture as he could during his first visit to the nation. On Wednesday he had his first drink of mat\u00e9, calling it \u201cquite good,\u201d and was to attend a state dinner in the evening.On Thursday, he and his family plan to take a day trip to Bariloche, a lakeside tourist city in Patagonia visited by Theodore Roosevelt, Dwight D. Eisenhower and Bill Clinton.In Buenos Aires, Mr. Obama\u2019s visit stirred mixed feelings from residents grappling with whether closer ties with the United States was in their country\u2019s interests.\u201cThey have always tried to put it into our heads that the United States is the enemy,\u201d said Alberto Gonz\u00e1lez, 59, a watch salesman who had come to the plaza opposite the presidential palace here to soak up the atmosphere. \u201cBut I think we need to have good relations with the whole world.\u201dFacundo Toloza, 19, an industrial painter, said he was \u201cnot convinced\u201d by Mr. Obama\u2019s visit.\u201cUnfortunately,\u201d he said over a morning coffee at a street stall, \u201cthe United States has a history of using other countries and exploiting their resources for its own needs.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "On Trade, Donald Trump Breaks With 200 Years of Economic Orthodoxy", "Date": "2016-03-10", "News": "Supported byAdd a few \u201cwhereins\u201d and \u201cwhences\u201d and that sentiment would conform nicely to the worldview of the first Queen Elizabeth of 16th-century England, to the 17th-century court of Louis XIV, or to Prussia\u2019s Iron Chancellor, Otto von Bismarck, in the 19th century. The great powers of bygone centuries subscribed to the economic theory of mercantilism, \u201cWherein we must ever observe this rule: to sell more to strangers yearly than we consume of theirs in value,\u201d as its apostle, the East India Company director Thomas Mun, wrote in the 1600s.Now Mr. Trump is bringing mercantilism back. The New York billionaire is challenging the last 200 years of economic orthodoxy that trade among nations is good, and that more is better.He is well on his way to becoming the first Republican nominee in nearly a century who has called for higher tariffs, or import taxes, as a broad defense against low-cost imports. And there is a good chance he would face a Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton, who has expressed fewer reservations about trade, inverting a longstanding political dynamic.Mr. Trump\u2019s mercantilism is among his oldest and steadiest public positions. Since at least the 1980s, he has described trade as a zero-sum game in which countries lose by paying for imports. The trade deficit with China, which reached $366 billion last year, makes America the biggest loser. \u201cOur trade deficit with China is like having a business that continues to lose money every single year,\u201d Mr. Trump told The Daily News in August. \u201cWho would do business like that?\u201dDuring the current campaign, he has regularly advocated tariffs as the best solution.He has promised to penalize American companies that build foreign factories. For months, his favored example was Ford, which announced plans last summer to expand in Mexico. More recently, he has called out Carrier, which is shifting air-conditioner production to Mexico from Indiana.\u201cI will call the head of Carrier and I will say, \u2018I hope you enjoy your new building,\u2019 \u201d Mr. Trump said last month. \u201c\u2018I hope you enjoy Mexico. Here\u2019s the story, folks: Every single air-conditioning unit that you build and send across our border \u2014 you\u2019re going to pay a 35 percent tax on that unit.\u2019 \u201dEconomists have long struggled against the popular view that exports are a measure of economic vitality while imports are evidence of regrettable dependence.They argue that the opposite is true.Everyone can buy a cheaper air-conditioner when Carrier debarks for a lower-cost country, but a few hundred people will lose their livelihoods.Pietra Rivoli, a finance professor at Georgetown University who explored the effect of increased globalization in her 2005 book, \u201cThe Travels of a T-Shirt in the Global Economy,\u201d said Mr. Trump might be finding a receptive audience in part because the United States had provided relatively little help to workers harmed by trade.\u201cYou have much more negative sentiment about trade in the U.S. than you do in pretty much any other wealthy country, and they\u2019ve lost their T-shirt jobs, too,\u201d Ms. Rivoli said. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on there is that in those countries, which are even more exposed to trade than we are, those countries have a bigger safety net.\u201dMr. Trump has also accused other nations, notably Japan and China, of cheating by suppressing the value of their currencies to make their exports cheaper.\u201cI am all for free trade, but it\u2019s got to be fair,\u201d Mr. Trump has said repeatedly.Economists persuaded governments to abandon mercantilism by demonstrating that trade barriers imposed higher prices on the masses while narrowly benefiting those sheltered from competition.A coalition of Republicans is banking on a scenario in which Donald J. Trump fails to reach the 1,237 delegates required to secure the party\u2019s nomination before its July convention, creating a potential opening for another nominee as the delegates vote on the convention floor.The United States largely dismantled its broad tariffs in the mid-20th century, opening the modern era of globalization. But some tariffs remain, providing a reminder of the costs and benefits. Annual imports of Chinese tires increased to 46 million in 2008 from 15 million in 2004, and American tire makers shed several thousand jobs.So in 2009, the Obama administration, at the urging of workers\u2019 unions, imposed a Trump-like tariff beginning at 35 percent and expiring after three years.China, moreover, retaliated by slapping a punitive tariff on American chicken parts \u2014 China is a particularly lucrative market for chicken feet \u2014 which cost American poultry exporters about $1 billion in lost sales over the same period.Eswar Prasad, a Cornell University economist, said Mr. Trump was raising legitimate concerns. Other nations do impose disproportionate restrictions on American goods, he said. The problem, Mr. Prasad said, is the proposed solution.\u201cIt might be that the threat of tariffs or other trade sanctions could cause American trading partners to open up their markets or drop their barriers to trade,\u201d Mr. Prasad said. \u201cPerhaps as a bargaining chip, it\u2019s not necessarily so bad. But there is a risk that rather than having that positive effect, it leads to retaliation on both sides.\u201dBecause of an editing error, an article on Friday about Donald Trump\u2019s views on American trade policy misidentified the location from which Carrier will be shifting its air-conditioner production. It is Indiana, not India. (It is expanding to Mexico.)Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Paul Ryan Faces Tea Party Forces That He Helped Unleash", "Date": "2016-03-02", "News": "Supported byCongressional memoSome of those insurgent winners from that year would eventually turn on the leaders one by one, setting in motion the downfall of Representative Eric Cantor \u2014 just as Republicans were attempting to cobble together a modest immigration measure \u2014 then blocking the ascent of Representative Kevin McCarthy after they had deposed John A. Boehner as speaker.\u201cPaul Ryan, I don\u2019t know him well, but I\u2019m sure I\u2019m going to get along great with him,\u201d Mr. Trump said as he stormed through Super Tuesday and sealed his front-runner status. \u201cAnd if I don\u2019t, he\u2019s going to have to pay a big price.\u201d Facing forces he inadvertently helped unleash, Mr. Ryan finds himself confronting a potentially agonizing choice \u2014 both moral and intellectual \u2014 between the values he has spent his career promoting and the man who stands ready to repudiate them.On Wednesday, Mr. Ryan\u2019s office was contacted by Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign, but the two men did not speak, said Brendan Buck, a spokesman for Mr. Ryan. To Democrats, and some Republicans, Mr. Ryan and the Republican leadership have a quandary of their own making. Republican lawmakers and candidates often averted their gaze when questions were raised about President Obama\u2019s birth certificate and religion. They tolerated breaches of decorum, such as Representative Joe Wilson\u2019s cry of \u201cYou lie\u201d during a presidential address, and even made light of the man who brought many of those alleged conspiracies to the fore: Mr. Trump.\u201cThe party repeatedly made myopic decisions, tolerating the intolerable views of a segment of the party unwilling to accept that problem-solving is complicated,\u201d said Tony Fratto, a Republican consultant who served in the George W. Bush administration. \u201cThe short game was winning some midterms. The cost was creating an incoherent and unsustainable coalition.\u201dDemocrats are now seizing on this trajectory, and trying to tie all Republican incumbents to the legacy. \u201cDonald Trump is appealing to some of the darkest forces in America,\u201d Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, the Democratic leader, said on Wednesday. \u201cIt\u2019s time for Republicans to stop the Frankenstein they created.\u201dMany Republicans reject that analysis, especially when it comes to Mr. Ryan. His aides answer questions of Mr. Obama\u2019s birth with a letter that includes a copy of the president\u2019s birth certificate. \u201cI certainly understand the importance of this issue,\u201d the letter says, \u201cand I hope you find the information useful.\u201dInstead, they pin Mr. Trump\u2019s rise on their own failures to deliver on promises like the repeal of the Affordable Care Act, the defunding of Planned Parenthood, and the broad shrinking of government. That helped spawn the anger propelling Mr. Trump.\u201cPeople were not totally upfront in saying as long as President Obama is in the White House, we need to be realistic about our goals,\u201d said Brian Walsh, a former official at the National Republican Senatorial Committee. While Mr. Ryan politely rejected the birth inquiries, others did not. Asked in 2011 on the NBC program \u201cMeet the Press\u201d about the birth certificate conspiracy, and House members still promoting it, Mr. Boehner responded, \u201cIt really is not our job to tell the American people what to believe and what to think.\u201d Asked on the same program about such \u201ccrazy talk,\u201d Mr. Cantor replied, \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s, it\u2019s nice to call anyone crazy, O.K.?\u201dThe Tea Party movement initially was focused on government spending, health care and bailout programs, but in 2014, with the deficit falling and the economy improving, the movement turned to immigration \u2014 and a fierce opposition to an immigration law overhaul embraced by some Republicans, including Senator Marco Rubio of Florida and Mr. Ryan. That June, Mr. Ryan and Representative Mario Diaz-Balart, Republican of Florida, were trying to drum up votes for an immigration bill that included a path to legal status for undocumented immigrants. Then Mr. Cantor, the majority leader, lost to a Tea Party primary challenger who accused him of being weak on illegal immigrants. Supporters abandoned the effort, and the immigration overhaul died.In the Republican-controlled House now, there are frequent flare-ups over racially charged issues, from a movement among some conservatives to roll back voting rights, to a fight over confederate flags at federal cemeteries that shut down the appropriations process last summer.On Tuesday, nine House Republicans voted against renaming a post office in Winston-Salem, N.C., after the poet Maya Angelou. Representative Mo Brooks of Alabama, a leader of anti-immigration forces, called her a \u201ccommunist sympathizer.\u201dMr. Romney hailed Mr. Trump\u2019s \u201cextraordinary ability to understand how our economy works.\u201dStuart Stevens, a Romney campaign strategist, sees nothing wrong with that. \u201cWe don\u2019t shun people and Donald Trump wasn\u2019t shunned,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen he said crazy things people said they were crazy.\u201d But he has been a Trump critic this year.For now Republicans dismiss that Mr. Trump can lay much of a glove on Mr. Ryan. \u201cI\u2019m not sure how much weight Trump\u2019s threat carries,\u201d said Senator Jeff Flake, Republican of Arizona and a critic of Mr. Trump. \u201cCertainly not more than Ryan can bench.\u201dKitty Bennett contributed research.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "As Hillary Clinton Sweeps States, One Group Resists: White Men", "Date": "2016-03-17", "News": "Supported byWhite men narrowly backed Hillary Clinton in her 2008 race for president, but they are resisting her candidacy this time around in major battleground states, rattling some Democrats about her general-election strategy.While Mrs. Clinton swept the five major primaries on Tuesday, she lost white men in all of them, and by double-digit margins in Missouri, North Carolina and Ohio, exit polls showed \u2014 a sharp turnabout from 2008, when she won double-digit victories among white male voters in all three states.She also performed poorly on Tuesday with independents, who have never been among her core supporters. But white men were, at least when Mrs. Clinton was running against a black opponent: She explicitly appealed to them in 2008, extolling the Second Amendment, mocking Barack Obama\u2019s comment that working-class voters \u201ccling to guns or religion\u201d and even needling him at one point over his difficulties with \u201cworking, hard-working Americans, white Americans.\u201dShe could not sound more different today, aggressively campaigning to toughen gun-control laws and especially courting black and Hispanic voters.Her standing among white men does not threaten her clinching the Democratic nomination this year, or preclude her from winning in November, unless it craters. Mr. Obama lost the white vote to Mrs. Clinton, after all, but still won the presidency.But what is striking is the change in attitudes about Mrs. Clinton among those voters, and her struggle to win them over again. In dozens of interviews in diners, offices and neighborhoods across the country, many white male Democrats expressed an array of misgivings, with some former supporters turning away from her now.Many said they did not trust her to overhaul the economy because of her wealth and her ties to Wall Street. Some said her use of private email as secretary of state indicated she had something to hide. A few said they did not think a woman should be commander in chief. But most said they simply did not think Mrs. Clinton cared about people like them.\u201cShe\u2019s talking to minorities now, not really to white people, and that\u2019s a mistake,\u201d said Dennis Bertko, 66, a construction project manager in Youngstown, Ohio, as he sipped a draft beer at the Golden Dawn Restaurant in a downtrodden part of town. \u201cShe could have a broader message. We would have listened.\u201d\u201cInstead, she\u2019s talking a lot about continuing Obama\u2019s policies,\u201d he said. \u201cI just don\u2019t necessarily agree with all of the liberal ideas of Obama.\u201dMr. Bertko said that he rarely crossed party lines but that he voted for Donald J. Trump, who is making a strong pitch to disaffected white men by assailing free-trade agreements that Mrs. Clinton once supported. \u201cI know a lot of guys who are open to Trump,\u201d he said.An interactive delegate calculator that lets you simulate how the 2016 Republican nomination could unfold.The fading of white men as a Democratic bloc is hardly new: The last nominee to carry them was Lyndon Johnson in 1964, and many blue-collar \u201cReagan Democrats\u201d now steadily vote Republican. But Democrats have won about 35 to 40 percent of white men in nearly every presidential election since 1988. And some Democratic leaders say the party needs white male voters to win the presidency, raise large sums of money and, like it or not, maintain credibility as a broad-based national coalition.To win a general election, Mrs. Clinton would rely most heavily on strong turnout from blacks, Hispanics, women and older voters. Though she won among white men in Arkansas, Alabama and Tennessee, and tied in Texas, some Democratic officials and pollsters say they fear that without a stronger strategy, Mrs. Clinton could perform as poorly among white men as Walter Mondale, who drew just 32 percent in 1984, or even George McGovern, who took 31 percent in 1972.\u201cHer most serious relationship problem is with white men, on a policy issue front but also stylistically, and she is at real risk for running worse than the average Democrat with white males,\u201d said Peter Hart, a veteran Democratic pollster.Bill Richardson, former governor of New Mexico and energy secretary under President Clinton, said Mrs. Clinton needed to focus more on economic issues and job creation and to deploy her husband on her behalf. \u201cPriority needs to be given to stopping the erosion of the white male voter and Reagan Democrats to Republicans,\u201d he said.Mrs. Clinton\u2019s advisers expressed confidence, saying her economic policies and national security experience would appeal strongly to white men in a general election. They said she regularly won among those over 45 and argued that Senator Bernie Sanders\u2019s appeal among younger white men reflected his popularity with young people generally.Surveys of Democratic voters exiting voting locations throughout Florida on Tuesday.Joel Benenson, Mrs. Clinton\u2019s strategist and pollster, predicted she would win at least 35 percent of white men nationally \u2014 the share Mr. Obama took in 2012 \u2014 and even more in battleground states like Ohio and Pennsylvania. But he insisted that focusing on white men overlooked the breadth of her support.\u201cWinning is never about slicing and dicing the electorate,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat you have to do is create a diverse coalition of voters that enables you to win, and win repeatedly. That\u2019s what Hillary Clinton has done, and that\u2019s what Bernie Sanders has failed to do.\u201dBut Mrs. Clinton is clearly focusing more so far on nonwhites, who provide outsize shares of the delegates needed to win the nomination. Her political message, events and surrogate speakers have been geared largely to blacks and Hispanics, from denouncing gun violence and police abuses to promising improvements in immigration and education.Eight years ago, Mrs. Clinton appealed to whites to counter Mr. Obama\u2019s popularity among minority voters. She ran as a moderate and a national security hawk, and fondly recalled how her father taught her to shoot. Some political analysts said she also benefited among white men because many were not comfortable voting for a black man.Mrs. Clinton\u2019s political challenges now center on the controversies stemming from her time as secretary of state and doubts about her willingness to take on Wall Street.Surveys of Democratic voters exiting voting locations throughout Ohio on Tuesday.\u201cThere are all these questions about her past, and she doesn\u2019t give straight responses about them,\u201d said Forrest Giffin, 23, a Democrat in Sumter, S.C., who cited Mrs. Clinton\u2019s refusal to release transcripts of her paid speeches to banks. Mr. Giffin, a mall supervisor and assistant manager at a gas station, added, \u201cI really wonder if she wants people like me in the Democratic Party.\u201dTerry Downs, a retired art professor who was impressed by Mrs. Clinton in Plymouth, N.H., last fall, said he was won over by Mr. Sanders\u2019s economic policies. \u201cI just thought there\u2019s a lot of hypocritical lip service coming from Hillary when she talks like a strong progressive,\u201d he said. \u201cShe and her husband received millions of dollars from Wall Street.\u201dIn Ohio, a plurality of white men said honesty and trustworthiness were the most important qualities in a candidate, and 89 percent of them voted for Mr. Sanders, according to exit polls. Of the four in 10 who wanted a president to pursue more liberal policies than Mr. Obama\u2019s, a wide majority favored Mr. Sanders.In Youngstown, a city battered by job losses, Mrs. Clinton\u2019s record was a flash point at the Golden Dawn.\u201cBeing an ex-serviceman, the situation with Benghazi still upsets me greatly,\u201d said Hayden Gerdes, 72, referring to the terrorist attacks in Libya. A Clinton voter in 2008, he chose Gov. John Kasich, a Republican, on Tuesday.Mr. Gerdes had a sparring partner in Dick Lucarell, 73, who voted for Mrs. Clinton in 2008 and again on Tuesday. Mr. Lucarell said that Mrs. Clinton was the target of unfair Republican attacks, and that she and her husband would be \u201ca strong team.\u201d But he also said she had yet to give white men compelling reasons to stay in the party.\u201cIf I\u2019m a woman, I probably vote for Hillary. If I\u2019m Hispanic, I vote for Hillary. Blacks will vote for Hillary,\u201d Mr. Lucarell said. \u201cBut white people, especially white men \u2014 she has a big problem there.\u201dGiovanni Russonello contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

Ms. Stefani won\u2019t discuss the details, partly to protect her children, but said: \u201cIf I could, I would just tell you everything, and you would just be in shock. It\u2019s a really good, juicy story.\u201d (The tabloids say Mr. Rossdale was having a several-years-long affair with a nanny caring for the couple\u2019s three sons.)Ms. Stefani, 46, was reeling. \u201cI\u2019m gonna die,\u201d she said, recalling her emotional state. \u201cI am dead, actually. How do I save myself? What am I going to do? How do I not go down like this?\u201dSitting at the long marble table in an office in her sprawling home here, dressed in a sheer white blouse and shiny red stilettos, Ms. Stefani laid out the answer: She plunged herself into her first love, songwriting. \u201cI have to make music out of this. That\u2019s what God wants for me,\u201d she remembers thinking.The result is \u201cThis Is What the Truth Feels Like\u201d (Interscope), her first solo album in a decade, which will be released on Friday, March 18.The album\u2019s 12 tracks are more direct and less whimsical than her previous two pop records. There are fiery songs about secrets and infidelity (the swaggering \u201cRed Flag\u201d and \u201cNaughty,\u201d delivered in Ms. Stefani\u2019s speak-sung pseudo-rap) and ballads that capture the rawness of a long relationship\u2019s premature end (\u201cUsed to Love You\u201d).

The songs aren\u2019t as dancey as much current pop; they retain the bouncy, synth-driven sound of Ms. Stefani\u2019s earlier work. In a field dominated by young starlets, she\u2019s made a grown-up pop album, confessional and sleek, without the oddball \u201cB-A-N-A-N-A-S\u201d flourishes of her past hits.As Ms. Stefani began writing, she said she didn\u2019t worry about potential sales, what it means to be a 46-year-old pop singer in a youth-dominated field, or pleasing her record company.Ms. Stefani\u2019s directions were clear: She wanted to capture her history \u2014 if it didn\u2019t happen in real life, it wasn\u2019t going on the album. And the floodgates opened.\u201cBeing in that room and being creative, it was the only place that felt good \u2014 I was like, I love the smell of this room,\u201d she recalled. (Ms. Michaels said there were a lot of laughter and tears during the sessions, which Ms. Stefani attended in her signature look: \u201cThe red lip and big nails and the jewelry.\u201d) Songwriting had saved her before, Ms. Stefani said. She described herself as having been a \u201cpassive girl,\u201d an unremarkable teenager, until she uncovered her talent. \u201cIt\u2019s almost like one of those movies where they discover they have magic,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen I was able to first write a song, that\u2019s when I found my whole self.\u201dMs. Stefani\u2019s label, however, had reservations about the highly personal music she was churning out. On a phone call that felt like \u201cfive people punching me in the stomach,\u201d she said she was told: \u201cWe support you, you should put out an artistic record, and don\u2019t go for radio. It\u2019s over for you, basically.\u201dJohn Janick, the chairman and chief executive of Interscope Geffen A&M, said he \u201cabsolutely\u201d remembers the uncomfortable call \u2014 because he was the one who had to make it. \u201cI said, \u2018I\u2019m not sure you have the song that\u2019s going to really connect with people,\u2019\u201d he recalled. \u201cAnd two days later, she sent us \u2018Used to Love You.\u2019\u201dThe label immediately got in touch to say, \u201cYou have a hit,\u201d Ms. Stefani said, noting with some glee that it was the most personal song she\u2019d attempted to write. \u201cThat\u2019s never happened in my entire career.\u201d (The song wound up peaking at No. 52 on the Billboard Hot 100. A second single, \u201cMake Me Like You,\u201d for which Ms. Stefani created an intricately choreographed live video during a commercial break on this year\u2019s Grammys in a multi-million-dollar partnership with Target, is at No. 54 and climbing.)After a few weeks in the studio, Ms. Stefani returned to her other job on \u201cThe Voice,\u201d burdened with knowing her marital issues had not yet become public. \u201cI\u2019m not a secret girl,\u201d she explained. \u201cI tell everybody when my period is coming.\u201dBut she soon learned that Mr. Shelton, whom she refers to as \u201cone of my co-workers,\u201d was also in the throes of a personal crisis. He \u201chad been going through literally the exact same thing in literally the exact same time frame,\u201d she said. Her friendship with him blossomed.Her collaborators noticed a change instantly. \u201cWe had anger, we had sadness, we had flirtation, we had sexy, and now we\u2019re madly in love,\u201d Mr. Tranter said. Ms. Stefani described the shift with one of her frequently used terms \u2014 \u201ccrazy!\u201d \u2014 and added, \u201cNever in my wildest, craziest dreams would I ever have seen this coming.\u201dMs. Stefani, unguarded and reflective, spoke quickly in torrents of words, pausing only to sip tea from a cup that, like most of her d\u00e9cor, was black and white. She thought back to her childhood in Anaheim, Calif., where she presumed she\u2019d one day lead a happy family like the one her parents had built. \u201cI literally was so sheltered and na\u00efve, and that\u2019s a lot why I think I got myself into so much trouble, in a way,\u201d she said. She lamented that because of her split from Mr. Rossdale, she now has her sons 50 percent of the time. \u201cIt\u2019s like, the most unjust, unbelievable system,\u201d she said, adding that the \u201cblessing\u201d in it was she had time to heal and write. Atop her work table sat a book of photos from her youngest son\u2019s first year, two pairs of sunglasses, her journal and a tin of Dr. Martens Wonder Balsam.No Doubt, the band she co-founded in 1987, had already sold more than 20 million albums worldwide when it took its first break following its 2001 LP, \u201cRock Steady.\u201d Her first thought: \u201cdance record.\u201d The result was \u201cLove. Angel. Music. Baby.,\u201d a 2004 album of wacky, hip-hop-inflected songs that blended her fascination with Japanese fashion and \u201980s synth pop. Pharrell Williams, now a longtime friend, collaborated on its signature hit, \u201cHollaback Girl.\u201d\u201cGwen is a true heroine, whose creativity represents all the young female rebels at heart,\u201d Mr. Williams said in an email.She got pregnant with her first son, Kingston, before embarking on her first solo tour and returned to the studio to make a follow-up album, \u201cThe Sweet Escape,\u201d when he was just eight weeks old. The cycle almost immediately repeated itself: a worldwide tour and a pregnancy, with her second child, Zuma. Her growing empire now included fashion and fragrances.And she wasn\u2019t done yet. No Doubt had been awaiting her return, so she hit the road with a toddler and a nursing baby and completely exhausted herself. \u201cI felt quite trapped on so many levels, because when you have that much success you feel like you owe everybody,\u201d she said. \u201cEverybody depends on you.\u201dSessions for the band\u2019s first album in 11 years, \u201cPush and Shove,\u201d followed, and Ms. Stefani wasn\u2019t brimming with ideas. The LP failed to take off commercially, and when the band returned to the studio \u2014 this time with collaborators including Sia, Greg Kurstin and Mr. Williams \u2014 Ms. Stefani got pregnant for a third time. \u201cThat\u2019s when I started to really find my faith again,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s like a miracle, at my age.\u201dWeeks after giving birth to Apollo, the offer to become a coach on \u201cThe Voice\u201d arrived, and Ms. Stefani found herself relishing her new role as mentor. \u201cI needed so badly to do something different, and I needed so badly to be in a different role, a giving role.\u201d Freshly inspired, she felt the urge to make music and mulled a solo album. \u201cI started to think, well, I\u2019ll just curate a record, and I\u2019ll do it like every other pop girl does.\u201dThis was the first time Ms. Stefani had dipped a toe into the new pop economy, where ace songwriters for hire shop tracks from artist to artist. \u201cEvery song that people would write for me felt like me 12 years ago, me 10 years ago. And lyrically they could never touch my heart, ever.\u201d She recorded a full album, but decided to shelve it once sessions for \u201cTruth\u201d took off.Considering how much the pop landscape has changed in a decade, Ms. Stefani is incredulous about her ability to continue recording. \u201cI don\u2019t even understand how I could possibly have had this long a career, or a career at all,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd that anyone cares, and that I\u2019m relevant or anything, it just blows my mind.\u201dMr. Tranter said Ms. Stefani\u2019s sweetness and humility aren\u2019t put-on. \u201cAt first I thought she was just being polite,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd then I was like, oh, she actually doesn\u2019t realize the lives that she\u2019s changed. She has no clue.\u201d Describing Ms. Stefani\u2019s appeal as \u201cthat amazing combination of extreme fabulousness and extreme honesty,\u201d he noted the 1995 No Doubt album \u201cTragic Kingdom\u201d \u201cdefined one whole era of music, and then she did it again as a solo artist, which is very rare.\u201dMr. Janick said the longevity of Ms. Stefani\u2019s career is one reason the label is confident in her new album\u2019s viability. \u201cObviously there\u2019s a lot of people that have grown up with Gwen over the years. Her being on \u2018The Voice,\u2019 what she does in fashion, she\u2019s all over all the magazines. You can say it\u2019s a grown-up pop record, but I feel like it touches on all different things that people can relate to of all different ages and sexes.\u201dMs. Stefani, who sometimes reminds herself \u201cWow, I did do that! I wrote those songs!\u201d to boost her own confidence, said singing about being happy is \u201cso fresh\u201d to her. \u201cI needed something new to happen. And not just in my career, in my life. Something had to change.\u201cI\u2019m not going to say I\u2019m not still picking up the pieces and every day isn\u2019t a challenge,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m still in shock. But it\u2019s an awesome time.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "In Sunset Park, a Call for \u2018Innovation\u2019 Leads to Fears of Gentrification", "Date": "2016-03-06", "News": "Supported bySide StreetFor decades, the industrial waterfront of Sunset Park, on the western edge of Brooklyn, was an urban flyover country of sorts, as commuters heading to Manhattan or Staten Island zipped past on the elevated Gowanus Expressway, catching glimpses of auto repair shops, huge warehouses and billboards.Developers tout their plans as forward-looking, something that will turn a drab waterfront into a modern, attractive destination and business hub that will generate jobs. City officials say the proposed streetcar is needed to meet the needs of 21st-century commuters and would be welcomed by working-class residents in areas that are far from the subway, like Red Hook in Brooklyn.Now, some of those accomplishments could displace her neighbors and the workers who may not find a home in a redeveloped waterfront, where for-sale signs abound along with other signs proclaiming \u201cinnovation.\u201d After years of working with community coalitions, Ms. Yeampierre is confronting development plans she says were imposed on the area without consulting the people who live in the modest houses and apartments east of Third Avenue, the industrial area\u2019s border.\u201cWe made this community more green; we made it with amenities, the same ones that developers are using to promote moving to this neighborhood,\u201d said Ms. Yeampierre, a former civil rights lawyer and a former dean at Yale. \u201cWe call it a displacement economy. If we complain, they say we are against innovation and creativity. The way things are done now is being driven by corporate interests, not by community needs.\u201dShe is part of a coalition that includes labor unions, the Working Families Party, business owners and residents that seeks to maintain a working waterfront, which she estimates currently employs 12,000 people. They are calling for more decent-paying jobs that could blunt the displacement effects of gentrification. For example, they favor using the industrial waterfront for businesses that produce environmentally friendly building and construction materials that would help structures withstand the effects of climate change.These could be the kind of unionized industrial jobs that let a breadwinner support a family, Ms. Yeampierre said. She worries that much of the talk about the area\u2019s future developments give little thought to local employment needs beyond entry-level service jobs.\u201cCommercial jobs just turn young people of color into a servant class for the privileged,\u201d she said. \u201cThey come in with plans and impose it on the community from the top down. That\u2019s the old-school way.\u201dWhile Ms. Yeampierre had advocated transportation options to help Sunset Park residents, especially those in public housing, she and others said their calls went unheeded until more upscale projects emerged. The recent streetcar plan, for example, was not dissimilar from one that some Brooklyn residents suggested more than 15 years ago as part of a community-based planning effort.Mr. Shiffman, who has worked with Uprose, said the new proposals for improved transportation and development in Sunset Park, while cast as improving the area and making it more attractive to business and new residents, have only increased the fear of displacement.\u201cThe developers haven\u2019t really reached out and worked closely with groups like Uprose,\u201d he said. \u201cBut every step they are taking looks like one that not only leads to displacement of residential communities but the displacement of jobs for working people who live in the adjacent community. It looks like the gentrification of manufacturing.\u201dMs. Yeampierre can see that on the same block of her group\u2019s headquarters. Down the street, a hotel rose a few years ago, while a new one is being built around the corner. Next to that site, an auto-repair garage lost its lease. The same fate awaits a radio-repair business whose landlord recently told the business owner that he planned to sell the building.Ms. Yeampierre brightened when she walked through Bush Terminal Park, which her group had promoted for years. It emerged like a vision on the waterfront after passing through a canyon of warehouses and other industrial buildings.\u201cIt took us 15 years for us to get this,\u201d she said. \u201cPeople who work in this neighborhood live in this neighborhood. And now we\u2019re going to lose it to gentrification?\u201d\u201cThis country was built on taking and pushing people out, and this is a continuation of that,\u201d Ms. Yeampierre said. \u201cTheir ads always talk about \u2018the pioneer spirit.\u2019 We call it the new colonization. And there is nothing innovative about colonizing.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Tough Re-election for G.O.P. Moderate Is Getting Tougher", "Date": "2016-03-28", "News": "Supported byBut from the moment the New Hampshire Republican rolls her carry-on bag to the airport gate for her flight back home, Ms. Ayotte\u2019s face softens, her gaze broadens and she chats with half her fellow passengers, all of whom she seems to know \u2014 lobbyists, college students, someone who has noticed her daughter\u2019s basketball game has improved.She may not always telegraph it, but Ms. Ayotte, a freshman senator, is locked in a herculean battle with the state\u2019s popular Democratic governor, Maggie Hassan. As one of five Senate Republicans running for re-election in states that supported President Obama in both 2008 and 2012, Ms. Ayotte is seen as particularly vulnerable this November, and is a major reason national Democrats, now on the short end of a 54-46 Republican majority, are optimistic about taking back the Senate.\u201cWith the potential for a polarizing nominee like Trump or Cruz at the top of the ticket, it will be more important than ever for Republican Senate candidates to cement their own identity and distance themselves when necessary,\u201d said Brian Walsh, a longtime Senate campaign aide and Republican consultant, referring also to Senator Ted Cruz of Texas. \u201cSenators in both parties have been successful in doing that in recent years, but you need to run hard and run your own race because the top of the ticket inevitably dominates the broader national political environment.\u201dBut in her home state, Ms. Ayotte, 47, the image is different.\u201cThe perception outside of here that Kelly Ayotte is part of the Tea Party was actually false,\u201d said Andrew E. Smith, a political scientist and pollster at the University of New Hampshire. \u201cShe is pretty much Judd Gregg in a skirt,\u201d he said, referring to the moderate Republican senator and former New Hampshire governor who preceded Ms. Ayotte.Ms. Hassan, her opponent, is also a lawyer, and entered politics in 1999 when Gov. Jeanne Shaheen, now a Democratic senator, appointed her to a state education commission. One of her children has cerebral palsy, and she has said her quest to have him educated in a traditional school inspired her to seek elected office.Ms. Shaheen, her mentor, describes her as someone who \u201chas shown she can work across the aisle.\u201d And just as Ms. Ayotte has tried lately to play up her spirit of bipartisanship, Ms. Hassan broke with her party shortly after announcing her candidacy this winter when she said the federal government had to put in place a better screening process for Syrian refugees before she would allow any in New Hampshire.But more recently her message seems borrowed from Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, the winner over Hillary Clinton in New Hampshire\u2019s Democratic presidential primary.Trump and Sanders voters share \u201ca pervasive feeling that the system is truly rigged,\u201d Ms. Hassan said in an interview in her office in Concord. \u201cPeople are very frustrated and angry, and have this sense that no matter how hard you work, you can\u2019t get ahead and stay ahead.\u201dDrawing a contrast with Ms. Ayotte, she said, \u201cWe\u2019ve tried to lower costs of higher education; I froze tuition\u201d at the public universities. \u201cWhile we were working so hard to do that, my opponent voted for deep cuts to Pell grants. She protected tax breaks for big oil. She voted to defund Planned Parenthood six times.\u201dBecause New Hampshire is a small state, elected officials and political rivals like Ms. Ayotte and Ms. Hassan often find themselves at the same events.\u201cHi, everyone,\u201d Ms. Ayotte said breezily, strolling from table to table at a St. Patrick\u2019s Day charity dinner in Manchester. Just as she settled down at a table, the governor rose to make a mildly awkward joke about how Ms. Ayotte\u2019s plane might have been late, but a pilot change could not be made because \u201cit\u2019s up to the American people to decide\u201d how to replace him.The joke, a reference to Ms. Ayotte\u2019s insistence on not voting on a Supreme Court replacement for Justice Antonin Scalia, drew nervous laughter and some boos, but underscored what Democrats hope is a high card in a contentious battle.\u201cPeople know both of us,\u201d Ms. Ayotte said. \u201cShe has been the governor, and I have been the senator. And, of course, the presidential election is an important one, but people here are going to be able to distinguish and look at our race on its own.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Santiago Calatrava\u2019s Transit Hub Is a Soaring Symbol of a Boondoggle", "Date": "2016-03-02", "News": "Supported byArchitecture ReviewFor a dozen years, the World Trade Center Transportation Hub was a train wreck. Santiago Calatrava\u2019s winged dove, beefed up to meet security demands, devolved into a dino carcass. The project\u2019s cost soared toward a head-slapping, unconscionable $4 billion in public money for what, in effect, is the 18th-busiest subway stop in New York City, tucked inside a shopping mall, down the block from another shopping center.And it\u2019s not really a hub. A maze of underground passages connects the site to far-flung subway lines, but there are not free transfers. The place is a glorified PATH station for some 50,000 weekday riders commuting to and from New Jersey. Predictions by the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which built the hub, that this number will somehow double when the site opens seem as reliable as the authority\u2019s initial promises that the project would take five years and cost $2.2 billion.Curved, steel-ribbed walls rise 160 feet like a pair of immense clamshells toward a ribbon of glass that is the giant hall\u2019s skylight. I visited the other morning, when sun spilled through windows between the ribs, dancing with the dust motes, splintering into fingered beams. It poured through the skylight, whose glass panes can slide open. I could imagine some poetic-minded, devil-may-care soul at the Port Authority allowing a shimmering scrim of snowflakes to waft down into the hall and dissolve on the vast white marble floor.Of course, today\u2019s pristine new cathedral of public space soon becomes the temple ground for another Apple store and John Varvatos. Shops move in later this year. The Oculus will be leased out as an event space. The authority needs to recoup the fortune it will spend on white paint to keep the place from instantly looking shabby.Assuming the best, commuters will head to bright, inviting train platforms \u2014 picking up a carton of orange juice and a copy of The New York Times at a Hudson News stand \u2014 and the hub will not suggest some bloated Soviet folly, a pretend Palace of the People testifying to broken government and chutzpah.We\u2019ll see.Meanwhile, the city has an Instagram-ready attraction whose defenders insist no one will remember it is the most expensive train station ever. Who recalls how much Grand Central cost?Actually, I do. It cost $80 million, or about half the cost of the hub, adjusting for inflation, which was private, not public, money. Grand Central spurred a building boom that transformed the surrounding blocks and the city\u2019s economy. This new hub is shoehorned into an unfinished office park in Lower Manhattan whose development it has complicated, not hastened \u2014 while the whole area has been evolving into a livelier live-work neighborhood despite what\u2019s happening at the World Trade Center, not because of it.I said \u201cat first blush.\u201d The genius of Grand Central, which accommodates many times the number of riders as the hub, entails more than that uplifting \u201cwow\u201d moment encountering its lofty main concourse. It is expressed in the ingenuity of its layout, its integration with the streets, the serendipity of its art, the richness and variety of its materials and ancillary spaces. It remains an endless discovery, even a century later.And it works.I toured the site recently with an architect who admired Mr. Calatrava for sticking to his guns and conceiving an ambitious public space. Cost was the Port Authority\u2019s responsibility, he said, and besides, cost isn\u2019t value, all of which is true.Mr. Calatrava has given New York something for its billions. But if the takeaway lesson from this project is that architects need a free pass, a vain, submissive client and an open checkbook to create a public spectacle, then the hub is a disaster for architecture and for cities.The World Trade Center Transportation Hub can be reached by subway: Take the 2 or 3 train to Park Place, and then walk west. Or you can take the PATH!Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Eviction Economy", "Date": "2016-03-05", "News": "Supported byOpinionI FIRST met Larraine when we both lived in a trailer park on the far South Side of Milwaukee. Fifty-four, with silvering brown hair, Larraine loved mystery novels, \u201cSo You Think You Can Dance\u201d and doting on her grandson. Even though she lived in a mobile home park with so many code violations that city inspectors called it an \u201cenvironmental biohazard,\u201d she kept a tidy trailer and used a hand steamer on the curtains. But Larraine spent more than 70 percent of her income on housing \u2014 just as one in four of all renting families who live below the poverty line do. After paying the rent, she was left with $5 a day.Under conditions like these, evictions have become routine. Larraine (whose name has been changed to protect her privacy) was evicted after she borrowed from her rent money to cover part of her gas bill. The eviction movers took her stuff to their storage unit; after Larraine was unable to make payments, they took it to the dump.Those of us who don\u2019t live in trailer parks or inner cities might think low-income families typically benefit from public housing or some other kind of government assistance. But the opposite is true. Three-quarters of families who qualify for housing assistance don\u2019t get it because there simply isn\u2019t enough to go around. This arrangement would be unthinkable with other social services that cover basic needs. What if food stamps only covered one in four families?America stands alone among wealthy democracies in the depth and expanse of its poverty. Ask most politicians what we should do about this, and they will answer by calling for more and better jobs. Paul Ryan, the Republican speaker of the House, thinks we need to do more to \u201cincentivize work.\u201d Hillary Clinton, the front-runner for the Democratic presidential nomination, thinks we should raise the minimum wage. But jobs are only part of the solution because poverty is not just a product of joblessness and low wages. It is also a product of exploitation.Throughout our history, wage gains won by workers through organized protest were quickly absorbed by rising rents. As industrial capitalists tried to put down the strikes, landlords cheered workers on. It is no different today. When incomes rise, the housing market takes its cut, which is why a two-bedroom apartment in the oil boomtown Williston, N.D., was going last year for $2,800 a month and why entire capital-rich cities like San Francisco are becoming unaffordable to the middle class. If rents rise alongside incomes, what progress is made?Poverty is no accident, an unintended consequence from which no one benefits. Larraine\u2019s rent money went to Tobin (also a pseudonym). A second-generation landlord, Tobin was 71, unsmiling and fit. His tenants waited tables at diners or worked as nursing assistants. Some received disability like Larraine or other forms of welfare, sometimes supplementing their checks by collecting aluminum cans.Running one of the poorest trailer parks in the city had its challenges, like dealing with mental illness, addiction and domestic violence. Every so often, tenants wrecked their trailer the night before being evicted. Tobin had a way of dealing with that. He\u2019d pay one of his tenants $20 to clean up the mess, then offer prospective new families the \u201cHandyman Special,\u201d a free mobile home as long as they paid \u201clot rent.\u201d Lot rent was the same amount as rent, except the new \u201cowners\u201d would be responsible for maintenance. A family could move their trailer elsewhere, but in reality no one could afford to. When families fell behind in lot rent and were evicted, they inevitably left their trailer behind. Tobin would reclaim it as \u201cabandoned property\u201d and give it to someone else.Tobin bought the mobile home park, 131 trailers parked on asphalt, for $2.1 million in 1995, paying off the mortgage nine years later. After reviewing Tobin\u2019s books and expenses (property taxes, utility bills, missed payments), I estimated that he netted roughly $447,000 a year. Some of Tobin\u2019s tenants called him \u201cgreedy,\u201d but others called him \u201cfair\u201d and \u201ca good man,\u201d especially those he had spared from homelessness when they fell on hard times. He bailed tenants out of jail, lent money for funerals and let some missed payments slide. In a year, he also made 30 times what his tenants getting minimum wage earned.Landlords like Tobin aren\u2019t making money in trailer parks or ghettos in spite of their poverty but because of it. Depressed property values offer lower mortgage payments and tax bills. In poor areas of the cities, rents are lower, too \u2014 but not by much. In 2010, the average monthly rent in Milwaukee\u2019s poorest neighborhoods was only $50 less than the citywide median.Landlords renting to poor families can charge slightly reduced rents but, owing to far lower expenses, still command handsome profits. As a landlord with 114 inner-city units once told me, speaking of an affluent suburb near Milwaukee: \u201cIn Brookfield, I lost money. But if you do low-income, you get a steady monthly income.\u201dPoor families are stuck. Because they are already at the bottom of the market, they can\u2019t get cheaper housing unless they uproot their lives, quit their jobs and leave the city. Those with eviction records are pushed into substandard private housing in high-crime neighborhoods because many landlords and public housing authorities turn them away. When poor families finally find a new place to rent, they often start off owing their landlord because they simply can\u2019t pay the first and last month\u2019s rent and a security deposit.When tenants are behind, protections designed to keep housing safe and decent dissolve. Tenants in arrears tempt eviction if they report housing problems. It\u2019s not that low-income renters don\u2019t know their rights. They know that exercising those rights could cost them. So many go on paying most of what they have to live with lead paint, exposed wires and broken plumbing. Saving and stability become wishes, and some days children go hungry because the rent eats first.Expanding our current housing voucher program to cover all low-income families would rebalance landlords\u2019 desire to make a living and tenants\u2019 desire to have a home. Eligible families would dedicate 30 percent of their income to rent, allowing them to pursue education, start a savings account and buy enough food.When families finally receive housing vouchers after years on the waiting list, the first place many take their freed-up income is to the grocery store. Their children become healthier in the process.A universal housing voucher program would fundamentally change the face of poverty in the United States. Evictions would plummet, and so would the other social problems they cause, like family and community instability, homelessness, job loss and depression. Suicides attributed to evictions and foreclosures doubled between 2005 and 2010. A universal housing voucher program would help reverse this disturbing trend.Exploitation is not confined to the housing sector alone. It thrives when it comes to other essentials, like food. Inner-city bodegas take advantage of families\u2019 lack of transportation to increase grocery prices, effectively reducing the value of food stamps. The payday lending industry exploits poor people\u2019s lack of access to credit by offering high-interest loans and collecting over $7 billion a year in fees.Most Americans who take out high-interest payday loans do so not to buy luxury items or cover unexpected expenses but to meet regular bills like rent or gas. When James Baldwin observed how \u201cexpensive it is to be poor,\u201d this is what he meant.Payday loans are but one of many financial techniques \u2014 from overdraft fees to student loans subsidizing for-profit colleges \u2014 specifically designed to pull money from the pockets of the poor. This problem generally goes unrecognized by policy makers. But until we confront the fact that people make a lot of money off the poor, our efforts to reduce inequality will always come up short.WE can start with housing, the sturdiest of footholds for economic mobility. A national affordable housing program would be an anti-poverty effort, human capital investment, community improvement plan and public health initiative all rolled into one. It would especially benefit mothers and children, the face of today\u2019s eviction epidemic.This solution is not as expensive as we might think. If we did nothing to make the voucher program more cost-effective \u2014 and there is much we could do on this score \u2014 expanding housing vouchers to all renting families below the 30th percentile in median income for their area would likely require an additional $22.5 billion a year. The actual figure is likely to be somewhat less, as this estimate does not account for potential savings in the form of reducing homelessness, lowering health care costs and curbing other costly consequences of the affordable-housing crisis.We have the money. We\u2019ve just made choices about how to spend it. In 2008, the year Larraine was evicted, federal expenditures for direct housing assistance totaled more than $40 billion, but homeowner tax benefits exceeded $171 billion, a figure equivalent to the budgets for the Departments of Veterans Affairs, Homeland Security, Justice and Agriculture combined.If we are going to spend the bulk of our public dollars on the affluent \u2014 at least when it comes to housing \u2014 we should own up to that decision and stop repeating the canard about this rich country being unable to afford more. If poverty persists in America, it is not for lack of resources. We lack something else.Advertisement"}

The heads of both houses of Congress are being investigated for their roles in the national oil company scandal. The leader of the opposition Social Democrats is under fire over revelations that his family maintains secret bank accounts in Liechtenstein. Even the low-profile vice president, who has been positioning himself to take over if Ms. Rousseff is impeached, is under scrutiny over allegations that he was involved in an illegal ethanol purchasing scheme.\u201cBrazil has turned into an aspiring banana republic,\u201d said Josias de Souza, a political commentator, pointing to the unusual situation of a sitting president handing over important functions to a besieged mentor.Brazil, he said, is being \u201cgoverned by a joke.\u201dProsecutors are trying to have Mr. da Silva arrested in a corruption case that centers on his ties to giant construction companies. But cabinet ministers are among the 700 or so senior officials who enjoy special judicial standing, meaning they can be tried only by Brazil\u2019s highest court, the Supreme Federal Tribunal.Effectively, this prevents nearly all of these figures from going to prison because trials at the court drag on for years. Nearly a third of the 594 members of Congress, including the leaders of the lower house and the Senate, are under scrutiny before the court over claims of violating laws.As chief of staff, Mr. da Silva will join a government lurching from one crisis to another. He remains a powerful force, a former union leader who founded the governing party during Brazil\u2019s military dictatorship.Brazil is in the midst of its deepest political crisis in decades, with its president facing impeachment proceedings and many in Congress facing criminal or corruption charges.\u201cIn my government, President Lula will have the necessary powers to help us, to help Brazil,\u201d Ms. Rousseff said. \u201cIf Lula\u2019s arrival strengthens my government, and there are people who don\u2019t want it strengthened, then what can I do?\u201dThough Mr. da Silva faces multiple corruption investigations, even his critics recognize his mastery of political negotiations, especially in comparison with Ms. Rousseff. Her inability to cultivate allies in the capital, Bras\u00edlia, may have doomed her to irrelevance long before she brought him aboard, analysts said.Mr. da Silva has asserted that he is innocent of any wrongdoing, calling the inquiries attempts to destabilize Ms. Rousseff\u2019s government and prevent him from returning to the presidency. He has recently begun mounting a bid to run again in 2018, denouncing political opponents and critics in the news media. But upon taking up his post, he will have to start with damage control.On Wednesday, a judge investigating him released an intercept of a phone call between Mr. da Silva and Ms. Rousseff that seems to signal how they were planning for him to get a cabinet post. In the call, she said she was preparing his \u201cappointment papers.\u201d The intercept could bolster opponents who say his move into the government was plotted well in advance and may have been illegal, though Ms. Rousseff\u2019s office said they were simply following normal procedures.Beyond that, Delc\u00eddio do Amaral, a senator from the Workers\u2019 Party, reached a plea deal in which he accused Mr. da Silva and Ms. Rousseff of obstructing corruption investigations. \u201cI am a prophet of chaos,\u201d Mr. do Amaral told reporters after the high court accepted the deal, in which he implicated figures across the ideological spectrum.While Bras\u00edlia braces for the return of Mr. da Silva to the daily political fray, others around the country are trying to decipher what comes next.Alceb\u00edades da Cunha Vieira, a lawyer in Rio de Janeiro, said the dismal economy and the endless stream of scandals had him feeling despondent about his 17-year-old son\u2019s future.\u201cI want to send him away from this corruption, to Canada or Australia or the United States,\u201d said Mr. Cunha Vieira, 57. \u201cThe system here ruins people, and I don\u2019t want it to ruin my son.\u201dFernando Henrique Cardoso, a former president who is widely admired among Mr. da Silva\u2019s opponents, expressed dread about his rival\u2019s return to power.\u201cI think it\u2019s scandalous for a person to accept a cabinet post at the moment when he could go on trial,\u201d Mr. Cardoso, 84, told reporters. \u201cThis intensifies the moral crisis in the country.\u201dIt is hard to find a part of Brazil\u2019s political system that has not been tarnished. Mr. da Silva\u2019s former chief of staff, Jos\u00e9 Dirceu de Oliveira e Silva, is in prison on corruption charges. So is Jo\u00e3o Vaccari Neto, the former treasurer of the Workers\u2019 Party.Meanwhile, investigators are narrowing in on the business dealings of one of Mr. da Silva\u2019s sons, Luis Cl\u00e1udio Lula da Silva, who is suspected of receiving illegal payments in connection to a scheme to reduce tax penalties for large corporations.Marcelo Odebrecht, scion of one of the country\u2019s richest families, was sentenced this month to 19 years in prison for his role in the scandal surrounding Petrobras, the national oil company. Other business titans who are friends of Mr. da Silva, like the construction magnate L\u00e9o Pinheiro, are also in jail.Then there are the politicians maneuvering to take power in case Mr. da Silva cannot salvage Ms. Rousseff\u2019s government. Waiting in the wings are the leaders of the Brazilian Democratic Movement Party, the centrists anchoring Ms. Rousseff\u2019s coalition government.One of its most powerful leaders, Eduardo Cunha, the speaker of the lower house of Congress, is resisting calls to step down. He faces charges of taking as much as $40 million in bribes for himself and his allies.Mr. da Silva is already reaching out to the leaders of the party to prevent them from breaking from the governing coalition, a move that would make Ms. Rousseff far more vulnerable to impeachment. After meeting with Mr. da Silva, Renan Calheiros, the president of the Senate, spoke admirably of the former president\u2019s \u201cgood ties to Congress.\u201dMore recently, he is facing claims of pocketing large bribes in the Petrobras scandal, remaining at the helm of the Senate thanks in part to the special judicial standing afforded to him and Mr. da Silva.\u201cWe\u2019re in the hands of leaders who are bandits,\u201d said Arivaldo Gomes, 54, a deliveryman. \u201cI\u2019m ashamed of this country.\u201dAnna Jean Kaiser and Mariana Sim\u00f5es contributed reporting.videoAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Awash in Empty Homes, China Asks Migrant Workers to Settle Down", "Date": "2016-03-09", "News": "Supported byBEIJING \u2014 Migrant workers are the unsung heroes of China\u2019s economic miracle. Numbering more than 270 million, they abandon their impoverished farms and villages to move to the cities, where they run the factories and build the highways and high-rises that have made China\u2019s growth the envy of the world.Now, as China\u2019s economy slows, the country\u2019s leaders have a new mission for them: Buy homes.China is looking for ways to get migrant workers to help buy up a huge glut of unsold homes that is dragging down the country\u2019s economic growth. Chinese leaders have eased taxes and down payment requirements. They are taking new steps to offer mortgages. And they have eased the tough laws that traditionally have kept migrant workers from putting down roots in big cities.The leaders want to turn people like Hong Qiwen into home buyers. Mr. Hong, 32, runs a small pastry shop in Xi\u2019an, a city in Shaanxi Province in the country\u2019s north. The province has said it will offer mortgages and other help as part of a $9.1 billion lending push to get people \u2014 especially migrants \u2014 to buy homes.But Mr. Hong, a father of two young children who is from a rural area in China\u2019s east, represents the challenge to China\u2019s effort. He has no plans to buy one in Xi\u2019an. \u201cI am like a fallen leaf that will eventually return to the roots,\u201d he said, invoking a Chinese proverb.The housing glut is one of the biggest drags on China\u2019s economy, and therefore one of the major drags on global growth. The empty homes have discouraged further investment in real estate, idling cranes and construction workers around the country.Investment in Chinese real estate reached nearly $1.5 trillion last year, according to official figures. Economists say the property sector\u2019s impact on the economy is even greater when related industries like steel and furniture-making are included. But growth has come to a standstill. After growing by double-digit percentage rates for more than a decade, Chinese real estate investment last year grew just 1 percent.The precise size of the housing glut is unclear. China nationally tracks square meters available for sale. Government data shows that the space in unsold residential units reached a high last year at 452 million square meters, more than twice as much as in 2011 and 130 times the size of Central Park in New York. (A square meter is a little less than 11 square feet.) Unlike typical homes in the United States, which are generally single-family houses, the typical Chinese home is an apartment in a residential complex.The real housing overcapacity may be more serious than official figures show. \u201cIf we take into account the land that hasn\u2019t started construction or newly started projects, the pressure from overcapacity will be greater,\u201d said Yan Yuejin, a property analyst at E-House R&D Institute in Shanghai.The problem stems from China\u2019s lending-and-spending binge eight years ago to stave off the effects of the global financial crisis. With $611 billion in spending, China rekindled growth but added to its surfeit of steel mills, cement kilns and glass factories \u2014 as well as empty homes. The glut was further fueled by Chinese investors looking for a place to park their wealth.The problem is most acute in China\u2019s less developed cities. Rapid increases in home prices persist in wealthier cities such as Beijing, Shanghai and the southern manufacturing mecca of Shenzhen, and analysts still warn of the potential for bubbles.For now, Chinese leaders seem mostly preoccupied with the backlog of unsold homes. President Xi Jinping was quoted in November as saying that \u201cdestocking the property market\u201d and \u201cpromoting the sustained development of the sector\u201d were important tasks for the coming year. Changjiang Daily, an official newspaper in the central city of Wuhan, likened the task of unloading vacant homes to \u201ca battle of annihilation.\u201dGovernment ministries have responded with a number of measures, such as reducing the deed tax and lowering requirements for down payments. The pressure is on: One Chinese provincial government has warned county- and city-level officials that they will be \u201cheld accountable\u201d if they fail, without specifying the penalties.China\u2019s economy is faltering, prompting concerns that are now shaking global stock markets.Part of the solution, officials believe, lies with China\u2019s hundreds of millions of migrant workers. Many are from the countryside and lack an urban hukou \u2014 the household registration that provides access to social services such as subsidized health care and state schools and the right to buy a home. Originally, that system was designed to keep rural workers from flooding Chinese cities.Now, provincial governments are encouraging the workers to stay, and many are focusing on initiatives tailored to migrants. In the central province of Henan, the government will subsidize city home purchases by migrant workers and give them easier access to an urban hukou. In Wuhu, in Anhui Province, the authorities have promised easy commercial bank loans to migrant workers.The policies are aimed at people like He Yong, 28, a driver from a village in Jilin Province, which borders North Korea and Russia. He hopes someday to get married, settle down in the nearby city of Hunchun \u2014 population 250,000 \u2014 and set up his own business. The policies to encourage that have not been introduced in his part of the country yet, but he hopes to take advantage of them.\u201cHere no one wants to marry you and live in the village,\u201d Mr. He said. \u201cWe all want to get a place in the city some day. Being a farmer is tiring and doesn\u2019t make much money.\u201dStill, the effort could prove to be tough. Hu Xingdou, an economics professor at the Beijing Institute of Technology, said rural residents hesitated to move into cities because rural services were improving, and they worried about compensation for their land and a lack of jobs in less developed cities.Mr. Hong, owner of the pastry shop in Xi\u2019an, currently rents an apartment in Xi\u2019an, but he doesn\u2019t plan to stay. Pollution and traffic make city life unpalatable, he said, adding that he could probably buy a modest home in a small city if he wanted to. Eventually, he said, he will probably settle down back in rural Jiangxi.\u201cI dreamed about city life when I was young, because many of the villagers who went there bragged about the city, which they said was full of new things,\u201d he said. \u201cBut once I began working in cities, I missed home a lot and was not entirely used to the city way of life.\u201dAdvertisement"}

I\u2019m going to finish up my term in the Senate over the next 10 months. We\u2019re going to work really hard here, and we have some things we want to achieve, and then I\u2019ll be a private citizen in January.\u201dLawmakers held that evening vote open for Mr. Rubio, who rushed in about 45 minutes after voting began. \u201cYou made it,\u201d one colleague called out as a group of senators circled him, grinning and patting him on the shoulder.

{"Headline": "Michigan Primary Puts Donald Trump\u2019s Rust Belt Strategy to a Test", "Date": "2016-03-06", "News": "Supported byWARREN, Mich. \u2014 Neil Mortensen remembers how neighbors lost factory jobs in this suburb north of Detroit, and then, inexorably and sadly, their homes.\u201cI\u2019d see all these businesses that used to produce normal products, even brooms, that everybody uses and purchases today, but are not produced here \u2014 they are produced overseas,\u201d he said.A construction manager, Mr. Mortensen escaped the waves of layoffs because his employer, which once built plants for heavy industry, is now in the demolition business. \u201cThose factories are gone, and I get to knock \u2019em down, unfortunately,\u201d he said.Mr. Trump\u2019s appeal to blue-collar voters, mostly whites, is driving his popularity in Michigan, where he has a polling lead ahead of the Republican primary on Tuesday. And these same voters, who historically supported Democrats, are at the core of his strategy for winning the general election and turning Democratic-leaning Rust Belt states back into the red column.Mr. Trump\u2019s rally here on Friday was in Macomb County, where political strategists first identified the phenomenon of Reagan Democrats. These white, working-class voters felt the party no longer protected their economic interests as it focused on affirmative action, welfare and other policies aimed at minorities.If he is the nominee, Mr. Trump argues, he can deliver not only Michigan but other Rust Belt states, like Ohio and Pennsylvania, into the Republican column in November, broadening the party\u2019s traditional road to the White House.A \u201cnormal Republican,\u201d Mr. Trump said at Macomb Community College, \u201ccannot think of bringing in Michigan, and if you don\u2019t bring in Michigan, it\u2019s tough. You have a very narrow road.\u201d\u201cBut I\u2019m going to bring in places like Michigan,\u201d he said, pledging to win back a once-solid Republican state that has supported Democrats in the last six presidential elections.The strategy might be a necessity if the party nominates Mr. Trump, because he would risk losing states, like Florida and Colorado, with large Hispanic populations. He has highly unfavorable ratings among Hispanic voters because of his call for a wall separating Mexico and his pledges to deport 11 million undocumented immigrants.Mr. Trump\u2019s signature issues of opposition to free trade and a crackdown on illegal immigration, which Republican leaders once dismissed as outside the mainstream, have brought him a populist following, including independents and some Democrats.\u201cI like what he wants to do with the immigration,\u201d said Marvin Bryant, a former salesman who attended the rally in Warren. Mr. Bryant plans to vote for Mr. Trump this week.Kurt Reidt, a captain of the Warren Fire Department, said his vote for Mr. Trump on Tuesday in the state\u2019s open primary would be his first ever for a Republican. \u201cThis is probably the worst state in the country with the economy,\u201d Mr. Reidt said as he entered the rally with members of his firehouse.Although Republican nominees for decades have carried the vote of white men without college degrees, they are a shrinking share of the electorate. Mr. Trump\u2019s ability to win Rust Belt states in a general election would require him to turn out these voters in historically large numbers.On Super Tuesday last week, he won 59 percent of voters without college degrees in Massachusetts and a plurality of 44 percent in Virginia, according to exit polls, en route to winning both states. He won much lower shares of voters who had graduated from college.In Massachusetts, 20,000 Democrats gave up their party registrations to vote in the Republican primary, which Mr. Trump won commandingly.But election experts say some of that surge came from people who were motivated to vote against Mr. Trump, which would also be a factor in the general election.\u201cSome polls show him getting about 20 percent of the Democratic vote,\u201d said G. Terry Madonna, who has long polled Pennsylvania. \u201cThey live in the Appalachian mountain chain, not just in Pennsylvania. The problem is, he would lose many center-right and moderate Republican voters who make up the voter-rich suburbs in key swing states.\u201dStanley B. Greenberg, whose research in Macomb County in the 1980s popularized the term \u201cReagan Democrat,\u201d said Mr. Trump might put the Rust Belt into play. \u201cThere\u2019s no doubt there\u2019s new voters coming into the Republican primary process,\u201d he said.But Mr. Greenberg added that there was an equal potential for a backlash in an electorate that is more racially and culturally diverse. \u201cThe country\u2019s changed pretty dramatically from the time when Reagan Democrats were calling the shots,\u201d he said.Mr. Trump spoke extensively in Macomb County about his plan to bring back manufacturing jobs, especially automotive jobs. He said he would pick up the phone to call the chief of any American company that moved factories to Mexico and threaten a 35 percent tariff (even though the president does not have that authority, and experts say if Congress agreed, it would likely set off a trade war).\u201cWithin 24 to 48 hours\u201d of such an ultimatum, Mr. Trump claimed, the chief of Ford would be on the phone. \u201cThey\u2019ll say: \u2018Mr. President, we\u2019re moving back. Would you like us to move to Michigan?\u2019 I\u2019ll say, \u2018Yeah, I really want you to move to Michigan.\u2019 And they\u2019ll move back.\u201dAccording to the Associated Press, Donald J. Trump and Hillary Clinton have each won enough delegates to claim their party\u2019s nomination for president.Since entering the race, Mr. Trump has harped on Ford\u2019s investment of $2.5 billion in a Mexico plant. The automaker\u2019s chief executive, Mark Fields, has said he sent Mr. Trump a letter pointing out that the company had also invested $10 billion in the United States and created more than 25,000 jobs since 2011.Representative Sander M. Levin, a Democrat who represents Macomb County in Washington, and who has opposed major trade deals for decades, said Mr. Trump was playing on people\u2019s fears with no practical solutions. \u201cHe pushes the buttons, but there\u2019s nothing behind it,\u201d Mr. Levin said. \u201cThe 35 percent tariff thing isn\u2019t workable.\u201d\u201cI think people more and more will realize it\u2019s demagogic,\u201d he added.But a sampling of two dozen voters who heard Mr. Trump on Friday turned up little skepticism about his promises. They felt strongly that he was the lone truth teller in the race. Many said they were doing well economically, even while painting a grim portrait of the state and the nation on issues like immigration and national security.Although the number of private-sector jobs has not returned to prerecession levels, Michigan\u2019s unemployment rate has fallen to 5.1 percent, down from nearly 15 percent at the height of the recession.Detroit\u2019s automakers are experiencing record sales.Nonetheless, the narrative of decline is pervasive, especially because many of the new jobs being created pay far less.\u201cWe\u2019ve got McDonald\u2019s and Burger King jobs, and that\u2019s about it,\u201d said Mr. Reidt, the fire captain.Gary Ragland, a retired time clock repairman, said his job had allowed him glimpses of a world of blue-collar jobs in auto plants, breweries and hospitals. \u201cIf you lose our manufacturing, you lose your country,\u201d he said.Although he was not sure Mr. Trump\u2019s plan for imposing 35 percent tariffs would bring back factories, he thought the threat alone could shake things up.\u201cYou can\u2019t have a sissy up there; you\u2019ve got to have a man,\u201d he said. \u201cHe has shown America \u2014 anybody that\u2019s awake \u2014 what the hell is going on.\u201dAn earlier version of this article, based on information received by a Michigan voter, described incorrectly the voter registration process in the state. Though the voter said he switched from Democrat to Republican last year, Michigan does not require voters to choose a party affiliation.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "E.P.A. Faces Bigger Tasks, Smaller Budgets and Louder Critics", "Date": "2016-03-18", "News": "Supported byThe leading Republican presidential hopefuls, Donald J. Trump and Ted Cruz, have each vowed to eviscerate the agency.\u201cWe are going to get rid of it in almost every form,\u201d Mr. Trump said at a debate this month. \u201cWe\u2019re going to have little tidbits left, but we\u2019re going to take a tremendous amount out.\u201dMr. Cruz, at the same debate, added, \u201cI will pull back the federal regulators, the E.P.A. and all the regulators that are killing small businesses and manufacturing.\u201dAnd House Republicans, at a hearing Thursday on the Flint water crisis, called for the E.P.A.\u2019s administrator to resign.No matter who emerges as the Republican nominee, the party\u2019s official policy will almost certainly take aim at the size, scope and structure of the E.P.A.Conservative policy makers are considering proposals that would effectively strip the agency of its authority to set, put in place and enforce pollution standards. The agency would continue to exist, at least in name, but it could end up functioning only as a small scientific research agency, possibly swallowed into another department.\u201cThere\u2019s no reason to have the agency in its current form,\u201d said Michael McKenna, a Republican energy lobbyist who has played a central role in drafting the party\u2019s environmental policy platform in previous presidential campaigns. \u201cSomething\u2019s going to be in the platform that gives the E.P.A. a serious haircut.\u201dDemocratic candidates are not exactly rushing to the agency\u2019s defense. Mrs. Clinton said that as president she would open an investigation into its handling of the Flint water crisis. Mr. Sanders said that he would \u201cfire anybody who knew about what was happening and did not act appropriately.\u201dAt Thursday\u2019s hearing, Representative Tammy Duckworth, Democrat of Illinois and a highly regarded Senate candidate, said she was \u201cextremely troubled by how the E.P.A. also failed in its duty to serve as the last line of defense for the children of Flint.\u201dThe agency\u2019s responsibilities have never been greater, and its resources have never been so strained. Because those global warming regulations have been issued under the legal authority of an existing law, the Clean Air Act, it could be difficult for a Republican president to simply repeal them outright. But substantially weakening the agency that enacts the rules could effectively hamstring Mr. Obama\u2019s climate change legacy.Historically, environmental regulations have required polluters to install new equipment like so-called smokestack scrubbers and catalytic converters in cars, factories and power plants.But Mr. Obama\u2019s current suite of climate change regulations, if enacted, would go far beyond that. The E.P.A. would effectively change how automobiles are propelled (with electricity, not gasoline) and how electricity is delivered (via wind and solar, not coal), said Bob Persciacepe, the agency\u2019s deputy administrator during Mr. Obama\u2019s first term.\u201cWe are at a pivotal moment in time, when, in fits and starts, the world is dealing with climate change and every country has to play an important role,\u201d he said. \u201cE.P.A. has been put in the spot to do this. The weight on their shoulders is heavy.\u201dAll of this is supposed to be accomplished under tight budgets imposed by a hostile Congress. The agency\u2019s spending under Mr. Obama has been cut between 10 and 20 percent below the budgets of the previous three administrations, when adjusted for inflation. The agency\u2019s budget has averaged about $8.8 billion annually under Mr. Obama, compared with (in today\u2019s dollars) $9.7 billion under George W. Bush, $10.6 billion under Bill Clinton and $10.4 billion under George Bush. The agency\u2019s 15,408 employees are its fewest since 1989.As the E.P.A. has taken on more work with fewer resources, problems have proliferated. Last year, after the E.P.A. accidentally spilled three million gallons of toxic wastewater from an abandoned mine into the Animas River in Colorado, a government report found that the agency lacked the technical skills to handle such tricky projects.The agency has also been criticized for its implementation of a regulation known as \u201cWaters of the U.S.,\u201d which would expand pollution controls over the nation\u2019s rivers and streams.\u201cIt\u2019s clear E.P.A. cannot currently handle the issues on its plate,\u201d Representative Scott DesJarlais, Republican of Tennessee, said Thursday.A spokeswoman for the E.P.A. declined to comment on the politics swirling around the agency. But Obama administration officials noted that the E.P.A. still enjoyed public support. A Pew poll in September 2015 found that 52 percent of respondents had a favorable view of the agency.That support could make it more difficult for a Republican president to enact some of the most drastic changes envisioned by those drafting the party\u2019s policy platform, because at least some proposals would have to go before Congress.

{"Headline": "Bank of England to Raise Bank Capital Buffer as Safeguard", "Date": "2016-03-29", "News": "Supported byLONDON \u2014 The Bank of England said on Tuesday that it would increase the size of a capital buffer it requires banks to hold to ensure they can provide lending and other essential banking services in times of financial stress.Lenders in Britain would be required to set aside the equivalent of 0.5 percent of their assets as weighted by risk by March 29, 2017, the central bank\u2019s Financial Policy Committee said on Tuesday.The Bank of England said it would like to gradually increase the so-called countercyclical capital buffer rate to 1 percent of risk-weighted assets. The rate, which is now set at zero, is intended to vary over time to reflect the risk that the banking system would incur losses on exposures in Britain in the future.The Financial Policy Committee also said that uncertainty surrounding a June 23 referendum on whether Britain should leave the European Union could lead to further depreciation of the pound and affect the cost and availability of loans in Britain.\u201cThe committee assesses the risks around the referendum to be the most significant near-term domestic risks to financial stability,\u201d the central bank said. \u201cIt will continue to monitor the channels of risk closely and support mitigating actions where possible.\u201dThe increase in the capital buffer, however, is not expected to result in another round of fund-raising by lenders, the central bank said.The Prudential Regulation Authority, a regulator within the Bank of England, is reducing a separate capital buffer requirement that overlapped with the countercyclical capital buffer.Removing the overlap will mean banks that account for about 75 percent of lending in Britain will not see their overall capital requirements increase, the Bank of England said.Many smaller banks will be among those whose future capital requirements will increase, the Financial Policy Committee said. Most of those banks, however, already hold enough capital to meet the requirements, the committee said.\u201cThe F.P.C. recognizes that these banks may wish to build capital over time in order to retain some excess over regulatory capital buffers, but their current position means that any such action will be able to take place gradually,\u201d the committee said.The tests will apply to seven of Britain\u2019s biggest banks and building societies, which account for about 80 percent of the lending to the British economy. This year\u2019s tests will examine macroeconomic and trading risks to bank portfolios, as well as projections for potential fines and other costs for improper conduct.The results will be released in the fourth quarter.Advertisement"}

The answer is most likely no, which is why Britons need to weigh the evidence carefully when they go to the polls in June to vote on leaving the E.U.Proponents of an exit criticize the union for taking too much power away from member nations and for issuing unnecessary and excessive regulations. This, the argument goes, has hurt Britain\u2019s economy. But the data does not back that up. It is far from clear that leaving would lead to faster growth and better living standards.

{"Headline": "The Road Not Taken to Better Jobs and Higher Pay", "Date": "2016-03-04", "News": "The report showed decent job growth: The economy added 242,000 new positions last month and job-growth tallies for December and January were revised upward by a total of 30,000 jobs. The unemployment rate held steady at 4.9 percent, which is actually a good sign: When the unemployment rate stays the same (or rises) even as jobs are added, it means that more jobless people are actively looking for work, rather than waiting on the sidelines for job prospects to improve.So, what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s wrong with that picture?One problem is that some two-thirds of the new jobs in February were in low paying fields of retail, restaurants and health care. Another is that average weekly hours fell by two-tenths of an hour. As a result, average hourly earnings fell last month, as did average weekly earnings. Last month\u00e2\u0080\u0099s declines were not enough to wipe out earlier gains, but progress has been slow. Over the past year, hourly wages grew by 2.2 percent, which is meager; weekly earnings were up 1.6 percent, barely ahead of recent inflation.Numbers like that indicate an economy in which people are working, but not getting ahead.They do not indicate, however, that the United States is failing, as Republican candidates on the campaign trail insist.In fact, Americans\u00e2\u0080\u0099 struggle to get ahead would be easier \u00e2\u0080\u0093 and the economy more equitable \u00e2\u0080\u0093 but for Republicans\u00e2\u0080\u0099 deplorable economic stewardship and obstructionist strategies.For example, the economic expansion of the George W. Bush years was the weakest in contemporary times; the Great Recession, which started at the end of 2007, and the financial crisis of 2008 \u00e2\u0080\u0094 also both on Mr. Bush\u00e2\u0080\u0099s watch \u00e2\u0080\u0094 further devastated any hope for good jobs and good pay.Since then, Republican resistance to fiscal stimulus has only made economic recovery more difficult. Even in the depths of recession in early 2009, no House Republicans and only three Senate Republicans voted to pass the stimulus bill put forward by the Obama administration. After that, Republicans used strong-arm tactics \u00e2\u0080\u0094 like threatening to default on the nation\u00e2\u0080\u0099s debt \u00e2\u0080\u0094 to impose federal budget cuts, even though the recession-damaged economy required more spending, not less. They have also blocked, obstructed or watered down other proposed spending measures that could have boosted the economy.There is no escaping the conclusion that their aim all along has been to foil the Obama presidency, even though it means prolonging economic pain for ordinary Americans.Against that backdrop, it is a wonder the economy had done as well as it has.By the same token, it is no wonder that the economy still needs more government spending. At the recent meeting of the Group of 20 leading industrialized nations, the International Monetary Fund and the O.E.C.D. warned of faltering global growth and strongly urged governments to boost demand with more fiscal spending, generally on infrastructure.Policy failures of the last nearly eight years have mainly been failures on the part of Republican lawmakers to act in the public interest.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "China\u2019s Outflows of Money Slowed in February", "Date": "2016-03-07", "News": "Supported byHONG KONG \u2014 Few economic statistics have gone as quickly from obscurity to the center of attention from international financial markets lately as China\u2019s foreign currency reserves, widely seen as the best barometer of how long China can avoid a possible devaluation someday of its own currency.Late Monday afternoon came word that the policies are starting to bear fruit: the erosion in China\u2019s foreign exchange reserves slowed sharply last month from the pace of $100 billion a month that prevailed through the winter. Reserves fell by $28.6 billion last month, to $3.202 trillion.Most economists had anticipated a somewhat larger drop in reserves \u2014 Barclays had expected a fall of $70 billion, for example.The decline announced on Monday \u201cis an encouraging sign because the concern amongst a lot of the bears was that the outflows would keep accelerating \u2014 the fact they\u2019ve eased is reassuring,\u201d said Julian Evans-Pritchard, the China economist for Capital Economics, a research firm based in London.Yi Gang, the senior deputy governor of the Chinese central bank, dismissed concerns about the nation\u2019s currency during remarks earlier in the day outside the National People\u2019s Congress session in Beijing. \u201cThe cross-border capital flows are in the normal range,\u201d he said.At a time of turmoil in world financial markets, the renminbi is actually among the most stable currencies, Mr. Yi added. \u201cOur volatility, the fluctuations of the renminbi against the U.S. dollar and also the fluctuations against a basket of currencies, in reality and from a global perspective, are fundamentally the smallest.\u201dBut since January, the central bank, the People\u2019s Bank of China, has set the daily fixing of the renminbi against the dollar in Shanghai with no clear trend toward the strengthening or the weakening of the currency. And state-controlled Chinese banks have also intervened heavily in the less regulated Hong Kong market to protect the currency\u2019s value here.As the economy stumbles, individuals and companies are pulling money out of China en masse, leaving the government scrambling to limit the outflows.Mr. Li included the money supply target in a broader panoply of measures aimed at maintaining economic growth at 6.5 percent or higher through 2020. Monetary stimulus helps economic growth by holding down interest rates. But lower interest rates also make it less attractive to invest in a currency, which could fuel further outflows of money from China.The reserves are a far from perfect measure of money leaving China. For starters, the change in the total value of the reserves is not influenced just by how much the central bank spends in currency markets to offset the outflow of money by Chinese companies and families.Changes in the value of China\u2019s vast hoard of government securities and some equities denominated in euros, yen, pounds and other currencies also affect the overall level of the reserves, which is quoted in dollars. Economists estimate that about two-fifths of the reserves are held in currencies other than the dollar, and the dollar weakened slightly against most currencies during February.That suggests that the overall value of the reserves increased by about $13 billion last month because of currency moves \u2014 and indicates that the outflow of money in the last month may have been $13 billion greater than the figure of $28.6 billion that was announced on Monday morning.Another consideration is China\u2019s huge trade surplus, which brings another $50 billion or so into the country each month, although the surplus narrowed to $32.6 billion last month, partly because of the Chinese New Year. The decline in reserves last month suggests that capital outflows may have totaled about $75 billion, using all of the nearly $33 billion from the trade surplus and the $13 billion or so from valuation changes, in addition to nearly $30 billion from the reserves.The change in central bank reserves does not include one other variable that will not be released until later this month and will provide a further clue on outflows: how much state-controlled banks spent on intervention last month.In the last two weeks, Chinese officials have said repeatedly that they do not see a need to devalue the country\u2019s currency against the three baskets, or weighted averages, of various foreign currencies against which the central bank measures it. The Chinese central bank strengthened the renminbi against the dollar by nearly 0.3 percent on Monday morning in fixing the daily band of values within which the renminbi is allowed to trade in Shanghai.Based on one model of reserves adequacy proposed by the International Monetary Fund, China needs a minimum of $1.5 trillion if it bars practically all investment flows in and out of the country. A minimum of $2.7 trillion is needed if China allows money to move in and out of the country freely. The central bank has been gradually tightening the enforcement of its regulations on capital flows.The level of China\u2019s reserves has become a subject of intense international interest as some large American hedge funds, like Hayman Capital Management in Dallas, have placed big bets in financial markets on a Chinese devaluation in the coming 12 to 18 months. \u201cI\u2019m not someone who hates China,\u201d said J. Kyle Bass, the founder and principal of Hayman Capital, in a telephone interview last week. \u201cWhat I\u2019m good at is spotting credit bubbles.\u201dBut Chinese officials and many Chinese economists disagree with that gloomy prediction. They contend that official statistics showing limited bank exposure to nonperforming loans are credible, and that bank reserves to handle these loans are ample.Chris Buckley contributed reporting from Beijing.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Glencore\u2019s Big Loss Reflects Hard Times for Mining Companies", "Date": "2016-03-01", "News": "Supported byThe company, based in Switzerland, had a $2.3 billion profit in 2014.In recent weeks, other major mining companies including the London-based Rio Tinto, BHP Billiton of Australia and Vale of Brazil have reported sharply lower operating results and net losses after writing down the value of assets because of depressed prices.Vale reported a staggering loss for 2015, $12.1 billion, on a combination of the diminishing value of its assets and a sharp decline in the Brazilian currency against the dollar.\u201cWe are now well and truly advanced in one of the worst bear cycles the mining industry has ever seen,\u201d said Paul Gait, an analyst in London at Bernstein Investment Research and Management.Mining executives have been cheered by the recent modest rise in most commodity prices, including oil, after lows at the beginning of the year. But they remain on guard.Ivan Glasenberg, Glencore\u2019s chief executive, told analysts on Tuesday that it was sometimes preferable to leave minerals in the ground rather than to try to feed them into an oversupplied market.Glencore differs from other mining companies in that, besides extracting raw materials, it also has large operations in trading and marketing oil, metals and other commodities. Though not a complete buffer, these businesses held up much better than the mines in last year\u2019s difficult market.The company also said it had reduced its net debt, which had been a major concern for investors, to $25.9 billion at the end of 2015, down from $30.5 billion a year earlier. Glencore said it planned to cut net debt to about $18 billion by the end of this year, with the help of as much as $5 billion in asset sales.Rio Tinto, which lost $866 million in 2015, and BHP Billiton, which reported a $5.7 billion loss for the six months that ended on Dec. 31, reacted by trimming large investments in new mines and other operations, and by adopting policies that will most likely reduce their rich dividends to shareholders.Glencore, spurred by a near panic among investors over its debt levels last year, has had to scramble more than other big mining companies to sell assets and reduce spending.The company has already brought in $1.4 billion from deals to sell silver and gold byproducts from copper mines. On Tuesday, it said it would consider other such deals, and it added that it had put copper mines in Chile and Australia up for sale. It has also curtailed production of copper and zinc at mines in Australia, the Democratic Republic of Congo and Zambia.The share price of Glencore, which is based in Baar, Switzerland, has been among the most volatile of the mining giants, as investors worried that falling commodity prices could prevent the company from maintaining payments on its relatively high debt.Gyrations in the company\u2019s stock price included a 29 percent drop on a single day in late September. The shares have since made up that lost ground. But the stock price, which rose 1 percent on Tuesday, is still nearly 60 percent below its level in May.Over the last two and a half years, the oil industry experienced its deepest downturn since at least the 1990s.Still, some analysts question whether any of the mining companies have adjusted to sharply lower prices for products like iron ore, copper and coal.Consider iron ore, a crucial business for companies like Rio Tinto and BHP Billiton. With additional production coming on the market from investments in new and bigger mines, especially in Australia and Brazil, supplies are growing \u2014 despite prices being down around 70 percent from the peak of about $190 a metric ton in 2011. Richard Knights, a mining analyst at Liberum in London, estimates that iron ore exports will grow about 6 percent this year.High prices for metals like iron ore encouraged companies like Rio Tinto to invest in bigger and more-productive mines, some of them engineering marvels.The heart of Rio Tinto\u2019s operations, for instance, is the Pilbara region of Western Australia, where the company has built an empire of 15 iron ore mines, with their own airports, railroads and ports. The main aim was to feed huge quantities of iron ore to China, whose share of world steel production rose to about half, from about a quarter, in the decade through 2014, as the country invested heavily in infrastructure and manufacturing.In the past two years, though, a slowing, shifting economy has reduced China\u2019s domestic demand for steel.With prices down, Rio Tinto and other companies have reduced their investments. And yet, as a result of additional mines coming into production, Rio Tinto and the two other major iron ore producers, BHP Billiton and Vale, are expected to increase output this year. Glencore, able to lean on its trading operations, is more likely to leave resources in the ground for now.\u201cWe will continue looking to cut production at any one of our operations if we believe we are not getting the right return,\u201d Mr. Glasenberg, the chief executive, said on Tuesday.With the cost of extracting and shipping iron ore in the range of $20 a metric ton, and prices now around $50 a ton, companies like Rio do not see much reason to cut back. They are still making money from their mines \u2014 but much less than before.Copper, a mainstay at BHP Billiton, is also profitable, Mr. Knights said.Probably the best hope for the mining companies is that the modest rise in most commodity prices in recent weeks signals that a modicum of stability has been reached. Copper, for example, was trading on Tuesday at $2.13 a pound, compared with a low of $1.94 in January.\u201cPerhaps we have come to some sort of plateau,\u201d Mr. Gait, the Bernstein analyst, said. \u201cThat interpretation is certainly possible.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Along one impeccably organized wall, they lift the spouts of gravity bins to let grains, nuts or legumes tumble into the tins and jars they\u2019ve brought along. At the bulbous stainless steel fusti, they dispense olive oil, balsamic vinegar or soy sauce into glass vessels. A customer samples a Medjool date, but looks confused about what to do with the pit \u2014 there are no napkins, no trash cans \u2014 and ends up stashing it in her pocket. She is, after all, shopping at a store committed to zero waste.Designed by the Los Angles-based architect Michael J. Brown, a disciple of Daniel Libeskind, the shop is a particularly sleek and modern manifestation of precycling, the concept of eliminating trash before it is created. If you don\u2019t use new plastic, paper or metal to begin with, you won\u2019t have to dispose of it.It\u2019s been 20 years since the Environmental Protection Agency began a media campaign to introduce precycling, but it\u2019s yet to catch on in any substantial way with Americans. Now, a new breed of mostly European store owners, who are as aesthetically sophisticated as they are ethically minded, are trying to change how we shop by presenting the market as a curated space. In an age in which we simultaneously expect and are overwhelmed by the sheer amount of choice at the grocery \u2014 this brand of whole-grain pasta or that one? \u2014 these stores offer something defiantly old-fashioned: one or two alternatives, selected by a member of a righteous cognoscenti. \u2018\u2018There\u2019s one kind of rice in my store,\u2019\u2019 said Andrea Lunzer of her eponymous Viennese shop. \u2018\u2018I don\u2019t have rices fighting with each other. I\u2019ve chosen for you \u2014 that\u2019s why it\u2019s called Lunzers.\u2019\u2019Lunzer hired a carpenter to create a black-and-white store worthy of Cecil Beaton\u2019s Ascot Gavotte, with dark woods, glossy walls and marble and stone surfaces, and a young industrial designer, Kathrina Dankl, to help design the customer experience. \u2018\u2018We needed an elegance that\u2019s welcoming, as you realize this is the new way you\u2019re supposed to shop if you care about the environment,\u2019\u2019 Dankl says. \u2018\u2018The mission was taking something that our grandmas knew very well \u2014 a personal relationship with a shop \u2014 but making it contemporary, a place where you pamper yourself but make conscious choices.\u2019\u2019When Judit Vidal and Iban \u00c0lvaro opened the first of their 12 Granel (Spanish for \u2018\u2018bulk\u2019\u2019) stores in Spain, their backgrounds in scenic design (her) and architecture (him) helped reinvent the look of bulk shopping. The bins of caramels and quinoa and arrangements of olives and honey are at eye level, essentially advertising themselves, their actual shapes and colors replacing photos on packages. Stepladders let young customers participate, while the grown-ups reacquaint themselves with weights and measures to buy exactly what they need from pale wood coffers under powder-coated industrial lamps.Then there\u2019s G\u00e9rard Bellet, who created a company specifically to precycle liquid goods. Jean Bouteille \u2014 which is available at certain organic groceries in France and Belgium \u2014 allows shoppers to decant vinegars, wines and detergents from gleaming steel tubes into reusable bottles with silk-screened labels designed by a typographer in Lille: Customers pay a small deposit for the bottles; when they\u2019re returned, they\u2019re cleaned and recirculated. \u2018\u2018You cannot kill the bottle,\u2019\u2019 said Bellet, who hopes to offer a precyclable way to buy soda and beer as well. \u2018\u2018The only way is if it breaks.\u2019\u2019PRECYCLING OFFERS a secondary reward as well, by making us re-see what we\u2019re looking at. Most packaging hides the good stuff, but there\u2019s no hiding the gorgeous greens and golds of the olive oil varietals poured from big blown-glass teardrops at the French bulk shops Day by Day. There is nothing hippieish about any of their nine markets: Some resemble Candyland, all primary colors under dancing glass mobiles; others are almost monastically white.This more thoughtful way of shopping does require some adjustment. Original Unverpackt owners Milena Glimbovski and Sara Wolf must occasionally explain that the canister of white pellets contains chewable toothpaste \u2014 no carton, no tube \u2014 or that the \u2018\u2018mooncups,\u2019\u2019 which already have a passionate fan base, are tampon alternatives made of medical-grade silicon. But they, like proprietors of similar stores, say that the size, shape and consistency of virtually any product could be altered to fit the zero-waste model. At Italy\u2019s Effecorta locations (which means \u2018\u2018short chain\u2019\u2019: a jibe at big supermarkets), shoppers use disposable plastic gloves to grab fistfuls of spaghetti from glass-domed containers, or scoop smaller shapes with ladles.Rethinking and reinventing groceries in the interest of the environment would require the cooperation of manufacturers, as well as consumers. Americans are like the Felix Unger of the retail economy, with a reputation for fastidiousness \u2014 that\u2019s why so many products are packaged and shrink-wrapped in layers of protection: Nobody\u2019s touched those coffee beans since Juan Valdez grew them. But we weren\u2019t always so persnickety; we used to buy pickles or crackers or penny nails from bins. Big Grocery, like Big Pharma, might argue that packaging provides 21st-century security, and that precycling on a grand scale is impractical. Not true, say these European shopkeepers: Their places are updating the old American general store cracker-barrel approach, while making hygiene a priority.So is America ready? Denver is about to find out when it gets Zero Market, co-founded by Lyndsey Manderson, a former high-school science teacher, whose new store will be located inside an old aviation hangar and will resemble a modern apothecary. The walls will be covered with reclaimed barn wood that\u2019s been sanded and waxed. Rolling ladders to access higher shelves will make shopping a bit of a joyride rather than drudgery. Amber- and clear-glass jars will be painted with chalkboard labels so the contents are both evident and inviting. \u2018\u2018We\u2019re asking people to slow down when they come to the store and take time to figure out how much they need,\u2019\u2019 said Manderson. \u2018\u2018And we\u2019ll have a tracker that will let them see the amount of packaging that\u2019s been diverted from landfill.\u2019\u2019 How long, then, until Brooklyn catches on?Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "In Search of the Entry-Level Art Buyer", "Date": "2016-03-18", "News": "Supported byWhat happens next now that the latest art market boom has apparently slowed?With both supply and demand at top-end auctions showing signs of shrinkage, the art world is seeking opportunities for growth further down the value chain.According to the European Fine Art Foundation, or Tefaf, which tracks sales using data from the auction houses and an online survey of 6,000 dealers, $63.8 billion in art and antiques were sold worldwide last year, a decline of almost 7 percent over 2014.The ever volatile art trade has had plenty of blips, of course. Sales fell 12 percent in 2012, and a hefty 36 percent in 2009 during the financial crisis. But there are plenty of reasons to believe that 2014, in which Tefaf calculated that $68.2 billion in sales were made, will be a high-water mark for some time to come.Plenty of billionaires collect art, and last year the supercharged auction market for postwar and contemporary works dipped, falling 14 percent to $6.8 billion, according to the Tefaf report.\u201cIt\u2019s early days,\u201d said Clare McAndrew, the founder of Arts Economics, who prepared the Tefaf report. \u201cBut if the top end is thinner, aggregate figures will go down. A lot of high-end sales aren\u2019t profitable, and it\u2019s difficult to see the auction houses courting sellers in the same way.\u201dWith economic conditions more uncertain in 2016, auction houses and their financial backers have been more hesitant to offer guarantees. As a result, owners of trophy works, if they do not have to sell, have been more reluctant to risk offering them at auction.This year, even what would seem to be surefire blockbuster lots are being offered without guarantees. On March 11, for example, Christie\u2019s announced that it would be selling a Peter Paul Rubens tour de force, \u201cLot and His Daughters,\u201d dating from 1613-1614, in its evening old masters auction in London on July 7.Offered without a guarantee by a descendant of the German banker and railroad magnate Baron Maurice Hirsch de Gereuth, who owned the painting in the 19th century, this hitherto little-known masterwork carries an estimate of at least \u00a320 million, or about $29 million.But if the top of the auction market for contemporary art looks as if it might have peaked, maybe demand can be reinvigorated from the bottom up.That is certainly the thinking at Sotheby\u2019s, which on Tuesday held its inaugural \u201cContemporary Curated\u201d auction in London. The format, well established in New York, where the company has held eight such sales, seeks to attract new buyers, with estimates as low as \u00a3500.A 1998 Antony Gormley cast iron figure sculpture, \u201cInsider VIII/Weeds I,\u201d sold to a European collector for \u00a3173,000, while at the other end of the price spectrum a 2013 ink drawing by Joy Gerrard, \u201cProtest Crowd, Moscow, Russia (Version 1),\u201d sold for \u00a3938 against a low estimate of \u00a3500.\u201cWe wanted to offer clients a platform to sell lower-priced works, to foster the spirit of collecting,\u201d said Alex Branczik, Sotheby\u2019s head of contemporary art in London. \u201cIn the future, some of these clients will go on to transact at higher levels.\u201dMr. Sayer, 70, has spent more than half a century amassing his eclectic collection. Contemporary art has been his main passion, and he has bought works by such major names as Gerhard Richter, David Hockney, Sol LeWitt and Henry Moore from various London dealers, often paying in installments and never spending more than \u00a37,000.\u201cI never thought about investment,\u201d Mr. Sayer said. \u201cAll I thought about was whether I could raise the money to buy it.\u201d\u201cThere were plenty of collectors in the 1970s of modest means interested in the history of art,\u201d he added. \u201cNow there is a vast gap between the old-fashioned connoisseurial collector and the new money type.\u201dThe sight of paintings, sculptures and books covering almost every available inch of wall in Mr. Sayer\u2019s home in North London is certainly more redolent of the 1970s than the 2010s, as is the notion of a relatively modestly paid professional being able to put together a museum quality art collection.In 2015, Britain supplanted China as the world\u2019s second largest national art market, after the United States, with 21 percent of sales, according to Tefaf. But, as the report also pointed out, the number of British households considered to be middle class fell by 27 percent from 1980 to 2010 while the number of wealthy households rose by 33 percent.Those dynamics have had an impact on what might be called today\u2019s \u201cprofessional class\u201d collecting, as evidenced at the Affordable Art Fair in Battersea Park last weekend. One of three such annual fairs held in London, the Battersea edition featured 110 dealers offering contemporary art at prices of \u00a3100 to \u00a35,000.Habitues of Art Basel and Frieze might dismiss much of what was for sale as \u201cpark railing\u201d art with negligible investment value, but on the closing Sunday the fair was packed with 30- and 40-somethings pushing strollers, happily browsing the booths to a soundtrack of Kid Creole and the Coconuts.Eyestorm, an online retailer in London, was one of the many dealers doing plenty of business, albeit within the modest price parameters of the Affordable formula. Seven floral skull prints made in 2015 in an edition of 50 by Jacky Tsai, a London-trained Chinese artist and fashion designer, found buyers at \u00a31,560 each, unframed.But some at the fair said they still found the art out of reach.\u201cThere\u2019s some really nice stuff, but it is more expensive than I thought,\u201d said James Pegram, 36, a structural engineer who lives on the outskirts of London. He and his wife were looking to pay about \u00a31,500 for something \u201clarge and bold\u201d for their house that would prompt visitors to say \u201cthat\u2019s really cool.\u201dThe market needs its Tim Sayerses as well as its billionaires, but in today\u2019s low-growth, \u201csqueezed middle\u201d economy, there are few people with the will or the means to fill their homes with art. With spending pinched at both the top and the bottom of the price scale, we might not be using the word \u201cboom\u201d again any time soon.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Al Qaeda\u2019s Branch in Africa Makes a Lethal Comeback", "Date": "2016-03-15", "News": "Supported byNow, the group is making a devastating comeback. Until relatively recently, it was best known around the world for kidnapping Westerners in remote parts of the Sahel and using the ransoms to support itself.\u201cFor AQIM, this is an evolution in terms of tactics and targeting,\u201d said Andrew Lebovich, a visiting fellow at the European Council on Foreign Relations who has tracked the group for years. \u201cIt shows a broadening of the group\u2019s appeal and much more staying power than many people thought.\u201dOn Monday, Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb said it had attacked the resort area over the weekend in revenge because Ivory Coast had handed over prisoners to Mali. But it also described the siege as part of its continuing \u201cplan to target the dens of the crusaders and locations of their gatherings,\u201d according to a translation released by the SITE Intelligence Group, which tracks extremist organizations. \u201cWe repeat our call to all countries involved in the French invasion of Mali to withdraw from this satanic alliance,\u201d it said.With the carnage left behind, the attacks are pummeling the economy and psyche of the region. Tourism is declining, hurting hotels that are already spending more on security. Governments worry that it will be harder to lure international companies, and organizations based in nations that have been hit are finding recruiting difficult.If the authorities chase the militants south, they risk letting up on patrols in the northern part of Mali. That stretch of sparsely populated desert, lined by lightly controlled borders, could become a new haven for the thousands of fighters with the Islamic State in Libya. The Islamic State appears to be pushing south, too, according to American military experts on counterterrorism in Africa.But in the ensuing months, Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb suffered major defeats at the hands of the French. The group has long been plagued by infighting, and though it has been around for years, it has lost members to the Islamic State.Some analysts said the merger most likely signaled that the two groups\u2019 leaders \u2014 Abdelmalek Droukdel and Mr. Belmokhtar, both Algerians and often rivals \u2014 had settled their differences at least temporarily to strengthen their brand in the face of defections to the Islamic State.Al Qaeda\u2019s regional affiliate has tried to use the attacks to stay relevant in an increasingly complex militant landscape. On Sunday, it even translated its responsibility statement for the Ivory Coast assault into multiple languages, including French, a marketing tactic adopted by the Islamic State.\u201cThose who were in charge for a long time of the military intelligence and national security services have been replaced by newcomers who do not have the same expertise and experience,\u201d said Paul Oumarou Koalaga, the executive director of Diplomacy and Peace International, based in Burkina Faso\u2019s capital, Ouagadougou.The violence by an array of terrorist groups in Africa may itself be indicative of growing competition. Each of the militant groups competes for essentially the same things: recruits, credibility and cash, all of which are scarce.Strikes on soft targets such as hotels are not particularly complicated, and are far easier and cheaper to pull off than controlling large swaths of land.Even so, terrorist groups still need a source of money to help them hide out. The status of Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb\u2019s finances is unclear. While it has reaped sizable ransoms for the release of hostages, its kidnappings of a Swiss missionary and an Australian doctor and his wife, who were taken the same day as the Splendid Hotel attack, could indicate a need for more cash.This month, the group set free Jocelyn Elliott, the wife of the Australian doctor, Ken Elliott, saying it was doing so because of public pressure and to adhere to principles of not involving women in war.Officials in Burkina Faso say no ransom was paid.Dionne Searcey reported from Dakar, Eric Schmitt from Washington and Rukmini Callimachi from New York.Advertisement"}

It once ran on gas, but now with electric power, it charges in 45 minutes.It is then filled with water \u2014 roughly 60 gallons, Mr. Corporan told us.He then takes the big, friendly beast onto the rink, firming the ice with hot water while smoothing it out with a blade.Unless the weather is warm.

{"Headline": "Prominent Tory Quits British Cabinet Over Welfare Cuts", "Date": "2016-03-18", "News": "Supported byLONDON \u2014 A former leader of Britain\u2019s Conservative Party, Iain Duncan Smith, resigned from the cabinet on Friday over proposed cuts to welfare payments, dealing a significant and unexpected blow to Prime Minister David Cameron.Mr. Duncan Smith, the work and pensions secretary, said in a statement that he was quitting over planned changes in benefits for disabled people that were announced Wednesday in a budget statement by the chancellor of the Exchequer, George Osborne.Mr. Duncan Smith\u2019s departure underscores the deep tensions within the government before a referendum scheduled for June 23 on whether Britain should leave the European Union.While Mr. Cameron and Mr. Osborne want Britain to remain in the 28-nation bloc, Mr. Duncan Smith is one of several cabinet ministers who want the country to quit the union.Relations between Mr. Duncan Smith and Mr. Osborne are thought to have been strained for some time, but the issue that provoked the resignation arose from Wednesday\u2019s budget statement, when limits on disability benefits were announced to help meet the government\u2019s deficit-reduction plans.Earlier on Friday, there were clear indications that the government was retreating from the proposed cuts in the face of growing opposition in Parliament, but that failed to prevent Mr. Duncan Smith\u2019s departure.\u201cI have for some time and rather reluctantly come to believe that the latest changes to benefits to the disabled and the context in which they\u2019ve been made are a compromise too far,\u201d Mr. Duncan Smith said in a resignation letter.He added that while such reductions were \u201cdefensible in narrow terms, given the continuing deficit, they are not defensible in the way they were placed within a budget that benefits higher-earning taxpayers.\u201d\u201cI am unable to watch passively whilst certain policies are enacted in order to meet the fiscal self-imposed restraints that I believe are more and more perceived as distinctly political rather than in the national economic interest,\u201d Mr. Duncan Smith wrote.In response, Mr. Cameron said that a decision had been made early Friday \u201cnot to proceed with the policies in their current form and instead to work together to get these policies right over the coming months.\u201d\u201cIn the light of this, I am puzzled and disappointed that you have chosen to resign,\u201d Mr. Cameron added.Though the government insisted that overall spending on disability benefits would grow, the changes outlined Wednesday suggested an eventual savings of more than 4 billion pounds, or about $5.7 billion, in disability benefits offered to about 640,000 people. At the same time, Mr. Osborne outlined plans to reduce corporate taxes and the capital gains tax.The leader of the opposition Labour Party, Jeremy Corbyn, said the resignation revealed \u201ca government in disarray and a chancellor who has lost the credibility to manage the economy in the interests of the majority of our people.\u201d\u201cThe budget has exposed George Osborne\u2019s record of profound unfairness and economic failure,\u201d Mr. Corbyn said in a statement.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Transcript of the Republican Presidential Debate in Detroit", "Date": "2016-03-04", "News": "Supported byFollowing is a transcript of the Republican debate, as transcribed by the Federal News Service.KELLY: Good evening, and welcome to the fabulous FOX Theatre in downtown Detroit, the site of the 11th Republican presidential debate of the 2016 campaign.KELLY: I\u2019m Megyn Kelly, along with my co-moderators, Bret Baier and Chris Wallace.BAIER: 59 Republican delegates are at stake here in the state of Michigan during next Tuesday\u2019s Republican primary, the biggest prize out of four states holding contests that day. For tonight\u2019s debate we\u2019re partnering with Facebook. The conversation about this election has been intense, as the crowd is here.Since January 1st, 53 million people in the U.S. have been talking about the election on Facebook.WALLACE: Tonight there are just four candidates on this stage. Their position has been determined by their standing in an average of the five most recent national polls as recognized by FOX News, and conducted and released by March 1st. Here they are.Businessman, Donald Trump.(CHEERING) (APPLAUSE)Texas Senator, Ted Cruz.(CHEERING) (APPLAUSE)Florida Senator, Marco Rubio.(CHEERING) (APPLAUSE)And, Ohio Governor, John Kasich.(CHEERING) (APPLAUSE)KELLY: Tonight\u2019s rules are simple. Up to 60 seconds for each answer, 30 seconds for each follow-up response, and if a candidate goes over the allotted time, you will hear this.(BELL RINGING)BAIER: So pleasant.KELLY: Really.BAIER: We have a big crowd here, and while we expect the audience to be enthusiastic and responsive at times... (CHEERING) (APPLAUSE)BAIER: ... they may have already been \u2014 we also expect them to be respectful, and we want the candidates to get their full time. So, somewhere between a library and a Red Wings game.(LAUGHTER) (CHEERING)BAIER: Am I right? Is that OK?Let\u2019s get started.WALLACE: Mr. Trump, as you may have heard, the 2012 Republican nominee for President, Mitt Romney, had some things to say about you today.He said your domestic policy will lead to recession, he\u2019s said your foreign policy will make us less safe, and then he listed what he said are your personal qualities. Quoting now Romney on Trump, quote, \u201cthe bullying, the greed, the showing off, the misogyny, the absurd, third-grade theatrics\u201d.(CHEERING)He challenged you to answer with substance, not insults. How do you answer Mitt Romney, sir?TRUMP: Well look, he was a failed candidate, he should have beaten president Obama very easy.He failed miserably, and it was an embarrassment to everybody, including the Republican party. It looked like he went away on a vacation the last month. So, I don\u2019t take that, and I guess, obviously, he wants to be relevant. He wants to be back in the game.As far as domestic policy and trade which is killing our country, he said free trade and I believe in free trade also. But, if you look at China, and you look Japan, and if you look at Mexico, both at the border, by the way, where they\u2019re killing us.Both at the border, and with trade \u2014 and every other country we do business with we are getting absolutely crushed on trade. And, he said free trade, I say free trade great. But, not when they\u2019re beating us so badly.With China we\u2019re going to lose $505 billion dollars in terms of trades. You just can\u2019t do it.Mexico, $58 billion dollars.Japan, probably about, they don\u2019t know it yet, but about $109 billion dollars.Every country we lose money with. As far as I\u2019m concerned, we\u2019ve got to reduce \u2014 we have to redo our trade deals 100 percent. I have the greatest business people in the world lined up to do it. We will make...(BELL RINGING)TRUMP: ... great trade deals.(CHEERING)WALLACE: Mr. Trump, Romney also talked about your position on race, and the controversy over your failure to denounce David Duke on Sunday. You have repeatedly disavowed him since then, but I\u2019d like to go deeper than that. What are your views on the Klu Klux Klan, and white supremacists?TRUMP: I totally disavow the Klu Klux Klan. I totally disavow David Duke. I\u2019ve been doing it now for two weeks, this is your \u2014 you\u2019re probably about the 18th person that\u2019s asked me the question. It was very clear, that question was also talked about in the form of groups. Groups, I want to know which groups are you talking about? You have to tell me which groups?Ultimately, he got to the Klu Klux Klan, which obviously I\u2019m going to disavow. And, by the way, if you look on my Twitter account, almost immediately after the program they were disavowed again.You know, it\u2019s amazing. When I do something on Twitter, everybody picks it up, goes all over the place. But, when I did this one nobody ever picks it up. Take a look at my Twitter account.WALLACE: Thank you, sir.TRUMP: Thank you. Thanks.(APPLAUSE)BAIER: Senator Rubio, three weeks ago you said, quote: \u201cI don\u2019t do the personal attacks, primarily because it\u2019s not who I am, because I think it\u2019s beneath the office that I\u2019m seeking but also because I don\u2019t want to embarrass my kids.\u201dBut in the past week you\u2019ve mocked Mr. Trump\u2019s tan. You\u2019ve made fun of his spelling. You called him a con artist. You suggested he wet himself backstage at the last debate, along with other vulgar jokes and jabs. So what happened?RUBIO: Yes, you know, Bret, let me say something. This campaign for the last year Donald Trump has basically mocked everybody with personal attacks. He has done so to people that are sitting on the stage today. He has done so about people that are disabled. He has done it about every candidate in this race.So if there is anyone who has ever deserved to be attacked that way, it has been Donald Trump, for the way he has treated people in the campaign.Now that said, I would much prefer to have a policy debate. I hope that\u2019s what we will have here tonight. Let\u2019s have a policy debate...TRUMP: And we will.RUBIO: ... let\u2019s talk about Donald Trump\u2019s strategy and my strategy and Ted\u2019s strategy and John Kasich\u2019s strategy when it comes to ISIS. And on health care and on the important issues facing this country.But let\u2019s be honest too about all this. The media has given these personal attacks that Donald Trump has made an incredible amount of coverage. Let\u2019s start talking again about the issues that matter to this country. I\u2019m ready to do that starting right here right now tonight.BAIER: Mr. Trump, your response?TRUMP: Well, I also happened to call him a lightweight, OK? And I have said that. So I would like to take that back. He is really not that much of a lightweight. And as far as \u2014 and I have to say this, I have to say this. He hit my hands. Nobody has ever hit my hands. I have never heard of this. Look at those hands. Are they small hands?(LAUGHTER)TRUMP: And he referred to my hands, if they are small, something else must be small. I guarantee you there is no problem. I guarantee.BAIER: OK. Moving on.KELLY: OK, Senator Cruz, you say that you are the true conservative in this race. But 15 states have voted now, and you have won only four of them. You have lost repeatedly with what is supposed to be your core voter groups, including evangelicals and conservatives.Hasn\u2019t your brand of conservatism been rejected by an electorate that appears to be more taken with Mr. Trump\u2019s populist message?CRUZ: Well, Megyn, you know, at the end of the day for the folks at home, this is not about the insults back and forth between the candidates. This is not about what attacks we can throw at each other. This is the people at home who are struggling through seven years of Barack Obama.This is the single moms who are working two and three jobs, 28, 29 hours a week because their hours have been forcibly reduced because of Obamacare. This is the truck drivers and the steel workers and the mechanics with calluses on their hands who have seen their wages not grow year after year after year while the cost of living goes up.This is all the young people coming out of school with student loans up to their eyeballs that aren\u2019t able to find a job.And I don\u2019t think the people of America are interested in a bunch of bickering school children. They are interested in solutions, not slogans. It\u2019s easy to say, make things better, make things great. You can even print it and put it on a baseball cap.But the question is, do you understand the principles that made America great in the first place? As president, I will repeal every word of Obamacare. I will pull back the regulators that are killing small businesses.And we will pass a simple flat tax and abolish the IRS. And what that\u2019s going to do, Megyn, is small businesses are going to explode. We are going to see millions of high-paying jobs. We are going to see wages going up. We are going to see opportunity.That\u2019s where our focus needs to be. That\u2019s where my focus is. And that is why our campaign is the only campaign that over and over again has beaten Donald Trump to date, and it\u2019s why we are the one campaign that going forward can and will beat Donald Trump in this election.KELLY: Go ahead, Mr. Trump. TRUMP: I have heard Ted say that over and over again on television, that he is the only one that can beat me. Just, for the record, I have won 10. He has won three or four. Last week, in fact, on Tuesday, I was a half a million votes higher than him. I was a million votes higher than Marco, 1 million votes. That\u2019s a lot of votes. And was by far in first place.So I keep hearing that he is the only one that can beat me but he is getting beaten very, very badly. So where does this come from? Where does it come from?KELLY: Go ahead, Senator Rubio.RUBIO: Yes, I would just say a couple of things. There is no doubt that Donald has done well in these elections. There is no doubt about that. The numbers are there.Here is what the numbers also say. Two-thirds of the people who have cast a vote in a Republican primary or caucus have voted against you. They do not want you to be our nominee.RUBIO: And, the reason why is because we are not going to turn over the conservative movement, or the party of Lincoln or Reagan, for example, to someone whose positions are not conservative. To someone who last week defended Planned Parenthood for 30 seconds a debate stage. To someone, for example, that has no ideas on foreign \u2014 someone who thinks the nuclear triad is a rock band from the 1980\u2019s.TRUMP: Oh yeah, you\u2019re...RUBIO: ... To someone who time and again on issue after issue has not proven that he has the principals...(BELL RINGING)RUBIO: ... That outline what the conservative movement has been about. And, as Ted said, the things that made America great.America is great because of the conservative principles of limited government and free enterprise, and a strong national defense...KELLY: ... OK...RUBIO: ... And, our nominee needs to be someone that stands by those things...KELLY: ... Alright...RUBIO: ... Donald has not demonstrated that.KELLY: ... Go ahead, Mr. Trump, and then we\u2019re going to have to go to Governor Kasich.(APPLAUSE)TRUMP: Very nice words, but happens to be wrong. CNN just came out with a poll two days ago that...RUBIO: ... (INAUDIBLE)TRUMP: ... That national poll \u2014 excuse me...RUBIO: ... (INAUDIBLE)TRUMP: ... The national poll \u2014 a national poll where he\u2019s at 15, he\u2019s at 14... RUBIO: ... (INAUDIBLE)...TRUMP: ... And, I\u2019m at 49, so when he says 75 percent, that would mean that 80 percent of the people don\u2019t dig you, and I\u2019m back down to 50...RUBIO: ... Of all the people on this stage, he performs the worst against Hillary Clinton.TRUMP: Wrong...RUBIO: ... If you\u2019re our nominee, we will lose...TRUMP: ... I beat Hillary Clinton. I beat Hillary Clinton in many polls...RUBIO: ... You lose by (INAUDIBLE) points (ph). She will wipe you out.TRUMP: I beat Hillary Clinton in many polls...RUBIO: If you\u2019re our nominee (INAUDIBLE)...KELLY: ... Hold on, Senator, hold on...TRUMP: ... I think I\u2019m talking...RUBIO: ... Oh, excuse me (INAUDIBLE)...TRUMP: ... I beat Hillary Clinton...KELLY: ... Hold on, hold on, hold on...TRUMP: ... I hope you think (INAUDIBLE)...KELLY: ... The audience cannot understand when you\u2019re talking over each other. Finish your point, Mr. Trump.TRUMP: ... I beat Hillary Clinton in many polls. The Cue (ph) poll just came out. I beat Hillary Clinton in a recent Fox poll, I beat Hillary Clinton in USA Today, I beat her today in a poll in Ohio. I beat \u2014 I\u2019m the only one that beats Hillary Clinton.I beat \u2014 and I have not started on Hillary yet. Believe me, I will...(CHEERING)TRUMP: ... start soon. I haven\u2019t even started.KELLY: OK.BAIER: Governor Kasich, today you admitted that you have a narrow path to the nomination through a contested convention. Today also Mitt Romney proposed that Republicans should vote for Senator Rubio in Florida. They should vote for you in Ohio. They should vote for Senator Cruz in states that he can beat Mr. Trump to prevent Mr. Trump from getting the nomination.So, do you buy Romney\u2019s blueprint, and can you say tonight to your Florida supporters that they should vote for Senator Rubio to get a contested convention?KASICH: You know, this so much about process. It frankly is boring to me. I would like it clear though, since we\u2019re talking about polls, I beat Hillary Clinton by more than 11 points, and the reason it happens...(CHEERING)TRUMP: ... In one poll...KASICH: ... The reason it happens...TRUMP: ... In one poll...KASICH: ... You know, the reason is because, as the Democrats tell me all the time, I can get the crossover votes. You see, because throughout this campaign I\u2019ve talked about issues, I have never tried to go and get into these scrums that we\u2019re seeing here on the stage. And, people say everywhere I go, \u201cyou seem to be the adult on the stage.\u201d(APPLAUSE)In terms of \u2014 you know, Mitt Romney\u2019s a great guy, but he doesn\u2019t determine my strategy. The fact of the matter is I\u2019m running for president because I worked hard to fix this country when I was in Washington as the Chairman of the Budget Committee where we had some of the most significant job growth after we balanced the budget.We had wages going up, it was very successful in Ohio. Our wages grow faster than the national average. We\u2019re up over 400,000 jobs. We paid down, back in the old days, they paid down half a trillion dollars of the national debt. It\u2019s a formula that works. And, I believe that formula will work when I return to Washington as the president.And, by the way, I won\u2019t need on the job training because I know how to do all of this, and within the first 100 days I will have a plan that will pass the Congress because...(BELL RINGING)KASICH: ... It is reasonable, and I can bring both sides together...(APPLAUSE)BAIER: ... But Governor, this is all about process. For voters, they need to see a path to get to the nomination if they\u2019re going to support you.On Super Tuesday you finished in single digits in nine out of 11 states. So, you can see that your path is through a contested convention. How do you...KASICH: ... Well, Bret, I think we\u2019re all really there. I mean, the simple fact is that, you know, you all wrote me off. You wrote me off before I even got to New Hampshire, then when I finished in New Hampshire you wrote me off in the South, then you wrote me off in Super Tuesday.I split delegates in Vermont with Donald Trump, I finished second in Massachusetts, and we won delegates in Virginia. But, guess what? It\u2019s now March Madness and we\u2019re heading up North to the place \u2014 to my turf, OK?(CHEERING)KASICH: And, let me just tell you this, I will win Ohio, and I am going to move all across this country, and over time as people begin to finally hear my message \u2014 you know what people say, Bret, to me all the time?Why don\u2019t they give you any time on the debate stage? Why is that?(CHEERING)KASICH: So now all of a sudden, I\u2019m starting to get it, and what I want the people to know is, I know how to bring people together, Republicans and Democrats. I have successfully, both at the federal level and the state level brought economic growth, wage growth, and economic security to this country.And I want to go back and do it again, and I\u2019m going to keep talking about my message of bringing people together and motivating people in the neighborhoods that realize they don\u2019t need somebody from Washington galloping in. There are many things they can do where they live, because the strength of our country is in our neighborhoods and our families. And I\u2019m going to keep doing this.(APPLAUSE)BAIER: Thank you.WALLACE: Well, then, we want to focus now on the economy, which is one of the top issues on Facebook, with 6.6 million people discussing it online. A lot of that conversation is happening here in Detroit, where the unemployment rate is 10.9 percent. That\u2019s more than double the national average.Senator Rubio, you have taken to calling Mr. Trump a con artist who portrays himself as a hero to working people while he\u2019s really been, in your words, \u201csticking it\u201d to the American workers for 40 years. But he has built a big company that employs thousands of people. Question. How many jobs have you created?RUBIO: Well, first of all, government doesn\u2019t...(AUDIENCE BOOS)First of all, Chris, my point is exactly right. He has spent a career of convincing Americans that he\u2019s something that he\u2019s not in exchange for their money. Now he\u2019s trying to do the same in exchange for their country. This is a fact. He talks about these great businesses that he\u2019s built. He inherited over $100 million.TRUMP: Wrong. Wrong.RUBIO: And with that money, he lost more money than he made.WALLACE: Mr. Trump, it\u2019s not your turn. You\u2019ll get your turn, sir.(CROSSTALK)RUBIO: He can start tonight by announcing that all the Donald Trump clothing will no longer be made in China and in Mexico, but will be made here in the United States.(APPLAUSE)And on the issue of job creation, I find this interesting. The private sector creates jobs. The jobs of those of us in public service are to put in place policies that allow the economy to grow.That\u2019s the problem with the Democratic Party. They think government is what creates jobs. Government does not create jobs.WALLACE: Sir? Mr. Trump, I\u2019d like you to respond. You have 30 seconds to respond. But as part of that, could you respond to his specific assertion about Trump Collection clothes, which you say some of it is made in Mexico?TRUMP: This little guy has lied so much...RUBIO: Here we go.TRUMP: ... about my record.RUBIO: Here we go. It\u2019s personal.(AUDIENCE BOOS)(CROSSTALK)TRUMP: He has lied so much about my record.WALLACE: Mr. Rubio \u2014 Senator Rubio, why don\u2019t you let him finish?TRUMP: And I will tell you this. First of all, I got a call from my sister and brother tonight, and they said we had no idea Dad gave you $200 million. Believe me, I started off with $1 million. I built a company that\u2019s worth more than $10 billion. And I say it not in a bragging way, but that\u2019s the kind of thinking we need.Very low debt, tremendous cash flow. My financials are all \u2014 they\u2019re all in there with the federal elections. You\u2019ve seen them. Everybody has seen them. I say it only because that\u2019s the kind of thinking this country needs with $19 trillion in debit. Believe me.(APPLAUSE)WALLACE: But wait one second. Specifically and quickly on the question, will you promise that you will \u2014 and how soon will you move your clothing collection, the clothes that are made in China and Mexico?TRUMP: They devalue their currencies. I will do that. And by the way, I have been doing it more and more. But they devalue their currencies, in particular China. Mexico is doing a big number now, also. Japan is unbelievable what they\u2019re doing.They devalue their currencies, and they make it impossible for clothing-makers in this country to do clothing in this country. And if you look at what\u2019s happened on Seventh Avenue, and you look at what\u2019s happened in New York with the garment industry, so much of the clothing now comes out from Vietnam, China, and other places. And it\u2019s all because of devaluation.By the way, the Trans-Pacific, if you look at the TPP, a total disaster, which, by the way, Marco is in favor of, they need \u2014 it is a disaster for our country. It\u2019s trying to be approved by various people, including President Obama. And I\u2019ll tell you something. The biggest problem with that is: They don\u2019t take into concurrence the devaluation. They\u2019re devaluing their currency.WALLACE: Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Trump. Senator Rubio?TRUMP: And they\u2019re killing \u2014 they\u2019re going to...(CROSSTALK)WALLACE: Wait, wait, Senator Rubio.RUBIO: The answer is, he\u2019s not going to do it. And you know why? Because there are plenty of clothing makers in America.(APPLAUSE)(CROSSTALK)And the second point, you see what happens, again, when you challenge him on a policy issue. You asked him about the economy, and the first thing he does is launch an attack about some little guy thing. Because he doesn\u2019t have answers.TRUMP: No, no. I have very good answers.RUBIO: And he\u2019s asking us to make him the president of the United States of America.(CROSSTALK) (APPLAUSE)RUBIO: This is not a game.TRUMP: I know what\u2019s happening with the economy. You don\u2019t know a thing.RUBIO: Well, then answer the economy question.TRUMP: You haven\u2019t employed in your life one person.RUBIO: But he doesn\u2019t answer the employment question.TRUMP: I have employed tens of thousands of people.(CROSSTALK)TRUMP: You haven\u2019t employed one person.RUBIO: You ever heard of Trump Steaks? You ever heard of Trump Vodka?TRUMP: Oh, you know what? You know what? Take a look at Trump Steaks.RUBIO: All of these companies he has ruined.TRUMP: By the way, that\u2019s the other thing...RUBIO: Trump Steaks is gone. You have ruined these companies.TRUMP: Mitt Romney...(CROSSTALK)TRUMP: ... false, totally false. And now the funny thing is he didn\u2019t talk about the hundreds of really successful jobs, the buildings all over the world that have made a fortune.(CROSSTALK)WALLACE: I have a policy question for you, sir.RUBIO: Let\u2019s see if he answers it.TRUMP: I will. Don\u2019t worry about it, Marco. Don\u2019t worry about it. Don\u2019t worry about it little Marco, I will.RUBIO: All right, well, let\u2019s hear it big Donald.TRUMP: Don\u2019t worry about it, little Marco.(CROSSTALK)WALLACE: Gentlemen. Gentlemen.(CROSSTALK)WALLACE: You have got to do better than this. TRUMP: This guy has a number one \u2014 the number one absentee record in the United States...WALLACE: Mr. Trump, I would like to ask you a policy question.TRUMP: He doesn\u2019t show up to vote.WALLACE: Your proposed tax cut...TRUMP: That\u2019s why the people in Florida do not like him.WALLACE: Mr. Trump, your proposed tax cut would add $10 trillion to the nation\u2019s debt over 10 years, even if the economy grows the way that you say it will. You insist that you could make up for a good deal of that, you say, by cutting waste, fraud, and abuse.TRUMP: Correct.WALLACE: Like what? And please be specific.TRUMP: Department of Education. We\u2019re cutting Common Core. We\u2019re getting rid of Common Core. We\u2019re bringing education locally. Department of Environmental Protection. We are going to get rid are of it in almost every form. We\u2019re going to have little tidbits left but we\u2019re going to take a tremendous amount out.We have various other things. If you look at the IRS, if you look at every single agency, we can cut it down, and I mean really cut it down and save. The waste, fraud, and abuse is massive.Larry Kudlow, great guy, everybody respects him, said my plan for taxes and tax cutting is the best by far of everybody.WALLACE: But, Mr. Trump, Mr. Trump, your numbers don\u2019t add up. Please put up full screen number four. The Education Department, you talk about cutting, the total budget for the education department is $78 billion.And that includes Pell grants for low-income students and aid to states for special education. I assume you wouldn\u2019t cut those things. The entire budget for the EPA, the Environmental Protection Agency, $8 billion.TRUMO: OK.WALLACE: The deficit this year is $544 billion. That\u2019s more than a half trillion dollars. Your numbers don\u2019t add up, sir.TRUMP: Let me explain something. Because of the fact that the pharmaceutical companies \u2014 because of the fact that the pharmaceutical companies are not mandated to bid properly, they have hundreds of billions of dollars in waste.We don\u2019t bid properly. We don\u2019t have proper bidding procedures. The reason we don\u2019t is because they take care of all of the senators, all of the congressman, and they don\u2019t bid. They don\u2019t go out to bid. WALLACE: Mr. Trump...TRUMP: Take a look \u2014 excuse me. You are talking about hundreds of billions of dollars...WALLACE: No, you are not.TRUMP: ... if we went out to the proper bid. Of course you are.WALLACE: No, you\u2019re not, sir. Let\u2019s put up full screen number 2.You say that Medicare could save $300 billion a year negotiating lower drug prices. But Medicare total only spends $78 billion a year on drugs. Sir, that\u2019s the facts. You are talking about saving more money on Medicare prescription drugs...TRUMP: I\u2019m saying saving through negotiation throughout the economy, you will save $300 billion a year.WALLACE: But that doesn\u2019t really cut the federal deficit.TRUMP: And that\u2019s a huge \u2014 of course it is. We are going to buy things for less money. Of course it is. That works out...WALLACE: That\u2019s the only money that we buy \u2014 the only drugs that we pay for is through Medicare.TRUMP: I\u2019m not only talking about drugs, I\u2019m talking about other things. We will save $300 billion a year if we properly negotiate. We don\u2019t do that. We don\u2019t negotiate. We don\u2019t negotiate anything.KASICH: Can I...WALLACE: No. I promise I will get to you in a moment, sir.Senator Cruz, one of centerpieces of your campaign, in fact, you mentioned it again tonight, is that you will abolish the IRS. Question though, who will collect the taxes that you are still calling for? Who will oversee to make sure that people pay the taxes that they rightfully owe? And who will check on the various tax deductions and tax credits that you still want?When he we get rid of all the corporate welfare, all the subsidies, all the carve-outs in the IRS code, it dramatically simplifies it. And under Obama, the IRS has become so corrupt and so politicized we need to abolish it all together.Now, at the end of that there will still be an office in the Treasury Department to receive the postcards but it will be dramatically simpler. CRUZ: And let me take a moment, Chris, to go back to go back to this exchange that was going on.In between all of the insults, let me point out the specificity that was lacking. It\u2019s very easy to say, \u201cLet\u2019s cut waste, fraud, and abuse.\u201d I\u2019ve rolled out a detailed plan to cut $500 billion in federal spending, specifying exactly what I would cut.(APPLAUSE)It\u2019s easy to say it, but one of the great disconnects to all the people, all of the voters, I understand the folks who are supporting Donald right now. You\u2019re angry. You\u2019re angry at Washington, and he uses angry rhetoric.But for 40 years, Donald has been part of the corruption in Washington that you\u2019re angry about.(APPLAUSE)And you\u2019re not going to stop the corruption in Washington by supporting someone who has supported liberal Democrats for four decades, from Jimmy Carter to John Kerry to Hillary Clinton. You\u2019re not going to stop the corruption and the cronyism by supporting someone who has used government power for private gain. Instead, we need a president who stands with the American people.(APPLAUSE)WALLACE: Governor Kasich, I promise I will get to you. But you do get 30 seconds to respond, Mr. Trump.TRUMP: Well, all of a sudden, I hear for 40 years I\u2019ve been involved in Washington. I have been supporting people for many years. And these people have been politicians, and they\u2019ve been on both sides, Democrats, Republicans, liberals, conservatives. I\u2019ve supported everybody, because, until recently, I wasn\u2019t a politician, and I hope maybe you don\u2019t all consider me a politician right now. I hate the term politician.But I\u2019ve been supporting politicians. A recent article somewhere said Donald Trump is a world-class businessman who goes out and he does get along with everybody. I\u2019ve supported Democrats, and I\u2019ve supported Republicans. And as a businessman, I owed that to my company, to my family, to my workers, to everybody to get along.Part of the problem we have in Washington, Chris...WALLACE: Mr. Trump...TRUMP: ... is it\u2019s total gridlock. Nobody gets along. We need people to get along. We need to be able to get things done.(APPLAUSE)WALLACE: Governor Kasich, Democrats, as you know, will make income inequality a big issue in the general election. You support raising the minimum wage, although you say not to the $15 an hour that Democrats are talking about. Mr. Trump opposes any increase because he says it will price American workers out of the world market. Is he wrong about that? No increase in the minimum wage?KASICH: Well, well, wait a minute, first of all, I didn\u2019t say I was for an increase in the federal minimum wage. I said in Ohio we increased it modestly every single year. So I\u2019m not for a federal minimum wage increase.WALLACE: But you did talk about states doing it.KASICH: Well, states \u2014 if states want to do it, they ought to sit down with businesspeople and the lawmakers and figure out what will work. But hold on a second here with everything else.I\u2019m the only person on this stage who actually was the chief architect of balancing the federal budget. It\u2019s not a theory for me. It\u2019s not \u2014 it\u2019s not some \u2014 you have to know how to put everything together. And you know, I spent 10 years of my life to get there, and I did not do that because I\u2019m worshiping at some balanced budget shrine.The reason I did it is when you have commonsense regulations, lower taxes on individuals and businesses, and you have a fiscal plan that makes sense, the job creators will expand employment. And what happened? When I was there, the jobs were exploding. Bill Clinton\u2019s tried to take credit for it. When I went to Ohio, we\u2019re up 400,000 jobs. It\u2019s the same formula.But it isn\u2019t easy. I fought the entire Washington establishment and won, because when you balance a budget, you must affect every single thing. Everything in the federal government specifically. You cannot get there with theories or broad statements, and you have to be willing to take the heat. In fact, I fought a Republican president, who I thought was not offering constructive proposals to fix this economy.So when we talk about all this, there\u2019s one person on this stage and one person who\u2019s been a candidate for president in either party that restored economic strength, growth, a balanced budget, paid down debt, cut taxes, the things that people in this country want. No theories. Reality.(APPLAUSE)WALLACE: Thank you, Governor.(APPLAUSE)KELLY: All right. Let\u2019s talk immigration for a little bit. Senator Cruz, let\u2019s start with you. You have repeatedly touted how you have stood shoulder to shoulder with Senator Jeff Sessions to fight illegal immigration and amnesty. But Senator Sessions just endorsed Donald Trump. If voters want Jeff Sessions-style immigration policies, isn\u2019t their choice rather clear?CRUZ: Yes, their choice is very clear. If you look to the actual record \u2014 you know, Donald mentioned a moment ago that he was just doing business when he was writing checks to liberal Democrats. But that\u2019s not, in fact, the checks he was writing.Listen, we could all understand if you write a check to a city commission because you\u2019re looking for a zoning waiver on building a building. That may be corrupt, but you could understand real estate developers doing that.CRUZ: That\u2019s not what Donald Trump did. Donald Trump supported Jimmy Carter over Ronald Reagan. Donald supported John Kerry over George W. Bush. If you don\u2019t like Obamacare, Donald Trump funded Harry Reid and Nancy Pelosi taking over Congress to pass Obamacare.On immigration, if you don\u2019t like amnesty, if you don\u2019t like the Gang of Eight, Donald Trump funded five of the eight members of the Gang of Eight $50,000.And let\u2019s talk about this election. The choice Republican primary voters are making is who is best prepared to stand up to Hillary Clinton and beat Hillary Clinton. Donald Trump has written checks to Hillary Clinton not once, not twice, not three times. Ten times. And four of those checks were not to her Senate campaign. It wasn\u2019t that she was the New York senator and it was a cost of doing business. It was to her presidential campaign.Donald Trump in 2008 wrote four checks to elect Hillary Clinton as president.KELLY: OK.CRUZ: So I\u2019d like to ask Donald, why did you write checks to Hillary Clinton to be president in 2008? It wasn\u2019t for business. And how can you stand on a debate stage now with her and say you don\u2019t think she should be president?(APPLAUSE)TRUMP: Actually, it was for business. It was. It was. It was for business. I pride myself, including outside of the United States. I\u2019m doing almost 120 deals outside of the \u2014 which I hope to be able to stop very soon and let my children handle it \u2014 but we\u2019re doing many, many deals outside of the United States.I support politicians. In 2008, I supported Hillary Clinton. I supported many other people, by the way. And that was because of the fact that I\u2019m in business. I did support very heavily Ronald Reagan. I also supported George Bush, by the way.KELLY: All right. Mr. Trump...CRUZ: But what would you say...KELLY: Well, stand by \u2014 stand by, Senator Cruz.CRUZ: ... to Hillary Clinton on the debate stage when you wrote her a check in 2008, wrote her four checks to be president?TRUMP: Let me tell you, something, Ted. The last person that Hillary Clinton wants to face is Donald Trump. That I can...(APPLAUSE)KELLY: Let\u2019s move on. And with all due respect, we have \u2014 we have questions. We have questions.TRUMP: That I can tell you.(CROSSTALK)KELLY: No, no, no. Hold on. Hold on. We can do more of this later. Mr. Trump, hi.TRUMP: Hello.KELLY: How are you doing?TRUMP: Nice to be with you, Megyn.KELLY: Great to have you here.TRUMP: You\u2019re looking well. You\u2019re looking well.KELLY: As are you.(APPLAUSE)Back in January, you gave an off-the-record interview to the New York Times. It was apparently audiotaped. Now, a recent report in Buzzfeed citing sources at the Times reports that in that interview you expressed flexibility when it comes to your immigration policy, specifically with respect to your promise to deport the 11 million people who are now living here illegally. You have suggested that you may have expressed some flexibility when it comes to the size of the wall that you want to build. But did you tell them, specifically, that you are flexible when it comes to your deportation plan?TRUMP: I don\u2019t know exactly what \u2014 when you talk about off the record. First of all, Buzzfeed? They were the ones that said under no circumstances will I run for president. And were they wrong. But a lot of people said that.Then, I did have a meeting with the editorial board of the New York Times, a very nice meeting. Many of those things were off the record, I think at their suggestion and my suggestion. And I think being off the record is a very important thing. I think it\u2019s a very, very powerful thing.And I will say this. These three gentlemen have gone off the record many times with reporters. And I think they want to honor it, and I would always honor that.I will say, though, in terms of immigration \u2014 and almost anything else \u2014 there always has to be some, you know, tug and pull and deal. And, you know, when I watch Ted stand on the Senate floor, I had great respect for what he did. He stood there for a day-and-a- half or something. In the meantime, what came of it? Nothing. You have to be able to have some flexibility, some negotiation.Now, sometimes you ask for more than you want and you negotiate down to the point. I may have discussed something like that with the New York Times, but I would never release off-the-record conversations. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s fair, frankly, to do that to anybody.KELLY: How flexible are you on this issue?(AUDIENCE BOOS)TRUMP: Not very flexible. No, not very flexible. I give the example \u2014 I\u2019m going to build a wall. I\u2019m the one that wants the wall. I\u2019m the one that can build the wall.(APPLAUSE)It\u2019s going to get built. And by the way, Mexico is going to pay for the wall. I can tell you that. Mexico is going to pay for the wall.(APPLAUSE)But \u2014 and I used an example. And this isn\u2019t necessarily what was said, but whatever was said, the wall\u2019s 50 feet high. Is it going to be 45 feet or 40 feet? That could very well be. That could very well \u2014 he wants it to be higher.(LAUGHTER)That could very well be. But there\u2019s always give and take. There\u2019s always negotiation. And the best negotiator that knows what he\u2019s doing will make a great deal. But we need give and take in government. If you don\u2019t have give and take, you\u2019re never going to agree on anything.(APPLAUSE)KELLY: Senator Rubio, you not only supported the failed immigration reform effort through the Gang of Eight, but you\u2019re still on record as favoring an eventual path to citizenship for those who are here illegally. And in addition...(AUDIENCE BOOS)... you favored in-state tuition for Florida illegal immigrants. You\u2019ve been hitting Mr. Trump hard on this flexibility discussion with the New York Times, but his supporters might say at least his opening stance was tough.RUBIO: Well, first of all, let me say that on the issue of the off-the-record, that\u2019s not up to the New York Times. That\u2019s up to you, Donald. If tonight you tell the New York Times to release the audio, they will do it, and we can exactly see what your true views are on immigration...TRUMP: Fine (ph).RUBIO: ... because it is a major issue, in your campaign that you\u2019ve made a center issue. Now, as far as my record on it is concerned, I absolutely want to solve this issue. And I did the best we could in a Senate that was controlled by liberal Democrats and Harry Reid in the hopes that the House, made up of conservatives, would take it up and make it even stronger. And I said that repeatedly at the time.I\u2019m not just saying that now; I said it throughout that process. We do need to do with this issue. (AUDIENCE BOOS)RUBIO: When I\u2019m president it will not be dealt with the way it was done in the Senate.It will be done first and foremost by bringing illegal immigration under control and proving it to the American people. And only after that is done can anything else happen.And it will be something the American people support. We\u2019ll see what they are willing to support. It\u2019s not going to be an executive order and we\u2019re not going to ram it down their throats.KELLY: Mr. Trump, we will let respond, but will you release the tapes? Will you authorize of The Times to release the tapes?TRUMP: I will say one thing, what Marco said is \u2014 I understand it. He is talking about a little give and take and a little negotiation. And you know what? That\u2019s OK. That\u2019s not the worst thing in the world.There is nothing wrong with that. I happen to be much stronger on illegal immigration. Sheriff Joe Arpaio endorsed me. And if he endorses you, believe me, you are the strongest, from Arizona.But give and take is OK. And I thought what he said is OK. We may differ on the degree. But what he said to me is OK.KELLY: Will you release the tapes?TRUMP: No. I never do that. I would not do that. I don\u2019t think \u2014 I have too much respect \u2014 if I deal with you off the record, if I deal with Bret or Chris off the record, I have too much respect for that process to say, just release everything. I would not do that.KELLY: OK. Stand by. We\u2019re going to continue this right after the break. We have more.BAIER: Coming up, more with Megyn on immigration, plus questions on other top issues, including the war on terror. The \u201cFOX News Republican Presidential Debate Live from Detroit\u201d continues after a quick break.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)KELLY: Welcome back everybody to the FOX News Republican presidential debate, live from the FOX theater here in Detroit. Let\u2019s get back now to the questions.Mr. Trump, your campaign website to this day argues that more visas for highly skilled workers would, quote, \u201cdecimate American workers\u201d. However, at the CNBC debate, you spoke enthusiastically in favor of these visas. So, which is it?TRUMP: I\u2019m changing. I\u2019m changing. We need highly skilled people in this country, and if we can\u2019t do it, we\u2019ll get them in. But, and we do need in Silicon Valley, we absolutely have to have.So, we do need highly skilled, and one of the biggest problems we have is people go to the best colleges. They\u2019ll go to Harvard, they\u2019ll go to Stanford, they\u2019ll go to Wharton, as soon as they\u2019re finished they\u2019ll get shoved out. They want to stay in this country. They want to stay here desperately, they\u2019re not able to stay here. For that purpose, we absolutely have to be able to keep the brain power in this country.(APPLAUSE)KELLY: So you abandoning the position on your website...TRUMP: ... I\u2019m changing it, and I\u2019m softening the position because we have to have talented people in this country.KELLY: And you\u2019re not releasing the discussion with the New York Times behind closed doors...TRUMP: ... That is correct.KELLY: Which will have some asking whether, on your immigration policies, you\u2019re really just playing to people\u2019s fantasies, which is a tactic...TRUMP: ... No, I\u2019m not playing.KELLY: ... you praised in your book, The Art of the Deal.TRUMP: I\u2019m not playing to anybody\u2019s fantasies, I\u2019m playing to the fact that our country is in trouble, that we have a tremendous problem with crime. The border is a disaster, it\u2019s like a piece of Swiss cheese. We\u2019re going to stop it, we\u2019re going to stop people from coming into our country illegally. We\u2019re going to stop it.(APPLAUSE) (CHEERING)KELLY: Senator Cruz, not long ago you propose quintupling the number of these foreign worker visas. After you announced for president, you reversed yourself, citing reports that the program was being abused. But, that abuse had been around long before your 180. In fact, it was so bad that just a few months earlier that a bipartisan group of senators called for an investigation and you declined to join them.Isn\u2019t it a good thing that the American public didn\u2019t trust Ted on that one?CRUZ: Well, the abuse of the H1-B program has been rampant. On the face of that H1-B abuse, I have proposed, and promised as president that I will impose a 180 day moratorium on the H1B program to implement a comprehensive investigation and audit because you got U.S. companies that are firing American workers, bringing in foreign workers, and forcing them to train their replacements.And, I would note that is not dissimilar to what we discovered at the last debate concerning the hotel that Donald owns down in Florida. Down in Florida that hotel has brought in hundreds of foreign workers, and afterwards it was really striking.I watched the CNN interview Donald did where he explained, he said, well the problem is you can\u2019t find Americans who are qualified, or who want to work as waiters and waitresses. Now, let me ask the people here, how many people have worked as a waiter or waitress?(APPLAUSE)CRUZ: Millions across this country. That is an astonishing statement. You know, Marco\u2019s Dad started as a bartender. My Dad started washing dishes, and yet, you know how many Americans wanted those jobs?(BELL RINGING)CRUZ: Roughly 300 applied, Donald hired 17. And, that\u2019s why this New York Times tape is so troubling because what\u2019s been reported is that Donald told the Editorial Board of the New York Times what I\u2019m saying on immigration, I don\u2019t believe. I\u2019m not going to build a wall, I\u2019m not going to deport people, this is all just rhetoric for the voters.Now, if he didn\u2019t say that, he has an easy solution. Simply release the tape.But, for everyone at home who\u2019s mad at politicians that lied to us, Donald\u2019s record right now as he standing here...KELLY: ... OK.CRUZ: ... His record right now is one of repeatedly hiring illegal aliens...KELLY: ... Times up, sir...CRUZ: ... abusing (ph) American workers...KELLY: ... Go ahead, Mr. Trump.TRUMP: First of all I\u2019ve had tens of thousands of people working for me, most of which are \u2014 98, 97, 98 percent of the people in this country, from this country. I\u2019m very proud of it. You have a club in Palm Beach, Florida called the Mar-a-Lago Club, it\u2019s a very, very successful club. It has a very short season, it\u2019s called, the Season, and it goes from November until March.It\u2019s a few months, five months at the most. People don\u2019t want a short-term job. They don\u2019t want \u2014 so, we will bring people in, and we will send the people out. All done legally, all done with the process that\u2019s...(BELL RINGING)TRUMP: ... Approved by government in Palm Beach, or West Palm Beach. We bring people in, we bring them out. We want to hire as many Americans as we can, but they don\u2019t want part-time, very short part-time jobs.KELLY: Understood. Thank you.RUBIO: That\u2019s not accurate. I\u2019m sorry, Megyn, that\u2019s not accurate. That\u2019s my \u2014 there were at least 300 Americans that applied last year, none of them were hired. Some of them...TRUMP: ... Wrong...RUBIO: ... have been interviewed...TRUMP: ... That\u2019s wrong.RUBIO: ... They were not hired...TRUMP: ... Wrong...RUBIO: ... And, here\u2019s why he does it this way, let me explain why he (INAUDIBLE) H2-B...TRUMP: ... Wrong...RUBIO: ... Because when you bring them in this way, when you bring someone in on one of these visas they can\u2019t go work for anybody else. They either work for you or they have to go back home. You basically have them captive, so you don\u2019t have to worry about competing for higher wages with another hotel down the street. And, that\u2019s why you bring workers from abroad.You argue that you\u2019re here to fight on behalf of the American worker, but when you have chances to help the American worker... (BELL RINGING)...RUBIO: ... but when you have chances to help the American workers, you\u2019re making your clothes overseas and you\u2019re hiring your workers from overseas.(APPLAUSE)KELLY: Go ahead, sir.TRUMP: The \u2014 the \u2014 the other hotels during the season, they do the same thing. They take in a lot of people, because you can\u2019t get them. They take in a lot of people. Long-term employees, we don\u2019t do that, but short-term employees, we have no choice but to do it, and other hotels in that very, very hot area. It is a very hot area.RUBIO: There were Americans in that hot area.TRUMP: It\u2019s very, very hard to get people. But other hotels do the exact same thing. And just so you understand, just again, this is a legal process. This is a procedure. It\u2019s part of the law. I take advantage of that. There\u2019s nothing wrong with it. We have no choice.KELLY: All right.CRUZ: Donald, you could resolve this issue very quickly by simply...(AUDIENCE BOOS)... releasing the New York Times tape. Because, listen, maybe it\u2019s right.TRUMP: This wasn\u2019t on the subject.CRUZ: ... that you didn\u2019t tell them you\u2019re misleading the American people. If that\u2019s the case...TRUMP: Tapes were not on the subject, but that\u2019s...CRUZ: If you didn\u2019t tell them that, the tapes will prove you\u2019re innocent.KELLY: OK.CRUZ: But if, in fact, you went to Manhattan and said I\u2019m lying to the American people, then the voters have a right to know.TRUMP: No, no. You\u2019re the liar. You\u2019re the lying guy up here.(CROSSTALK)CRUZ: Because we\u2019ve been lied to too many times.TRUMP: You\u2019re the \u2014 you\u2019re the one. You\u2019re the one.CRUZ: Why don\u2019t you release the tapes? Release the tapes.TRUMP: You\u2019re the one. Now, let me just tell you. Let me just tell you.(CROSSTALK)TRUMP: Excuse me. Excuse me. I\u2019ve given my answer, Lyin\u2019 Ted. I\u2019ve given my answer.KELLY: All right. Let\u2019s leave it at that.(AUDIENCE BOOS)Let\u2019s leave it at that. We have more to get to.(AUDIENCE BOOS)BAIER: Gentlemen, the next topic to discuss is terrorism. Senator Rubio, ISIS is a big topic of conversation on Facebook. We have a map that shows the conservation about ISIS around the country. You proposed sending a larger number of American ground troops to help defeat ISIS in Syria and Iraq...RUBIO: That\u2019s correct, and Libya.BAIER: ... but military commanders say the biggest ISIS threat to Europe in particular now is coming from Libya, not Syria.RUBIO: Correct.BAIER: So just to be clear, if you\u2019re for putting more U.S. ground troops in Iraq and Syria, are you also ready to send U.S. ground troops on the ground in Libya?RUBIO: Well, Bret, what I\u2019ve argued from the very beginning is ISIS \u2014 in order to defeat ISIS, you must deny them operating spaces. This is how ISIS or any radical group, for that matter, can grow. It\u2019s how Al Qaida was able to carry out 9/11, is that the Taliban gave them an operating space in Afghanistan.Today that operating space has largely been based in Iraq and Syria, but I\u2019ve been warning about the Libyan presence for the better part of two years. So they need to be targeted wherever they have an operating space. They do need to be defeated on the ground by a ground force made up primarily of Sunni Arabs themselves. This is a radical Sunni movement. They can only be defeated if they are driven out and the territory is held by Sunni Arabs. But it will require a specific number of American special operators, in combination with an increase in air strikes. And that will include, if necessary, operating spaces in Libya, which, in fact, they are using to project into the Sinai against Egypt and ultimately into Europe, as well.BAIER: Governor Kasich, would you put ground troops in Libya?KASICH: Well, first of all, just to be clear, not only did I serve for 18 years on the Defense Committee, more than anybody on this stage, but, secondly, I was called into the Pentagon after 9/11 to help Secretary Rumsfeld with some of his difficulties.I will say, look, let me tell you what happened with Libya. And I pointed out in the last debate \u2014 Hillary Clinton worked aggressively to depose Moammar Gadhafi. We had no business doing it. He was working with us. He was cooperating with us. He denuclearized. And now they pushed him out, and now we have a fertile ground for ISIS.Fortunately in Libya, there\u2019s only a few cities on the coast, because most of Libya is a desert. The fact of the matter is, we absolutely have to be \u2014 and not just with special forces. I mean, that\u2019s not going to work. Come on. You\u2019ve got to go back to the invasion when we pushed Saddam Hussein out of Kuwait. We have to be there on the ground in significant numbers. We do have to include our Muslim Arab friends to work with us on that. And we have to be in the air.And we \u2014 it should be a broad coalition, made up of the kinds of people that were involved when we defeated Saddam. Now, you\u2019ve got to be on the ground and in the air both in Syria and Iraq. And at some point, we will have to deal with Libya. I am very concerned about ISIS getting their hands on the oilfields in Libya and being able to fund their operations. The fact is cool, calm, deliberate, effective, take care of the job, and then come home. That\u2019s what we need to do with our military foreign policy.(APPLAUSE)BAIER: Mr. Trump, just yesterday, almost 100 foreign policy experts signed on to an open letter refusing to support you, saying your embracing expansive use of torture is inexcusable. General Michael Hayden, former CIA director, NSA director, and other experts have said that when you asked the U.S. military to carry out some of your campaign promises, specifically targeting terrorists\u2019 families, and also the use of interrogation methods more extreme than waterboarding, the military will refuse because they\u2019ve been trained to turn down and refuse illegal orders.So what would you do, as commander-in-chief, if the U.S. military refused to carry out those orders?TRUMP: They won\u2019t refuse. They\u2019re not going to refuse me. Believe me.BAIER: But they\u2019re illegal.TRUMP: Let me just tell you, you look at the Middle East. They\u2019re chopping off heads. They\u2019re chopping off the heads of Christians and anybody else that happens to be in the way. They\u2019re drowning people in steel cages. And he \u2014 now we\u2019re talking about waterboarding.This really started with Ted, a question was asked of Ted last \u2014 two debates ago about waterboarding. And Ted was, you know, having a hard time with that question, to be totally honest with you. They then came to me, what do you think of waterboarding? I said it\u2019s fine. And if we want to go stronger, I\u2019d go stronger, too, because, frankly...(APPLAUSE)... that\u2019s the way I feel. Can you imagine \u2014 can you imagine these people, these animals over in the Middle East, that chop off heads, sitting around talking and seeing that we\u2019re having a hard problem with waterboarding? We should go for waterboarding and we should go tougher than waterboarding. That\u2019s my opinion.BAIER: But targeting terrorists\u2019 families?(APPLAUSE)TRUMP: And \u2014 and \u2014 and \u2014 I\u2019m a leader. I\u2019m a leader. I\u2019ve always been a leader. I\u2019ve never had any problem leading people. If I say do it, they\u2019re going to do it. That\u2019s what leadership is all about.BAIER: Even targeting terrorists\u2019 families?TRUMP: Well, look, you know, when a family flies into the World Trade Center, a man flies into the World Trade Center, and his family gets sent back to where they were going \u2014 and I think most of you know where they went \u2014 and, by the way, it wasn\u2019t Iraq \u2014 but they went back to a certain territory, they knew what was happening. The wife knew exactly what was happening.They left two days early, with respect to the World Trade Center, and they went back to where they went, and they watched their husband on television flying into the World Trade Center, flying into the Pentagon, and probably trying to fly into the White House, except we had some very, very brave souls on that third plane. All right?(APPLAUSE)BAIER: Senator Cruz, you were mentioned.TRUMP: I have no problem with it.BAIER: Senator Cruz?CRUZ: Bret, you know, I think the American people understand that yelling and cursing at people doesn\u2019t make you a tough guy. We need a commander-in-chief that, number one, will rebuild the military, just like Ronald Reagan did in 1981 coming out of the weak Jimmy Carter administration. He passed tax reform and regulatory reform. The economy took off. It generated millions in high-paying jobs, trillions in new revenue. He rebuilt the military, bankrupted the Soviet Union, and won the Cold War.As president, I will do the exact same thing with radical Islamic terrorism. We will rebuild this military so that it remains the mightiest fighting force on the face of the planet. And then, when I am commander-in-chief, every militant on the face of the Earth will understand that if they go and join ISIS, if they wage jihad against the United States of America, they are signing their death warrant.(APPLAUSE)BAIER: But, Senator Cruz, in 2013, you said you were open \u2014 you were open to the possibility that Edward Snowden had performed a considerable public service, you said back then, in revealing certain aspects of the NSA procedures. Many of your colleagues in the Senate, including Senator Rubio, called him a traitor. It took you until January of this year to call him a traitor and say he should be tried for treason. Why the change of heart? And why did it take you so long?CRUZ: Well, Bret, as someone who spent much of his life in law enforcement, I believe you should start with the facts and evidence first before ending up with the verdict. When the news first broke of the United States government engaging in massive surveillance on American citizens, that was a very troubling development, and it\u2019s why the United States Congress acted to correct it.Now, at the same time, I said in that initial statement that if the evidence indicated that Edward Snowden violated the law, he should be prosecuted for violating the law. And, indeed, since then, the evidence is clear that not only does Snowden violate the law, but it appears he committed treason. Treason is defined under the Constitution as giving aid and comfort to the enemies of America, and what Snowden did made it easier for terrorists to avoid detection.And Snowden\u2019s comments afterwards, and his behavior afterwards, he fled to Russia, he fled to China. His conducts afterwards indicates that he was not a whistleblower, but instead he was undermining the ability to defend this country. But we need a president who isn\u2019t rash, who doesn\u2019t just pop off at the \u2014 at the hip, but waits to see what the facts are and then acts to defend this country.(APPLAUSE)BAIER: Mr. Trump, you\u2019ve repeatedly deflected calls for specific national security or defense policy plans with the claim that you\u2019ll ask the best people when you become president, and take their advice.So who are the best people? Can you reveal two or three names that you trust for national security?TRUMP: I think Richard Haass is excellent. I have a lot of respect for him. I think General Keane is excellent. I think that there are \u2014 I like Colonel Jacobs very much. I see him. I know him. I have many people that I think are really excellent but in the end it\u2019s going to be my decision.When you just asked the question about Snowden, I will tell you right from the beginning, I said he was a spy and we should get him back. And if Russia respected our country, they would have sent him back immediately, but he was a spy. It didn\u2019t take me a long time to figure that one out. Believe me.But I would get the best people, people that I\u2019d be comfortable with. And we will do the right thing.KASICH: Bret, it\u2019s very interesting to note, I think it\u2019s for the good of the record here that they took a survey of foreign policy magazines, 700 foreign policy experts, who would be the best person to conduct foreign policy of all the candidates in the race?I received 55 percent of the vote. Jeb Bush received 30 percent of the vote. And everybody else, none of them made double digits. And that\u2019s because you have to have the experience.And you know, we hear about Ronald Reagan rebuilding the military. I was there when Ronald Reagan rebuilt the military. I worked with him. I was there when Ronald Reagan rebuilt the economy. I was there, and I worked with him. I knew Ronald Reagan.And I\u2019ll leave it right there with what comes after that. You can figure that one out.BAIER: Governor Kasich, thank you.KELLY: We\u2019re going to have more questions for the candidates right after this break. And during the commercial break, join us for a \u2014 Facebook live on the FOX News Facebook page and tell us what you think about tonight\u2019s debate in the comment section. (COMMERCIAL BREAK)BAIER: Welcome back to the historic Fox Theater in downtown Detroit and the Republican presidential debate. Let\u2019s get right back to the questions.KELLY: Mr. Trump, one of the things people love about you is they believe you tell it like it is. But time and time again in this campaign, you have actually told the voters one thing only to reverse yourself within weeks or even sometimes days. We\u2019ve teed up just three examples in a videotape, similar to those we used with Senator Rubio and Senator Cruz in the last debate. The first is on whether the war in Afghanistan was a mistake. Watch.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)CUOMO: What about in Afghanistan? Do you believe that American boots should stay on the ground in Afghanistan to stabilize the situation?TRUMP: We\u2019ve made a terrible mistake getting involved there in the first place. That thing will collapse about two seconds after they leave. Just as I said that Iraq was going to collapse after we leave.(UNKNOWN): About Afghanistan, you said we made a terrible mistake getting involved there in the first place.TRUMP: We made a mistake going into Iraq. I\u2019ve never said we made a mistake...(UNKNOWN): Our question was about Afghanistan. That day on October...TRUMP: Well, OK, I never said that.(UNKNOWN): ... was on Afghanistan.TRUMP: OK. Wouldn\u2019t matter. I never said it.(END VIDEO CLIP)KELLY: Next, on whether we should accept...TRUMP: Should I respond to that first?KELLY: Two more, and then you\u2019ll have the floor. Next on whether we should accept the Syrian refugees...TRUMP: You\u2019ll be here a long time.KELLY: On whether we should accept the Syrian refugees.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)O\u2019REILLY: Do you object to migrants who are getting out of the Middle East and North Africa? Do you object to them coming to the USA?TRUMP: I hate the concept of it, but on a humanitarian basis, with what\u2019s happening, you have to. It\u2019s living in Hell in Syria; there\u2019s no question about it. They\u2019re living in Hell.HANNITY: Are you saying absolutely people from Syria, the Middle East, should we allow any of them into this country?TRUMP: Look, from a humanitarian standpoint, I\u2019d love to help, but we have our own problems. We have so many problems that we have to solve.(END VIDEO CLIP)KELLY: Most recently, on whether President George W. Bush lied to get us into the Iraq war.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP: They lied. They said there were weapons of mass destruction; there were none. And they knew there were none.I don\u2019t know if he lied or not. He could have lied. Maybe he did. Maybe he didn\u2019t. I guess you\u2019d have to ask him.(END VIDEO CLIP)KELLY: And there are many other examples. So how is any of this \u201ctelling it like it is\u201d?TRUMP: Well, on Afghanistan, I did mean Iraq. I think you have to stay in Afghanistan for a while, because of the fact that you\u2019re right next to Pakistan, which has nuclear weapons, and we have to protect that. Nuclear weapons change the game.And I was always against going into Iraq. In fact, I \u2014 believe me, I was always against it. There was some cases where I sort of \u2014 in one interview with a great friend of mine, and yours, Howard Stern \u2014 said that \u2014 said that...(LAUGHTER)I said very meekly, long before we went in, I said very meekly, well, maybe, maybe, I don\u2019t know. By the time it got to that point, I was always against Iraq. But Afghanistan, I felt \u2014 and in that one, if you notice, I corrected it the second day. OK? Second question? KELLY: There are several examples, Mr. Trump.TRUMP: No, no. But...KELLY: We went through the Afghanistan being a mistake. Within one day, you reversed yourself on Syrian refugees.TRUMP: Now on \u2014 let me explain that. You\u2019re right. Let me explain. First time the question had been put to me, it was very early on. The migration had just started. And I had heard that the number was a very, very small number.By the second day, two or three days later, I heard the number was going to be thousands and thousands of people. You know, when they originally heard about it, they were talking about bringing very, very small numbers in.And I said, begrudgingly, well, I guess maybe that\u2019s OK. It was not like, \u201cLet\u2019s bring them in,\u201d because I think we should build a safe zone in \u2014 we should really \u2014 what we should be doing is building safe zones so they can stay in their own country and not go all over, and at least this way we\u2019re not going to have the problem. That\u2019s what we have to do.(APPLAUSE)But just \u2014 just to set \u2014 because I fully understand what you\u2019re asking. When I first heard the question, first time the question was ever asked to me, first time I really had known about the question, the migration had just started. I was very much like, OK, by the time I went back and studied it, and they were talking about bringing thousands and thousands, I changed my tune. And I don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything wrong with that.KELLY: But the point I\u2019m going for is you change your tune on so many things, and that has some people saying, what is his core?TRUMP: Megyn, I have a very strong core.(APPLAUSE)I have a very strong core. But I\u2019ve never seen a successful person who wasn\u2019t flexible, who didn\u2019t have a certain degree of flexibility. You have to have a certain degree of flexibility.(APPLAUSE)You can\u2019t \u2014 for instance, let\u2019s say, on \u2014 on the second question, you can\u2019t say it\u2019s OK, and then you find out it\u2019s not OK, and you don\u2019t want to do anything. You have to be flexible, because you learn. I mean, before I knew the question was asked by Bill, and the next day, or the couple of days later, the question was asked by, by \u2014 you know \u2014 I was asked by a number of people, actually. I was asked by Sean, but I was asked by a number of people. But by that time, the number had increased significantly.KELLY: Sean was the next day after Bill.TRUMP: The next day. But I had learned. I mean, nobody had ever asked me the question. This was brand new. But \u2014 and I really mean it. You have to show a degree of flexibility. If you\u2019re going to be one way and you think it\u2019s wrong, does that mean the rest of your life you have to go in the wrong direction because you don\u2019t want to change? (APPLAUSE)KASICH: Megyn.TRUMP: (INAUDIBLE)KELLY: Go ahead, Governor.KASICH: I did 200 meetings in New Hampshire, I don\u2019t know how many in Michigan now. In these townhalls people come in and they\u2019re very emotional meetings. And, you know what they really want to know? If somebody tells them something, can they believe it?And, the reason why people are so upset in this country is because politicians all the time tell them what they want to hear. And, they go to Washington, or they go to the state capital, wherever, and they don\u2019t deliver on those promises.You know, when I ran for Governor of Ohio, I said not only would we balance the budget, but we would cut taxes. People said that can\u2019t be done. I wouldn\u2019t have said it if I didn\u2019t believe it.We cut taxes in Ohio more than any governor in the country, and $5 billion dollars worth of tax cuts \u2014 we\u2019re not running a surplus in Ohio. But, you see, what\u2019s getting in the hearts and souls of the people is they want change, and they keep putting outsiders in to bring about the change, then the change doesn\u2019t come. Then they put more outsiders in because we\u2019re putting people in that don\u2019t understand compromise. They don\u2019t understand policy...(BELL RINGING)(APPLAUSE)KASICH: ... They\u2019re getting more and more frustrated with the system which is why we must pick somebody that has a record of achievement, not just talk.KELLY: OK.KASICH: Not just talk, but a record of achievement. That\u2019s how we\u2019ll restore credibility..RUBIO: ... This isn\u2019t just about flexibility.KELLY: Go ahead, Senator. RUBIO: There\u2019s a difference between flexibility and telling people whatever you think you need to say to get them to do what you want them to do.(CHEERING)RUBIO: And, that\u2019s what Donald has done throughout his career.TRUMP: (INAUDIBLE)RUBIO: Well, he did, and that\u2019s why Trump University...TRUMP: ... That\u2019s not right...RUBIO: ... Is so relevant here. I saw this video last week where he\u2019s sitting in front of a camera saying we\u2019re going to hire the best people, and I\u2019m going to hand pick them. There are going to be hand picked and instructors, the best instructors in the world. One of them, but the way, was the manager at a Buffalo Wild Wing. And, that\u2019s who they hired to do this, and people borrowed money, and they signed up for this fake university.And, these people owe all this money now, and they got nothing in return for it, but you are willing to say whatever you had to say...(BELL RINGING)RUBIO: ... To get them to give you their money...KELLY: ... Go ahead, Mr. Trump...TRUMP: ... We\u2019ll find out when we have the (INAUDIBLE)...RUBIO: ... And, we\u2019re not going to do that to our country...TRUMP: ... And, by the way, just so you understand...(APPLAUSE)TRUMP: ... This is a case I could have settled very easily, but I don\u2019t settle cases very easily when I\u2019m right. Ninety-eight percent approval rating, we have an \u201cA\u201d from the Better Business Bureau...RUBIO: ... That\u2019s false...TRUMP: ... We have a 98 percent approval rating from the people who took the course. We have an \u201cA\u201d from the Better Business Bureau. And, people like it. Now, he\u2019s saying they didn\u2019t learn.We have many, many people that will be witnesses. Again, I don\u2019t settle cases. I don\u2019t do it because that\u2019s why I don\u2019t get sued very often, because I don\u2019t settle, unlike a lot of other people.We have a situation where we will win in court...(BELL RINGING) TRUMP: But, many of the people that are witnesses did tremendously well, and made a lot of money...RUBIO: ... That\u2019s false...TRUMP: ... By taking the course.KELLY: Go ahead, Senator.TRUMP: You\u2019re going to see, you don\u2019t know...RUBIO: ... The Better Business Bureau gave it a \u201cD\u201d minus.TRUMP: You\u2019re going to see, you\u2019re going to see.KELLY: ... It\u2019s Senator Rubio\u2019s turn...TRUMP: ... No, no. Before they had the information...TRUMP: ... Before they had the information...KELLY: ... Senator Rubio, standby, let him finish his point, and then I\u2019ll give you the floor...TRUMP: ... Before they had the information it got \u2014 it is right now an \u201cA\u201d, once they had the information...RUBIO: ... (INAUDIBLE) this anymore.TRUMP: ... The only reason that is was a \u201cD\u201d was because we didn\u2019t care \u2014 we didn\u2019t give them the information...RUBIO: ... A third of the people (INAUDIBLE)...TRUMP: ... When they got the information it became an \u201cA\u201d...KELLY: ... With respect \u2014 wait. With respect...TRUMP: ... Marco you don\u2019t know (INAUDIBLE)...KELLY: ... With respect, we went back and looked at this...TRUMP: ... Yes.KELLY: The rating from the Better Business Bureau was a \u201cD\u201d minus...(CHEERING) (APPLAUSE) TRUMP: ... (INAUDIBLE)KELLY: ... that\u2019s the last publicly available rating in 2010, and it was the result of a number of complaints they had...The New York Times will be checking assertions made throughout the 2016 presidential campaign.TRUMP: ... But it was elevated to an \u201cA\u201d...UNIDENTIFIABLE MALE: (INAUDIBLE)KELLY: ... That\u2019s never been publicly available.TRUMP: ... I can give it to you. I can give it to you tomorrow..KELLY: ... Let\u2019s just bring the viewers up to speed, let\u2019s just bring the viewers up to speed.TRUMP: ... It was elevated to an \u201cA\u201d.KELLY: Let me just set the record, and then you guys can have at it. There was Trump University, which was a business that you started, and it was marketed...TRUMP: ... Small business...KELLY: ... to many people, and now there is a class-action of over 5,000 plaintiffs against you, Mr. Trump...TRUMP: ... Right...KELLY: ... And, it involves veterans, and it involves teachers, and it involves so-called little guys, working class, and lower- working class and middle class who say that they were fleeced, who say that it was as scam. The class has been certified, and in that case you counter-sued the lead plaintiff alleging that you were being defamed.That case was thrown out against her...TRUMP: ... The lead plaintiff is now getting out of the case because it\u2019s so bad for her...KELLY: ... But, what happened was...TRUMP: ... Excuse me, the lead plaintiff signed a letter saying how great it was, and it on tape saying how great it was.KELLY: OK, no, but \u2014 standby. But, what happened in that case was you counter-sued her. The court threw out your counter-suit, and made you pay almost $800,000 dollars in legal fees of hers, and you made the same argument about 98 percent of the people being happy with Trump University. And, that woman in particular signing a survey saying she liked it while someone was standing over her shoulder...TRUMP: ... She\u2019s trying to get out of the case. She\u2019s trying to get out of the case...KELLY: ... And this is what \u2014 standby, this is what the Court of Appeals found. They said that the plaintiffs against you are like the Madoff victims...TRUMP: Oh, give me a break... KELLy: ... This is what the Court of Appeals said.TRUMP: Give me a break.KELLY: This is what the court of appeals said.TRUMP: Give me a break.KELLY: They found that victims of con artists often sing the praises of their victimizers until they realize they have been fleeced.TRUMP: You know what, let\u2019s see what happens in court. This is a civil case. Very easy to have settled. Could settle it now. Very easy to have settled. Let\u2019s see what happens at the end of a couple years when this case is over, OK?KELLY: It has been going for five years.TRUMP: Yes, it has been going for a long time.KELLY: Go ahead, Senator.RUBIO: I spoke to one of the victims yesterday.TRUMP: We\u2019ll win the case.RUBIO: I spoke to one of the victims yesterday.TRUMP: One, one of the victims.RUBIO: No, there are several. Obviously there are so many, I can\u2019t talk to them every day. I spoke to one of them, he told me exactly what happened. They signed up for this course because they believed Mr. Trump was this fantastic businessman, that Donald is going to teach them the tricks of the trade.They signed up. They paid $15,000 for this course. They were asked for additional money for this course. If they really wanted the real secrets of success, they had to pay even more money, and so they did.And you know what they got in these courses? Stuff you can pull off of Zillow. When they finally realized what a scam it was, they asked for their money back.And you refused to give them their money back. Why don\u2019t you tonight...TRUMP: I gave many people their money back. RUBIO: Then why don\u2019t you tonight say you\u2019re going to give the money back to everybody who wants...TRUMP: Let me just...(CROSSTALK)KELLY: OK. Senator Rubio, let him answer.(CROSSTALK)KELLY: Let him answer.Go ahead, Mr. Trump.TRUMP: We will see who\u2019s right at the end of a few years. But all of the \u2014 almost all of the people, many, many people signed what\u2019s called the report card at the end, did you like the course, how did you like it.Almost all of them said it was terrific, OK? With letters, with this. Some of them are on tape saying it was terrific. Let\u2019s see what happens at the end of three years.KELLY: With respect, Mr. Trump, one-third of the plaintiffs in that case demanded refunds. So it\u2019s not the case that 98 percent were...TRUMP: I gave some refunds to people because if they asked for the refunds in a certain period of time, and we gave refunds to people.KELLY: OK.TRUMP: But let\u2019s see what happens at the end of three years. Let\u2019s see who\u2019s right.KELLY: Still a pending litigation.(CROSSTALK)TRUMP: It\u2019s called pending litigation.RUBIO: Megyn, this is why this is relevant to this election.KELLY: All right. Senator Rubio then Senator Cruz. Go ahead.RUBIO: This is why, because he\u2019s trying to do to the American voter what he did to the people that signed up for this course. He\u2019s making promises he has no intention of keeping. And it won\u2019t just be $36,000 that they lose, it\u2019s our country that\u2019s at stake here.The future of the United States and the most important election in a generation, and he\u2019s trying to con people into giving them their vote just like he conned these people into giving him their money. TRUMP: Let me tell you the real con artist. Excuse me. Excuse me. The real con artist is Senator Marco Rubio who was elected in Florida and who has the worst voting record in the United States Senate.He doesn\u2019t go to vote. He\u2019s absent. He doesn\u2019t go. Now, the people of Florida can\u2019t stand him. He couldn\u2019t get elected dogcatcher. The people of Florida \u2014 the people of Florida \u2014 and by the way, I know he\u2019s going to spend $25 million on ads. Without that he wouldn\u2019t have a chance. He\u2019s 20 points south.The people in Florida wouldn\u2019t elect him dogcatcher. He couldn\u2019t get any \u2014 he\u2019s right now 21 points down to me. And, you know...KELLY: OK.TRUMP: ... again, there will be a lot of advertising. It\u2019s the only thing that might save him. But I doubt it.RUBIO: Notice that\u2019s not an answer.KELLY: I\u2019m coming to you next. But go ahead.(CROSSTALK)TRUMP: He scammed the people of Florida. He scammed people. He doesn\u2019t vote. He doesn\u2019t show up for the U.S. Senate. He doesn\u2019t vote. He scammed the people. He defrauded the people of Florida.KELLY: With respect, you\u2019ve made that point.Go ahead.RUBIO: There\u2019s no \u2014 as you can see in his answer, it\u2019s always the same thing.TRUMP: You defrauded the people of Florida, little Marco.RUBIO: He has defrauding people out of things, and not just \u2014 and not just, by the way, on the issue of Trump University. He had another development in Mexico that he had nothing to do with except his name on the building. People put money into that building.TRUMP: That was licensing.RUBIO: They lost their money. Yes, licensing, but you told them you owned the building. So they gave him his money. They lost their money. Time and again...KELLY: All right. Stand by. I will come back to you. Senator Cruz wants to weigh in. You\u2019re coming back.Go ahead.CRUZ: Megyn, let me ask the voters at home, is this the debate you want playing out in the general election? The stakes in this election are too high. For seven years, millions of Americans, we\u2019ve been struggling, wages have been stagnating, people are hurting, our constitutional rights are under assault.And if we nominate Donald, we\u2019re going to spend the spring, the fall, and the summer with the Republican nominee facing a fraud trial...TRUMP: Oh, stop it.CRUZ: ... with Hillary Clinton saying...TRUMP: It\u2019s just a minor case. It\u2019s a minor case.CRUZ: ... why did you give my campaign and my foundation $100,000?TRUMP: It\u2019s a minor civil case.CRUZ: And with Hillary Clinton...TRUMP: Give me a break.CRUZ: ... pointing out that he supported her four times in her presidential race.TRUMP: It\u2019s a minor civil case.CRUZ: Donald, learn not to interrupt. It\u2019s not complicated.TRUMP: There are many, many civil cases.CRUZ: Count to 10, Donald. Count to 10.TRUMP: Give me a break.CRUZ: Count to 10. The stakes are too high and if you are one of the 65 to 70 percent of Republicans who recognize that nominating Donald would be a disaster, then I ask you to come join us. If you\u2019re supporting other candidates, come join us.We welcome you to our team because we\u2019ve demonstrated not once, not twice, not three times, but five separate times we have beat Donald. And if you don\u2019t want him to be the nominee, then I ask you to stand with us as a broad coalition of people who believe in the Constitution, believe in freedom, and want to turn this country around.KELLY: Go ahead, Mr. Trump.TRUMP: I don\u2019t believe these politicians. All talk, no action. I\u2019m standing here listening to \u2014 I\u2019m hearing him say about a percentage. CNN, he gets 15. That means 85 percent, based on what you\u2019re saying, of the people don\u2019t dig you, number one, number one. Is that a correct statement? How do you get \u2014 are you at 15 in the new CNN poll? Do you believe in CNN? I mean, I know we\u2019re with FOX. But CNN spent \u2014 CNN...CRUZ: All right, I\u2019ll respond...(CROSSTALK)TRUMP: CNN spent a lot of money on a poll, just came out. I\u2019m at 49. He\u2019s at 15. He tells me about 65 percent of the people. It\u2019s not 65 percent of the people. If you go by that, 85 percent of the people.Then he goes, we have five. And \u2014 well, excuse me, I won 10. I won 10 states. If you listen to him, it\u2019s like \u2014 I won 10 states. Everybody knows that on Super Tuesday Trump was the winner. There wasn\u2019t one person that didn\u2019t say that. Even the two people on your left and right said we did a great job. So how does he take \u2014 how does he take five and say it\u2019s better than 10?KELLY: Go ahead, Senator.TRUMP: I am by far the leader. But if you listen to a politician, he\u2019ll try and convince you otherwise.KELLY: Senator Cruz, go.CRUZ: All right, well, Donald lives by the polls every day. He tweets about the polls.TRUMP: No, I don\u2019t. No, I don\u2019t.CRUZ: He\u2019s told us to look to the CNN poll. Well, that\u2019s a very good poll to look to, because that CNN poll showed that head to head Donald Trump loses to Hillary Clinton by 8 points. He doesn\u2019t just lose close; he loses by 8 points. That same poll he told you to look at shows me beating Hillary Clinton.(APPLAUSE)We cannot mess this up. And, by the way, the last four polls in a row, when you nominate a candidate who literally has been on every side of every issue, and in the course of this debate may be on two other sides before we\u2019re done, that\u2019s not how you win. And the stakes are too high. (CROSSTALK)KELLY: All right. I\u2019m going to let Mr. Trump \u2014 I\u2019m going to let \u2014 let me just...TRUMP: According to your poll...(CROSSTALK)KELLY: I\u2019m going to let you respond to that, Mr. Trump. I\u2019m going to then go to you, Governor. You\u2019re up next.TRUMP: ... I know, but your recent polls have me beating Hillary Clinton, and very, very easily.KELLY: OK. Do you want to weigh in?KASICH: All right, look, honestly, when I see people at these meetings, these town halls, where we take massive questions, and I get to spend time with them. Last night, there was a woman that came to tell me about the loss of her 15-year-old son, who took his own life.See, there\u2019s people in this country \u2014 and Ted\u2019s right \u2014 their wages haven\u2019t gone up for so long, they see the rich get richer, they believe, and they\u2019re not moving. And they put their money in the bank, and they got no interest on their money. They receive none. And their sons or daughters are living in the basement because they can\u2019t get a good job after they rang up so much college debt.What people are hungry for is, who can fix this? People want to know who \u2014 what can you do to solve the problems in Washington, to make sure that we have stronger job growth and better wages? But you know what else they\u2019re yearning for? They want to believe that they have the power to fix things where they live, and they want the power back, so they can begin to do things in their community.Now, listen, this has been going on for a long time here. And I appreciate the discussion back and forth. But there are a lot of people out there yearning for somebody who\u2019s going to bring America back, both at the leadership level and in the neighborhood, where we can begin to reignite the spirit of the United States of America. And let\u2019s stop fighting.(APPLAUSE)KELLY: Governor, thank you. Gentlemen, thank you.WALLACE: Much more to come live from the Fox Theater, including where the candidates stand on the social issues facing the country. The Republican presidential debate continues in a moment.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)KELLY: Welcome back, everybody, to the Fox News Republican presidential debate. We want to get right back to the questions.(APPLAUSE)BAIER: We are here in Detroit. The top issues in Michigan, according to Facebook, are displayed in a word cloud you\u2019re taking a look at. The second biggest issue is clean water. That, of course, is directly tied with the situation in Flint.Senator Rubio, Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton have both been to Flint. They are both running ads in this state focusing on that, focusing on supporting Flint and fixing the problems, showing images of people in Flint thankful that they\u2019re there.Without getting into the political blame game here, where are the national Republicans\u2019 plans on infrastructure and solving problems like this? If you talk to people in this state, they are really concerned about Flint on both sides of the aisle. So why haven\u2019t GOP candidates done more or talked more about this?RUBIO: Well, I know I\u2019ve talked about it, and others in our campaign have talked about it, and other candidates have talked about it, as well. What happened in Flint was a terrible thing. It was systemic breakdown at every level of government, at both the federal and partially the \u2014 both the state and partially at the federal level, as well.And by the way, the politicizing of it I think is unfair, because I don\u2019t think that someone woke up one morning and said, \u201cLet\u2019s figure out how to poison the water system to hurt someone.\u201d(APPLAUSE)But accountability is important. I will say, I give the governor credit. He took responsibility for what happened. And he\u2019s talked about people being held accountable...(APPLAUSE)... and the need for change, with Governor Snyder. But here\u2019s the point. This should not be a partisan issue. The way the Democrats have tried to turn this into a partisan issue, that somehow Republicans woke up in the morning and decided, \u201cOh, it\u2019s a good idea to poison some kids with lead.\u201d It\u2019s absurd. It\u2019s outrageous. It isn\u2019t true.(APPLAUSE)All of us are outraged by what happened. And we should work together to solve it. And there is a proper role for the government to play at the federal level, in helping local communities to respond to a catastrophe of this kind, not just to deal with the people that have been impacted by it, but to ensure that something like this never happens again.BAIER: Thank you, Senator.(APPLAUSE)KELLY: Governor Kasich, the city of Detroit has long suffered with urban blight, broken street lights, dilapidated and vacant houses, and so on. In 2013, Detroit actually declared bankruptcy, which helped, but the schools here remain a big problem. They\u2019re $3.5 billion in debt and are some of the most troubled and poorly testing in the country. The kids too often go to classrooms that are unsafe, falling apart, infested with rodents and insects. Experts say the schools could go bankrupt by next month.Question to you. If the federal government bailed out the auto industry here in Detroit, should it also bail out the Detroit schools?KASICH: Well, look, first of all, I think the mayor now is controlling the schools. This is not much different than what happened in Cleveland, Ohio, where the African-American Democrat mayor, the union, and business leaders came to see me and said, \u201cWould you help us to pass legislation to really create a CEO environment so that we can take control of the schools?\u201dWe even invested in a buyout plan, where we bought out the teachers who had been there a long time, because there were so many young teachers who had been laid off who were so enthusiastic to get back in the schools. It worked beautifully. Cleveland\u2019s coming back. The Cleveland schools are coming back because of a major overhaul.It\u2019s the same thing that has to happen in all of our urban schools. And, frankly, look, if I were president, I\u2019d take 104 federal programs, bundle them into four buckets, and send it to the states, because fixing schools rests at the state and the local level, and particularly at the school board level. (APPLAUSE)KASICH: Now, I also believe \u2014 I also believe that you need to introduce vocational education in those schools. You need mentoring in those schools. And you need to have a situation where people can have an alternative forum to get a degree. And you need school choice, both vouchers and charter schools. All of those things can come together to help, Megyn.But here\u2019s the bottom line. And I\u2019ll go quickly. We as adults have to fight in our neighborhoods, in our communities, for our children\u2019s education. Put the politics aside, and everyone in this room can play a role in lifting their schools and lifting the students who are in those schools, because too much politics gets in the middle of it, and where we focus as adults, and put children first, we see tremendous results. And the people of this town are going to rise. And they need to be involved. Thank you.(APPLAUSE)WALLACE: For \u2014 for half a century, as you all know, Detroit was the symbol of America\u2019s industrial might: 300,000 manufacturing jobs in this city. At last count, there are now fewer than 30,000 manufacturing jobs here, and the unemployment rate in this city is 11 percent, twice the national average.Senator Cruz, I know that you have general plans for tax reform, but what specifically would you do to bring manufacturing jobs back to America and train residents of cities like Detroit to do those jobs?CRUZ: Well, Chris, thank you for that question. Let me start by observing that Detroit is a great city with a magnificent legacy that has been utterly decimated by 60 years of failed left-wing policy.(APPLAUSE)You know, Henry Ford revolutionized automobile manufacturing and brought automobiles to the middle class. During World War II, Detroit provided \u2014 funded the arsenals of democracy to help us win World War II. In \u2014 in the 1960s, Detroit was the Silicon Valley of America. It had a population of 2 million people, had the highest per capita income in the country.And then, for 50 years, left-wing Democrats have pursued destructive tax policies, weak crime policies, and have driven the citizens out. (APPLAUSE)This city now has just 700,000 citizens. There are vacant homes, one after the other after the other. Crime has been rampant, and it is an outrage. And let me say to folks in the media: That is a story that the media ought to be telling over and over again, the destruction of left-wing policies and the millions who have hurt because of it.(APPLAUSE)WALLACE: Well, I was going to say, I\u2019ll give you 30 seconds to try to answer my question. What specifically would you do to bring manufacturing jobs back to Detroit and to train the residents here to do those jobs?CRUZ: The way you bring manufacturing back to America is, number one, you lift the regulations. As president, I will repeal Obamacare, the biggest job-killer in America.I will pull back the federal regulators, the EPA and all the regulators that are killing small businesses and manufacturing.What that will do, Chris, is bring millions of manufacturing jobs back to this country, bring the steel industry back to this country, create an environment where when we compete on a fair and level playing field, American ingenuity can beat anyone. But right now, the federal government isn\u2019t giving us a level playing field.WALLACE: Thank you, Senator.(APPLAUSE)BAIER: Gentlemen, the next series of questions will be on social issues. Governor Kasich, the last debate, you were asked a question about religious liberty, in a hypothetical situation where a same-sex couple approaches a cupcake maker to do their wedding. Here\u2019s what you said.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)KASICH: If you\u2019re in the business of selling things, if you\u2019re not going to sell to somebody you don\u2019t agree with, today I\u2019m not going to sell to somebody who\u2019s gay, then tomorrow maybe I won\u2019t sell to somebody who\u2019s divorced.(END VIDEO CLIP)BAIER: Governor, some faith leaders got nervous about that answer. Do gay marriage dissenters have rights?KASICH: Well, look, first of all, I try to be a man of faith every day as best as I can, and I try to focus in my faith on the dos and I think the don\u2019ts will take care of themselves once I get the dos right, which is humility, and loving my enemy, and caring for my neighbor.But secondly, look, you\u2019re in the commerce business, you want to sell somebody a cupcake, great. OK? But now if they ask you to participate in something you really don\u2019t like, that\u2019s a whole \u2018nother issue, OK? Another issue.Here\u2019s what I\u2019d like to see happen. The Supreme Court ruled, I don\u2019t agree with the ruling. I\u2019m of favor of marriage between \u2014 you know, traditional marriage, a man and a woman. What I hope was going to happen after the Supreme Court ruling is things would settle down.If you go to a photographer to take pictures at your wedding, and he says, I\u2019d rather not do it, find another photographer, don\u2019t sue them in court. You know what, the problem is in our country \u2014 in our country, we need to learn to respect each other and be a little bit more tolerant for one another.And at the end of the day, don\u2019t go to court. Can\u2019t we have common sense in America? That\u2019s the way it used to be. And there was a book written called \u201cThe Death of Common Sense.\u201d We need to bring it back.But at the end of the day, if somebody is being pressured to participate in something that is against their deeply-held religious beliefs, then we\u2019re going to have to think about dealing with the law.But you know what, I\u2019d rather people figure this out without having to put another law on the books and have more arguments in this country. Why don\u2019t we come together as a country, respect one another, love one another and lift this country? I think that\u2019s what people want.So thanks for asking.BAIER: Senator Cruz, the U.S. Supreme Court obviously declared same-sex marriage legal in all 50 states, a decision you have criticized. Given the current status of the law, do you believe a gay couple should be able to adopt?CRUZ: Well, listen, adoption is decided at the state level and I am a believer in the 10th Amendment in the Constitution, I would leave the question of marriage to the states, I would leave the question of adoption to the states.That\u2019s the way it has been for two centuries of our nation\u2019s history until five unelected judges in an illegitimate and wrong decision decided to seize the authority over marriage and wrongfully tear down the marriage laws of all 50 states.Now, interconnected to this is the question of religious liberty. And at the last debate, one of my colleagues on this stage said on the question of religious liberty and Supreme Court nominees that he\u2019d be willing to compromise and negotiate.I can tell you, for me, there are areas that we should compromise on. Marginal tax rates, we can reach a middle ground on. But when it comes to core principles and convictions, when it comes to the Constitution and Bill of Rights, I can tell the men and women at home I will never compromise away your religious liberty.And for me, Bret, religious liberty has been a lifelong passion. I\u2019ve spent two decades defending religious liberty, including defending the Ten Commandments before the U.S. Supreme Court and winning. Defending the Pledge of Allegiance before the Supreme Court and winning.And defending the Mojave Desert Veterans Memorial, a lone white Latin cross that was erected to honor the men and women who gave their lives in World War I. I represented 3 million veterans for free defending that memorial and we won 5-4 before the Supreme Court.BAIER: Senator, thank you.Senator Cruz definitely avoided saying your name, Mr. Trump, but I think he was referring to you and your religious liberty answer. Would you like to respond?TRUMP: I have nothing to say. I mean, generally speaking, agree with what he said. I would have certainly have rather left it to the states. I was always in favor \u2014 I was very surprised when they came up with that decision.I would have certainly \u2014 I would have preferred had it been left to the states and I think most people would have preferred that.BAIER: Senator Rubio, the late Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia, a conservative icon, obviously, pointed out, in the United States versus Heller, that like most rights, the Second Amendment right is not unlimited.Just like the First Amendment doesn\u2019t allow you to go into a theater and yell fire, he said the Second Amendment leaves room to regulate guns. So do you agree with Justice Scalia? And if so, what limits would you draw around the Second Amendment?RUBIO: As few as possible. The Second Amendment, as I\u2019ve said before, is not a suggestion. It is the constitutional right of every American to protect themselves and their families. It is a right that \u2014 it is the Second Amendment for a reason.It is right after the defense of the freedom of speech for a reason, for clearly the founders of our nation understood and the framers of the Constitution understood that you cannot have life and you cannot have liberty and cannot pursue happiness if you are not safe.RUBIO: And the Second Amendment \u2014 when people talk about gun laws, what they need to realize is, criminals don\u2019t follow gun laws. They\u2019re criminals. By definition, they ignore the law.(APPLAUSE)But the gun rights of Americans, if you are talking to a law- abiding citizen and a gun-owner like myself, if you pass a law, I will follow whatever the law is. A criminal will not do it. They will continue to pursue these guns on the black market, where they then go out and commit crimes and they steal guns from each other.Gun laws are not effective. They simply do not provide for safety. But they do, however, ensure that law-abiding people don\u2019t have access to weapons to protect themselves and guns to protect themselves, but criminals always will be well armed. They don\u2019t care about the law; they don\u2019t follow the law. We will protect the Second Amendment when I\u2019m president of the United States.(APPLAUSE)BAIER: Mr. Trump, you were once a supporter of an assault weapons ban. So do you think there should be any restrictions on the Second Amendment?TRUMP: No, I\u2019m a big defender of the Second Amendment. And if you look at what\u2019s happened, whether it\u2019s in California, where you had the 14 people killed, whether it\u2019s in Paris \u2014 which, by the way, has the toughest gun laws in the world and 130 people killed. Many, many people in the hospital gravely injured. They will be dying. Many people will be dying in addition.If we had guns, or if they had guns on the other side of the room, with the bullets going in the opposite direction, you would not have had 130 people killed. That I can tell you right now.(APPLAUSE)So I\u2019m a very, very big supporter of the Second Amendment.BAIER: But in 2000, you wrote in your book, \u201cI generally oppose gun control, but I support the ban on assault weapons.\u201dTRUMP: I don\u2019t support it anymore. I do not support the ban on assault.(AUDIENCE BOOS)BAIER: Senator Cruz? Any limits to the Second Amendment?CRUZ: Well, listen, unlike Donald, I would not support banning firearms. In that instance, Bill Clinton banned many of the most popular firearms in America. And by the way, the study showed that ban did nothing to reduce violent crime. It just took away the Second Amendment rights of law-abiding citizens.(APPLAUSE)And let me point out, you know, it is easy for political candidates to have rhetoric and say, \u201cI support the Second Amendment.\u201d But you cannot say that and at the same time say what Donald just said, which is that on the question of Supreme Court nominees he wants to compromise and reach a middle ground with Harry Reid and Chuck Schumer. That\u2019s what he said in the last debate.TRUMP: I \u2014 I did not say that. I did not say that.CRUZ: And any justice that Harry Reid and Chuck Schumer sign off on...TRUMP: I did not say that.CRUZ: And I would point out, Harry Reid and Chuck Schumer are both Democrats that Mr. Trump has written checks to repeatedly. Any justice that those two sign off on is going to be a left-wing judicial activist who will undermine religious liberty, and we are one vote away from the Heller decision being overturned, which would effectively erase the Second Amendment from the Bill of Rights.If you care about the Second Amendment, then you need to ask who on this stage do you know will appoint principled constitutionalists to the court and not cut a deal with your Second Amendment rights?BAIER: Mr. Trump...TRUMP: So we\u2019re listening to the all-talk, no-action politician, and he was the primary supporter of John Roberts, who gave us Obamacare.CRUZ: That\u2019s flat-out wrong.TRUMP: No, it\u2019s not. You take a look. He was the primary supporter. He pushed John Roberts, and pushed him, and pushed him, and Bush ultimately appointed him. He got appointed. And when it came his time to raise his hand and kill Obamacare, not once, but twice, he let us down, and he did the wrong thing.This is the man that was the primary supporter. And you can read law journal, you can read whatever you want to read \u2014 I\u2019ve read plenty of it. There was no stronger supporter of John Roberts than him. And it was a very, very big mistake.BAIER: Quickly, Senator Cruz. CRUZ: You know, Donald has a tenuous relationship with the truth.(LAUGHTER)I wrote one op-ed supporting President Bush\u2019s nomination after he made it. I would not have made that nomination. But let me point out...TRUMP: Not what you say in the op-ed.CRUZ: ... if Donald actually cared about...TRUMP: That is not what you said in the op-ed.CRUZ: But, Donald, please, I know it\u2019s hard not to interrupt. But try.TRUMP: Yeah, I know it is. But it\u2019s not what you said in the op-ed.CRUZ: Breathe, breathe, breathe.TRUMP: Lyin\u2019 Ted.CRUZ: You can do it. You can breathe. I know it\u2019s hard. I know it\u2019s hard. But just...RUBIO: When they\u2019re done with the yoga, can I answer a question?CRUZ: You cannot.(LAUGHTER)RUBIO: Unbelievable.CRUZ: I really hope that we don\u2019t \u2014 we don\u2019t see yoga on this stage.RUBIO: Well, he\u2019s very flexible, so you never know.(APPLAUSE)CRUZ: But you cannot, in fact, care about conservative Supreme Court justices and support Jimmy Carter for president. You cannot care about conservative Supreme Court justices and support John Kerry for president, as Donald did. You cannot care about conservative Supreme Court justices and support Harry Reid for Senate majority leader.And you cannot care about conservative Supreme Court justices and write four checks to Hillary Clinton for her to be president if you care at all about the Second Amendment or religious liberty or anything else.BAIER: Gentlemen, gentlemen, we\u2019re going to move on. Thank you very much. We want to talk about some more policy questions coming up.WALLACE: And coming up, the candidates tackle foreign policy. But first, during the commercial break, join us for a Facebook live on the Fox News Facebook page and tell us what you think about tonight\u2019s debate in the comments section. Stay with us. More to come. (COMMERCIAL BREAK)KELLY: Welcome back, everybody. We\u2019re going it get right back to the questions.WALLACE: And gentlemen, we\u2019re going to focus for a bit now on foreign policy.Senator Rubio, you like to take a shot at Mr. Trump on the campaign trail saying that negotiating a hotel deal in a foreign country is not foreign policy. The other day you even compared him to Kim Jong-un, the North Korean leader, as lunatics trying to get a hold of nuclear weapons.Please tell Mr. Trump why he\u2019s unprepared to be commander-in- chief.RUBIO: Well, first of all, I think, as we\u2019ve seen throughout this campaign, Donald has not shown a seriousness about the issues of foreign policy. He just simply hasn\u2019t.Whether it was the structure of our military, even today he was asked a question about the issue of commanders not following his lead on killing the family of terrorists. And his answer basically was, if I tell them to do it, they\u2019re going to do it. Now that\u2019s just not true.Foreign policy is not only consequential, I think much of our future now depends on it. You know, I see a lot of young people at my events around the country. I feel great when they come.And I always them that despite the hardships of the moment, I honestly believe that today\u2019s Millennials have a chance to be the greatest generation we\u2019ve had in 100 years. I really do.Because the world today has hundreds of millions of people that can afford to be their clients, their customers, their partners, people they collaborate with. But that won\u2019t happen if the world is dangerous and it\u2019s unstable.And that will require strong American leadership. The next president of the United States is going to have eight years of a mess of a foreign policy to clean up. That\u2019s why it can\u2019t be Hillary Clinton.And quite frankly, that\u2019s why it can\u2019t be someone who simply has not shown the intellectual curiosity or the interest in learning about these very complicated issues. And Donald simply hasn\u2019t.WALLACE: Mr. Trump, your response.TRUMP: Well, let me just say this. I\u2019ve gotten to know Marco over a period of time, believe me, he is not a leader. Believe me.RUBIO: But that doesn\u2019t answer the question. (CROSSTALK)WALLACE: He didn\u2019t interrupt you. Let him talk.TRUMP: He didn\u2019t answer \u2014 he\u2019s not a leader. And, frankly, when I say they\u2019ll do as I tell them, they\u2019ll do as I tell them. And that\u2019s very \u2014 it\u2019s very simple. It\u2019s very simple.We are in a very dangerous place. We have a depleted military. Totally depleted. We have \u2014 by the way, our vets are treated horribly. We\u2019re going to take care of our vets. We\u2019re going to start taking care of our vets, properly, like we should.(APPLAUSE)But we\u2019re going to build up our military, and we\u2019re going to get the equipment we want, not the equipment that\u2019s sold to us by somebody that gave him and him and not the governor campaign contributions. OK? We\u2019re going to get the equipment that the generals and the soldiers want.I will prove to be a great leader. And, you know, it\u2019s very interesting, we talk about the polls. Every single poll when it comes to ISIS and the military and the border say, by far, Trump is the best.WALLACE: Mr. Trump, your time is up.RUBIO: Yeah, I just want to \u2014 a couple points. Once again, he was pressed on a policy issue to show his understanding of the foreign policy, and his reaction was just to attack somebody else with a name.Here\u2019s the bottom line. And I\u2019m going to repeat it again. The world today is as complicated and as complex as it has been certainly in a very \u2014 certainly in the lifetime of anybody here today. You indeed do have a lunatic in North Korea with nuclear weapons. You indeed do have the Chinese government taking over the most important shipping lane in the world. And Vladimir Putin, who you\u2019ve expressed admiration for, Donald...TRUMP: Wrong. Wrong.RUBIO: You\u2019ve expressed admiration for him.TRUMP: Wrong.(CROSSTALK)RUBIO: Donald, you said he\u2019s a strong leader.TRUMP: Wrong.RUBIO: He is now dividing Europe up...TRUMP: He said very good things about me, and I said...(CROSSTALK)RUBIO: All right, I\u2019m going to finish my statement here.TRUMP: Yeah, finish.RUBIO: And he\u2019s also sowing instability in the Middle East. You have Iran who\u2019s going to get $100 billion of sanctions relief. You have radical jihadists spreading all over the world. This is a time for seriousness on these issues. You have yet to answer a single serious question about any of this. Will you give us a detailed answer about foreign policy any time you\u2019re asked on it?TRUMP: Let me just tell you, first of all, I\u2019ve been hearing this man so long talking about Putin. Putin said about me \u2014 I didn\u2019t say about Putin \u2014 Putin said very nice things about me. And I say very nicely, wouldn\u2019t it be nice if actually we could get along with Russia, we could get along with foreign countries, instead of spending trillions and trillions of dollars?You\u2019re talking about Flint, Michigan. You\u2019re talking about places \u2014 we need to rebuild the infrastructure of our country. Wouldn\u2019t it be nice if we got along with the world, and maybe Russia could help us in our quest to get rid of ISIS, et cetera, et cetera?(CROSSTALK)WALLACE: Gentlemen, you both have had a chance to talk. You both have had a chance to talk a couple of times. I\u2019d like to move on to Senator Cruz. Senator, we have some breaking news tonight. North Korea\u2019s dictator, Kim Jong-un, has ordered that country\u2019s nuclear weapons to be made ready at a moment\u2019s notice.CRUZ: Yes. Yes.WALLACE: And this comes just hours after the U.N. Security Council announced that \u2014 approved the toughest sanctions in two decades against that country. Assume you\u2019re President Cruz tonight. What do you do?CRUZ: Well, you\u2019re right, the news is very disturbing that Kim Jong-un has put their nuclear weapons on ready state. I\u2019m glad that we\u2019re sending another carrier group to the South China Sea. I\u2019m glad that Congress passed sanctions on North Korea.But this is all the result of the failures of the Clinton administration two decades ago that negotiated a deal with North Korea lifting the sanctions, allowing billions of dollars to flow in, and they used that money to develop nuclear weapons in the first place.What we \u2014 now we\u2019re in a much harder position. When you have a lunatic with nuclear weapons, to some extent, it constrains your options. We need to be moving the carrier \u2014 carrier group to the South China Seas. We \u2014 we need to be putting in place missile defense, such as the THAAD missile defense system in South Korea.We need to be pursuing space-based missile defense. One of the advantages of space-based missile defense is that if you have a missile launch in North Korea or you have a missile launch in Iran, a space-based missile defense can take out one or two or three missiles before it can cross over and do damage.And we also need to be putting pressure on China, because North Korea is effectively a \u2014 a client state of China. All of that will happen with a strong commander-in-chief that is devoted to keeping this country safe.WALLACE: Thank you, Senator.Governor Kasich, I want to move back to the debate that we heard earlier about Vladimir Putin. In December, after Vladimir Putin had some nice thing to say about Donald Trump, calling him bright and talented, your campaign ran a video suggesting that Trump might name the Russian president as his running mate. Here\u2019s a clip.KASICH: I\u2019ll have to see this.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)(UNKNOWN): If elected, Trump promised that the dictatorial duo would, quote, \u201cmake tyranny great again.\u201dTRUMP: I think I\u2019d get along very well with Vladimir Putin. I just think so.(END VIDEO CLIP)(LAUGHTER)WALLACE: That was your campaign video, sir.KASICH: That was a pretty good one.WALLACE: Well, OK.KASICH: No, I...(CROSSTALK)WALLACE: If I may \u2014 sir, if I may ask my question...KASICH: Of course.WALLACE: I think you were kidding...WALLACE: But it was your video and the serious question is, because the suggestion is, do you think that Donald Trump is naive about the threat that Vladimir Putin represents?KASICH: I\u2019m not biting. Let me take you around the world, OK? Let me \u2014 look, I\u2019m going to take you very quickly.In Russia, we need to tell them we\u2019re going to arm the Ukrainians with defensive lethal weapons. And we\u2019re going to tell Putin if you attack anybody in Eastern Europe in NATO, you attack Finland and Sweden, which is not in NATO, consider it an attack on us. And he will understand that.Secondly, I would tell the Chinese you don\u2019t own the South China Sea. Stop hacking us. And we\u2019re going to beef up our cyber command. And we\u2019re going to be in a position to be able to take out your systems if you continue to do this.Now let\u2019s move over into the Middle East. The Egyptians, they know they\u2019re on their last legs there because of the attack from ISIS. The Jordanians are \u2014 really have been our friends. They know that they are at risk. So do the Saudis. So do the Gulf states.They are our allies, really, or have similar aims, we need to bring them closer to us. Turkey a critical avenue to the Middle East. We have to bring them towards the West, and not towards the East.WALLACE: Governor...KASICH: And we have a joint, good human intelligence. That is called a semi-trip around the world. And if you gave me more time, I\u2019d finish the trip.WALLACE: Governor, thank you.KASICH: Thank you.BAIER: Coming up, a final question and closing statements. And take a look at this. The volume of conversation on Facebook surrounding the remaining candidates over the last month. Whether that conversation is good or bad, Donald Trump clearly dominates the field.We\u2019ll be back with more of the Republican presidential debate live from Detroit. (COMMERCIAL BREAK)BAIER: Welcome back to the Republican presidential debate. Let\u2019s get back at it.Gentlemen, this is the last question of the night. It has been a long time since our first debate, seven months ago in Cleveland. A lot has transpired since then, obviously, including an RNC pledge that all of you signed agreeing to support the party\u2019s nominee and not to launch an independent run. Tonight, in 30 seconds, can you definitively say you will support the Republican nominee, even if that nominee is Donald J. Trump?Senator Rubio, yes or no?RUBIO: I\u2019ll support the Republican nominee.BAIER: Mr. Trump? Yes or no?RUBIO: I\u2019ll support Donald if he\u2019s the Republican nominee, and let me tell you why. Because the Democrats have two people left in the race. One of them is a socialist. America doesn\u2019t want to be a socialist country. If you want to be a socialist country, then move to a socialist country.The other one is under FBI investigation. And not only is she under FBI investigation, she lied to the families of the victims of Benghazi, and anyone who lies to the families of victims who lost their lives in the service of our country can never be the commander- in-chief of the United States.BAIER: Senator...RUBIO: We must defeat Hillary Clinton.BAIER: Senator Cruz, yes or no, you will support Donald Trump is he\u2019s the nominee?CRUZ: Yes, because I gave my word that I would. And what I have endeavored to do every day in the Senate is do what I said I would do. You know, just on Tuesday, we saw an overwhelming victory in the state of Texas where I won Texas by 17 percent.And I will say it was a powerful affirmation that the people who know me best, the people who I campaigned, who made promises that if you elect me, I\u2019ll lead the fight against Obamacare, I\u2019ll lead the fight against amnesty, I\u2019ll lead the fight against our debt, and I will fight for the Bill of Rights and your rights every day, that the people of Texas said you have kept your word, and that\u2019s what I\u2019ll do as president.BAIER: Governor Kasich, yes or no, would you support Donald Trump as the Republican nominee?KASICH: Yeah. But \u2014 and I kind of think that, before it\u2019s all said and done, I\u2019ll be the nominee. But let me also say...(APPLAUSE)But let me also say, remember...BAIER: But your answer is yes?KASICH: But I\u2019m the little engine that can. And, yeah, look, when you\u2019re in the arena, and we\u2019re in the arena. And the people out here watching \u2014 we\u2019re in the arena, we\u2019re traveling, we\u2019re working, we spend time away from our family, when you\u2019re in the arena, you enter a special circle. And you want to respect the people that you\u2019re in the arena with. So if he ends up as the nominee \u2014 sometimes, he makes it a little bit hard \u2014 but, you know, I will support whoever is the Republican nominee for president.(APPLAUSE)WALLACE: Mr. Trump, I\u2019m going to ask you a version of the same question. As we saw today with Mitt Romney, the #NeverTrump movement is gaining steam. Some people are talking about contributing millions of dollars to try to stop you. Again today, you raised the possibility that you might run as an independent if you feel you\u2019re treated unfairly by the Republican Party.So I\u2019m going to phrase the question that the other three people on this stage just got. Can you definitively say tonight that you will definitely support the Republican nominee for president, even if it\u2019s not you?TRUMP: Even if it\u2019s not me?(LAUGHTER)Let me just start off by saying...WALLACE: Thirty seconds, sir.TRUMP: ... OK \u2014 that I\u2019m very, very proud of \u2014 millions and millions of people have come to the Republican Party over the last little while. They\u2019ve come to the Republican Party. And by the way, the Democrats are losing people. This is a trend that\u2019s taking place. It\u2019s the biggest thing happening in politics, and I\u2019m very proud to be a part of it. And I\u2019m going to give them some credit, too, even though they don\u2019t deserve it. But the answer is: Yes, I will.WALLACE: Yes, you will support the nominee of the party? TRUMP: Yes, I will. Yes. I will.KELLY: Candidates, it\u2019s now time for your closing statements. Governor Kasich, we\u2019ll start with you.KASICH: Well, ladies and gentlemen, I love being here in Michigan, and I want to say to all of you here that I have a record of being able to solve some of the biggest problems. It\u2019s not just talk, and it\u2019s not theory.I did it in Washington by helping people get into a healthier economic situation. I\u2019ve done it in Ohio. And as we\u2019ve made progress in Ohio, we\u2019ve left no one behind. We\u2019ve not left behind the mentally ill, the drug addicted, the working poor, the developmental disabled, and we have raised our minority community.And as president of the United States, I will go back to Washington, I will take the formulas that I used, and I will \u2014 I will fix the problems in Washington, and you\u2019ll work with me as I send you power to fix your \u2014 your communities, your neighborhoods, your state, and together, we\u2019ll restore the spirit of America. And I know you want that. Thank you.(APPLAUSE)WALLACE: Senator Rubio, 30 seconds, closing statement.RUBIO: Well, I know this has been an unusual election cycle, as it continues, and there\u2019s a lot of problems in America, and people are truly hurting. But this election is not just about confronting our problems; it\u2019s also about embracing our opportunities.(APPLAUSE)BAIER: Senator Cruz, your closing statement?CRUZ: I want to talk to every soldier and sailor and airman and Marine. I want to talk to every mom and dad and sister and brother and son and daughter of someone fighting for this country. For seven years, you\u2019ve had a commander-in-chief that doesn\u2019t believe in you, that sends you into combat with rules of engagement that tie your arms behind your back. That is wrong. It is immoral. And in January 2017, it will end.I want to also talk to all the police officers and firefighters and first responders who have been left behind with this president. Starting in January 2017, I will have your back.(APPLAUSE)KELLY: Mr. Trump, your closing statement.TRUMP: Thank you. I am going to bring jobs back to the United States like nobody else can. We\u2019re going to fix our very depleted military. We\u2019re going to take care of our vets. We\u2019re going to strengthen our borders. And you\u2019re going to be very, very proud of this country in just a few years if I\u2019m elected president. Thank you.KELLY: Thank you, sir.And that will do it for the 11th Republican primary debate of the 2016 presidential race. But the night is not over yet.WALLACE: Not by a long shot. A special edition of \u201cThe O\u2019Reilly Factor\u201d is next. And remember, Fox News has the race for the White House covered, all the way to the conventions and onto the general election.BAIER: Our thanks to Detroit and the crowd here. Thank you again for joining us. Have a great evening.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "In Late Antiquity Textiles, a Long-Lasting Fashion Show", "Date": "2016-03-14", "News": "Supported byA tapestry weave of dyed wools and undyed linen from Egypt, ca. 6th-8th century A.D.Archaeology is about more than rock-hard ruins of palaces and temples, royal mummies in remote tombs and obscure writing on clay tablets. Less durable remains, like fabrics of garments and home decorations that somehow survive time\u2019s decay, can also be telling artifacts of early cultures.One of their messages, it seems, is that dressing for success and putting on the Ritz are hardly new in the human experience.In time, an expanding Arab culture introduced Islam across the Middle East.In recent studies, art historians and other researchers have recognized more clearly elements of continuity and only gradual change in how the wealthy elite in these lands, and their wannabes, used dress to define and celebrate their place in society.The exhibit, Dr. Chi said, shows \u201chow textiles were carefully created to convey specific images of self, society and culture, and offer glimpses of both the activities of daily life and the practice of religious rituals.\u201dBeginning in the late 19th century, a bounty of textile artifacts came to light in archaeological excavations far from Rome, often in Egyptian cemeteries from Roman times. Many people recycled their best tunics, ones with patterns like bird-and-vine lattice motifs or more artistic embellishments, as their burial shrouds. The arid desert climate was kind to the textiles through the centuries.The exhibition\u2019s bias toward textiles of the upper classes was perhaps unavoidable. Such well-preserved specimens understandably caught the eye of archaeologists, who found them irresistible. Many were shipped back to their institutions in the United States more than a century ago.Other collections were eventually donated to museums, but often languished in back-room obscurity until they were dusted off and lent to the N.Y.U. institute for the Designing Identity exhibition. They have now undergone a reappraisal of the role of clothing and home furnishings in Late Antiquity.The most popular motifs on garments, Dr. Chi said, related to \u201cprosperity and well-being\u201d or appeared to be charms intended to invoke good fortune or ward off evil.Before the Industrial Revolution, textile production was especially difficult. The many decorative embellishments on dyed wool fabrics and undyed linen made these products even more out of reach to ordinary people. Only emperors or the superrich could afford tunics and mantles decorated with patterns colored with purple dye made from the glandular fluids of Murex sea snails in the eastern Mediterranean.Dr. Thomas, writing in the exhibition catalog, said these high costs meant that lavish textiles came to signify wealth and prestige. Their production and acquisition, she added, \u201cwere key aspects of household economies, in the sphere of women.\u201d Spindles, looms and other textile-working instruments are often found in domestic contexts at the region\u2019s archaeological sites.Tunics appeared to be in fashion throughout Late Antiquity. They were often single pieces of fabric draped over the body, usually loosely and sometimes more form-fitting. For women they reached to the feet, for men to the knees.Even children wore tunics. On exhibit is a garment with an ornamented hood to be pulled over a child\u2019s head. The first hoodie?Some experts were not sure what to make of one wall tapestry. It depicts a servant waiting for a command. Was this a tribute to the faithful household staff? Or a reminder to be more dutiful in their service?Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Corned Beef and Cabbage for St. Patrick\u2019s Day? Not So Irish, Historians Say", "Date": "2016-03-17", "News": "Supported byMany staples of St. Patrick\u2019s Day in the United States have little or nothing to do with Ireland, such as green beer and green bagels. But some Irish Americans might be surprised by another entry on that list of suspect foods: corned beef and cabbage.Experts say the meal originated on American soil in the late 19th century as Irish immigrants substituted corned beef for bacon, which was meat of choice in the homeland.\u201cWhen they came here they found bacon was expensive,\u201d said Niall O\u2019Dowd, the publisher of Irish America magazine and The Irish Voice, an Irish newspaper in New York.\u201cThe theory I\u2019ve always heard is when the immigrants came to New York City it was actually Jewish brisket that they ate because it was cheaper than beef,\u201d he said.Jay P. Dolan, the author of \u201cThe Irish Americans: A History,\u201d said corned beef and cabbage is a relatively uncommon dish back in the old country.\u201cI never saw corned beef on the menu,\u201d said Mr. Dolan, who is American-born but lived in Ireland for a time. \u201cIf you ordered it, the waiter would not know what you were talking about.\u201dMr. O\u2019Dowd said the Irish \u201ctake offense at the idea that corned beef is the same as what they had in the old days back in Ireland.\u201dPork products, particularly salted bacon, have historically played a much larger role in Ireland\u2019s economy and gastronomy than beef has, said Marion Casey, a professor of Irish history at N.Y.U.In fact, in the 18th century Ireland exported large quantities of salted meat to North America and other parts of the British Empire, said Kevin O\u2019Neill, a professor of Irish Studies at Boston College. \u201cCabbage, of course, was an Irish mainstay,\u201d he said.But the United States was a different matter. As famine ravaged Ireland in the middle of the 19th century, large numbers of immigrants came to the United States, where prejudice against Irish and other Catholic newcomers was common.When St. Patrick\u2019s Day began to evolve into a commercial American holiday in the early 20th century, retailers and greeting card manufacturers used images of pigs as a visual shorthand for Irishness, Professor Casey said, much to the horror of the Irish themselves.\u201cIrish-Americans vigorously protested such an alignment of their ethnicity with an animal that carried all sorts of popular connotations about dirt and disease,\u201d Professor Casey wrote in a book manuscript based on her dissertation.From there, the shift from salted pork to corned beef, which was popular among working class Americans of all ethnicities in the 19th century, was a natural move, she said. By the 1950s and \u201960s it had become associated with Ireland, appearing in recipe columns and restaurant menus each March.\u201cArguments about authenticity are pointless,\u201d Professor Casey said. St. Patrick\u2019s Day did not become a major commercial holiday in Ireland until the 1980s, she noted, and traditions there developed without the dislocations of immigration and assimilation.\u201cThe Irish in Ireland did not have to protest, as Irish America did, pig jokes in early radio and cinema through the 1940s,\u201d she said. \u201cCorned beef was an all-American dish and, in that respect, it has served Irish America well.\u201dSo is it cultural heresy to eat corned beef and cabbage on St. Patrick\u2019s Day? Not at all, Mr. O\u2019Dowd said.In fact, he said, it is probably harmless if you even have some green beer.Reflecting on some of the more over-the-top aspects of the celebration in the United States, such as the annual green-dying of the Chicago River, he said there is a tendency to romanticize homelands after millions of people move to another country.\u201cIt\u2019s a typical immigrant experience to overemphasize some of the things you want to remember,\u201d he said, \u201cand underemphasize some of the things you want to forget.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trade and Jobs Key to Victory for Bernie Sanders", "Date": "2016-03-09", "News": "Supported byNo Democratic presidential candidate had campaigned in Traverse City, Mich., in decades until Senator Bernie Sanders pulled up to the concert hall near the Sears store on Friday. Some 2,000 people mobbed him when he arrived, roaring in approval as he called the country\u2019s trade policies, and Hillary Clinton\u2019s support for them, \u201cdisastrous.\u201d\u201cIf the people of Michigan want to make a decision about which candidate stood with workers against corporate America and against these disastrous trade agreements, that candidate is Bernie Sanders,\u201d Mr. Sanders said in Traverse City, about 250 miles north of Detroit.For Mrs. Clinton, it was a stinging defeat in a state that she had made a symbol of her campaign, pledging to help the citizens of Flint overcome its contaminated water crisis in a rare display of passion and outrage from a candidate who is often reserved. The results were also a reminder of her weakness among two key voting blocs: working-class white men and independent voters.The setback will almost certainly lead her to sharpen or even rethink her economic message, which does not seem to be reaching voters who feel betrayed by the Democratic Party\u2019s embrace of free trade and left behind by the forces of globalization and deregulation. The first big test will come Wednesday night, when the two candidates debate in Miami, and then in the major industrial states that vote on March 15, including Ohio and Illinois.Despite the loss, Mrs. Clinton still has a large lead among delegates and was likely to pick up more than Mr. Sanders on Tuesday night because of her lopsided win in Mississippi.One ad, according to advisers to Mr. Sanders, was especially effective: It portrayed Mr. Sanders as the only candidate who had consistently opposed the free trade agreements many Michigan voters blame for job losses.Despite Mrs. Clinton\u2019s advantages, including the support of much of the state\u2019s Democratic establishment, the Sanders campaign showed deft organization and strategy: Mr. Sanders crisscrossed the state, speaking to more than 41,000 people, and his campaign opened 13 offices and hired 44 staffers to carry his message. He also visited places that were largely overlooked by the Clinton campaign, including Traverse City and Kalamazoo.Beverly Christensen, a retired pilot, said she had waited in line for a couple of hours to see Mr. Sanders at his rally in Traverse City. She called it \u201chuge\u201d for Mr. Sanders to come to the area, saying she could not recall another presidential contender visiting since the home-state favorite Gerald Ford stopped by.\u201cTo have him show up here \u2014 it was like he was a superstar just coming to our small town,\u201d Ms. Christensen, 68, said in a telephone interview. \u201cWe felt like we were being heard and being listened to, and that was really important.\u201dIn Grand Traverse County, the home of Traverse City, Mr. Sanders won with about 64 percent of the vote. He also performed especially well in counties that are home to major campuses like the University of Michigan, Michigan State University and Western Michigan University.As results flooded in Tuesday night, Mr. Sanders said he had felt the race shifting in his favor in recent days as he talked with auto workers, union leaders and college students, who all seemed eager for a more assertive progressive agenda.\u201cIf you understand that two weeks ago, we were 30 points behind, it is very clear, as I felt, that we have a lot of momentum with us,\u201d Mr. Sanders said in an interview. \u201cMany of the vibes we were getting were very, very positive. I knew, I knew that these polls that had us 20 or 30 points behind were wrong.\u201dBut even Mr. Sanders seemed surprised by the outcome: He had no victory speech prepared, instead holding a seven-minute news conference from Miami as the votes were being counted.While Michigan\u2019s economy has recovered substantially since the economic crisis, its unemployment level has continued to hover above national averages. More problematic, some analysts fear that many have simply stopped looking for work as the state\u2019s labor force has shrunk.Although the auto industry, which fuels the regional economy, has rebounded significantly from the lows of 2008, Detroit only recently emerged from bankruptcy. \u201cHe was strong and forceful on trade, and persuasive with a lot of Michigan Democrats who have seen what\u2019s happened to their economy over the past 20 years,\u201d said Tad Devine, a senior adviser to the Sanders campaign.When Mrs. Clinton accused Mr. Sanders at the debate of opposing the 2009 federal bailout of the auto industry, and then began broadcasting a radio ad about the issue on Monday morning, Sanders advisers scrambled to come up with an ad of their own, explaining that Mr. Sanders had supported the bailout but opposed earlier aid for Wall Street that included some money for car companies.A coalition of Republicans is banking on a scenario in which Donald J. Trump fails to reach the 1,237 delegates required to secure the party\u2019s nomination before its July convention, creating a potential opening for another nominee as the delegates vote on the convention floor.While the Clinton ad was unmatched on the air for several hours, Sanders advisers said, their ad was up on Monday night and covered by the Michigan news media \u2014 enough to halt the effectiveness of the Clinton spot, they argued.Mr. Sanders\u2019s Michigan operation ultimately drew on hundreds of volunteers to make phone calls and help transport voters to the polls on Tuesday, while other aides used a string of short advertisements \u2014 some lasting five seconds or less \u2014 to spread the message about Mr. Sanders on Facebook and Twitter.Mr. Sanders performed particularly well among white voters \u2014 especially white men, but also white women \u2014 and he won independents strongly. He lost to Mrs. Clinton among Democrats and minority voters.Mrs. Clinton\u2019s advisers had been fearing a loss, and the team sent her husband, former President Bill Clinton, and their daughter, Chelsea Clinton, to campaign around the state. Her campaign\u2019s leaders are worried that Mr. Sanders could upend her recent momentum if he parlays his narrow victory in Michigan into wins next Tuesday in Illinois, Missouri and Ohio, where he is focusing his resources.Jennifer Palmieri, a spokeswoman for the Clinton campaign, and other advisers pointed to Mrs. Clinton\u2019s significant lead in delegates and said the team would like to \u201cwrap up\u201d the primary campaign \u201cas soon as possible.\u201d\u201cWe feel confident she is going to be the nominee, but the race will continue to be competitive through next week,\u201d Ms. Palmieri said.Mrs. Clinton is competing hard in Illinois, Missouri and Ohio, as well as in Florida and North Carolina, which also vote Tuesday. Her aides are confident that even if she loses the three Midwestern states to Mr. Sanders, she could still come away with more delegates that night, because her victories in Florida and North Carolina would most likely be bigger than his in the other states.Amy Chozick, Steve Eder and Giovanni Russonello contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Where Computers Defeat Humans, and Where They Can\u2019t", "Date": "2016-03-16", "News": "Supported byOp-Ed ContributorsALPHAGO, the artificial intelligence system built by the Google subsidiary DeepMind, has just defeated the human champion, Lee Se-dol, four games to one in the tournament of the strategy game of Go. Why does this matter? After all, computers surpassed humans in chess in 1997, when IBM\u2019s Deep Blue beat Garry Kasparov. So why is AlphaGo\u2019s victory significant?Like chess, Go is a hugely complex strategy game in which chance and luck play no role. Two players take turns placing white or black stones on a 19-by-19 grid; when stones are surrounded on all four sides by those of the other color they are removed from the board, and the player with more surrounded territory and captured stone at the game\u2019s end wins.Unlike the case with chess, however, no human can explain how to play Go at the highest levels. The top players, it turns out, can\u2019t fully access their own knowledge about how they\u2019re able to perform so well. This self-ignorance is common to many human abilities, from driving a car in traffic to recognizing a face. This strange state of affairs was beautifully summarized by the philosopher and scientist Michael Polanyi, who said, \u201cWe know more than we can tell.\u201d It\u2019s a phenomenon that has come to be known as \u201cPolanyi\u2019s Paradox.\u201dPolanyi\u2019s Paradox hasn\u2019t prevented us from using computers to accomplish complicated tasks, like processing payrolls, optimizing flight schedules, routing telephone calls and calculating taxes. But as anyone who\u2019s written a traditional computer program can tell you, automating these activities has required painstaking precision to explain exactly what the computer is supposed to do.This approach to programming computers is severely limited; it can\u2019t be used in the many domains, like Go, where we know more than we can tell, or other tasks like recognizing common objects in photos, translating between human languages and diagnosing diseases \u2014 all tasks where the rules-based approach to programming has failed badly over the years.Deep Blue achieved its superhuman performance almost by sheer computing power: It sifted through millions of possible chess moves to determine the optimal move. The problem is that there are many more possible Go games than there are atoms in the universe, so even the fastest computers can\u2019t simulate a meaningful fraction of them. To make matters worse, it\u2019s usually far from clear which possible moves to even start exploring.What changed? The AlphaGo victories vividly illustrate the power of a new approach in which instead of trying to program smart strategies into a computer, we instead build systems that can learn winning strategies almost entirely on their own, by seeing examples of successes and failures.Since these systems don\u2019t rely on human knowledge about the task at hand, they\u2019re not limited by the fact that we know more than we can tell.AlphaGo does use simulations and traditional search algorithms to help it decide on some moves, but its real breakthrough is its ability to overcome Polanyi\u2019s Paradox. It did this by figuring out winning strategies for itself, both by example and from experience. The examples came from huge libraries of Go matches between top players amassed over the game\u2019s 2,500-year history. To understand the strategies that led to victory in these games, the system made use of an approach known as deep learning, which has demonstrated remarkable abilities to tease out patterns and understand what\u2019s important in large pools of information.Learning in our brains is a process of forming and strengthening connections among neurons. Deep learning systems take an analogous approach, so much so that they used to be called \u201cneural nets.\u201d They set up billions of nodes and connections in software, use \u201ctraining sets\u201d of examples to strengthen connections among stimuli (a Go game in process) and responses (the next move), then expose the system to a new stimulus and see what its response is. AlphaGo also played millions of games against itself, using another technique called reinforcement learning to remember the moves and strategies that worked well.Deep learning and reinforcement learning have both been around for a while, but until recently it was not at all clear how powerful they were, and how far they could be extended. In fact, it\u2019s still not, but applications are improving at a gallop, with no end in sight. And the applications are broad, including speech recognition, credit card fraud detection, and radiology and pathology. Machines can now recognize faces and drive cars, two of the examples that Polanyi himself noted as areas where we know more than we can tell.We still have a long way to go, but the implications are profound. As when James Watt introduced his steam engine 240 years ago, technology-fueled changes will ripple throughout our economy in the years ahead, but there is no guarantee that everyone will benefit equally. Understanding and addressing the societal challenges brought on by rapid technological progress remain tasks that no machine can do for us.An Op-Ed essay on March 16 about the game-playing computer called AlphaGo mischaracterized the strategy game Go, in which players place colored stones on a grid. Stones are removed from the board when they are surrounded by the other color, and the player with more territory and captured stones wins; the winner is not the player with more captured stones alone. The article also misstated how Deep Blue, a chess-playing computer, learned to make optimal moves. It sifted through millions of possibilities that it created; it was not fed chess games by programmers.Advertisement"}

The reverence or at least quiet sympathy that popular culture extends to the very rich \u2014 factors without which the ascendancy of a gaudy billionaire in a presidential election would not be possible \u2014 may have been harder to make sense of then.Axe (played by Damian Lewis) grew up as a working-class kid and went to Hofstra. When he decides he wants his name on the front of a major Manhattan cultural institution, it is an act of vengeance as much as vanity. Paying off the downwardly mobile aristocrats whose family name is already there, ostensibly in perpetuity, Axe first promises them $25 million to revoke their naming privilege and then breaks the news, humiliatingly in front of the institution\u2019s director, that in fact he will pay only $9 million.

But he also called on the Cuban president to embrace the kinds of changes he has long resisted.\u201cI want you to know, I believe my visit here demonstrates that you do not need to fear a threat from the United States,\u201d Mr. Obama said. \u201cAnd given your commitment to Cuba\u2019s sovereignty and self-determination, I\u2019m also confident that you need not fear the different voices of the Cuban people and their capacity to speak and assemble and vote for their leaders.\u201dThe speech was a striking element on the final day of a three-day presidential visit packed with extraordinary firsts: an American president speaking directly to Cuba\u2019s people, in remarks that were broadcast live, as Cuba\u2019s own president looked on.\u201cHaving removed the shadow of history from our relationship, I must speak honestly about the things that I believe, the things that we as Americans believe,\u201d Mr. Obama said in his speech on Tuesday, addressing the Cuban people. \u201cI can\u2019t force you to agree, but you should know what I think.\u201dMr. Obama visited Cuba to cement a policy shift toward normalization that he hopes will outlast his presidency. He was accompanied by more than three dozen members of Congress who support the policy and several business leaders eager to take advantage of it through new commercial deals.But he made it clear in the speech that the engagement could not be successful unless Cuba evolves, opening its economy and its political system.\u201cIt\u2019s time to lift the embargo, but even if we lifted the embargo tomorrow, Cubans would not realize their potential without continued change here in Cuba,\u201d Mr. Obama said. \u201cIf you can\u2019t access information online, if you cannot be exposed to different points of view, you will not reach your full potential, and over time the youth will lose hope.\u201dMr. Obama drew loud applause, including from Mr. Castro, and a standing ovation when he said he had asked Congress to rescind the trade embargo with Cuba, proclaiming that it was time to \u201cleave behind the ideological battles of the past.\u201dAt other points, including when Mr. Obama spoke passionately about the virtues of democracy, much of the audience sat silent, though there were short bursts of applause in pockets of the hall.Mr. Obama hopes to make the opening with Cuba a part of his legacy, akin to Richard M. Nixon\u2019s 1972 trip to China. Tuesday\u2019s speech drew comparisons to Ronald Reagan\u2019s 1987 speech at the Brandenburg Gate in West Berlin, where he famously challenged the Soviet leader, Mikhail S. Gorbachev, to \u201ctear down this wall.\u201dMr. Obama put a twist on that comparison, quoting the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. to invoke the \u201cfierce urgency of now\u201d in appealing to a new generation. \u201cMany suggested that I come here and ask the people of Cuba to tear something down,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I\u2019m appealing to the young people of Cuba who will lift something up, build something new.\u201dThroughout Mr. Obama\u2019s visit, a dynamic of cautious warmth pervaded his interactions with Mr. Castro, including when the younger American president appeared to coach the older Cuban through his first genuine news conference on Monday.At the end of his speech on Tuesday, Mr. Obama, 54, made a point of silently mouthing \u201cThank you\u201d to Mr. Castro, 84.Photographs from a land of endless waiting and palpable erosion \u2014 but also, an uncanny openness among everyday people.The speech appeared to have been well received by many here.Alejandro Trelles Shaw, a retired counterintelligence officer, watched the speech at home. A 50-year-old photo of him with Mr. Castro\u2019s older brother Fidel was perched on a nearby shelf.\u201cI liked it,\u201d Mr. Trelles said. \u201cI liked all of it. There was nothing I didn\u2019t like. There\u2019s communication between him and Ra\u00fal, and that\u2019s fundamental.\u201dMr. Trelles, 77, said die-hard communists like him were happy to see the two countries inching closer.Mr. Obama may have left crucial issues out \u2014 like how money corrupts American elections, Mr. Trelles said \u2014 but his discourse on issues that matter to the Cuban people went over well. The president\u2019s words came across as a sincere and humble sermon that addressed unpopular topics without being overly preachy or demanding, Mr. Trelles said.\u201cThis system is not going to change even if Ra\u00fal and Fidel die \u2014 it\u2019s well planted,\u201d he said. \u201cSocial justice was sown here, and Obama has that \u2014 the human side.\u201dMr. Trelles watched the president\u2019s speech with his son-in-law, Gabriel Hern\u00e1ndez Porras, 28, who recently gave up a life in Havana to start a farm.The generational divide was deep.

{"Headline": "Foxconn\u2019s Deal to Buy Sharp Is a Test for Japanese Reform", "Date": "2016-03-30", "News": "Supported byBreakingviewsAnd fixing Sharp, the loss-making Japanese electronics manufacturer, will be a tough slog for Foxconn, the Taiwanese giant led by Terry Gou. But after botched beginnings, this transaction may just make history. It presents Exhibit A that Japan is capable of the sort of corporate reform critical to overhauling its economy.One month ago, Sharp and Foxconn, which is formally called Hon Hai Precision Industry, appeared to be at odds. Hours after Sharp announced a plan to sell control to various arms of Foxconn for 489 billion yen, or $4.4 billion, the Taiwanese company called a time out. It said it was still mulling over the details, including new material information about Sharp\u2019s potential liabilities.That explains the big drop in the headline price since. Foxconn will now pay $900 million less for its 66 percent stake. It will buy Sharp\u2019s shares at 88 yen apiece, a 35 percent discount to their Wednesday close \u2013 the classic definition of a \u201ctake-under.\u201d Moreover, Foxconn is buying new preference shares that will allow it to increase its stake over time.This is painful for Sharp\u2019s backers \u2014 and that is the point. It might have been possible to find an all-Japanese solution for Sharp by cutting a deal with the state-supported Innovation Network Corporation of Japan. But that might have just swept Sharp\u2019s problems under a rug. Instead, Sharp is going to the bidder with the most capabilities, and incentives, to make it a profitable and productive enterprise.It will not be an easy ride for Foxconn. The limited overlap between the two businesses will make it hard to cut costs at the Japanese group, which has forecast an operating loss of some 170 billion yen, or $1.5 billion, for the year through Thursday. Mr. Gou\u2019s bet is that by increasing his company\u2019s position in the supply chain of Apple, which uses Sharp screens on its devices, Foxconn can more effectively revive the ailing group\u2019s fortunes.Either way, the signal sent by that Foxconn\u2019s takeover of a century-old stalwart of Japan Inc. is immediate. Revitalizing Japan\u2019s economy after decades of stagnation, and in the face of a shrinking population, will require firms to become more productive and less protected from competition. In this respect, Sharp is the first major test of Japan\u2019s ability, and willingness, to meet that challenge.Advertisement"}

Even among self-identified centrists, opinion was split three ways on the issue of Israeli settlements in the occupied West Bank. Over all, a third believed the settlements hurt Israel\u2019s security, a third thought they helped security and the remainder said they made no difference.\u201cThese groups live in the same country, a small country, but it\u2019s almost like they live in different worlds,\u201d said Alan Cooperman, Pew\u2019s director of religion research.\u201cAll societies have various kinds of fractures and divisions,\u201d he said, \u201cbut the size of the fractures in Israel, from a pollster\u2019s point of view, are jaw-dropping.\u201dHe described those fractures as \u201cethnic and religious and deep and very real and alive,\u201d with practical implications \u201con policy questions like whether public transportation is running and planes are flying on the Sabbath.\u201dPresident Reuven Rivlin of Israel, who has spoken passionately about Israel\u2019s need to bridge gaps between its various \u201ctribes,\u201d said the survey \u201cpoints to the need to address our problems at home, more than ever.\u201dAnd despite the diametrically opposed positions of some sectors regarding the place of Jewish law, the survey indicates that 76 percent of Israeli Jews believe Israel can be both a Jewish state and a democracy. Among the Arab population, 64 percent do not believe it can be both.Local experts said that although Israelis frequently poll themselves on similar issues, the unusually large scope of the Pew survey gives it weight and validity.The survey was conducted through face-to-face interviews in Hebrew, Arabic and Russian among 5,601 Israeli adults from October 2014 through May 2015.The margin of error was three percentage points for Israeli Jews over all, but higher for each of the subgroups, including Christian, Muslim and Druse minorities that constitute about a fifth of Israel\u2019s 8.5 million people.Jews in Israel are more religiously observant than those in the United States, according to the two studies, including those who define themselves as secular. Nearly two-thirds of Israeli Jews say they keep kosher at home, for example, compared with about a quarter of Jewish Americans.Israelis who describe themselves as Haredi, the Hebrew term for ultra-Orthodox, make up about 8 percent of the state\u2019s adult population, and are the fastest-growing group. Religious (\u201cDati\u201d) Jews are 10 percent of all Israeli adults, and those who call themselves traditional (\u201cMasorti\u201d) represent 23 percent.While 56 percent of Dati Jews place themselves on the political right, Haredim and Masorti Jews are equally likely to place themselves on the right or in the ideological center. Most secular Jews \u2014 62 percent \u2014 identify as centrists. Eight percent of all Jews surveyed defined themselves as leftists.Tamar Hermann, who directs surveys for the Israel Democracy Institute and was an unpaid adviser to the Pew study, said she did not know whether to be shocked or to express reservations regarding the finding on the transfer of Arabs.\u201cThe phrasing of the question is very blunt,\u201d she said.\u201cI would feel uncomfortable incriminating the Israeli public based on that one question,\u201d she said, adding that it would nonetheless be \u201cused as a weapon\u201d by Israel\u2019s critics.Yehuda Ben Meir, an expert on Israeli public opinion at the Institute for National Security Studies at Tel Aviv University, said that previous surveys showed strong support for \u201cvoluntary\u201d transfer, but at the same time, \u201cif you ask Israeli Jews, \u2018Do you view the integration of Arabs into the Israeli economy and society as important?\u2019 most will say yes.\u201dMr. Cooperman, of the Pew Research Center, said Pew decided to keep the question simple, especially since there is no specific policy proposal advocating transfer on the table now in Israel.\u201cThis is how Jews are reacting to the broad idea,\u201d he said. \u201cBut people will point fingers at us.\u201d\u201cIf you pull the transfer question out in isolation, I can see how it can be used for propaganda about racism in Israeli society,\u201d he said. \u201cIt should not be viewed in isolation.\u201dAdvertisement"}

On which step of the ladder would you say you personally feel you stand at this time?\u201dThe scholars found that three-quarters of the variation across countries could be explained by six variables: gross domestic product per capita (the rawest measure of a nation\u2019s wealth); healthy years of life expectancy; social support (as measured by having someone to count on in times of trouble); trust (as measured by perceived absence of corruption in government and business); perceived freedom to make life choices; and generosity (as measured by donations).The field of happiness research has grown in recent years, but there is significant disagreement about how to measure happiness. Some scholars find people\u2019s subjective assessments of their well-being to be unreliable, and they prefer objective indicators like economic and health data. The scholars behind the World Happiness Report said they tried to take both types of data into account.The three economists noted research showing that people\u2019s evaluations of their lives \u201cdiffer significantly and systematically among countries\u201d; that within countries, subgroups differ widely in their levels of happiness; that unemployment and major disabilities have lasting influences on well-being; and that the happiness of migrants approximates that of their new country, instead of their country of origin.The three economists noted that crises can prompt vastly different responses based on the underlying social fabric. In Greece, where the economy began to plummet in 2007, setting off a crisis in the eurozone that has resulted in three financial bailouts, widespread corruption and mistrust were associated with the diminishing sense of happiness over the past decade.\u201cA crisis imposed on a weak institutional structure can actually further damage the quality of the supporting social fabric if the crisis triggers blame and strife rather than cooperation and repair,\u201d the economists wrote. \u201cOn the other hand, economic crises and natural disasters can, if the underlying institutions are of sufficient quality, lead to improvements rather than damage to the social fabric.\u201dHe also forcefully rejected the notion that happiness and freedom \u2014 especially when narrowly defined as economic liberty \u2014 are interchangeable.\u201cThe libertarian argument that economic freedom should be championed above all other values decisively fails the happiness test: There is no evidence that economic freedom per se is a major direct contributor of human well-being above and beyond what it might contribute towards per-capita income and employment,\u201d Dr. Sachs wrote. \u201cIndividual freedom matters for happiness, but among many objectives and values, not to the exclusion of those other considerations.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misidentified the country that ranked second in the World Happiness Report, thereby misidentifying the countries that ranked second through ninth. Switzerland is second \u2014 not Iceland, which ranks third.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Midtown Landlords Trim Rents as Corporate Tenants Flee to Trendier Addresses", "Date": "2016-03-22", "News": "Supported bySquare FeetAs businesses flock to new high-rises in of-the-moment New York City neighborhoods, older offices in more traditional business districts appear to be taking a hit.In the last few months, rents in some of those types of buildings have been trimmed, unusual in an industry that is loath to cut prices, especially when other economic indicators are generally sound.Throughout the industry, there is a growing sense that the office market might be overbuilt.\u201cThe tide is starting to turn away from a landlord-driven market to a tenant-driven market,\u201d said Heidi Learner, chief economist with the commercial real estate firm Savills Studley, which specializes in tenant representation. \u201cIt\u2019s not necessarily a signal of desperation. But it is a signal there\u2019s a lot of supply out there.\u201dStepped-up marketing efforts on behalf of those buildings, involving gifts to brokers beyond what is usually offered, are another sign that some properties may be struggling.If there is a newfound softness in the office-leasing market, it appears concentrated in Midtown, whose mid-20th-century towers were for decades the place to be for law firms, banks and publishing houses. That is gradually changing.Asking rents at the top buildings in Midtown dropped to about $87 a square foot in the fourth quarter last year from $91 in the third quarter, according to a Savills Studley market report. It was the largest decline among Manhattan office submarkets.In contrast, in Midtown South, the area that encompasses trendy NoMad, Union Square and the meatpacking district, the average asking rent in the third and fourth quarters was the same, $91 a square foot, the report said. This area has become a destination in recent years for start-up firms and established companies.Data from other brokerages suggests similar weakness. So far this year, more space in Midtown has been put on the market than taken off, according to CBRE Group, the commercial brokerage. The office vacancy rate in Midtown last month was 7.1 percent, CBRE said, compared with 5.1 percent in Midtown South.\u201cThe landlords got too piggy, and the tenants are starting to flee,\u201d said Robert Bielsky, the chairman of Manhattan Commercial Realty, a tenant-focused commercial brokerage.Among the properties where rents have been trimmed is 280 Park Avenue, a 1.3-million-square-foot office complex at East 48th Street that is jointly controlled by SL Green Realty Corporation and Vornado Realty Trust. The 43-story structure is now offering floors at discounted rates as it puts the finishing touches on a $125 million renovation.Steven Durels, an executive vice president of SL Green, said, \u201cIf you have to throttle it back, you throttle it back. We meet the market.\u201dHe noted that the building\u2019s vacancy rate of 12 percent was a big improvement over its 55 percent vacancy rate in 2011, when SL Green bought its stake in the property.By some measures, New York\u2019s economy is booming. In January, the unemployment rate dropped to 5.3 percent, and the share of the population that is employed is at its highest level in decades.Still, SL Green, which is one of New York\u2019s largest commercial landlords and has most of its buildings in Midtown, seems to be bracing for a slower office market.\u201cWe expect to see a bit of a rollback in job creation for the first time in the past four or five years in New York City,\u201d said Marc Holliday, SL Green\u2019s chief executive, in his company\u2019s quarterly earnings call in late January.While Midtown might be feeling the brunt of any slowdown, other neighborhoods also seem pinched, based on ads emailed to brokers in recent weeks. Phrases like \u201caggressive new pricing\u201d were a common feature.An ad for a fourth-floor space available at 38 Cooper Square, a converted warehouse in NoHo, for instance, promised \u201cPrice slashed.\u201d This winter, its asking rent was cut 11 percent, to $58 a square foot, from $65, said Nora Stats, an agent with Coldwell Banker Commercial Alliance who is listing the unit.\u201cIf a landlord can hang on to a space that\u2019s empty and wait, that\u2019s fine,\u201d Ms. Stats said. \u201cBut most landlords can\u2019t wait.\u201dAs demand slackens, the playing field is expanding, and business districts carved from industrial areas and other nontraditional areas are vying for prominent tenants.Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Company, the private equity firm, will decamp to 30 Hudson Yards, a new office tower going up atop train tracks, from 9 West 57th Street, a high-rise near Fifth Avenue in Midtown that has been considered one of the city\u2019s most prized corporate addresses.The landlord, the Durst Organization, is now marketing the publisher\u2019s empty 800,000-square-foot space for $80 to $90 a square foot, according to company officials, after a $100 million renovation to the building. Durst officials said they had no plans yet to lower those rents.While many of the relocations will not actually happen for years, landlords do not seem to be waiting around and are spending more money than usual, brokers say, to entice prospective tenants to check out their spaces.The five-agent marketing team for 530 Fifth Avenue, a 26-story, 536,000-square-foot limestone edifice completed in the mid-1950s, for instance, recently offered gift cards worth around $150 to entice brokers to view the office space. Even if they did not bring in prospects, they could keep the cards, which analysts said was unusual: Gift cards are typically given only when brokers show up with tenants.\u201cUse the gift as you wish,\u201d an email advertising the promotion said. \u201cA new bathing suit, sunglasses, a mai tai, or ahi tuna tacos.\u201d The ad also said that any brokers who came by would be taken out for drinks after a walk-through.\u201cWe run different kinds of promotions for different assets,\u201d said William Elder, an executive vice president of RXR Realty, which controls the office portion of the building, at West 44th Street. But Mr. Elder said he would not lower rents to fill the building.The office portion of 530 Fifth Avenue has an occupancy rate around 85 percent range, according to Mr. Elder, who added that asking rents per square foot were $65 to $85.\u201cWe are still seeing very healthy, very good activity,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Record Number of Tourists Visited New York City in 2015, and More Are Expected This Year", "Date": "2016-03-08", "News": "Supported byIt has been a decade since former Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg decided to ramp up New York City\u2019s efforts to attract more tourists, and city officials say there is no end to the influx on the horizon.In Berlin on Wednesday, Fred Dixon, the chief executive of New York\u2019s tourism-marketing agency, NYC & Company, plans to announce a forecast of 59.7 million visitors this year. That would exceed last year\u2019s record of 58.3 million visitors by 2.4 percent and keep the city on pace for a goal of drawing 67 million annual visitors by 2021, Mr. Dixon said in an interview.The tourists have kept flowing into New York from around the country and the rest of the world despite turmoil in many places, a slowing economy in China and a strengthening American dollar that weakens the buying power of foreigners, Mr. Dixon said. Despite the slowdown in China, the country is expected to be a growing source of visitors to the city in 2016, which has been declared \u201cU.S.-China tourism year,\u201d he said.NYC & Company is projecting about 920,000 visitors from China this year, an increase of 8.2 percent from the preliminary estimate of about 850,000 in 2015. China is the fourth-largest source of foreign visitors to the city, behind England, Canada and Brazil.\u201cWe\u2019ve already said we\u2019re expecting Chinese visitors to reach one million by 2018, and this could help us achieve it even sooner,\u201d Mr. Dixon said.Under the leadership of Mr. Dixon, who was chosen to be chief executive by Mayor Bill de Blasio two years ago, NYC & Company has continued to promote the city overseas \u2014 not an inexpensive undertaking.The agency\u2019s total budget for this year will be about $35 million, with more than half of it provided by the city government, Mr. Dixon said. The rest comes from hotel operators and other tourism-related businesses that make up its membership.Alicia Glen, the deputy mayor for economic development, said the city\u2019s contribution is projected to increase this year by more than 50 percent, to over $18 million.\u201cTourism is an incredibly important piece of our economy,\u201d Ms. Glen said in a phone interview. \u201cWhen we invest in the sector, we get a really high return.\u201dStill, the city\u2019s annual contribution to NYC & Company had fallen to about $12 million from a high of about $22 million when Mr. Bloomberg, a political independent, took control of the agency and announced an audacious goal of attracting 50 million visitors by 2015. The campaign was so successful that the original goal was reached four years early, in 2011. After the annual tally rose to nearly 57 million, Mr. de Blasio, a Democrat, declared a new goal of attracting \u201c10 million more\u201d visitors by 2021.The increased tourism has made for some very crowded parts of the city, especially in Manhattan, Ms. Glen acknowledged. That is why, she said, there is now an emphasis on getting tourists to explore other boroughs.Tourism officials are hoping to persuade out-of-towners that \u201cthe cool thing to do is to get out of Manhattan,\u201d Ms. Glen said. \u201cYou\u2019re sort of a loser if you come to New York and just go to Times Square.\u201dEmily Rafferty, the chairwoman of NYC & Company and former president of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, said the most important factor in continuing to attract people is that they feel safe, particularly in the wake of terrorist attacks like the one in Paris in November. William J. Bratton, New York\u2019s police commissioner, will be one of the prominent speakers at the agency\u2019s annual meeting next week, Ms. Rafferty said.\u201cWe want to assure everybody who is concerned about safety,\u201d she said. \u201cCommissioner Bratton has been extraordinary in his ability to give assurances to people that it\u2019s safe to come to New York.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "What Quagmire? Even in Withdrawal, Russia Stays a Step Ahead", "Date": "2016-03-15", "News": "Supported byNews AnalysisWASHINGTON \u2014 For five years, President Obama has steadfastly rejected the argument that the United States could intervene in Syria, alter the equation on the battlefield and avoid being sucked into a quagmire. Now, it appears that President Vladimir V. Putin has done exactly that.The Russian leader\u2019s announcement on Monday that he would withdraw the bulk of his forces from Syria not only caught the White House by surprise, it seemed to belie Mr. Obama\u2019s regular warnings that Russia would be severely damaged by its military adventurism. And it reinforced the sense that Mr. Putin has managed to maintain the initiative in Syria against an American president who wants to keep the war at arm\u2019s length.The White House on Tuesday cautiously welcomed Russia\u2019s latest move, even as it continued to criticize its intervention, and administration officials struggled to understand Mr. Putin\u2019s motives for acting now.\u201cThe Russia military intervention propped up Assad and only made it more difficult for that political resolution to be reached,\u201d the White House press secretary, Josh Earnest, said, referring to President Bashar al-Assad of Syria. \u201cIf they continue to follow through,\u201d he added, \u201cthen that would be a positive outcome.\u201dAdministration officials cautioned that they would need to see further evidence of Russian equipment leaving Syria before they concluded that the withdrawal was genuine. On Tuesday, the Pentagon said the American military had seen fewer than 10 Russian planes depart for Russia and no major troop movements.Still, American officials said there were reasons to believe that Mr. Putin would follow through. He has tied his credibility to the fragile cease-fire now in place, as well as to the peace talks that resumed this week in Geneva. He is eager to ease tensions with the European Union over a migrant crisis that the Europeans blame partly on him. And he is impatient with Mr. Assad, whose forces have been unable to hold territory in Syria\u2019s west, despite Russian air support.Mr. Putin, these officials said, had reached a turning point in his campaign, where the costs, domestically and internationally, of staying engaged outweighed the advantages. Moreover, the Russians had largely achieved their primary goal: preserving the Assad administration and giving Moscow a seat at the table for any political settlement.For Mr. Obama, Russia\u2019s decision is a relief insofar as it eases the pressure on him to increase American support for Syria\u2019s moderate opposition, something he has long resisted. The administration wants Russia to play a role in the political negotiations because it wields influence over Mr. Assad\u2019s government, and analysts predicted the withdrawal would force Mr. Assad to make concessions he was not otherwise willing to make.But the announcement is a reminder that since September, when Russia thrust itself into the conflict, Mr. Putin has consistently seemed a step ahead of the United States on Syria. His withdrawal could also prolong the American-led campaign against the Islamic State, also known as ISIS, because while Moscow trained most of its firepower against anti-government forces, it also struck Islamic State targets.The Pentagon spokesman, Peter Cook, said on Tuesday that Russian airstrikes had occurred over the last 24 hours, and those airstrikes were carried out against the Islamic State.The partial cease-fire in Syria, which began Feb. 27, has proved more effective and durable than expected, significantly reducing the level of violence.\u201cSuddenly, the Russians are no longer as available for the fight against ISIS,\u201d said Andrew J. Tabler, an expert on Syria at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy. \u201cThat would seem to put a longer timetable on this war and a greater burden on the United States and the West.\u201dMr. Earnest said the United States had received no \u201cdirect advance notice\u201d of the decision from Russia \u2014 wording careful enough that it did not dispel questions among analysts about whether Russia had coordinated its announcement with the United States. A senior administration official said that there was no \u201cstrategic grand bargain\u201d between the United States and Russia on Syria.Mr. Putin made the announcement just before he got on the phone with Mr. Obama for a call that had been scheduled at the request of the White House.Mr. Obama, in an interview last week with The Atlantic magazine, repeated his assertion that Russia\u2019s intervention was a blunder \u2014 one that betrayed weakness rather than strength. To argue that Russia was in a stronger position in Syria since it had intervened, he said, was to \u201cfundamentally misunderstand the nature of power in foreign affairs or in the world generally.\u201d\u201cThey are overextended. They are bleeding,\u201d Mr. Obama told Jeffrey Goldberg of The Atlantic. \u201cAnd their economy has contracted for three years in a row, drastically.\u201dModern Russia has inflamed conflict in former Soviet republics to create \u201cfrozen zones,\u201d allowing it to influence events and confound its opponents.Experts on Russia, however, said there was little evidence that Mr. Putin was withdrawing because of economic or political pressure. The Russian press has portrayed the operation as a victory \u2014 a \u201cmission accomplished\u201d \u2014 with relatively few Russian casualties. \u201cThis doesn\u2019t look like a quagmire to me,\u201d said Angela E. Stent, a professor of government and Russia expert at Georgetown University. \u201cIf they had been more ambitious in their goals \u2014 to destroy the Islamic State or to keep Syria whole \u2014 the outcome might be different,\u201d she added.Those are the goals of the Obama administration, which is why some analysts said it made little sense to compare Russia and the United States. Russia intervened in Syria on behalf of a sovereign government, while the Obama administration\u2019s debate has been over how aggressively to get involved in efforts to uproot that government. And the United States could never have taken part, as Russia did, in a campaign that resulted in the kind of civilian casualties inflicted by the Syrian government\u2019s forces.\u201cHe clearly set out to buy time for Assad, and that worked,\u201d said Derek Chollet, a former State Department and White House official in the Obama administration, referring to Mr. Putin. \u201cBut he made the situation in Syria demonstratively worse. When you go in without scruples, it\u2019s fairly easy to succeed.\u201dThe Russians, Mr. Chollet noted, have a long record of surprising the United States with tactical moves, going back to their invasion of Afghanistan. But those moves are not always successful in the long run. Other analysts, however, said that in one respect at least, Russia\u2019s limited operation exposed a fallacy in the president\u2019s argument: that any military involvement in Syria would inevitably lead to deeper engagement.\u201cSyria doesn\u2019t have to be a slippery slope,\u201d Mr. Tabler said. \u201cPutin actually demonstrated you could intervene, bomb, put troops on the ground and still get out. They effectively changed the situation on the ground, and kept the regime from collapsing.\u201dMatthew Rosenberg contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "What Donald Trump Doesn\u2019t Understand About \u2018the Deal\u2019", "Date": "2016-03-17", "News": "Supported byOn MoneyDonald Trump loves the word \u2018\u2018deal.\u2019\u2019 The book he released with a co-writer in 1987 to summarize his views of the world was called, of course, \u2018\u2018The Art of the Deal.\u2019\u2019 His view of trade with China is summarized in this quotation from his speech announcing his candidacy for president: \u2018\u2018When was the last time anybody saw us beating, let\u2019s say, China, in a trade deal? They kill us. I beat China all the time. All the time.\u2019\u2019 When asked last fall how he, as president, would guarantee health care for the uninsured, he answered, \u2018\u2018I would make a deal.\u2019\u2019 He plans to make a deal with pharmaceutical companies to lower prices, make a deal with hospitals to treat the uninsured. On immigration, of course, he promises the greatest deal of all time, one that would compel Mexico to pay for a wall along its border with the United States.I have spent much of the past few months trying to make sense of Trump\u2019s policy proposals. His website lists his major priorities as, in order: health care reform, China-United States trade agreements, Veterans Affairs reform, tax reform, gun rights and immigration reform. There are no other issues addressed at length. It\u2019s a puzzling mix. Any serious economic proposal to \u2018\u2018make America great again\u2019\u2019 would surely mention education, fiscal policy, entrepreneurship and trade with the entire world, not just China \u2014 issues he makes little or no reference to. No doubt Trump\u2019s list of priorities reflects the issues that he and his advisers perceive, probably correctly, to be red meat for Republican primary voters. But tellingly, it\u2019s also a set of issues for which the \u2018\u2018deal\u2019\u2019 \u2014 that is, Trump\u2019s unique ability to make deals \u2014 can be presented as his crucial promise.The centrality of the \u2018\u2018deal\u2019\u2019 to Trump\u00adonomics is especially strange when you consider how tangential that concept is, or at least should be, to a modern economy. In Microeconomics 101, deals are an afterthought: Transactions have the most socially optimal outcome when buyer and seller reach a mutually beneficial agreement. The very idea of a \u2018\u2018good\u2019\u2019 deal for one party and a \u2018\u2018bad\u2019\u2019 deal for another suggests a suboptimal outcome; an economy built on tough deal-making, with clear winners and losers, will always be a poorer one. Meanwhile, in macroeconomics \u2014 which covers the big, broad issues that a president typically worries about \u2014 the concept of the \u2018\u2018deal\u2019\u2019 hardly exists at all. The key issues at play in a national or global economy (inflation, currency-exchange rates, unemployment, overall growth) are impossible to control through any sort of deal. They reflect underlying structural forces in an economy, like the level of education and skill of the population, the productivity of companies, the amount of government spending and the actions of the central bank.It\u2019s easy to dismiss Trump as a loutish ignoramus who simply doesn\u2019t understand how modern economies function. But I\u2019ve come to see him as a canny spokesman for a different sort of economy, one that often goes by the technical name \u2018\u2018rent seeking.\u2019\u2019 In economics, a \u2018\u2018rent\u2019\u2019 is money you make because you control something scarce and desirable, whether it\u2019s an oil field or a monopolistic position in a market. There is a bit of \u2018\u2018rent\u2019\u2019 in nearly every transaction. When you pay rent on an apartment, some of the money is for the value the landlord has added to the property, by upgrading the kitchen, say. But much of the money your landlord makes comes from the fact that he or she controls property in a desirable location. If you think of the transactions that make people the most frustrated, they are, most likely, rent-seeking transactions in which some force is imposing a better \u2018\u2018deal\u2019\u2019 for one party. Your cable service costs more and is less responsive because local monopoly allows the company to make a better \u2018\u2018deal\u2019\u2019 for itself. The owner of the local pro-sports team can make a \u2018\u2018deal\u2019\u2019 with the city for a new stadium, or else the team packs up and leaves town. Without real competition, one or both sides of a rent-seeking transaction lack leverage, and so decisions can be hashed out only by powerful people making deals in back rooms.I learned a great deal about rentier economies, as they\u2019re sometimes known, when I spent a year in Baghdad, covering the American occupation of Iraq between 2003 and 2004. I met many of Iraq\u2019s leading businesspeople, and they always talked about \u2018\u2018deals.\u2019\u2019 As one explained to me, there would be some business opportunity \u2014 building a hospital, say, or getting a license to import a new line of cars \u2014 and Saddam Hussein\u2019s family would essentially auction off the opportunity to the handful of wealthy businesspeople whom they deemed trustworthy. Success came not from being better at building hospitals or more efficient at importing cars. It came from understanding the internal family politics of the Husseins and the power of the state bureaucracy.As an economic journalist, when trying to explain the idea of rent-seeking, I have always used one quintessential example from the United States \u2014 a sector in which markets don\u2019t function, in which excess profits are held by a few. That world is Manhattan real estate development. Twenty-three square miles in area, Manhattan contains roughly 854,000 housing units. But there are many more people than that who want to own property there. A Manhattan pied-\u00e0-terre has long been a globally recognized sign of wealth and status \u2014 especially in recent years, as billionaires the world over have come to see a Manhattan condo, even one rarely visited, as a vessel for laundered wealth or a hedge against political upheaval at home.Manhattan real estate development is about as far as it is possible to get, within the United States, from that Econ 101 notion of mutually beneficial transactions. This is not a marketplace characterized by competition and dynamism; instead, Manhattan real estate looks an awful lot more like a Middle Eastern rentier economy. It is a hereditary system. We talk about families, not entrepreneurs. A handful of families have dominated the city\u2019s real estate development for decades: Speyer, Tishman, Durst, Fisher, Malkin, Milstein, Resnick, LeFrak, Rose, Zeckendorf. Having grown up in Manhattan myself, I think of these names the way I heard Middle Easterners speak of the great sheikhs who ran big families in Jordan, Iraq and Syria. These are people of immense power and influence, but their actual skills and abilities are opaque. They do, however, make \u2018\u2018deals.\u2019\u2019In recent weeks, hearing Trump talk, I\u2019ve realized that his economic worldview is entirely coherent. It makes sense. He is not just a rent-seeker himself; his whole worldview is based on a rent-seeking vision of the economy, in which there\u2019s a fixed amount of wealth that can only be redistributed, never grow. It is a world\u00adview that makes perfect sense for the son of a New York real estate tycoon who grew up to be one, too. Everything he has gotten \u2014 as he proudly brags \u2014 came from cutting deals. Accepting the notion of a zero-sum world, he set out to grab more than his share. And his policies would push the American economy to conform with that worldview.Many economists and political scientists now think that the United States economy has shifted, over the past few decades, toward one in which a higher proportion of the economy comes from so-called rents: Wall Street\u2019s maneuvering through the regulatory process, \u2018\u2018free-trade\u2019\u2019 deals whose thousands of pages of rules wind up prescribing winners and losers. The left, right and center of the economics profession all agree that reducing rent-seeking behavior, and improving overall growth, is essential if we want to \u2018\u2018make America great again.\u2019\u2019But this descent into a rentier economy would only accelerate with a mentality like Trump\u2019s in the White House. The native-born population of the United States is aging rapidly; without immigrants the nation would quickly face a disastrous level of debt. Middle-class workers may be struggling now in a changing economy, but a clampdown on global trade would only make that worse. Any health care reform that revolved around the president\u2019s ability to \u2018\u2018deal\u2019\u2019 would inherently be one more prone to corruption. In a rentier state, every ambitious person knows that the way to become rich and powerful is to grab the sources of wealth and hold onto them, by force if necessary. It\u2019s no accident that, around the world, rentier states tend to be run by unelected dictators \u2014 the ultimate dealmakers in chief.Adam Davidson is a founder of NPR\u2019s \u2018\u2018Planet Money\u2019\u2019 and a contributing writer for the magazine.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Obama Family Spring Break: Making History and Doing the Tango", "Date": "2016-03-25", "News": "Supported byReporter\u2019s NotebookIt was the final day of the Obama Family Spring Break, and one of the last big overseas adventures Mr. Obama and his wife and daughters will have before he leaves office.It is rare for Mr. Obama to bring his daughters, whose privacy the White House guards vigilantly, with him on his closely watched trips overseas. This time, with a history-making adventure during school vacation, the president was determined to show them parts of the world they might not otherwise get to see.\u201cMy wife, Michelle, and I brought our daughters \u2014 and by the way, they don\u2019t always want to go with us; they\u2019re teenagers now,\u201d Mr. Obama told reporters in Havana. \u201cThey have friends at home and they have things to do, but they wanted to come to Cuba because they understood, and we wanted to show them, the beauty of Cuba and its people.\u201dLike many family vacations, this one had its ups and downs. What was planned as a leisurely family stroll through Old Havana became a soaked slog over slippery cobblestones on Sunday under an unexpected downpour. Malia and Sasha, grim-faced under large umbrellas, stepped around puddles as crowds of Cubans gawked and applauded, yelling, \u201cObama!\u201dLater, Malia translated Spanish for her father at a Cuban restaurant when he chatted with the chef.The daughters appeared cheerier in the sun on Tuesday during a baseball game at the Estadio Latinamericano, watching the Tampa Bay Rays beat the Cuban national team. But when Mr. Obama and the rest of his entourage rose to do the wave, Sasha stayed seated, her arm over her face as if mortified. A Presidential Tango It\u2019s not every day that the leader of the free world engages in a steamy dance routine with a stranger.But on Wednesday at a state dinner in Buenos Aires hosted by Mauricio Macri, the Argentine president, Mr. Obama succumbed to one of the country\u2019s best-known charms, doing an impromptu tango with a professional dancer clad in a silver dress.Mora Godoy, a renowned Argentine dancer, and a male partner were on hand as entertainment at the elegant dinner, which featured a menu of smoked trout, lamb and a dulce de leche \u201cvolcano.\u201d But after their performance, Ms. Godoy approached Mr. Obama and asked him to join her. He initially refused but then, prodded by his Argentine counterpart, relented.What followed was a presidential tango, complete with dramatic steps, spins and what appeared to be an aborted dip in which Ms. Godoy raised a bent leg high against Mr. Obama\u2019s thigh.Mrs. Obama got in on the fun as well, dancing her own tango with Ms. Godoy\u2019s partner. D\u00e9tente\u2019s Body Language A look at some of the first family's trips together over the first seven years of the president's tenure in office.They shook hands cheerfully, eyed each other warily, touched arms awkwardly and locked eyes meaningfully across a crowded theater. Then they donned shades and kicked back together for a baseball game.At an extraordinary joint news conference at the Revolutionary Palace, they seemed to grapple for control, Mr. Obama gently coaching Mr. Castro on how to handle questions from a free press, and the Cuban president resisting testily.Mr. Obama leaned indulgently on his lectern at one point when Mr. Castro abruptly paused the news conference to confer with an aide over whether to answer an American reporter\u2019s question about Cuba\u2019s political prisoners. After several moments, Mr. Obama, with a wry and somewhat impatient look on his face, glanced toward Mr. Castro and said, \u201cExcuse me.\u201dAll the while, Mr. Castro\u2019s grandson and head bodyguard stood off to one side of the stage, looking ready to pounce. The Cuban leader showed flashes of temper, at times yanking at his translation headset, at others raising his voice.The episode ended with a supremely goofy salute, Mr. Castro clasping Mr. Obama\u2019s limp wrist as they appeared to vacillate between handshake and revolutionary fist pump.The next day, Mr. Castro smiled broadly and waved from the balcony of the ornate Grand Theater of Havana before Mr. Obama\u2019s speech. As the audience cheered him, Mr. Castro kept pointing to the stage where Mr. Obama would stand.But Mr. Castro sat stonily as Mr. Obama directly admonished him during the speech to open Cuba\u2019s economy and political system. Afterward, Mr. Obama gazed across the theater and silently mouthed \u201cThank you\u201d to his host as the Cuban classic \u201cGuantanamera\u201d blared.By the start of the baseball game between the Rays and the Cuban team, the two presidents had traded ties for shades. Surrounded by their families, they sat side by side, an interpreter just behind them, and chatted like old friends. An Invasion of a Different Sort It was not the invasion that the Cubans have long feared. But when Mr. Obama arrived in Havana with hundreds of Americans in his entourage, it did seem a bit like the United States had taken over the island.Members of Congress milled around the Parque Central, gawking and snapping pictures like tourists. The White House press corps took over a floor in a large hotel, treating it as a filing center, snack bar and general meeting area.At a Havana restaurant with sweeping harbor views and cannons out front, Jimmy Buffett sat with the band and Derek Jeter mingled with guests invited by Major League Baseball to celebrate the game.Senior White House staff members stood elbow to elbow with the professional ballplayers, and next to 1950s cars, as waiters passed trays of mojitos. Secretary of State John Kerry and Penny Pritzker, the commerce secretary, were also there.Late in the evening, after the state dinner, several lawmakers joined in, bopping to Mr. Buffett\u2019s music in their cocktail attire.As a man hand-rolled Cuban cigars nearby, Representative Nancy Pelosi, Democrat of California and the minority leader, belted out all the words to \u201cMargaritaville.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Face-Off Between Strongmen Exposes Afghanistan\u2019s Political Rifts", "Date": "2016-03-23", "News": "Supported byThe demonstrators blamed the province\u2019s governor and Mr. Dostum\u2019s longtime rival, Atta Mohammad Noor, saying that the men who took down the photos were using official police vehicles at a time of tight security for the celebration of the Persian New Year.Mr. Noor, whose supporters also took to the streets, denied the accusations. Nevertheless, the posturing has raised fears of a return to the kind of open factional hostilities that, at their worst, drove the country\u2019s disastrous civil war in the 1990s. Militias aligned with the two officials continued to intermittently battle each other until 2003, when the United Nations conducted a disarmament campaign and Mr. Noor consolidated his power as governor of Balkh Province and its lucrative resources.A senior official close to President Ashraf Ghani, speaking on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to brief the news media, said the president had sent a stern message to his vice president and the governor: If you are in the government, act like statesmen.But some residents of Mazar-i-Sharif say they are on edge, and worried that the two factions will come to violence.\u201cAll they care about is self-fame and personal interests and in between the poor people have to suffer,\u201d Rahim Shah, 29, who sells curtains in Mazar-i-Sharif, said in a telephone interview.Mr. Shah said business was down on Tuesday and many shops had remained closed out of fear of violence. \u201cMy entire life, my hope, is tied to my shop. If anything happens to my shop, I will lose everything.\u201dHard feelings left over from those elections \u2014 between the supporters of Mr. Ghani, who became president, and Abdullah Abdullah, for whom the position of the government\u2019s chief executive was created \u2014 have kept the two sides tense over the smallest protocol issues. The strained relations have burdened a government faced with the mounting challenges of an emboldened insurgency and an economic crisis.Nicholas Haysom, the United Nations special representative for Afghanistan, recently listed the management of the \u201cfractious and fragmented political elite\u201d among Afghanistan\u2019s top challenges, after security and the economy, if the government is to \u201csimply survive\u201d 2016.The tensions in Balkh are the continuation of the political troubles stirred by the election. Mr. Noor, who was one of Mr. Abdullah\u2019s main supporters, has said that his candidate was cheated out of winning and that the president\u2019s team is now trying to marginalize Mr. Abdullah as well as replace Mr. Noor as governor of Balkh, a post he has held for 12 years.Mr. Noor denied accusations that he was behind the removal of Mr. Dostum\u2019s photos. In a long and at times harsh statement, he placed blame for the episode on \u201cagitators\u201d who he promised would be pursued. \u201cWe will not allow the security of our city to be ruined, or us and our people be cursed at, on pretext of the tearing of a photo,\u201d he wrote.Advisers to Mr. Dostum accused the governor of preventing the vice president\u2019s supporters, who mostly originate from the neighboring provinces of Jowzjan, Sar-i-Pul and Faryab, from entering the city to organize a peaceful protest.\u201cThe supporters of the vice president were not allowed into the city last night, and we asked them to retreat with calm and continue to seek justice in their home provinces,\u201d said Bashir Ahmad Tayanj, a spokesman for Mr. Dostum\u2019s National Islamic Movement Party of Afghanistan.\u201cThe billboards were taken down by men using police vehicles,\u201d Mr. Tayanj added. \u201cThis could not have happened by a couple thugs, it happened in coordination with the local authorities.\u201dHabibullah Kohmand, an adviser to Mr. Noor and the director of the Ministry of Mines in Balkh, said Mr. Dostum\u2019s supporters had been prevented from entering because some of them were armed. \u201cThose armed people intended to create chaos in the city so we had to stop them,\u201d Mr. Kohmand said. \u201cIf they planned to hold a demonstration, why did they bring arms with them?\u201dNevertheless, Mr. Noor\u2019s own supporters, some also reported to have been armed, used the opportunity to show force, taking to the streets to drown out the protest that had been planned against him. Mr. Kohmand said thousands of supporters were on standby \u201cto defend the governor\u2019s position.\u201d A war of words between the supporters of the two officials continues to flare on social media.The two sides in the coalition government have bickered over seating arrangements for their respective leaders in public meetings, and the locations and sizes of their portraits in government offices.This month, the proceedings of an International Women\u2019s Day event attended by the country\u2019s first lady, Rula Ghani, and cabinet ministers was delayed in part because there was a large portrait of Mr. Ghani behind the stage but not one of Mr. Abdullah.After supporters demanded that the situation be fixed, a portrait of Mr. Abdullah was mounted on the other side of the stage. Because the new picture was notably smaller than Mr. Ghani\u2019s, the organizers set up a screen next to the stage and projected a second, larger picture of Mr. Abdullah.Mr. Ghani\u2019s government has also faced pressure from an external political opposition that has been demanding that long-delayed parliamentary elections be held soon. The symbolism of pictures has come into play in that political dynamic as well.As former President Hamid Karzai, who is believed to have supported Mr. Ghani\u2019s campaign, and his allies have grown publicly disenchanted with his successor, visitors noticed that a large portrait of Mr. Ghani that was hanging in Mr. Karzai\u2019s office was suddenly no longer there. Aides to Mr. Karzai said the portrait had been removed because of renovation. But when the picture reappeared, it was relegated to the waiting room.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Globalization and Growth", "Date": "2016-03-14", "News": "I used to believe the same thing, and still find myself thinking along those lines now and then. But I\u2019d argue that economists need to be, at the least, upfront about the argument\u2019s limitations.First, it doesn\u2019t come out of the models. As Brad says, the map is not the territory; but guesses about such things are, well, guesses. There was a time when everyone knew that import-substituting industrialization was the key to economic takeoff, based on loose historical reasoning (America and Germany did it!). Then developing countries tried it en masse, and the results weren\u2019t great. Furthermore, my sense is that nonstandard free-trade arguments tend to involve, often unintentionally, a kind of bait and switch. Economists love to talk about comparative advantage, which is a beautiful piece of reasoning that runs counter to lay intuition. Somewhere Alan Blinder said that economists would almost all agree on the slogan \u201cYay free trade.\u201d But the seeming authority of the comparative-advantage case then ends up being carried over, illegitimately, to arguments for trade that have nothing to do with comparative advantage. Yes, there could be positive externalities associated with trade, but there could be positive externalities associated with lots of things, and Ricardian models don\u2019t give us any special reason to think that the trade ones are more important.So how would you test such arguments? Well, in a way we did carry out an experiment. In the early 1990s there was a widespread orthodoxy that \u201coutward-looking\u201d development policies were much more favorable to growth than \u201cinward-looking\u201d policies. This orthodoxy had a lot to do with the rapid growth of Asian economies, which had followed an export-oriented path rather than the import substitution tried by much of the world in the 50s and 60s. The question, however, was whether you would see dramatic acceleration of growth in other places, such as Latin America, when policy shifted away from inward focus.And the answer turned out to be, not so much. Look at Mexico, which did a radical trade liberalization in 1985-88, then joined NAFTA. It has seen a transformation of its economy in many ways; it has gone from an economy that didn\u2019t export much besides oil and tourism to a major manufacturing export power. And the effect on development has been \u2026 undewhelming.So Brad could be right; but the evidence is far from conclusive. I would still argue very strongly that it\u2019s crucial to keep markets open for poor countries. But we should be cautious in our claims about the virtues of free trade.Paul Krugman is an Op-Ed columnist for The New York Times.Advertisement"}

He noted that the company expanded revenue 15 percent, to about $186 million last year, despite trying circumstances. Brazil\u2019s overall economy in 2015 plunged by 3.8 percent, its worst performance since 1990.Then this January, STP increased revenue by 13 percent when compared with the same month one year earlier, the executive said. He said he expected that to continue. \u201cWe\u2019re confident we see the potential to double STP earnings over the next three to four years.\u201dSTP, based in S\u00e3o Paulo, is an electronic toll payments company that processes more than 800 million transactions annually and uses the brand name Sem Parar. It is also expanding into parking garages and fuel payments and has an agreement with Shell, another reason FleetCor was attracted to the deal.It was also drawn to the country\u2019s attractive work force payment business, the executive said.Fleet management continues to grow here. In January, Edenred of France said it would form a joint venture with Embratec of Brazil. Last October Itau Unibanco acquired a 50 percent share in ConectCar.The agreed-upon price disclosed today values STP at 11.5 times 2015 earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, adjusted for one-time items, FleetCor said in a presentation to investors. It acquired STP from a shareholder group including CCR, Arteris, and Ra\u00edzen Combustiveis.The purchase was denominated in reais, with an expected closing price of approximately 4.2 billion reais, or about $1.05 billion, it estimated. FleetCor said that it would pay for the transaction with a combination of cash and debt. It expects the deal, which requires regulatory approval, to close in the third quarter of this year.STP\u2019s chief executive and much of its management team are expected to stay on.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Supreme Court Nomination Drives Groups From Left and Right to Fight", "Date": "2016-03-16", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 More than 100 protest rallies are being scheduled in key electoral states like Ohio, Pennsylvania, Illinois, Wisconsin, New Hampshire and Iowa. Television advertisements are being scripted. Twitter and Facebook campaigns are rolling out, and email blasts are filling up inboxes.\u201cBork and Thomas, those were titanic battles,\u201d said Curt A. Levey, the executive director of FreedomWorks Foundation, a conservative group, referring to the Supreme Court nomination fights over Robert H. Bork in 1987 and Clarence Thomas in 1991. \u201cI think this will be the biggest battle of all. \u201dAs one measure of the scale of the fight, several former top aides to Mr. Obama, including Stephanie Cutter, Katie Beirne Fallon and Anita Dunn, are joining to create a nonprofit group they will call Constitutional Responsibility Project to coordinate the campaign by liberal groups and perhaps buy television ads.The White House on Wednesday declined to say whether the White House would coordinate with the groups to push for Judge Garland.Part of the intensity of the effort on both sides is a reflection of the diverse range of special interest groups that have decided to engage in what will be the first confirmation fight in an age in which social media has become a dominant force. In many cases, the groups have set aside longstanding tensions that have prevented them from teaming up in a unified way.On the right, conservative groups like Heritage Action, which have in the past sparred with Senator Mitch McConnell, the Kentucky Republican and majority leader, are already working closely with his office to back up his call that the Senate should wait until the next president is sworn in to fill the court vacancy. Judge Garland was approved by the Senate to the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit in a 76-to-23 vote in 1997.The House Majority PAC, which supports Democrats, sent out a solicitation urging recipients to contribute money \u201cto help us support President Obama\u2019s Supreme Court nominee.\u201d\u201cIt is different than a lot of the fights over the last five or six years,\u201d said Dan Holler, a Heritage Action spokesman. \u201cThe unity on the right is pretty remarkable and encouraging.\u201d\u201cThere is an incredibly diverse and deep coalition of organizations that have left their institutional egos at the door and have come together for the purpose of advancing a unified goal,\u201d said Wade Henderson, the president of the liberal Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights, whose civil rights organization hosted leaders from 30 to 40 groups at its offices last Friday.Liberal groups see their push as a win-win: If the Senate Republicans decline to hold hearings or vote on Judge Garland, they are convinced the protests they are busy organizing will help Democrats pick up at least some Senate seats.\u201cIf we apply enough political pressure, McConnell will see the majority slipping out of his hands and he will relent,\u201d said Brad Woodhouse, president of the progressive advocacy group Americans United for Change. \u201cIf not, we are still going to extract a political price and we will just do this all next year with President Clinton.\u201dMany of the liberal events, at least according to the plan, are going to feature speakers like construction workers or nurses \u2014 to emphasize the \u201cDo your job\u201d theme.On the right, there is a similar sense that a high-profile nomination fight will motivate their core supporters \u2014 which is why a broad range of conservative causes, from the Federalist Society, a legal group; Americans United for Life, an anti-abortion group; and Gun Owners of America are prepared to invest so much effort in this debate.\u201cWe want to make sure that people recognize what is at stake \u2014 when it comes to issues like the death penalty, gun rights and immigration,\u201d said Carrie Severino of Judicial Crisis Network. She said her group intended to spend up to $2 million and to target Democratic senators from more conservative states, like Joe Donnelly of Indiana, Joe Manchin III of West Virginia and Michael Bennet of Colorado, who is up for re-election in 2016.Merrick B. Garland is a candidate who had support from Republicans in the past but would still move the court in a progressive direction.The first part of the push will focus on senators back in their home states during the recess that starts next week. MoveOn.org plans a \u201cNational Day of Action,\u201d which organizers say will involve more than 50 rallies on Monday alone, mostly in states where Senate Republicans are up for re-election. Conservatives plan their own events during the recess, although the details are still being worked out.Republicans are likely to focus the debate on the process while Democrats will try to highlight the personal story of Judge Garland.\u00a0Mr. Obama\u2019s decision to select Judge Garland, a white man, has, at least among some liberal activists, deflated their enthusiasm for the fight. \u201cPresident Obama failed to use this opportunity to add the voice of another progressive woman of color to the Supreme Court,\u201d Charles Chamberlain, the executive director of Democracy for America, said in a statement. But Mr. Henderson, who is black and runs a civil-rights group, played down this split, saying President Obama had already appointed a record number of women and minorities as federal judges.The U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the National Association of Manufacturers, so far at least, plan not to play an active role in the fight.But there will still be some major industry groups involved, like the National Federation of Independent Business, which for the first time in its 73-year history has decided to mobilize, citing several continuing cases that its leaders fear could \u201cradically expand the federal government\u2019s control over the economy,\u201d including a court fight over pending clean air and clean water environmental rules.A \u201ccoordinated validator push\u201d is what Amy Brundage, a former Obama White House deputy communications director, called it. She is now at SKDKnickerbocker, a political consulting firm that is helping with the Supreme Court push.R. Bruce Josten, the top lobbyist at the Chamber of Commerce, said that to him, the biggest challenge for both sides was going to be keeping the American public interested in the debate if the Senate holds no hearings and takes no votes.\u201cThey are going to have manufactured something to continue to cause stories to be written,\u201d he said. \u201cThat is a tall order.\u201dGardiner Harris contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Florida Town Curbs Debauchery, and Pays the Price", "Date": "2016-03-21", "News": "Supported byPANAMA CITY BEACH, Fla. \u2014 The sun was sublime, the flour-soft sand could scarcely have been more tempting and the D.J. music thumped loudly enough to jiggle the beer cups resting on nearby tables. All that was missing were the throngs of booze-soaked, sunburned spring breakers who usually swarm this beach town during March.The scarcity of the party-hard population was no accident. Last year, after a particularly rowdy spring break that saw an alleged sexual assault on a crowded beach in broad daylight (it was recorded and went viral) and gunfire at a house party that injured seven partygoers, local officials clamped down. They passed more than 20 ordinances to curb the debauchery, drinking and violence that they had concluded was marring the town\u2019s image. In response, students sprinted to Facebook, Twitter, Snapchat and Instagram, quickly spreading the news \u2014 using the hashtag #RIPPCB (Rest in Peace Panama City Beach) \u2014 that the party here was over.Amplified through the social media megaphone, the drop was far steeper than even the businesses who opposed the measures had anticipated. Last week, peak time for spring break, scores of bars, restaurants, clubs, hotels, fast-food franchises and taxi companies that typically see their March profits bulge sat forlorn, with some reporting a 90 percent drop in customers.\u201cThere were a lot more unintended consequences than anyone imagined,\u201d said Jack Bishop, the owner of the popular waterfront restaurant and bar Harpoon Harry\u2019s. \u201cWe never dreamed it would be this bad so quickly. This tells you the power of the 24-hour news cycle and social media. I\u2019m down 72 percent for the month.\u201dLast week, Miami Beach dealt with its own rash of bad news: Rowdy spring break brawls on Ocean Drive led to the fatal shooting of a 20-year-old Florida man. The city has now rolled out its own restrictions and stepped up law enforcement. And despite Panama City Beach\u2019s stricter laws, one college student fell to his death from a parking garage balcony last week after drinking all day, and another died from an alcohol and drug overdose.In this small, conservative town with a Southern sensibility, the past year\u2019s debate over spring break has been painful and divisive. Owners and employees of many small businesses have accused politicians of overreach, warning the economy would be badly hurt. But many of the area\u2019s older residents and elected officials argue that spring break here had badly deteriorated, becoming far too raunchy, boozy, dangerous and dirty, and risked turning off families.To fight the problem, officials stepped up law enforcement, and the city and county passed more than 20 ordinances. The new laws, mostly in effect only in March, required bars to close at 2 a.m., banned loitering and scooter rentals in the evening and, most important, made it illegal to drink alcohol on the beach.\u201cIt got out of hand, and I believe it stopped some good people from coming here,\u201d said Mike Thomas, a Bay County commissioner who is now running for Panama City Beach mayor. \u201cI think it reached the point where we were killing ourselves. Our image was being hurt so badly.\u201dMr. Thomas said bars and clubs had been asked to tone down some events that in years past featured heavy drinking and the kind of entertainment he said attracted \u201can element that causes problems.\u201d Businesses, he said, did not cooperate.But business owners said that the vast majority of spring breakers were good people who wanted nothing more than a good time with friends, and that the new laws had gone too far.At Harpoon Harry\u2019s, Mr. Bishop said he did not even bother to open his outdoor bar most nights in March and had hired far fewer employees. The only reminder of the crowds that once flocked here was the row of empty portable toilets. The same story unfolded in business after business. A few had to lay off extra workers.At the Holiday Inn Resort, usually one of the most rollicking spring break hotels, a sprinkling of students lingered in the pool, arms raised high to protect their beers. Just beyond the fence, the town\u2019s world-famous sand beckoned. Choosing beers over the beach, few students ventured out beyond the hotel, though they said they were still having a good time.

{"Headline": "The Cities on the Sunny Side of the American Economy", "Date": "2016-03-31", "News": "Supported byNow the animals are gone, and the land is cleared and ready for the new development surging along the Denver-to-Boulder corridor.But this thriving industrial park is just one sign of the many metropolises and smaller cities across the nation that have not only regained their footing since the recession, but are on the upswing. Here in the Mountain West \u2014 but also in places as varied as Seattle and Portland, Ore., in the Northwest, and Atlanta and Orlando, Fla., in the Southeast \u2014 employers are hiring at a steady clip, housing prices are up and consumers are spending more freely.\u201cIt\u2019s pretty clear that some metropolitan areas are doing really well,\u201d said Andrew McAfee, an economist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. \u201cThe ingredients to that formula seem to be some combination of great research universities and knowledge-intensive industries, whether it\u2019s high tech on the West Coast, biotechnology here in the East or clusters of technology and robotics in places like Pittsburgh.\u201dThe Denver metropolitan area has become a showcase of the sunnier side of the American economy. While the region has some inherent advantages, like a spectacular landscape that beguiles outdoor enthusiasts, Colorado had long been held back by a dependence on natural resources as its economic base.Cities like Denver; San Jose, Calif.; and Austin, Tex., are now among those with the best-performing labor markets, while places like Las Vegas, Chicago and Detroit remain laggards.Its transformation into one of the most dynamic economies in the country was led by local business leaders and government officials, who took advantage of existing assets while also raising taxes at times to invest in critical transportation links, development-friendly policies and a network of colleges and universities.With a history of boom-and-bust commodity cycles, Colorado hit bottom in the mid-\u201980s, when energy prices collapsed. Nearly a third of the office space in downtown Denver, the state\u2019s oil-and-gas headquarters, sat empty. Many of the city\u2019s cultural institutions teetered, and a cloud of brown smog smeared the horizon.Now the brilliant blue skyline is punctuated with red cranes, and Denver\u2019s soundtrack includes the steady thrum of power drills operated by hard-hatted construction workers who are putting up office buildings and housing at a feverish pace.A raft of smaller aerospace and commercial satellite companies like Sierra Nevada, which just won a NASA contract to build the mini-space shuttle Dream Chaser, have elbowed in beside giants like Boeing and Lockheed Martin. Colorado led the country last year in new health care jobs.Several measures helped things along. A new rail line that will connect the airport to the downtown and serve outlying industrial parks and a push to support cultural institutions \u201crequired people to vote to raise their taxes,\u201d Mr. Clark of Metro Denver said. \u201cThis wasn\u2019t something done by the elites.\u201dWhat Denver and its surrounding cities share with other boomtowns is an appealing environment for a skilled work force, which has increasingly meant the difference between prosperity and stagnation.According to the latest figures available, the Denver-Aurora-Lakewood region had an unemployment rate of 2.7 percent, the lowest of any metropolitan area with a population above one million. (The national average was 4.9 percent in February.)A recent report by the Leeds School of Business, at the main Boulder campus of the University of Colorado, predicted that the state would gain more than 65,000 jobs in 2016, or about 2.5 percent above last year\u2019s level.This year, Schwab plans to add 1,360 people to its staff in Colorado.Other businesses have taken advantage of opportunities for collaboration with universities and government laboratories.Sierra Nevada\u2019s plant, for example, features a thermal vacuum chamber that simulates the cold void of space and a pint-size mission control to track its commercial satellite launches.But when it needed to recreate the intense vibration of a space launch, it trucked the Dream Chaser prototype to the earthquake simulator at the University of Colorado campus 20 minutes away.Bryan Leach, a former lawyer who founded Ibotta (pronounced \u201cI bought a\u201d), a mobile shopping app, has seen that evolution firsthand. After starting his career in the District of Columbia, he tested several western states in the early 2000s. Arizona had too many rattlesnakes, he said half jokingly. Wyoming was too small. California was too expensive.Then he and his wife visited Denver. They could manage to buy a new five-bedroom house and have the occasional dinner out without borrowing from their in-laws, he said. But at first he couldn\u2019t find the right job.No more. In Mr. Leach\u2019s view, Denver has reached a \u201ccritical mass\u201d of new business ventures. People who love Colorado\u2019s lifestyle no longer \u201cfeel like they have to sacrifice the quality of career opportunities,\u201d he said.Mr. Leach\u2019s own company has undergone extraordinary growth. In 2012 he ditched his lawyerly dark suits and now wears a tech entrepreneur\u2019s uniform of orange sneakers and a purple shirt. He started Ibotta in the windowless basement of a fire station, paying $8 a square foot to house himself and one other employee.In March, the company moved more than 200 full- and part-time employees into a new 40,000-square-foot office in Denver\u2019s tallest tower.The relative lack of racial and cultural diversity (the state is 87 percent white) can deter some people from relocating, Mr. Leach conceded, but he thinks that is changing with an increasingly cosmopolitan mix of people, arts, restaurants and shops. His own weekend ritual includes dim sum and rock climbing.\u201cNow I get to be part of the generation that is building the new economy,\u201d he said.An earlier version of this article misstated the month when the Denver-Aurora-Lakewood region had an unemployment rate of 2.7 percent.

{"Headline": "The Trade Deficit Isn\u2019t a Scorecard, and Cutting It Won\u2019t Make America Great Again", "Date": "2016-03-27", "News": "Supported byThe 2016 RaceDonald Trump believes that a half-trillion-dollar trade deficit with the rest of the world makes the United States a loser and countries with trade surpluses like China and Mexico winners.The reality is different. Trade deficits are not inherently good or bad; they can be either, depending on circumstances. The trade deficit is not a scorecard.What\u2019s more, eliminating the trade deficit would not, on its own, make America great again, as Mr. Trump promises. And in isolation, the fact that the United States has a trade deficit does not prove that trade agreements are bad for Americans, a staple of Bernie Sanders\u2019s campaign in the Democratic presidential primary. In fact, trying to eliminate the trade deficit could mean giving up some of the key levers of power that allow the United States to get its way in international politics.Getting rid of the trade deficit could very well make America less great. The reasons have to do with the global reserve currency, economic diplomacy and something called the Triffin dilemma.Imagine a world where there are only two countries, and only two products. One country makes cars; the other grows bananas.People in CarNation want bananas, so they buy $1 million worth from people in BananaLand. Residents of BananaLand want cars, so they buy $2 million of them from CarNation.That difference is the trade deficit: BananaLand has a $1 million trade deficit; CarNation has a $1 million trade surplus.But this does not mean that BananaLand is \u201closing\u201d to CarNation. Cars are really useful, and BananaLandites got a lot of them in exchange for their money.Similarly, it\u2019s true that the United States has a $58 billion trade deficit with Mexico, for example. But it\u2019s not as if Americans were just flinging money across the Rio Grande out of charity. Americans get a lot of good stuff for that: avocados, for example, and Canc\u00fan vacations.If you want to think of it in terms of winners and losers, in fact, you could justifiably reverse Mr. Trump\u2019s preferred framing: \u201cThose losers in Mexico gave us $58 billion more stuff than we gave them last year. Ha, ha, ha. We\u2019re winners.\u201dMaybe.It is true that a trade deficit subtracts from a country\u2019s gross domestic product. G.D.P. measures the value of goods and services produced within a country\u2019s borders, so when a country is selling less stuff abroad than it buys from abroad, the country is making less stuff, and as a result there are fewer jobs. This piece of the Trump theory of trade is true.But when a country runs a trade deficit, as the United States does, there is a countervailing force. Think back to our pretend countries. BananaLand has a $1 million trade deficit with CarNation. But that means that car producers in CarNation are sitting on an extra $1 million a year in income.Something has to happen with that $1 million, and both of the two options have consequences.One option is to keep that money at home. But keeping that money inside CarNation will push the value of its currency upward. And as its currency goes up, cars will become more expensive in BananaLand \u2014 causing people there to buy fewer of them until eventually the trade deficit is eliminated.If CarNation doesn\u2019t want its currency to rise, it has to take that $1 million trade surplus and plow it back into BananaLand. There are different ways it could do that. People in CarNation could buy stocks or bonds in BananaLand, or companies in CarNation could invest in factories in BananaLand, or the government of CarNation could buy assets directly.The choice is stark: A country running a trade surplus must either let its currency rise or let money flow back to its trading partners.This isn\u2019t just an abstraction. It\u2019s what has happened between the United States and China for the last couple of decades. China has had consistent trade surpluses, but it did not want its currency to rise in a way that would undermine its exporters. So money has flowed from China into the United States \u2014 both from the Chinese government\u2019s purchases of United States Treasury bonds and more recently in the form of direct investment from Chinese companies into the United States.So does a trade deficit mean fewer jobs? It depends on which force is more economically powerful: fewer jobs creating exports or investment dollars flowing into the country.It depends on what the country does with the investment that comes in.In theory, that money could go toward long-lasting investments with positive economic returns: new factories and equipment; education for the work force; and new roads and bridges, or repairs and improvements to existing ones.Unfortunately, how countries use these capital inflows is not always so good. In the United States, the influx of foreign capital in the mid-2000s went in large part to fuel an unsustainable housing and mortgage bubble. Greece\u2019s capital inflows in the same time period went to fund bloated public spending.When the world is flinging money at you, it\u2019s important to use it for something productive. It\u2019s not that trade deficits (and the capital inflows that are their flip side) don\u2019t matter \u2014 but just knowing the numbers doesn\u2019t tell you much about whether they are good, bad or indifferent.It\u2019s not clear that that\u2019s even an option, because the dollar isn\u2019t used just in trade between the United States and other countries.The dollar is a global reserve currency, meaning that it is used around the world in transactions that have nothing to do with the United States. When a Malaysian company does business with a German company, in many cases it will do business in dollars; when wealthy people in Dubai or Singapore\u2019s government investment fund want to sock away money, they do so in large part in dollar assets.That creates upward pressure on the dollar for reasons unrelated to trade flows between the United States and its partners. That, in turn, makes the dollar stronger, and American exporters less competitive, than they would be in a world where nobody used the dollar for anything except commerce involving the United States.The roughly $500 billion trade deficit that the United States runs each year isn\u2019t just about poorly negotiated trade deals and currency manipulation by this or that country. It\u2019s also, to some degree, a byproduct of the central role the United States plays in the global financial system.There\u2019s even a name for this: the Triffin dilemma. In the mid-20th century, the economist Robert Triffin warned that the provider of the global reserve currency would need to run perpetual trade deficits to keep the world financial system from freezing, with those trade deficits potentially fueling domestic booms and busts.The key idea is that if a President Trump or any other future leader really wants to reduce our trade deficits in a major way, that leader is going to have to rethink the very underpinnings of global finance.Be careful what you wish for.There\u2019s no doubt that maintaining the global reserve currency creates costs for the United States, namely a less competitive export industry.But it also creates a lot of advantages. Lower interest rates and higher stock prices are among them (though they have the downside of also feeding debt-driven booms and busts). Even more important is what the dollar\u2019s prominence in global finance does for America\u2019s place in the world.It helps ensure that the United States can afford to finance wars, and it gives the government greater ability to fight recessions and panics. A country experiencing a banking panic will see money sent out of the country, causing its currency to fall and its interest rates to rise. All that limits a government\u2019s options for fixing the problem. In 2008, when the United States experienced a near collapse of the banking system, the opposite happened.The centrality of the dollar to global finance gives the United States power on the global stage that no other country can match. It has enforced sanctions on Iran, Russia, North Korea and terrorist groups with the implicit threat of cutting off access to the dollar payments system for any bank in the world that does not cooperate with American foreign policy.Part of what makes the United States powerful is the great importance of the dollar to global finance. And part of the price the United States pays for that status is a stronger currency and higher trade deficits than would be the case otherwise.The debate over the trade deficit is about more than Mexico and China, cars and bananas, or winning and losing. It\u2019s about what makes America great, and which of the country\u2019s priorities should come first.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "China Weighs Letting Banks Sell Bad Debt to Investors", "Date": "2016-03-12", "News": "Supported byBEIJING \u2014 China is exploring a new way to grapple with its mounting pile of bad corporate debt, though its top central banker sought on Saturday to dispel worries that the plan would simply shift the burden to other parts of the country\u2019s vast economy.Under the tentative proposal, Chinese officials would allow banks saddled with growing quantities of bad loans to sell that debt to investors, said Zhou Xiaochuan, the governor of the People\u2019s Bank of China. The goal is to help alleviate one of the major drags on China\u2019s economy, the world\u2019s second largest after the United States\u2019 and a major driver of global growth.But Mr. Zhou and a deputy central bank governor, Pan Gongsheng, said they would take steps to make sure the effort did not create the kind of risk-laden financial products that played a major role in the 2008 global financial crisis. The effort would be modest, regulators would monitor it closely, and mom-and-pop investors would be kept out, they said.\u201cThere\u2019s no need to exaggerate,\u201d Mr. Zhou said at a news conference held as part of China\u2019s annual legislative session in Beijing. \u201cThere\u2019s not certainty that this would be a very big market.\u201dThat lending spree has also led to a major surplus of Chinese steel factories, glassworks and other industrial facilities, dragging down China\u2019s economic performance to its slowest rate in 25 years and casting a pall over the broader global outlook.On paper, China\u2019s banks have some of the world\u2019s lowest loan default rates. But economists inside and outside the country say many banks \u2014 in a practice known as \u201cextend and pretend\u201d \u2014 do not force companies to pay up or restructure, putting off the problem. That raises concerns that China\u2019s big banks could have considerable amounts of bad loans on their books.Some experts are skeptical that such a program would resolve the problem. \u201cUsing shares to pay overdue loans could help banks temporarily shore up their balance sheets, but it could cause greater difficulties down the road,\u201d said Ning Zhu, a finance professor at the Shanghai Advanced Institute of Finance.\u201cBanks are positive about securitization,\u201d Mr. Zhou said. \u201cIf some assets can be packaged and sold off, they can adjust their balance sheets.\u201d He said that because the loans sold off would be troubled, they would fetch prices below their face value.Mr. Zhou and Mr. Pan stressed that the program would be modest at first and absorb lessons from the 2008 financial crisis. China\u2019s new debt products would be kept simple, Mr. Pan said.\u201cThis is just a pilot,\u201d Mr. Pan said. \u201cWe\u2019ve selected a small number of major financial institutions with quite high management standards to develop trials, and the credit involved in the initial trials is not large.\u201dShang Fulin, the head of the China Banking Regulatory Commission, said at a separate news conference on Saturday that the trial effort to sell off bad debt was needed to ensure that more bank loans flowed into supporting the real economy, rather than turning over old loans.\u201cOur total volume of loans is quite adequate, but the speed of turnover of loans has been falling year after year,\u201d Mr. Shang said.Keith Bradsher contributed reporting from Hong Kong.Advertisement"}

On Wednesday morning, Mr. Cruz received the endorsement of Jeb Bush who said that \u201cwe must move to overcome the divisiveness and vulgarity of Donald Trump.\u201d\u201cDonald Trump may be used to bullying everyone around him, but Heidi is not scared of his bellowing attacks,\u201d he said. \u201cIf Donald wants to engage in a character fight, he\u2019s better off sticking with me because Heidi is way out of his league.\u201dMany observers recognized the line, which Mr. Cruz repeated throughout the day, as an echo from the Michael Douglas movie \u201cThe American President.\u201dAn interactive delegate calculator that lets you simulate how the 2016 Republican nomination could unfold.But Mr. Cruz reiterated his pledge to support Mr. Trump if he is the nominee, saying he had given his word, even as he predicted Mr. Trump would be \u201ctruly disastrous\u201d in the fall election.To date, Mr. Cruz has named only one situation in which he would not support Mr. Trump: if his opponent \u201cwere to go out on Fifth Avenue and shoot somebody,\u201d as Mr. Trump once suggested he could do without losing votes.On Wednesday, just off Fifth Avenue, Mr. Cruz spoke to supporters at a private club in Midtown, receiving a warm reception in a city with which he has a strained relationship. In January, Mr. Cruz attacked Mr. Trump as having \u201cNew York values,\u201d citing his history of left-leaning positions. Mr. Trump defended himself in part by invoking the city\u2019s response to the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.But on Wednesday, Mr. Cruz encountered few dissenters.He spoke in a stately hall \u2014 with two chandeliers, cushioned seats and what appeared to be a gilded eagle \u2014 as a vendor out front, on West 51st Street, sold imitation designer bags and heavily discounted wool hats.He peppered his remarks with allusions to New York Democrats, including Anthony Weiner and Representative Charles B. Rangel, and playful winks at local grievances.\u201cWe can\u2019t even afford a Big Gulp anymore!\u201d Mr. Cruz said at one point, discussing the economy, in a nod to former Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg\u2019s ill-fated efforts to ban large sugary drinks.\u201cNot allowed to!\u201d a woman shouted, a bit imprecisely, from an overflow room.Mr. Cruz reserved his most pointed criticism for Mayor Bill de Blasio. On Tuesday, Mr. de Blasio and his police commissioner, William J. Bratton, sharply criticized Mr. Cruz for his calls to \u201cpatrol and secure Muslim neighborhoods\u201d in the wake of the violence in Brussels. Mr. de Blasio called the remarks \u201creprehensible\u201d and accused Mr. Cruz of demagogy.He described a police protest against the mayor after the shooting deaths of two officers in 2014.\u201cWhen the heroes of the N.Y.P.D. stood up and turned their backs on Mayor de Blasio, they spoke not just for the men and women of New York but for Americans all across this nation,\u201d Mr. Cruz said, to cheers.Mr. Cruz is considered an underdog in the New York primary, given Mr. Trump\u2019s local ties and the perception that a message of conservative purity mixed with evangelical appeals might not resonate. Yet in the crowd, there were signals of his potential strength, including several voters who cheered his \u201cNew York values\u201d remarks.\u201cHe understands New York politics,\u201d said John Cudney, 33, from Williamsburg, Brooklyn.And even in his neighborhood, Mr. Cudney said, the tide seemed to be turning for conservatives, if only slightly.\u201cIt\u2019s getting gentrified,\u201d he said, gesturing toward his smart purple button-down. \u201cThere are more people who dress like me there.\u201dJonathan Martin contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Presidential Candidates Woo Arizona Voters on Immigration", "Date": "2016-03-18", "News": "Supported byPHOENIX \u2014 When Donald J. Trump campaigns in Arizona, he talks up the endorsements he has received from Jan Brewer, the former governor who signed some of the nation\u2019s toughest immigration laws, and Sheriff Joe Arpaio, whose aggressive pursuit of illegal immigrants has prompted discrimination charges by the Justice Department.And in ads airing across the state this week \u2014 his in English, hers in Spanish \u2014 Ted Cruz and Hillary Clinton deliver opposing messages: Mr. Cruz vows to undo executive actions by President Obama delaying the deportation of certain undocumented immigrants, while Mrs. Clinton promises to stop deporting parents whose children are citizens of the United States.The presidential race has moved to Arizona \u2014 a state at the center of the nation\u2019s battle over immigration \u2014 and each side is using the issue to try to woo a deeply divided electorate ahead of Primary Day on Tuesday.\u201cWe\u2019re not just at the center of the immigration discussion,\u201d Tyler Bowyer, chairman of the Republican Party of Maricopa County, the state\u2019s most populous, said in an interview. \u201cThe border is our backyard. We live the challenges of immigration every single day.\u201dArizona is a state in demographic transition. Latinos are poised to become the majority, and they already account for the largest number of students in public schools. But the state is also a magnet for retirees, and older white residents play an outsize role in elections and tilt the state to the right.In many ways, Arizona\u2019s political battles over immigration predicted the tensions and divisions that are defining the presidential election. Mr. Trump is a prime example, with his promises to build a wall at the border and make Mexico pay for it. The state\u2019s Latino population swelled to 2.5 million last year from 440,000 in 1980, while the share of white residents has steadily declined.Sheriff Arpaio stepped up raids as conservative legislators pushed bills that imposed heavy sanctions on employers who hire undocumented immigrants and expanded the legal definition of identity theft to include anyone seeking employment without proper documentation.According to the Associated Press, Donald J. Trump and Hillary Clinton have each won enough delegates to claim their party\u2019s nomination for president.Representative Ruben Gallego, a Democrat from Phoenix, said in an interview, \u201cOur immigration laws have been a very effective tool to mobilize the right, and it\u2019s once again going to reward a politician who\u2019s going to be preying on people\u2019s anxieties, be it Cruz or Trump.\u201dStill, profound challenges remain, fueled by geography \u2014 the border between Arizona and Mexico runs for about 370 miles \u2014 and opportunity. This month, Border Patrol agents arrested a convicted sex offender who had previously been deported as well as a man wanted for murder in Maricopa County as they tried to enter the country illegally.\u201cPeople are angry, they\u2019re upset,\u201d Ms. Brewer said in an interview. \u201cThe heartache and the loss and the suffering of people who have been harmed by illegal immigrants who come across our border is very real.\u201dBut Mr. Arpaio is unrepentant. He said that of the 8,600 undocumented immigrants his office had turned over to federal immigration authorities after their arrests for felony and misdemeanor crimes in the past two years, 3,000 had returned to county jails. The reason, he said, \u201cis not that they\u2019re all running back across the border, is that the federal government is releasing them back onto our streets.\u201d\u201cI hope I get to be there the day President Cruz tears up those illegal executive actions instituted by President Obama,\u201d Mr. Ronnebeck says in the ad.Mr. Trump\u2019s pledge to build a wall continues to be his most popular applause line at his rallies here. By contrast, Mr. Sanders, who spent much of the week traveling the state, accused Sheriff Arpaio of using \u201cun-American and uncivilized law enforcement tactics\u201d against Latinos.\u201cIn an election year dominated by threats and put-downs,\u201d the newspaper\u2019s editorial board wrote of Mr. Kasich, \u201cthe most understated candidate is the most competent.\u201dAn article on Saturday about the primary elections in Arizona misstated projections for 2030 about the citizenship of Latinos living in the state. The study estimates that four in five \u2014 not one in five \u2014 Latinos will be United States citizens by then.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Tefaf Faces Competitive Headwinds", "Date": "2016-03-11", "News": "Supported byMAASTRICHT, The Netherlands \u2014 The European Fine Art Fair, held on the outskirts of this historic Dutch city, has for almost three decades been the world\u2019s pre-eminent commercial event devoted to pre-21st-century art and objects.Global sales of art declined nearly 7 percent, to $63.8 billion in 2015 from $68.2 billion in 2014, according to the report, the industry\u2019s only comprehensive overview of world auction and dealer transactions (the latter based on estimates).Sales of postwar and contemporary art represented 46 percent of these sales by value, with modern works making up 30 percent. European old masters \u2014 a specialty of at least 50 of the 276 dealers exhibiting at this year\u2019s Tefaf \u2014 accounted for just 4 percent.\u201cThere\u2019s an element in the old master trade that\u2019s slightly in denial and doesn\u2019t want to face up to weakness in the market,\u201d said Hugo Nathan, a co-founder of the London art consultants Beaumont Nathan. But, he added, \u201cthe market is robust for top-quality exciting fresh material.\u201dA shortage of fresh material has always been a systemic problem for the old master market, and at Tefaf dealers make a conscious effort to unveil discoveries.One the most spectacular is a moving and finely preserved early 15th-century gold-ground painting of the crucifixion by Paolo Uccello being shown by the London dealers Thomas Agnew\u2019s, priced at 5.5 million euros, about $6 million.Paintings by this important Florentine artist are all but unheard-of on the open market. Acquired by Agnew\u2019s from a private collection, the circa 1423 panel has been recently identified by scholars as an early work by Uccello painted in a medieval style before (as Giorgio Vasari put it) he \u201cdrove himself mad\u201d with the study of perspective.This slightly atypical work by one of the great names of Renaissance art will test the fair\u2019s continuing ability to find buyers for top-level old masters.A 13-foot-wide Luca Giordano painting, \u201cThe Calling of Saints Peter and Andrew,\u201d from 1690 and priced at \u20ac2 million at the booth of the London dealer Colnaghi, was one of the few big-ticket old masters sales at the Thursday preview.The Paris dealership Galerie Talabardon & Gautier is showing Rembrandt\u2019s \u201cSmell,\u201d one of five panel paintings of the senses made by the artist in the 1620s while still a teenager. The painting, which is not available for sale, was bought in September by the French dealers as \u201ccontinental school, 19th century\u201d for $1.1 million with fees at an auction in New Jersey. It was subsequently identified as an early Rembrandt and sold to the American billionaire Thomas S. Kaplan for about $2 million, according to a dealer with knowledge of the matter who spoke on the condition of anonymity.The London dealer Fergus Hall is also showing an auction \u201csleeper.\u201d He bought a monumental early 17th-century canvas of Hercules at Sotheby\u2019s in 2014, described as \u201cJusepe de Ribera and workshop\u201d for 350,500 pounds, about $500,000. Now widely, if not unanimously, accepted as the fourth known \u201cGiants of Antiquity\u201d painted by the artist himself, it is priced at $4.8 million. Like that early Rembrandt, the Ribera underlines the potential profits that can still be made by discoveries in the old master market.The Tefaf report describes the art market in 2015 as \u201chighly polarized,\u201d with most of the value in sales of postwar, contemporary and modern art at \u201cthe very highest price levels.\u201d While overall sales in Britain declined 9 percent in the past year, and in China 23 percent, those in America increased 4 percent to $27.3 billion, representing 43 percent of the global value.In response to the growing dominance of American collectors and museums, Tefaf announced last month that it would be holding two \u201cmini Maastrichts\u201d in New York at the Park Avenue Armory.Tefaf New York Fall, devoted to more historic works, will open in October, while Tefaf New York Spring, focusing on modern art and design, is scheduled for May 2017. Both events will include about 80 to 90 exhibitors.Tefaf\u2019s enterprise has been widely applauded, but will the presence of these fairs obviate the need for Americans \u2014 2,500 of whom attended last year, of the fair\u2019s 75,000 visitors \u2014 to go to Maastricht?\u201cIt will be good for the New York market,\u201d the Tefaf exhibitor Otto Naumann, an old-master specialist there, said of the October event. \u201cNew York is the center of competition and dealers who can\u2019t get into the fair will be exhibiting in the galleries. But it could possibly have an erosive effect on Maastricht. There are fewer Europeans buying.\u201dTefaf Maastricht continues to have some weak areas \u2013 this is not the fair to buy cutting-edge contemporary art, and a clash of dates with Asia Week in New York has seriously depleted representation by top dealers in Chinese ceramics and other works of art \u2013 but the sheer wealth here of startling, museum-quality objects continues to amaze, as do some of the prices.The Swiss book dealer Heribert Tenschert Antiquariat Biberm\u00fchle is asking \u20ac12 million for a hitherto unknown early 15th-century illuminated manuscript by the Limbourg Brothers, famed for the \u201cTr\u00e8s Riches Heures\u201d made for Jean, Duc de Berry. Containing 30 pen and silverpoint drawings, the manuscript had been bought by Mr. Tenschert in 2013 for \u20ac2.7 million at an online auction in Belgium.One of the few exceptional works in the 51-dealer modern section of the fair is a circa 1950 painted plaster corset by the Mexican artist Frida Kahlo presented by the Uruguayan dealers Galeria Sur. This widely exhibited object, painted with a hammer and sickle and an image of an embryo in a womb, is priced at $3.5 million, on consignment from a collector.The Kahlo did not hook a buyer at the preview, but at least half a dozen collectors expressed strong interest in the six-foot-eight-inch-high nail painting, \u201cWeiss (White),\u201d by the Zero Group artist G\u00fcnther Uecker, priced at $2 million by the Italian postwar art specialists Cardi. The 1988 work was sold to a European buyer at the preview.The Tomasso Brothers of London have reunited 17th-century Roman polychrome marble busts of Horace and Cicero that in the early 18th century were part of the Eighth Earl of Pembroke\u2019s famed art collection in the \u201cDouble Cube\u201d room at Wilton House in Wiltshire.They were found in original condition, coincidentally, in separate collections in America and France in December and January respectively, and are marked at \u20ac1.75 million for the pair.Dino Tomasso, one of the two brothers who founded the dealership, said he was confident of Tefaf Maastricht\u2019s longevity, despite shifts in fashion and its ventures in America.\u201cWhen you look around you see dozens and dozens of world class objects,\u201d Mr. Tomasso said. \u201cIt\u2019s the cr\u00e8me de la cr\u00e8me.

{"Headline": "Major Companies Press North Carolina on Law Curbing Protections From Bias", "Date": "2016-03-29", "News": "Supported byDURHAM, N.C. \u2014 The onslaught of criticism, economic sanctions and a lawsuit being leveled at Gov. Pat McCrory of North Carolina grew on Tuesday, as the largest corporation in his state joined the fight against a new law that eliminated anti-discrimination protections for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people.Bank of America, which has its headquarters in Charlotte, N.C., announced late Tuesday on Twitter that its leadership was joining over 80 chief executives, including Timothy D. Cook of Apple and Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook, in objecting to the new law. Earlier in the day, the chief executives published a letter, addressed to Mr. McCrory, on the Human Rights Campaign website, saying, \u201cSuch laws are bad for our employees and bad for business.\u201dMr. McCrory, a Republican, signed the law last Wednesday to create a mandatory statewide anti-discrimination policy that excludes protections based on sexual orientation and gender identity. The bill, created by Republican legislators in an emergency session that same day, was intended to overrule a new municipal ordinance in Charlotte, the state\u2019s largest city, that provided such protections, including allowing transgender people to use bathrooms according to the gender they identify with. It was set to take effect Friday.Condemnation rained down in response. The governors of New York, Washington and Vermont issued bans on most official state travel to North Carolina, as did the mayors of San Francisco, Seattle and New York. The National Basketball Association implied it might move the 2017 All-Star Game from Charlotte. The White House press secretary, Josh Earnest, called the law \u201cmeanspirited.\u201dOn Monday, Lambda Legal, the American Civil Liberties Union, the A.C.L.U. of North Carolina and Equality North Carolina filed a federal lawsuit against Mr. McCrory; the state\u2019s attorney general, Roy Cooper; and the University of North Carolina, challenging the law on behalf of two transgender North Carolinians.Mr. McCrory defended his signature in a testy news conference on Monday, insisting that the new law did not take away existing protections. Fact-checkers at Raleigh\u2019s WRAL-TV rated that statement false.Then on Tuesday, Mr. Cooper, a Democrat who plans to run for governor against Mr. McCrory this fall, held a news conference saying he refused to defend the new law in court, despite being named in the case. \u201cNot only is this new law a national embarrassment, it will set North Carolina\u2019s economy back,\u201d he said.Mr. McCrory accused Mr. Cooper and other critics, including the White House, of taking part in a \u201cvicious nationwide smear campaign\u201d against his state.In a video released by his press office on Tuesday, Mr. McCrory accused the critics of \u201cdisregarding the facts.\u201d\u201cOther politicians, from the White House to mayors and City Council members and, yes, our attorney general, have initiated and promoted conflict to advance their political agenda,\u201d he said.In a separate statement provided to The New York Times, Mr. McCrory\u2019s communications director, Josh Ellis, lashed out at Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo of New York, accusing him of hypocrisy.\u201cSyracuse is playing the Final Four in Houston, where voters overwhelmingly rejected a bathroom ordinance that was also rejected by the State of North Carolina. Is Governor Cuomo going to ask the Syracuse team to boycott the game in Houston? It\u2019s total hypocrisy and demagoguery.\u201dMr. Cuomo\u2019s chief counsel, Alphonso David, rejected that comparison, noting that Syracuse University is private and that the Houston measure was rejected in a referendum, not voided by a state legislature.\u201cThey cannot hide behind what we perceive as nothing more than sheer discrimination and bigotry,\u201d Mr. David said by phone from Albany. Mr. McCrory ran for office as a pro-business moderate but has often gone along with a staunchly conservative Republican legislature whose supporters he needs to win a second term. Bank of America was one of the largest contributors to Mr. McCrory\u2019s 2012 campaign and is a major supporter of North Carolina\u2019s Republican and Democratic Parties, according to the National Institute on Money in State Politics.In the video, Mr. McCrory said the law was meant to \u201cprotect men, women and children when they use a public restroom, shower or locker room.\u201d That is a reference to its best-known requirement: that people use bathrooms that correspond with the gender on their birth certificate, rather than their gender identity. Lawmakers had focused their opposition to Charlotte\u2019s anti-discrimination ordinance on the contention that it might allow men dressed as women to enter bathrooms and commit assaults.The law\u2019s critics say there is no evidence that has happened elsewhere.Threats of boycotts stemming from discriminatory laws have forced governors in Indiana and, this week, Georgia to reject similar laws in those states.The economic pressure is building on North Carolina as well. Another of the signatories on the letter signed by Bank of America was the president and chief executive of PayPal, Dan Schulman, who had announced plans for a $3.6 million global operations center in Charlotte this month.Advertisement"}

He has contended that he is innocent and that powerful media groups are unfairly zeroing in on him over charges of money laundering and misrepresentation of assets.Ms. Rousseff continues to refuse to resign. \u201cIf there is no reason to do so, I will not step down,\u201d she said on Friday.Struggling with a rebellion in her governing coalition and the prospect that Mr. da Silva may even be arrested, Ms. Rousseff also said she would be \u201cextremely proud\u201d to have the former president in her cabinet.Such a move would give Mr. da Silva the special judicial standing enjoyed by senior government officials and hundreds of members of Congress, allowing them to be tried only by the Supreme Federal Tribunal, Brazil\u2019s highest court. This standing effectively allows them to avoid arrest, while producing years of delays in trials.Mr. da Silva has not said whether he would accept such a post. Political analysts say doing so may convey the impression that he is avoiding prosecution. While Mr. da Silva never stopped exerting influence in Bras\u00edlia, the capital, his formal return to the government could also transform Ms. Rousseff, an already weakened leader, into something of a figurehead.Still, it remains unclear whether big segments of Brazilian society that benefited from expanded social welfare programs under the Workers\u2019 Party are ready to turn on Ms. Rousseff and Mr. da Silva. In Rio, thousands of demonstrators crowded a beachfront avenue; many on the street seemed to come from relatively privileged backgrounds.Nevertheless, resentment was palpable among many protesters. Some in S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil\u2019s largest city, expressed frustration with much of the established order.Durval Sanches, 77, a retired bank employee in S\u00e3o Paulo, said he would support a military coup if the legal system was not capable of curbing the Workers\u2019 Party. The party originated under Mr. da Silva\u2019s leadership in the 1980s as a coalition of union leaders and left-wing intellectuals opposed to Brazil\u2019s military dictatorship, which ruled from 1964 until 1985.\u201cTiririca would need a team to guide him,\u201d Mr. Sanches said of the congressman, whose real name is Francisco Everardo Oliveira Silva. \u201cBut he\u2019d be better than this band of thieves we have now.\u201dMariana Sim\u00f5es contributed reporting from Rio de Janeiro, and Paula Moura from S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Senate Bill Would Limit Shareholder Rights", "Date": "2016-03-24", "News": "Supported byAnother ViewJason N. Ader is the chief executive and Eric Jackson the managing director of SpringOwl Asset Management.The bill seeks to shorten the number of days to two from 10 that shareholders have to disclose that they have bought more than 5 percent of a company, force shareholders to disclose derivatives and short positions they hold in a company, as well as redefine the rules about who has taken a 5 percent stake in a company to prevent \u201cwolf pack\u201d investing, which occurs when a lead fund tips off others that a disclosure is about to be made, giving them the opportunity to buy the same stock before the 10-day window is up.The bill is misguided. Its backers are unwittingly supporting entrenched and underperforming managers to restrict shareholders from having the right to oust them.Eventually, Wasau Paper decided to close a money-losing free-sheet printing paper plant in Brokaw, Wisc. One hundred jobs were lost. Local tax revenue was lost. It hurt that town\u2019s economy. Hence, the name of this bill is the Brokaw Act.But let\u2019s examine the facts here.Was Starboard wrong?Was Starboard a \u201cshort-term\u201d investor?Did it act in a \u201cwolf pack\u201d with other investors?No.Do Senators Sanders and Warren favor companies running unprofitable lines of business until the entire company goes into bankruptcy and all jobs across the company are lost?If Brokaw had a large plant that made fax machines, no political bill would help save those jobs when the world stopped using fax machines. If a shareholder speaks up and suggests that management stop investing in fax machines, management should listen.Finally, let\u2019s consider who the major investors in these kinds of funds are.They are teacher and police officer pension funds, municipal retirement systems, private pensions of large companies with thousands of employees and endowment funds of major academic systems.Are these pensioners, these former teachers, police officers and government workers trying to sell America short? Hardly. They simply want the pension that they are entitled to. This requires that their assets be invested profitably in profitable companies. If activist funds make wise investments, those pensioners will be well served.

{"Headline": "Why Trump Now?", "Date": "2016-03-01", "News": "Supported byThe economic forces driving this year\u2019s nomination contests have been at work for decades. Why did the dam break now?In other words, the economic basis for voter anger has been building over forty years. Starting in 2000, two related developments added to worsening conditions for the middle and working classes.After 2000, the middle class continued to shrink, but so did the percentage of households making $100,000 or more. The only group to grow larger after 2000 was households with incomes of $35,000 or less. Americans were moving down the ladder. (This downward shift can be seen in the other chart that accompanies this article.)If one had to project the impact of China\u2019s momentous economic reform for the U.S. labor market with nothing to go on other than a standard undergraduate economics textbook, one would predict large movements of workers between U.S. tradable industries (say, from apparel and furniture to pharmaceuticals and jet aircraft), limited reallocation of jobs from tradables to non-tradables, and no net impacts on U.S. aggregate employment. The reality of adjustment to the China shock has been far different. Employment has certainly fallen in U.S. industries most exposed to import competition. But so too has overall employment in local labor markets in which these industries were concentrated. Offsetting employment gains either in export-oriented tradables or in non-tradables have, for the most part, failed to materialize.High wage workers find it relatively easy to adjust and \u201cdo not experience an earnings loss,\u201d argue Autor and his colleagues. Low wage workers, in contrast, \u201csuffer large differential earnings loss, as they obtain lower earnings per year both while working at the initial firm and after relocating to new employers.\u201dThis is why Trump\u2019s charge that China has gotten the better of the United States has gained traction.The recipe for populism seems pretty clear: take a surge in manufacturing imports from China and continued automation in the US workplace and add a tepid macroeconomy. The result is a combustible stew sure to sour the stomach of party leaders nationwide.The widespread sense that all the elites in Washington and New York conspired to bail out the miscreants who caused the disaster and then gave them bonuses, while the rest of us lost our houses or saw their value, the biggest and often only asset of Americans, plummet, lost our jobs or saw them frozen and stagnant, and then saw gaping inequality grow even more, is just palpable.Voter anger was directed at two targets \u2014 the \u201cundeserving rich\u201d and the \u201cundeserving poor.\u201dThe 2010 election pattern was repeated in the 2014 midterms.Jared Bernstein, a senior fellow at the Center for Budget and Policy Priorities, described in blunt terms the consequences of disillusionment with old guard Republicans:The intersection of inequality driven by real wage/income stagnation and the fact that the folks perceived to have blown the damn economy up not only recovered first, but got government assistance in the form of bailouts to do so. If you\u2019re in the anxious middle and that doesn\u2019t deeply piss you off, you\u2019re an unusually forgiving person.In these circumstances, Bernstein wrote, the logic supporting the traditional Republican Party fell apart:The core theme of Republican establishment lore has been to demonize not unregulated finance or trade or inequality, but \u2018the other\u2019 \u2013 e.g., the immigrant or minority taking your job and claiming unneeded government support. And yet, none of their trickle down, deregulatory agenda helped ameliorate the problem at all. So they lost control.Just as animosity to Republican power brokers in Washington intensified, the Republican Party began to splinter.This election has demonstrated that there is no Republican Party organization, per se. The Republican Party exists as an array of allied groups, incumbent office holders, media organizations, and funding vehicles (e.g., SuperPACs, 501(c)(4)s, and the like). When people ask why the \u201cestablishment\u201d or \u201cthe party\u201d has not done anything to stop Trump, it is not exactly clear who they mean.The tragedy of the 2016 campaign is that Trump has mobilized a constituency with legitimate grievances on a fool\u2019s errand.If he is shoved out of the field somehow, his supporters will remain bitter and enraged, convinced that a self-serving and malign elite defeated their leader.If he prevails, a constituency that could force politicians to confront the problems of the working and middle class will waste its energies on a candidate incompetent to improve the lives of the credulous men and women lining up to support him.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Banned in Beijing", "Date": "2016-03-18", "News": "Supported byThe ShortlistThe Chinese title of this sprawling novel, \u201cFeidu,\u201d means \u201cabandoned capital.\u201d It refers not to Beijing but to Jia Pingwa\u2019s hometown, Xi\u2019an, called Chang\u2019an when it was the political and spiritual center of the Tang dynasty. In its time possibly the largest and most cosmopolitan city in the world, Xi\u2019an (Xijing in the novel) has, in Jia\u2019s description, become a dilapidated backwater by the 1980s. \u201cRuined City,\u201d newly translated by Howard Goldblatt, concerns the careers of a small group of local writers, and their friends, publishers and lovers (sometimes all three at once). Zhuang Zhidie, the protagonist, is a freethinker and libertine who seems driven to sleep with women more out of curiosity than lust, and the book\u2019s many elaborate descriptions of sex \u2014 which caused the novel to be banned in China for 17 years \u2014 have a detached and clinical air, the feeling of a deliberate provocation for the censors rather than a celebration of Eros for its own sake.Far more resonant than the sex is Jia\u2019s pervading nostalgia for the Chinese past, embodied in the novel\u2019s episodic, wandering, seemingly plot-indifferent structure \u2014 a series of what seem to be very similar incidents and encounters, meals, conversations, sexual escapades, minor scandals and subdued confrontations, which only by very slow degrees add up to any sense of narrative progress. Like some of the classics of Chinese literature \u2014 \u201cThe Water Margin,\u201d \u201cJourney to the West,\u201d \u201cThe Dream of the Red Chamber,\u201d \u201cThe Scholars\u201d \u2014 \u201cRuined City\u201d has to be appreciated for its small pleasures as much as its larger themes: It\u2019s a grab bag of techniques and vantage points, from the loving description of a living room filled with furniture imported from Hong Kong (a rare sight in the 1980s) to a passage seen from the perspective of a cow.\u201cRuined City\u201d is notable for its almost complete indifference to its historical moment. While the Cultural Revolution is referred to in places, it\u2019s clear that Jia wants his characters to seem neither traumatized by nor interested in politics. They live in a tiny world of their own making and seem \u2014 like artists everywhere \u2014 to thrive on life\u2019s small dissatisfactions. That may be the novel\u2019s most shocking quality of all.\u201cBeijing Comrades\u201d is a familiar, almost archetypal love story: Chen Handong, a princeling in his late 20s, possessed of enormous wealth and almost equally enormous sexual appetites, loses his heart to Lan Yu, an alluring teenager who has maneuvered his way into college in Beijing, even though he comes from an impoverished family in remote northwestern China. Not content with the conventionally discreet existence of a Chinese gay man, Handong buys a house in the suburbs, where he hopes he and Lan Yu can build a new life together; eventually, however, his family discovers his secret and, his happiness sabotaged, he finds himself driven to marry a manipulative, selfish woman. After a short while Handong\u2019s marriage ends in a pitiless divorce, and he manages to find Lan Yu again, but their hard-earned contentment is short-lived.\u201cBeijing Comrades\u201d (which was made into a film, \u201cLan Yu,\u201d by the Hong Kong director Stanley Kwan in 2001) has lingered in the margins far too long. Scott E. Myers\u2019s translation demonstrates that it\u2019s one of the most significant Chinese novels of our time.Originally published in 1950 as \u201cEighteen Springs\u201d and both revised and retitled 18 years later, \u201cHalf a Lifelong Romance\u201d is the most mature and fully achieved novel by the midcentury writer Eileen Chang, whose work was beloved by readers in Hong Kong and Taiwan, yet banned in mainland China until the 1990s. Somewhat mysteriously, it\u2019s also the only one of her novels she herself did not adapt into English. Chang, also known as Zhang Ailing, was born in Shanghai to an aristocratic family in 1920 and moved back and forth between China and Hong Kong during the chaotic years of her young adulthood, finally settling in the United States in the 1950s. She drew equally on Chinese and Western novels for inspiration and considered her work to be a hybrid.\u201cHalf a Lifelong Romance,\u201d translated by Karen S. Kingsbury, takes place in Shanghai in the years leading up to World War II, when the city was flush with overseas investment and cosmopolitan panache. Unlike Chang\u2019s famously lurid story of spies and seductresses, \u201cLust, Caution\u201d \u2014 the basis for the Ang Lee movie \u2014 this novel is set among ordinary residents of the city whose lives are hemmed in by rigid social constraints and Confucian reserve. Shen Shijun, a young engineer, falls in love with Gu Manzhen, a beautiful, gentle, sincere young woman employed at the same textile factory. But because Manzhen\u2019s sister once worked as a taxi dancer and prostitute, Shijun\u2019s family rejects her and he marries someone else. Manzhen then enters into her own unfortunate marriage. When they finally meet again, many years later, they can only acknowledge the sequence of slights, errors and miscalculations that doomed their relationship almost from the start.Somewhat less atmospheric than Chang\u2019s other work, \u201cHalf a Lifelong Romance\u201d is a small masterpiece of under\u00adstatement and indirection. It has a grave tenderness, alert to the manners and gestures of bourgeois family life, almost reminiscent of Henry James or Edith Wharton. It\u2019s an excellent introduction to the complex work of an underappreciated writer.Jess Row\u2019s most recent book is the novel \u201cYour Face in Mine.\u201d Advertisement"}

Then, worries centered on rising gas prices, deep consumer debt and government layoffs.Despite the setback on wages, Beth Ann Bovino, chief United States economist at Standard & Poor\u2019s, was upbeat about the economy\u2019s prospects this year. \u201cWe\u2019re back in the saddle again,\u201d she said, noting that the heavy snowfall that hit the Northeast last month apparently did little to curtail hiring in retail sales and food services.Economists said the Fed was still likely to remain in a holding pattern, but the strong jobs report would at least give its policy makers plenty to talk about and increased the chances that it would decide to raise borrowing costs in April or June. As Mr. Tannenbaum put it: \u201cThis number will certainly spice up the Fed\u2019s discussion.\u201dA broader measure that includes people too discouraged to search for work or who are making do with a part-time job because they cannot find a full-time one fell 0.2 of a percentage point, to 9.7 percent.Perhaps the most encouraging sign in the monthly statistics was evidence that people who had long been sidelined were being lured back to the job market. The overall share of Americans in the labor force ticked up 0.2 of a percentage point to 62.9 percent.\u201cThat has been the shadow hanging over all the other labor force statistics,\u201d Patrick O\u2019Keefe, director of economic policy at CohnReznick, an accounting, tax and advisory firm, said of the stubbornly low participation rate.Despite the improved economic picture, there is still plenty of distress and anger, emotions that have helped spur the success of the Republican presidential front-runner, Donald J. Trump, and rallied many Democrats behind the underdog Bernie Sanders\u2019s attacks on inequality and Wall Street cronyism.Part of the reason is the unevenness of the recovery. Fortunes have diverged depending on where people live, their education and skill levels and what industry they work in.\u201cWe are seeing job growth across a range of industries, but we\u2019re also seeing a polarization in the labor market,\u201d said Tara Sinclair, chief economist for the job site Indeed.There has been vigorous demand for hospitality and service workers, often at low wages. But the higher total job count masks losses in manufacturing, transportation, warehousing and energy, better-paying industries that tend to be dominated by blue-collar white men who have been particularly battered by shifts in the American economy.The mining industry, for example, continues to bleed jobs, with a loss of 19,000 in February, while manufacturing lost 16,000.And while employment has been advancing at a robust pace for more than two years, many workers continue to complain about low pay, or jobs beneath their skill levels.\u201cIf you look at many Trump voters, they generally are people who have not been winning economically for a long time as the country is diversifying,\u201d Ms. Tanden said. Whites without a college education provide the core of support for Mr. Trump.Still, if steady job growth continues and wages pick up in response to a tighter labor market, it could change views about the economy and influence the political dynamic. In previous elections, the direction of the economy in the months leading up to the vote has been perhaps the single most important factor affecting whether Americans opt for continuity or change.The brisk hiring since the Affordable Care Act went into effect also serves to undermine the Republican argument that the measure has stripped millions of jobs from the economy.\u201cOur businesses have created jobs every single month since I signed that \u2018job killing\u2019 Obamacare bill,\u201d for a total of 14.3 million private sector jobs, President Obama told reporters at the White House.Certainly, the law is spurring job creation in the health care industry, with 38,000 jobs added in February.Edward Fleischman, chief executive of the Execu/Search Group, a professional recruiting firm based in New York, said he had seen outsize demand for health care professionals, including urgent care physicians, nurses, therapists and technicians. \u201cA lot of that has to do with Obamacare,\u201d he said.Mr. Fleischman, whose firm opened three new offices last year, added that hiring \u2014 particularly for digitally adept workers \u2014 had been strong across the board.Friday\u2019s report is the first of three estimates of February\u2019s job creation by the Labor Department. Revisions for December and January showed a total of 30,000 more jobs than previously reported.William Spriggs, chief economist at the A.F.L.-C.I.O., contrasted the palpable dissatisfaction of many voters with the record of unbroken job creation. \u201cThis is one of those times when the economic cycle has hit a weird political cycle,\u201d he said.An earlier version of this article misstated the drop in the percentage of those too discouraged to search for work or making do with part-time work.

In China\u2019s authoritarian system, even small numbers of dissenting votes make a statement, such as when a third of the delegates voted against or abstained from approving the controversial Three Gorges Dam in 1992. The dam was still approved, though.The meetings also give journalists rare access to officials, both in organized news conferences and in impromptu stand-ups. Occasionally an unscripted comment shakes loose.N.P.C. delegates can also make proposals. Even if their ideas do not become legislation, they can provide a sense of which issues are of concern to the public, and within specific industries and regions.On Saturday, Premier Li Keqiang will produce his annual work report, which should give a target for how much the Chinese economy will grow over the next year. While economists have questioned the accuracy of China\u2019s official economic statistics, the numbers are expected to give a sense of how dramatically officials expect growth to decelerate.At the end of the session, the premier\u2019s closing news conference sometimes reveals insights into the leadership\u2019s thinking.Prime Minister Li Keqiang of China delivered his government's annual work report to the National People\u2019s Congress, the Communist Party-controlled legislature, on March 5. Here is a \u200bsearchable\u200b transcript of his speech.In recent days the Chinese news media has run articles discussing the importance of dissenting views from political advisers. While the Communist Party can be brutal in suppressing organized political dissent, the delegates can use their reports and suggestions to highlight areas of concern.Another body, the Chinese People\u2019s Political Consultative Conference, meets at the same time.

Starting with a computer company called Sahara, they have built an empire in mining, transportation, technology and media. They own a newspaper and television network which tend to offer favorable coverage of Mr. Zuma and the A.N.C.Some senior party leaders directly criticized Mr. Zuma on Thursday. \u201cTo those people who believe they still need to defend Zuma and have benefited from a close relationship with the Guptas, I appeal to them now to stand back,\u201d Barbara Hogan, a former minister of public enterprises under Mr. Zuma, said in call to a radio station.A day earlier, Mcebisi Jonas, the deputy finance minister, said in a statement that in a meeting with the Guptas in December they had offered him the job of finance minister. Mr. Jonas \u2014 who on Thursday drew statements of support from many high-ranking government officials \u2014 said he immediately rejected the offer.In December, a few days after the alleged offer to Mr. Jonas, Mr. Zuma removed a widely respected finance minister, Nhlanhla Nene, and replaced him with a little-known legislator, a decision that shocked the financial markets, sent the rand plummeting and also drew criticism from senior party members and businessmen. Critics of the decision said that, in appointing a pliable finance minister, Mr. Zuma was seeking to ease financing for public projects that would benefit the Guptas and other allies.Mr. Zuma was forced to reverse himself a few days later by removing his new finance minister and reappointing a well-regarded former finance minister, Pravin Gordhan, who had served from 2009 to 2014. Mr. Gordhan has spent the last three months trying to reassure investors and persuade credit-rating agencies not to downgrade South Africa\u2019s government debt to junk status.But analysts say that continuing doubts about governance in South Africa \u2014 as well as a drought and low commodity prices that have hurt its economy \u2014 will make it difficult for the nation to fend off an eventual downgrade.A day before Mr. Jonas\u2019s statement about the offer of a post, a former A.N.C. lawmaker, Vytjie Mentor, wrote on her Facebook page that the Guptas had offered her the position of minister of public enterprises in 2010. Ms. Mentor wrote that the offer was made in a meeting inside their house, in which Mr. Zuma was also present.The Gupta brothers, all in their 40s, have released statements denying the recent allegations. Mr. Zuma said he had no \u201crecollection\u201d of Ms. Mentor.In Parliament on Thursday, Mr. Zuma said he knew nothing about the alleged offer made by the Guptas to Mr. Jonas.\u201cIf Jonas says he was offered by the Guptas, I think you will be well placed to ask the Guptas, or Jonas,\u201d Mr. Zuma said, as members of his party cheered. \u201cDon\u2019t ask me.

{"Headline": "How Can Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders Both Be \u2018Populist\u2019?", "Date": "2016-03-22", "News": "Supported byFirst WordsThere was a time when \u201cpopulist\u201d meant something more specific. The word originated with the decidedly left-wing People\u2019s Party that emerged in the Midwest and the South amid the economic turmoil and rampant inequality of the 1890s. Journalists who knew some Latin started calling them \u201cPopulists\u201d as a shorthand, and the name stuck. Those uppercase Populists championed small farmers and wage-earners who thought \u201cthe money power\u201d \u2014 banks and industrial corporations \u2014 had seized control of both America\u2019s economy and its government. The party called for nationalizing the railroads, breaking up the trusts and strengthening labor unions. At times, their leftism toppled over into paranoia; to explain society\u2019s ills, they invoked \u201ca vast conspiracy against mankind,\u201d engineered by a plutocratic cabal.The Populists joined forces with the Democrats for the 1896 election and collapsed soon afterward. The word \u201cpopulist\u201d mostly disappeared into academic studies until the 1950s, when Joseph McCarthy, a previously obscure Republican senator from Wisconsin, rose to promi\u00adnence with his claims that Communists had infiltrated positions of power in the American government and military. Many targets of his rants were members of the East Coast liberal intelligentsia.Millions of Americans cheered on McCarthy\u2019s crusade \u2014 horrifying liberal intellectuals like the historian Richard Hofstadter and the sociologist Daniel Bell, who reached back to the precedent of the Populists to understand the roots of the new anti-elitist fervor. In McCarthy, they heard echoes of the original Populists\u2019 conspiracy theorizing \u2014 only this time, the perpetrators were well-born \u201cpinkos\u201d or \u201creds.\u201dOther scholars dismissed the comparison as deeply unfair, but Hofstadter\u2019s effort to link the Populists to what he called \u201cthe paranoid style\u201d of the new right resonated. And so \u201cpopulism\u201d began to morph into a handy tool of journalistic discourse.In the 1960s, the streets and airwaves were crowded with protesters of all ide\u00adolo\u00adgical persuasions who claimed to be fighting for the interests and values of a virtuous, exploited people against an immoral, grasping elite. \u201cPopulist\u201d became a handle applied to anyone who fought the powers that be, however they were defined. Wallace protested a federal order to integrate the University of Alabama by stating, \u201cThere can be no submission to the theory that the central government is anything but a servant of the people.\u201d On the left, young radicals vowed that with \u201cparticipatory democracy,\u201d they could topple racists like Wallace, along with the rest of \u201cthe power elite.\u201d Ralph Nader, then a liberal lawyer, stoked a revolt by consumers enraged at auto companies that increased their profits by concealing design flaws in their vehicles.Like Trump and Sanders today, \u201960s \u201cpopulists\u201d chose to blame elites for what ailed the nation. For Nader, it was greedy corporations and enabling politicians. For Wallace and Ronald Reagan, it was the federal state. These habits live on today. From the Tea Party to the fight for a $15-an-hour minimum wage, Americans keep turning their ire against institutions that appear to betray the promise of fair and equitable treatment of ordinary workers, homeowners or taxpayers. Sometimes, it seems, \u201cpopulism\u201d is just a synonym for widespread unhappiness with the status quo.Yet differences of language matter; they suggest what a candidate will seek to accomplish if he or she takes power. The 19th-century antecedent that Trump evokes in his nativist appeals to white working- and middle-class Americans is not the populism of the People\u2019s Party but rather that of the Know-Nothing Party of the 1850s, which similarly argued that immigrants were taking Americans\u2019 jobs and breaking the nation\u2019s laws. Trump\u2019s \u201cpopulism\u201d is a brilliant specimen of performance art but one that bears little resemblance, even in style, to the capital-P kind. The earnest activists from the People\u2019s Party of old brandished a lengthy blueprint for reform; Trump\u2019s personality overshadows his program. His canny lack of finesse finesses us all.And those who disparage \u201cpopulism\u201d in general neglect its salutary function. When populist talkers direct their outrage at elites, in government or business, who neglect the needs and betray the trust of ordinary citizens, they can perform a service to the nation. They train their language of discontent on those accused of betraying the core ideal of American democracy \u2014 one that is no less powerful because it can never be fully realized.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Fed Slows Down on Plans to Pursue Interest Rate Increases", "Date": "2016-03-16", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The Federal Reserve has once again pared its plans for raising interest rates, citing the weakness of the global economy as a reason for greater caution about the prospects for domestic growth.The Fed\u2019s policy-making committee voted not to raise its benchmark rate at a meeting that ended on Wednesday, although general expectations at the beginning of the year were for an increase this month. And it pulled back sharply from a December prediction that the rate would rise by one percentage point this year. Fed officials now expect to raise rates by just half a percentage point this year.Janet L. Yellen, the Fed\u2019s chairwoman, said the central bank remained relatively optimistic about the domestic economy, which she said had shown no signs of damage from the wobbles of financial markets or from weak global growth. But she said that prudence dictated caution.\u201cWhat you see here is a virtually unchanged path of economic projections and a slightly more accommodative path\u201d for monetary policy, Ms. Yellen told a news conference on Wednesday.The Fed\u2019s prolongation of its stimulus campaign pleased investors. The Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index rose sharply when the Fed made its announcement, and closed up 0.56 percent for the day. After a rough start to the year, the major stock gauges have nearly recouped their losses.The Fed entered the year planning to raise its benchmark rate about one percentage point, most likely in four quarter-point increments. Officials backed away from those plans after financial conditions tightened in January because of concerns about the health of the global economy.Officials said they were waiting to assess the impact of market turmoil on the broader economy.On Wednesday the Fed made clear that its plans had been delayed but not derailed. It issued a relatively upbeat assessment of economic conditions and affirmed plans to raise rates gradually.The statement did not clarify the timing of the Fed\u2019s next move. The committee next meets in April and June. Analysts and investors do not expect another rate increase until June.Ms. Yellen gave two principal reasons that the Fed was now planning to move more slowly.First, while the United States has outpaced other developed nations in recent years, Ms. Yellen said weak global growth posed a continuing threat.Lael Brainard, a Fed governor, argued in a recent speech that the Fed might be constrained in its ability to raise rates at a time when other major central banks are still engaged in aggressive stimulus campaigns. Ms. Yellen, asked about this assessment, acknowledged that such policies can weigh on domestic growth, for example by strengthening the dollar, which reduces demand for American goods overseas.Second, Ms. Yellen said, financial markets are doing some of the Fed\u2019s work. Tighter financial conditions, like increased borrowing costs faced by some corporations, are the effective equivalent of Fed rate increases.There was one dissent on Wednesday. Esther L. George, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, voted to raise rates by a quarter-point. The statement did not explain her reasons; she has said in recent speeches that higher rates are appropriate given the strength of domestic growth.Some analysts agree. \u201cWe remain of the view that the data will in due course force the Fed to raise rates faster than they or the markets expect,\u201d said Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics. \u201cDenial only works up the point where the data are unambiguously telling the opposite story; that point is not far off.\u201dThe plans for a slower climb are not a result of a change in the Fed\u2019s economic outlook. Officials at the central bank still expect the economy to expand at an annual rate of about 2 percent, and they still expect inflation to rise gradually, remaining below a 2 percent annual pace until 2018.But Ms. Yellen on Wednesday played down this evidence. She said price increases in some areas, such as clothing, had been \u201cunusually high\u201d in recent reports and might not signal a trend.\u201cI haven\u2019t yet concluded that we have seen any significant uptick that will be lasting,\u201d she said.Fed officials predicted that inflation this year would be 1.2 percent. That is lower than the government\u2019s most recent estimate of 1.3 percent through the 12 months ending in January, implying that the Fed expects inflation to rise more slowly.\u201cThe main message from the Fed today is that it is too early to worry about inflation,\u201d said Torsten Slok, chief international economist at Deutsche Bank Securities.The Fed also indicated that it saw room for improvement in the labor market. The median forecast by Fed officials is for the unemployment rate to fall to 4.5 percent in 2018, from the December median forecast of 4.7 percent.Ms. Yellen cited persistently weak wage growth as one reason.Ms. Yellen nonetheless described herself as \u201csomewhat surprised that we\u2019re not seeing more of a pickup in wage growth.\u201dShe said other labor market indicators also suggested the economy had yet to fully absorb the surplus of workers. The share of part-time workers who want full-time jobs remains high. And the share of adults participating in the labor force has increased in recent months as people who had stopped looking for work resume searching or move into new jobs.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Migrant Crisis Alters E.U. Calculations for Greece as Its Debt Struggle Continues", "Date": "2016-03-04", "News": "Supported byEight months after Greece agreed to do its part, it is the rest of Europe that is failing to muster the will to address a threat to the bloc\u2019s unity, this time the continued influx of migrants from the Middle East and beyond. And Greece, the main entry route for asylum seekers, has been largely left to fend for itself.\u201cWe are now in the situation where Greece is essentially becoming a holding pen for refugees and is being asked to solve a problem created by other countries,\u201d said Jens Bastian, an economics consultant based in Athens and a former member of the European Commission\u2019s task force on Greece. \u201cYou are basically putting the management of Europe\u2019s migrant crisis at the doorstep of Greece.\u201dBut if the situation is generating more despair in an already battered nation, it also holds the potential for Mr. Tsipras to exert new leverage over the rest of Europe \u2014 with a possible ally in Ms. Merkel, long seen in Greece as a usurper of Greek sovereignty and a dispenser of economic punishment.Perhaps more than any other European leader, Ms. Merkel, who continues to welcome refugees from Syria and Iraq to Germany despite intense opposition at home and among other governments, needs a deal to defuse the migrant problem. She would find her job that much tougher if Greece deteriorates further into humanitarian and political crisis.With Mrs. Merkel angered by decisions in Austria and nine other countries to tighten their borders, trapping tens of thousands of migrants in Greece, \u201cthis creates an opportunity for a closer alliance between Athens and Berlin,\u201d said Mujtaba Rahman, the head of European analysis at the Eurasia Group in London. The refugee crisis \u201ccould win Greece some bailout flexibility,\u201d he said.Some members of Mr. Tsipras\u2019s fragile coalition government have also hinted they would like creditors to reduce some of Greece\u2019s debt in exchange for Greece bearing the burden of warehousing the migrants Europe will not allow in.There is little outward sign that European leaders are willing to link the two issues and let up on requirements in last summer\u2019s bailout plan for deep budget cuts and painful overhauls of many elements of the economy. Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble, the German finance minister, warned on Thursday in a speech at the London School of Economics that the refugee crisis did not mean Greece could relax its fiscal efforts.\u201cOf course, there is a new situation, the refugee crisis, and therefore Greece needs beyond all discussion additional solidarity,\u201d he said. \u201cThis does not mean that Greece should not continue to work to regain competitiveness.\u201dBut Mr. Tsipras\u2019s challenge remains substantial, with political opponents coming at him from the far left and right.The economy has continued to weaken since last summer, when Greece imposed capital controls during turbulent negotiations with its European Union creditors for a new bailout in exchange for accepting harsh austerity terms.Despite tentative signs that the worst was over, the economy has continued to contract after Mr. Tsipras imposed new taxes and began cutting pensions further to comply with the terms of the bailout. Greece\u2019s overall unemployment rate has been stuck above 25 percent for more than two years, while the number of young people without jobs remains near 50 percent.Mr. Tsipras\u2019s biggest immediate challenge is to complete an overhaul of the near-bankrupt pension system, without which Greece cannot move forward in talks with creditors on sorely needed debt relief. The pressure from creditors has sparked raucous street protests in recent weeks. The creditors have also delayed disbursing billions of euros in new bailout funds, citing slow progress by Mr. Tsipras\u2019s government in implementing the austerity measures.Throughout last year, the government had effectively waved through migrants \u2014 almost none of whom wanted to stay in the economically moribund country \u2014 to Germany and other prosperous nations where they wanted asylum. But when the nations along the migrant trail decided to constrain the flow of people, the rest of Europe warned Greece that it could be kicked out of the Schengen system of passport-free travel if it did not exercise control over its borders.At the same time, he has hardened his position with Europe, demanding this week that the European Union \u201cexplicitly recognize that Greece cannot assume all the responsibility by itself,\u201d and demanding sanctions for countries that do not take their share of refugees under a Europe-wide relocation plan that has so far been a flop.\u201cThe one thing he can\u2019t let happen is for migrants and refugees to be left out in the open, where they become not only vulnerable to extremists, but turn into a focal point for the far right to try and rally support,\u201d he said.In a peculiar reversal, analysts say, Mr. Tsipras\u2019s greatest hope may lie with Mrs. Merkel, who has steadfastly admonished other countries not to let Greece \u201cplunge into chaos,\u201d and rebuked Austria and the nine Balkan states that shut their borders.\u201cDo you seriously believe that all the euro states that last year fought all the way to keep Greece in the eurozone \u2014 and we were the strictest \u2014 can one year later allow Greece to, in a way, plunge into chaos?\u201d she said in a weekend interview with the public broadcaster ARD.Yet on the streets of Athens, few are buying talk of European solidarity.\u201cThis just shows you how not-united Europe is,\u201d said Jackie Rogers, a Briton who has lived in Greece for nearly 40 years, sweeping her eyes over migrants scrambling for donated food, water and clothing at Victoria Square in central Athens.\u201cI think it suits northern European nations who don\u2019t want the problem in their backyard to use Greece as a dumping ground.\u201dPrashant Rao contributed reporting from London.Advertisement"}

He was taken to a federal police station, but he was not arrested or charged. He was released after about three hours of questioning, which he later derided as a \u201cmedia show.\u201dThe move against Mr. da Silva raises serious questions about his political future and the ambitions of the governing Workers\u2019 Party to retain the presidency. As recently as last week, he defiantly signaled in public statements that he planned to run for president again in 2018.\u201cThey\u2019re going to have to defeat me on the street,\u201d he told supporters at a party celebrating the anniversary of the party, founded 36 years ago, during Brazil\u2019s military dictatorship. \u201cI\u2019ll be 72, but as hot and ready to go as a man of 30.\u201dGroups of Mr. da Silva\u2019s opponents and supporters squared off in front of his home in S\u00e3o Paulo on Friday, shouting insults at one another. A man in a red shirt, the signature color of the Workers\u2019 Party, was captured on television punching another man amid the confusion.\u201cNo one is exempt from the investigations,\u201d said Carlos Fernando Lima, a prosecutor at the helm of the inquiry. He said Mr. da Silva and his foundation had received the equivalent of about $7.8 million from construction companies seeking government contracts, including funds for speeches and the improvements at the luxury properties.\u201cWe are analyzing evidence that the ex-president and his family received advantages in return for actions inside the government,\u201d Mr. Lima added.The former chief executive of OAS has been sentenced in connection with a bribery plot involving Petrobras, and the billionaire former chief of Odebrecht has been charged and jailed pending trial.Mr. da Silva has denied owning the properties refurbished by the construction companies, and delivered an angry rebuke on Friday after his release from questioning, calling the episode the combination of a \u201cmedia show\u201d and a \u201cfireworks spectacle.\u201dSome of his most prominent supporters went further. Maria do Ros\u00e1rio Nunes, a congresswoman and former minister of human rights, said his detention was part of a \u201cnefarious conspiracy.\u201dVarious confidants of the former president are already in prison on corruption charges, including Jos\u00e9 Dirceu de Oliveira e Silva, his former chief of staff.

{"Headline": "Let Trump Make Our Trans-Pacific Trade Deal", "Date": "2016-03-16", "News": "Supported byWhat if the United States had had a truly savvy deal maker like Donald Trump negotiate the Trans-Pacific Partnership free-trade accord instead of the wimpy Obama team? I mean, be honest, folks, would you let Barack Obama sell your house? I\u2019ve researched the deal and concluded Trump would have gotten us this:He would have begun by saying \u201ca baby could figure out\u201d that since 80 percent of the goods from our 11 TPP partners come into our country duty-free already, and so much of our stuff is still hit with tariffs in their countries, if we eliminate 18,000 tariffs we\u2019ll be able to keep more production at home and sell more abroad. \u201cWe\u2019ll export so much we\u2019ll actually get tired of exporting,\u201d Trump would say.After all, America\u2019s total manufacturing output was nearing an all-time high at the end of 2015. True, it was with more robots and fewer people, but we\u2019ve still created nearly 900,000 manufacturing jobs since 2010 because we have cheap energy, skilled workers and good rule of law. Our workers can compete if we level the playing field, so Trump would have told opponents of the trade deal, \u201cJust do the math, people.\u201d Our average applied tariff is already only 1.5 percent while the tariffs of these Pacific countries can range much higher \u2014 Vietnam has peak tariffs of over 50 percent on cars and machines \u2014 so if we get rid of those tariffs our exporters are poised to benefit.Since Trump cares about blue-collar workers, unlike the elitist Obama, he\u2019d have demanded that in return for free access to our markets the 11 other TPP countries had to agree, some for the first time, to freedom for their workers to form independent trade unions, to elect their own labor leaders, to collectively bargain and to eliminate all child and forced labor practices. He\u2019d also have insisted that they adopt laws on minimum wages, hours of work and occupational safety and health, again, precisely to level the playing field with U.S. workers.Trump would also have required that the deal prohibit all customs duties for digital products, make sure companies did not have to share source codes in order to get into new markets and ensure free access for all cloud computing services in all TPP countries \u2014 all areas of growing U.S. strength.Trump, because he respects women, surely would have demanded that this deal require all signatories \u2014 especially Malaysia \u2014 to take real steps to halt human trafficking from such countries as Thailand, Myanmar and Bangladesh and require each signatory to improve access for human rights groups to assist victims of trafficking. If you don\u2019t comply, you lose your trade benefits. (Trump\u2019s no sucker for a wink and a smile.)Moreover, Trump would have made sure that the accord, in a first for any trade deal, put restrictions on state-owned companies that compete with our private businesses, like Vietnam\u2019s oil company. These state-owned companies often get special benefits that enable them to undercut our companies. Trump\u2019s trade deal would also have been the first requiring criminal penalties for stealing our industrial secrets.\u201cNo more ripping off America,\u201d Trump would have said.He certainly would have insisted on strong intellectual property protections for America\u2019s software industry, one of our greatest export assets, and taken an approach to pharmaceuticals that splits the difference between what the big drug companies want in the way of intellectual property protection time for their products and what the generic manufacturers want. Everybody would have gotten something but nobody would have gotten everything. It\u2019s called \u201cthe art of the deal,\u201d folks!Trump would also surely have required that all signatories combat trafficking in endangered wildlife parts, like elephant tusks and rhino horns, and end all their subsidies that stimulate overfishing.And Trump, who has a lot of Chinese restaurants in his hotels, would know that if we walk away from the TPP all our friends in the Pacific will just sign up for China\u2019s R.C.E.P., or Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership, which will set trade rules in Asia and include weak intellectual property protections, no labor or environmental protections and no disciplines on state-owned industries.You don\u2019t know that because Trump doesn\u2019t know it himself; because Bernie Sanders knows it and doesn\u2019t want to tell you; and because Hillary Clinton knows it but, sadly, won\u2019t tell you, choosing instead to play \u201cBernie Lite.\u201d (Remind me how that worked out for her in Michigan.)No trade deal is perfect. No single deal will save every job or remake our economy. And we must be more generous in caring for workers hurt by trade. But we also have to recognize that smart deals, like the TPP, help keep us the most efficient and innovative economy in the world and strengthen our security alliances \u2014 as opposed to abandoning our allies to regimes that don\u2019t support our values.Thank goodness we had a former community organizer negotiating for us.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Art Basel Hong Kong Opens to Less Frenzy", "Date": "2016-03-23", "News": "Supported byIn the three years since they began buying art, Mr. Lin, a Beijing-based collector, and his wife, Wanwan Lei, both 28, have built up a collection at lightning speed, acquiring more than 300 works. But at the V.I.P. preview of the Hong Kong art fair on Tuesday, neither Mr. Lin nor Ms. Lei was in the mood to make any quick decisions. Indeed, some dealers noted that the overall atmosphere seemed more muted than last year\u2019s, with fewer collectors in attendance, especially from Europe and North America, and less frenzied first-day buying \u2014 not entirely unexpected, given the recent economic slowdown in China.By the end of Friday, some dealers were reporting strong sales. David Zwirner, which is planning to open a gallery in Asia, presented a booth of mostly figurative paintings, including five works by Micha\u00ebl Borremans made especially for the fair. All five were bought by Asian collectors, including the Long Museum in Shanghai, at prices ranging from $250,000 to $1.6 million.And Leo Xu Projects, a Shanghai gallery, reported that it had sold eight works by the Chinese artist Cui Jie for between $7,700 and $28,000 in the first 30 minutes of the V.I.P. preview.Mr. Lin is one of a number of rising young collectors from mainland China, a group that dealers describe as motivated, well informed and with more adventurous taste than the older generation of Chinese collectors.Mr. Lin\u2019s personal collection, for example, includes works by Tracey Emin and John Currin, but also less established artists like Richard Lin, Ouyang Chun, Firenze Lai and Charles Harlan. Recently, Mr. Lin and Ms. Lei, who earned a graduate degree in arts administration at Columbia University, have taken a keen interest in old masters.\u201cThis feels fresh to me,\u201d Mr. Lin said as he leaned in to inspect one work, a pigment trace on cement of a ceremonial building in India.It was the closest Mr. Lin came to buying anything on Tuesday. For the next four hours, he; Ms. Lei; and Presca Ahn, the American director of their museum, merely took in the show.The recent slowdown of the Chinese economy appears to have put a damper on art buying by all mainland collectors, regardless of their age, with total sales in the Chinese market having dropped 23 percent, to $11.8 billion in 2015, according to the Tefaf report. Last year, Britain supplanted China as the second-largest market for art sales, after the United States, the report found.While dealers say the economic slowdown has been most acutely felt by the auction houses, the final results from Art Basel Hong Kong are still being looked to as an important measure of the state of the art market in Asia.On the whole, there was a sense among dealers and collectors that the quality of the works at the Hong Kong fair, which this year included 239 galleries, was stronger than in previous years.Highlights among Western galleries included Hauser & Wirth, which brought \u201cSpider Couple,\u201d a mammoth bronze Louise Bourgeois sculpture from 2003, and Alexander Calder\u2019s 1967 mobile \u201cMorning Cobweb.\u201d Marianne Boesky Gallery presented a solo exhibition of Frank Stella, including a 13-foot-tall wooden star.Hauser & Wirth said it was in talks with an Asian museum about the Bourgeois sculpture. The gallery sold a number of works, including a Mark Bradford painting for $1.5 million as well as an Alexander Calder painting for an undisclosed amount.\u201cWe decided to bring a different kind of booth this year, big pieces centered around the theme \u2018spider,\u2019 so we were expecting this year to be more about education than sales,\u201d said Neil Wenman, senior director at Hauser & Wirth in London. \u201cBut we are very happy about the sales too. We were really able to connect with a different level of collector in Asia.\u201dAsian galleries also made a strong showing, with Eslite Gallery from Taiwan presenting a solo show of David Diao. For its first show at the fair, the Beijing-based Ink Studio brought a booth devoted to the Chinese artist Li Huasheng.\u201cThe fair has had a reputation for being a dumping ground for galleries,\u201d said Adeline Ooi, Asia director for Art Basel. \u201cBut that\u2019s changing, and people are taking our clientele seriously.\u201dAlthough Mr. Lin, who grew up in Beijing and studied in Singapore and Britain, declined to say how much he had invested in art since 2013, he projected that he would spend about $3 million this year. To set up M Woods, which opened to the public in 2014, he estimated his outlay at about $1.5 million.He said that some of that money had been lent to him by his parents, both onetime members of the military who are now in business. But he said that most of his wealth had come from a luxury-brand public relations company he founded and from real estate investments.\u201cSome people might think I\u2019m just doing this because I have money and am looking for a hobby,\u201d Mr. Lin said, taking a break to drink some coconut water at the fair. \u201cBut for me, art is no longer just a hobby. Art has become an undertaking for me. I might make decisions quickly, but it truly is something that I love.\u201dAdvertisement"}

No longer can you be sure that a large swell of young working-age people will enrich your country, as they did a generation ago in East Asia. \u201cYou can\u2019t just say, \u2018Hey look, I\u2019ve got a youth bulge, it\u2019s going to be great,\u2019 \u201d said Charles J. Kenny, an economist at the Washington-based Center for Global Development. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to have an economy ready to respond.\u201d\u201cIt is the big development challenge these countries face \u2014 more decent jobs,\u201d he added.A case in point are the caste protests that paralyzed a prospering North Indian state in recent weeks. They were driven by a powerful landowning caste whose sons can neither support themselves through farming nor secure the jobs of their choice. So the protesters took to the streets demanding caste-based quotas for government posts. They blocked rail lines and set trucks on fire; the police say 30 people died in the unrest.This is just part of India\u2019s staggering challenge. Every year, the country must create an estimated 12 million to 17 million jobs.Youth unemployment is especially striking in richer countries. Across Europe, youth unemployment is 25 percent, not just because of a sluggish economy but because many young Europeans don\u2019t have the skills for the jobs available, from electricians to home health aides; it explains in part the surge of anti-immigrant sentiment on the Continent. In the United States, nearly 17 percent of those between the ages of 16 and 29 are neither in school nor working.That does not bode well. An increase in youth unemployment is a better predictor of social unrest than virtually any other factor, warned Raymond Torres, the Labour Organization\u2019s research chief. \u201cThe social contract is weakened because of unfulfilled promises,\u201d he said.In some ways, the global demographic portrait reflects what we are doing right: Our babies are far less likely to die, and our grandparents live longer. Women have fewer children, and die less often in childbirth. More good news: Primary school enrollment has shot up in the developing world. In India, for instance, nearly all children are enrolled in school.What\u2019s more, even modest education fuels ambition. Yet it can also frustrate those who can\u2019t find work. Across the Middle East, where authoritarian rulers invested in education, youth unemployment is soaring \u2014 along with unrest.\u201cA demographic arbitrage between aging societies with a shrinking work force and youthful societies would be good thing, if the whole thing could be managed,\u201d he said.Many politicians are making the opposite case. Just last week, Donald Tusk, the president of the European Council, told migrants not to come to Europe, which has sought to stanch the flow by offering development aid to the migrants\u2019 home countries.Perhaps most worrisome for some societies is the bachelor gap.Little surprise then that the recent caste protests in India took place in Haryana, the state with the sharpest gender imbalance in the nation, with 879 women for every 1,000 men in the population. This lopsidedness stems from a disdain for daughters. Technology and rising incomes have allowed expecting couples to pay for illegal sex determination tests, and female fetuses are often aborted. A result is a surplus of young men, making it necessary to import brides from other parts of the country.And so the parable of our times may really be: Mind your daughters, or your future will come to ruin.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How Iran\u2019s Reformists Found Their Center", "Date": "2016-03-04", "News": "Supported byOp-Ed ContributorFOR decades, Iran\u2019s politics have centered on a contest of visions that pitted democratic reformists against hard-line theocrats. Under President Hassan Rouhani, that binary has begun to give way. Last week\u2019s elections showcased a coordinated movement toward the center of Iran\u2019s political spectrum.This reflects not only the ascendancy of Mr. Rouhani\u2019s centrist faction, whose priorities are not civic empowerment or human rights so much as diplomatic and economic re-engagement with the world. It also reflects a transformation within the reformist camp. Today\u2019s reformists are the left wing of a muted coalition. They navigate a world of lowered expectations and play by rules that demand ingenuity and patience.Reform, in earlier times, was a visionary movement for democratic development. Together with his brain trust of luminaries and strategists, the reformist president Mohammad Khatami held the country\u2019s first direct elections for local government in 1999, and made the security establishment accountable for some of its most flagrant human rights abuses. His movement was embattled from the start, then stymied. Later it was criminalized as a seditious conspiracy. But Mr. Khatami remained perhaps the most enduringly popular figure in Iranian politics.By the time of last week\u2019s election, Iranian news media was forbidden to publish Mr. Khatami\u2019s image or to quote his words. Still, he managed to circulate a video on social media. Reformists and pragmatic centrists had endorsed lists of candidates for Parliament and the Assembly of Experts, the clerical body that will most likely select Iran\u2019s next supreme leader. In his video, Mr. Khatami conveyed a simple message: Anyone who cared about reform should vote for every name on both lists. \u201cI repeat,\u201d he said, \u201cevery name on both lists.\u201d Voters took the message seriously. The reformist-centrist lists achieved a stunning victory.In today\u2019s centrist climate, Mr. Khatami made no promises and offered no vision. What he advocated was a strategy: Every name on both lists, he had to repeat, because the lists included some unsavory characters, like the former intelligence minister Mohammad Reyshahri, popularly known as \u201cthe scary ayatollah\u201d and associated with political executions in the 1980s. But voting for everyone on both lists, reformist and centrist political operatives had determined, was the best and probably the only way to defeat the hardest of the hard-liners who obstructed Mr. Rouhani\u2019s agenda.The defeat of these hard-liners, some of them closely associated with the supreme leader, was a rebuke to those who stood in the way of the nuclear deal, tarred the allies of the popular president as foreign stooges and promised to block foreign investment in the newly opening economy. For the first time in at least eight years, the Parliament will be substantially new, with neither a clear majority nor fixed partisan lines.This election was not a victory for reform. Reform was not on the ballot, though some reformists were. Even if every one of them prevailed, they could not produce visionary change as a minority in Parliament. But by ticking off \u201cevery name on the list,\u201d pro-reform voters effectively opened a bottleneck. Like the election that brought Mr. Rouhani to the presidency in 2013, this vote was a victory for pragmatism \u2014 as a political faction, but more significantly as a frame of mind.Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, a pugnacious hard-liner, succeeded Mr. Khatami as president. The contrast between them appears to illustrate the extremities possible under Iran\u2019s Islamic Republic, even though Mr. Khatami\u2019s reformists were nobody\u2019s extremists. They advocated an incremental process of internal change \u2014 evolution, not revolution, they liked to say, toward greater pluralism in thought, politics and even religion.But their vision challenged the hard-liners\u2019 strongly held beliefs about the fundamental nature of the Islamic state. For this reason, among others, the reformist project ran up against the security establishment. Under Mr. Ahmadinejad, particularly in his second term, Iran was governed with a heavy, forceful hand by a faction more in harmony with the security services and in open conflict with civil society. Both presidencies were defined by a zero-sum contest for political survival.Iran\u2019s pragmatic centrists offer a way around that deadlock. They seek to harness the popularity of the reformists to the institutional power of the conservatives, and to define a national interest on which the most temperate elements of both camps can agree. This approach holds out hope for a more constructive and inclusive politics, and for real improvement in Iran\u2019s material circumstances and its standing among nations. But it also comes with dangers: that the center will be defined increasingly rightward, as it has been throughout the life of the Islamic Republic, and that important but controversial reformist priorities \u2014 human rights, representative politics and the rule of law \u2014 will languish beyond the pale of political expediency. The reformists risk sacrificing their identity in this coalition; outside of it, they sacrifice their relevance.Iran\u2019s revolution is a work in progress. Its protagonists and its factional alliances are protean. Yesterday\u2019s hard-liners are today\u2019s pragmatists. Today\u2019s reformists were something else yesterday. The way Iranians vote \u2014 whether they see voting as an expression of support for the system, a demand for sweeping revision, a meaningful exercise of political choice or a strategic tool \u2014 is in constant flux. The demand for inclusion is raucous, relentless, life giving. The centrists must not take it for granted, for they owe it all their strength.Laura Secor is the author of \u201cChildren of Paradise: The Struggle for the Soul of Iran.\u201dAdvertisement"}

He beseeched people desperate for a better life to please help Europe by staying away. He once again asked Turkey, already hosting more than two million refugees from the Syria war, to please help Europe by keeping them away.Though Mr. Tusk\u2019s speech was directed at economic migrants \u2014 rather than those fleeing war in Syria and Iraq \u2014 he was effectively signaling Europe\u2019s determined turn away from Chancellor Angela Merkel\u2019s more open approach to welcoming migrants. The German chancellor has stood by her policy of accepting legitimate refugees, while much of the rest of Europe is increasingly resisting.On Thursday, Mr. Tusk also visited Turkey hoping that it could be persuaded to do more to help. He urged the prime minister, Ahmet Davutoglu, to do more to slow the human exodus \u2014 and to be prepared to accept the return of those who make it to Greece but cannot obtain the right to remain in Europe.\u201cThe refugee flows still remain far too high,\u201d Mr. Tusk said. \u201cTo many in Europe the most promising method seems to be a fast and large-scale mechanism to ship back irregular migrants arriving in Greece \u2014 it would effectively break the business model of the smugglers.\u201dEach day last month, on average, 1,918 migrants entered the Aegean Islands, according to new statistics from the International Organization for Migration.Policies put in place by a number of countries along the path from Greece to Germany, the preferred destination for most migrants, have effectively limited passage across the borders to Syrians and Iraqis while blocking the progress of Afghans and people from a number of Middle Eastern countries and North Africa.On Thursday, 200 people occupied the train tracks on the border near Idomeni, holding signs saying \u201cMerkel, Help Us\u201d and \u201cWe Just Want to Pass.\u201d Aid agencies warned of a possible risk of infectious diseases, given the area\u2019s limited resources.Over the past few days, Mr. Tusk, a former prime minister of Poland, has made a sort of reverse pilgrimage along the so-called Western Balkans migration route, visiting Austria, Slovenia, Croatia and Macedonia and Greece before reaching Turkey. \u201cGreece and the Greek people are paying a very high price for the problem they themselves did not create,\u201d Mr. Tusk said. \u201cI want to state here very clearly that the European Union will not leave Greece alone.\u201dMr. Davutoglu reiterated calls for the creation of a \u201csecure zone\u201d in Syria where migrants could be free from the violence that has torn the country apart over the last five years. \u201cThis is not just a problem for Greece or Turkey,\u201d he said.The migration crisis continued to show itself to be a flash point across the Continent on Thursday.His comments widened a recent rift between Ms. Merkel and her Austrian counterpart, Werner Faymann. Mr. Faymann wants to cap the number of migrants who can apply for asylum to 80 a day and those who can move through Austria to other countries to 3,200 a day.James Kanter reported from Brussels, and Sewell Chan from London.

{"Headline": "House Hunting in ... Spain", "Date": "2016-03-30", "News": "Supported byInternational Real Estate16 PhotosAN EIGHT-BEDROOM APARTMENT IN THE CENTER OF BILBAO The apartment building was designed by the architect Gregorio Ibarreche for one of Bilbao\u2019s wealthiest families of the time, according to Pablo Gul\u00edas, the managing director of Engel & V\u00f6lkers Bilbao, which is listing the apartment. This 5,350-square-foot apartment is on the third floor of the building. The unit\u2019s style is very British, with wood paneling in most rooms, Mr. Gul\u00edas said. The floors are chestnut wood, which was common in luxury apartments built before 1960 in Bilbao, he said.The apartment features spacious rooms and 10-foot ceilings throughout. The layout follows a classic European style, with large separated living and dining rooms, connected to the bedrooms by a long hallway. The kitchen is also separate, reflecting that it was traditionally used by the service staff, Mr. Gul\u00edas said. There is a room designated as an office.There are three master bedrooms with private bathrooms; the largest is 215 square feet and includes a walk-in closet. The living room, the office and one of the bedrooms have small balconies overlooking the square. The furniture is not included in the asking price, but it is available for sale, Mr. Gul\u00edas said.A separate \u201cmini-apartment\u201d with a bedroom, a small living room and a bathroom was traditionally used for staff. There are also a separate elevator and an entrance for staff, as well as a storeroom in the basement.The apartment was extensively renovated seven years ago, which included new wiring, plumbing and painting. The building\u2019s facade has also been repaired and repainted in recent years, Mr. Gul\u00edas said. The apartment does not include parking, but spaces are available for rent or purchase in the area, Mr. Gul\u00edas said. A doorman is on duty from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m.It is rare for large apartments in this building to come on the market, Mr. Gul\u00edas said. None of the apartments of this size have been sold in the building in the last 10 years, and several apartments similar to this one have been divided into smaller apartments, he said.A big draw for buyers is the neighborhood, Mr. Gul\u00edas said. Many of Bilbao\u2019s finest restaurants, landmark buildings and parks are within easy walking distance. The streets are lined with small shops and cafes. It is about a five-minute walk to Moy\u00faa Square, where there is a metro stop, and the city\u2019s main shopping district. From the apartment, it is a short drive to the surrounding mountains and the waterfront communities on the Bay of Bilbao. The apartment is about 10 miles from Bilbao\u2019s international airport.MARKET OVERVIEW\u201cIt is clear that demand is up, mortgage lending is growing, and the price of property that people actually want to buy is stable or rising,\u201d said Mark St\u00fccklin, the founder of Spanish Property Insight, a consultancy tracking the market. \u201cHowever, there is still a vast glut of homes built in the wrong place for which there is little demand.\u201dThe property market in the Basque Country is \u201cone of the healthiest in Spain,\u201d Mr. St\u00fccklin said. \u201cThe local economy is strong by Spanish standards, unemployment is relatively low, and the hangover from the building-boom years was more manageable,\u201d he said. The market is also less reliant on foreign demand, which disappeared in many areas in the wake of the global recession.In Bilbao, prices dropped sharply from 2012 through 2014, even while many markets around the world bounced back, Mr. Gul\u00edas said. The average price paid for a home in Bilbao fell 23.5 percent from 2012 to the end of 2014, from 3,090 euros a square meter, or about $322 a square foot, to 2,363 euros a square meter, or $246 a square foot, Mr. Gul\u00edas said. But while final figures are not available for 2015, data for the first three quarters of the year suggests prices have started to stabilize, he said.Although prices remain low, the number of sales increased by more than 10 percent last year, agents said.\u201c2012, 2013 and 2014 were terrible years for the real estate business in Bilbao and Basque Country, but after 2015 the situation is going up, definitely,\u201d said Fernando Renteria, an agent with Puerto Banus Properties, a real estate agency with offices in Marbella and Bilbao.Activity and interest vary in different neighborhoods, agents said. Luxury homes on the outskirts of the city, closer to the waterfront and the Bay of Biscay, are particularly popular these days, Mr. Renteria said.The Ensanche is considered one of the most expensive areas in Bilbao. There has been less fluctuation in prices in the area, where demand is high for the older apartments, Mr. Gul\u00edas said. Around the Guggenheim, there are several new modern apartment buildings, which are also drawing buyers.WHO BUYS IN BILBAOBilbao doesn\u2019t attract the same number of international buyers as Spain\u2019s resort cities, agents say. But its status as a financial center, the local culture and the beauty of the surrounding area entice buyers from around the world.In recent years, there has been an increase in buyers from Russia and Latin America, but the largest numbers of international buyers are from France, Britain, the United States and Germany, Mr. Renteria said.The many international corporations with offices in Bilbao attract buyers, and nearby country properties are popular as second homes. But most international buyers these days are looking for homes as an investment, Mr. Renteria said.BUYING BASICSInternational buyers should find few surprises in Spain\u2019s transaction system. A notary oversees the process and can research the title and any liens that might exist on the property. Hiring a lawyer is not required, but it is a good idea to help with translations and nuances that might arise in the purchase, agents said.WEBSITESLANGUAGES AND CURRENCIESSpanish, Basque; euro (1 euro = $1.12)TAXES AND FEESThe biggest additional cost of buying a home in Spain is a transfer tax, which is usually between 7 percent and 10 percent of the purchase price, agents said. Agent fees range from 3 percent to 8 percent and are usually paid by the seller. Annual property taxes are generally 0.4 percent to 1.1 percent of the property\u2019s appraised value. There is a monthly maintenance fee of 318 euros, or about $356, on this apartment. The estimated property tax on the apartment is about 2,000 euros, or around $2,240, a year, Mr. Gulias said.CONTACTAdvertisement"}

Wall Street\u2019s health reverberates throughout the city and state economies; profits are on the line for luxury retailers, restaurants, real estate firms and even auto dealers.Already New York State has cut its forecast for this year\u2019s bonus pool for finance and insurance jobs in the state, now predicting a 2.5 percent drop.Securities industry profit fell 10.5 percent last year, to $14.3 billion, the lowest since 2011.Thomas P. DiNapoli, the state comptroller, said recent job gains might not be sustainable, given the early weakness in the financial markets and increasing provisions for bad loans to energy sector companies. \u201cBoth the state and city budgets depend heavily on the securities industry, and lower profits could mean fewer industry jobs and less tax revenue,\u201d he said.A number of banks have been cutting jobs in trading as markets have become volatile, and pay trends reflect the relative strength of individual businesses. Incentive pay fell 10 to 20 percent for fixed-income division employees last year, according to estimates from Johnson Associates, and pay for equities employees rose as much as 10 percent, for example.Wall Street has also been adjusting to new regulations that force it to take on less risk, eating into profit margins.Mr. DiNapoli has released the numbers each year as lawmakers in the state capital take up budgeting for the next fiscal year. For every job on Wall Street, two are created elsewhere in the economy, according to the comptroller\u2019s office. The average salary, including bonuses, for securities industry employees in New York City rose 14 percent in 2014 to $404,800, which is a record. Data for 2015 is not yet available.The numbers, based on personal income tax withholding data, provide a snapshot of trends affecting Wall Street during the heart of its traditional bonus payout season, which runs from December through March. The securities industry accounted for 22 percent of private sector wages paid in New York City in 2014 even though it made up just 5 percent of private sector jobs.Over all, employment in the industry ticked up 2.7 percent last year, to 172,400, the second-consecutive year of growth and the highest number of employed people since the financial crisis, despite the fact that Wall Street as an industry is still 8 percent smaller than before 2008.The estimates do not distinguish between cash bonuses and stock-based awards that vest over multiple years. The numbers reflect cash bonuses and deferred compensation for which taxes have been withheld; they do not include stock options.The size of the average bonus had been on the rise in 2012 and 2013 before dropping 6 percent in 2014 and again last year. Still, they are far lower than the recent peak of $191,360 in 2006.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Migrants Lament as Deal With Turkey Closes Door to Europe", "Date": "2016-03-19", "News": "Supported byIZMIR, Turkey \u2014 Smoking cigarettes and huddling against the midnight chill, a group of Syrian men sat outside a mosque waiting for a smuggler\u2019s call. It was their last chance, they said, to reach Europe.It was late Friday, hours after they watched news reports from cafes and hotel lobbies that the Europe Union and Turkey had struck a deal that would send refugees from war-torn countries back to Turkey, from the shores of Greece. Time was running short: Officials said the deal would take effect Sunday.\u201cOne hour ago,\u201d said Milad Ameen, 19, when asked when he decided to set off for Europe. He had a life jacket, an inner tube and small bag containing his passport and school certificates he hoped would help him land a job in Europe.As the men waited, they lamented a deal that they believe shuts the door on the last way out of their misery. \u201cIt\u2019s for Turkey\u2019s good, but not for the good of the Syrian people,\u201d Mr. Ameen said.A man standing next to him, who gave only his first name, Raafat, said he was from Aleppo, Syria. Raafat said he was demoralized that Europe no longer seemed to welcome Syrians. When he heard news of the pending deal, he rushed from Istanbul, where he had worked in a textile factory, to this coastal city. \u201cWe aren\u2019t going to Europe to destroy Europe,\u201d he said, explaining that he wished to assimilate and learn the language in whichever country would take him. \u201cWe are going in peace.\u201dJust then, a Turkish man, presumably a smuggler\u2019s agent, approached and said, \u201cIt\u2019s time to go,\u201d and they were off.By the next afternoon, they had returned to Izmir, their European dreams dashed, after being interdicted by the Turkish authorities. As of Saturday afternoon, worries of a mass exodus of refugees crossing the choppy Aegean Sea from Turkey to Greece had not materialized.Many have tried, though, and some said they would make one last effort on Saturday night. Turkish authorities said that a large-scale operation, involving the coast guard, the police and the military, including the use of helicopters, had resulted in the detention of 1,734 migrants and 16 smugglers on Friday along the Aegean coast.While many migrants were seized at beaches or on the sea, others were rounded up from hotels and streets and taken in for questioning to determine their backgrounds, nationalities and plans to travel to Europe, according to a statement from the Turkish military.For Europe, the deal with Turkey offers its best chance to contain a crisis that has roiled the Continent, and upended its politics amid a surge in popularity of anti-immigration parties. For Turkey, the deal offered the prospect of resuming talks to join the European Union, billions of dollars in aid and visa-free travel for Turks.For Syrians, though, as well as Iraqis, Afghans and other refugees from countries in chaos, who saw Europe as their last, best hope, the pact was disheartening.For them, there is a sense that Europe, so welcoming last summer, is betraying them, and that Turkey is benefiting on the backs of their misery.\u201cIt\u2019s a good deal for Turkey, but it harms the Syrian people,\u201d said Issi Adam, 30, from Aleppo, who had tried to reach Europe a few nights ago but was sent back before he even reached the beach.As Mr. Adam stood outside a mosque close to midnight on Friday, he pointed to the men sleeping on the ground, just behind him.\u201cPeople are sleeping outside,\u201d he said. \u201cDuring the day, you see hundreds of people waiting for food.\u201dHe continued: \u201cWe had one door only, the European door. And now it\u2019s shut down.\u201dThe Basmane neighborhood of this city, a warren of narrow streets, tourist hotels and cafes, was a vibrant hub last summer for migrant smuggling. But in recent weeks and months, as the Turks began cracking down on smuggling rings and migrants, either on land or at sea, business dropped noticeably.On a rainy Saturday afternoon, it was mostly quiet, with little evidence of the bustling migrant economy of last summer. Many Syrians, instead of becoming migrants, have stayed here to find work.Hamoud Ali, a Syrian who works at a clothing shop, also sells orange life jackets to migrants. He said at the height of the migrant rush, last summer, he would sell 150 jackets on a good day. Now, he said, he sells 10 to 15, at most.\u201cYesterday, no one made it to Greece,\u201d he said on Saturday.Many said they believed that the pact between Europe and Turkey would not solve the problem, and that eventually migrants and the smugglers \u2014 many of whom are connected with Turkish organized crime rings \u2014 would find alternative routes.Even so, many Syrians who had once hoped to leave are now being forced to contemplate a long-term future in Turkey. Turkey, which has seen war resume in the southeast with Kurdish rebels, has also faced attacks by the Islamic State. On Saturday morning, a suicide bomber struck in the heart of Istanbul\u2019s most famous pedestrian shopping street, killing four people and wounding dozens of others.For Syrians, the hope now is that Turkey will use the $6.8 billion in aid being provided by Europe to improve their lives.While some here were still planning a last dash on Saturday night, hoping to reach Greece before midnight, others had given up hope.Muhammed Ali, a Syrian who works as a smuggler\u2019s broker, arranging trips for refugees from street corners and hotel lobbies, said that a trip he had set up Friday night for 10 migrants had failed. All were seized by the Turkish Coast Guard shortly after setting out.He had given his customers their money back \u2014 about $500 per person \u2014 and they told him they were going back to Istanbul, where they had been living.\u201cThey changed their minds because it was their last chance,\u201d said Mr. Ali. \u201cI don\u2019t have any passengers right now. No one is trying to go.\u201dKaram Shoumali contributed reporting from Izmir, Turkey, and Ceylan Yeginsu from Canakkale, Turkey.Advertisement"}

Afraid of unrest, President Theodore Roosevelt sought the help of John Pierpont Morgan.The powerful banker, who held great sway over the coal industry, brokered a deal with the miners that ended the strike.\u201cMy dear sir,\u201d the president wrote to Mr. Morgan. \u201cLet me thank you for the service you have rendered the whole people.\u201dAmerica\u2019s coal industry is now facing another dark hour, but this time there are few financiers willing to save it.While coal has been declining over the last several years, Wall Street\u2019s broad retreat is an ominous sign for the industry.\u201cThere are always going to be periods of boom and bust,\u201d said Chiza Vitta, a metals and mining analyst with the credit rating firm Standard & Poor\u2019s. \u201cBut what is happening in coal is a downward shift that is permanent.\u201dPeabody has been trying to sell three of its mines in Colorado and New Mexico to raise cash. But the sale to Bowie Resource Partners appears to have stalled amid the difficult financing environment. Bowie did not comment. A Peabody spokesman said the company \u201cstands ready to complete the sale of assets to Bowie.\u201dCoal, like railroads, steel and other engines of the nation\u2019s industrial expansion in the 19th and early 20th centuries, helped drive Wall Street\u2019s profits for generations. More than a century later, the coal industry is in a free fall and the banks are pulling away.\u201cGiven the state of the coal industry today, I think Mr. Morgan himself might make the same decision,\u201d said Jean Strouse, a biographer of the banker.Some banks say they are trying to do their part to curtail climate change by moving away from coal projects and financing ventures that produce less carbon. But bankers also say there is a more basic reason for the shift: Lending to coal companies is too risky and could ultimately prove unprofitable.Coal companies are being squeezed by competition from less expensive energy sources like natural gas and by stiffer regulations \u2014 pressures that show no signs of letting up.As a result, even the most secure loans \u2014 like those made to companies emerging from bankruptcy, known as debtor-in-possession loans \u2014 are increasingly off limits for many banks, according to bankers and industry lawyers.But in the coal country of Appalachia, it is unclear whether many unprofitable mines can ever make money again.\u201cThere is certainly no $40 billion titan looking to make a big play in coal right now,\u201d said Marshall Huebner, co-leader of the insolvency and restructuring practice at Davis Polk & Wardwell who has represented several coal companies in recent bankruptcies.Despite the challenges, the coal industry still powers roughly a third of the nation\u2019s electricity. Industry officials say the business will eventually bounce back, once supplies burn off and demand for coal rebounds in places like China.\u201cCoal is part of our future, and I think the banks are taking a shortsighted view,\u201d said Mike Duncan, president of the American Coalition for Clean Coal Electricity, an industry group. \u201cThey are ignoring a huge market and buying into rhetoric that just doesn\u2019t work.\u201dEnvironmental groups, meanwhile, are hoping the banks\u2019 reluctance will hasten the collapse of coal. Groups like the Rainforest Action Network have been pressuring banks for months to reduce coal lending.\u201cWith much of the world committed to stabilizing the climate, we need the banks to follow quickly with measures to end coal financing altogether,\u201d said Ben Collins, a senior campaigner at Rainforest Action Network.But the banks\u2019 retreat could inflict collateral damage on an industry that employs tens of thousands of workers and needs financing not only to keep operating, but also to clean up coal mines after they close. If coal companies are unable to pay for the mine reclamation, taxpayers could be on the hook for the cleanup costs.In its latest annual corporate responsibility report, Deutsche Bank said it was phasing out financing for projects that employ so-called mountaintop removal mining, which environmentalists say is particularly harmful. But the bank\u2019s policy statement did not commit to the type of broad reduction in coal exposure that many American lenders have made in recent months.In a statement, a bank spokeswoman said that Deutsche Bank is one of the \u201cmost prominent banks when it comes to clean energy financing.\u201d She added that the bank \u201chas very strict guidelines governing any financing decisions. We conduct a thorough and detailed analysis on a case-by-case approach, drawing on a deep understanding of wider socioeconomic and environmental trends.\u201dEven most American banks are not cutting off funding to the industry overnight, saying that for the moment coal remains a major source of energy, particularly outside the United States.JPMorgan, for instance, is halting financing of new coal-fired plants in wealthy nations like the United States, but will continue to lend to such plants in the developing world, where in some places the coal market is still thriving. To receive financing, however, these plants need to use certain environmentally sound technologies, according the bank\u2019s new policy.Changes to the coal lending policy at Bank of America have created tension between senior leadership and rank-and-file bankers.Senior leaders wanted the bank\u2019s energy lending strategy to reflect \u201ca transition from a high-carbon to a low-carbon economy,\u201d said James Mahoney, who oversees public policy issues at the bank and worked on the new coal policy. It is part of Bank of America\u2019s current effort at \u201cresponsible growth\u201d \u2014 which entails not taking undue risks like lending to a troubled industry, Mr. Mahoney said.But the shift has been uncomfortable for some of the bankers serving the coal industry.\u201cIt put them in a difficult position to say to the companies they have worked with for years, \u2018We are pulling back,\u2019\u00a0\u201d Mr. Mahoney said. \u201cIt runs counter to everything we do as a client-focused company.\u201dSpeaking at an environmental conference at the United Nations in January, Bank of America\u2019s chief executive, Brian T. Moynihan, acknowledged the internal tensions around coal but said that the bank was trying to pull back gradually from the sector.\u201cWhen you have real clients involved, these decisions get difficult,\u201d Mr. Moynihan said. \u201cBut I think the view of the people working on it is: We have to help people make the transition.\u201dThat transition seemed to accelerate last week with the warning from Peabody that it would miss $71 million in interest payments.One of Peabody\u2019s best hopes for avoiding bankruptcy, analysts said, was the potential sale of three mines to Bowie Natural Resources.Bowie is a rare breed of coal company. It has been expanding its operations, focusing largely on Utah, a state that still relies primarily on coal to generate electricity. Still, Bowie in recent weeks has apparently had trouble raising the full $650 million in debt to acquire the mines.In many debt deals, banks would cover the shortfall. But Deutsche Bank and Citigroup agreed only to make their best effort to raise the debt for Bowie. The banks did not commit any of their own money, as a traditional underwriter might do.Those best efforts might not be enough.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Labor Protests Multiply in China as Economy Slows, Worrying Leaders", "Date": "2016-03-14", "News": "Supported byGUANGZHOU, China \u2014 For nearly seven years, Li Wei rose before dawn seven days a week for his 10-hour shift at the steel plant, returning home each night soaked in sweat, the clank of heavy machinery still ringing in his ears. But last month, the 31-year-old welder stood outside the plant with hundreds of co-workers, picketing against pay cuts and singing patriotic battle hymns.Within a week, the authorities declared their strike illegal, threatening fines and imprisonment. The police descended on the plant by the hundreds, tearing down signs and ordering the protesters to go back to work. \u201cI\u2019ve sacrificed my life for this company,\u201d Mr. Li told officers as they sought to disperse the workers. \u201cHow can you do this?\u201dMost demonstrations have refrained from political attacks and focused on grievances such as wage arrears, unpaid benefits like pension contributions and unsafe working conditions.President Xi Jinping, concerned about challenges to the ruling Communist Party, has responded with a methodical crackdown, quashing protests, dismantling labor rights organizations and imprisoning activists. But his government has also sought to placate workers, putting pressure on businesses to settle disputes and making billions of dollars available for welfare payments and retraining programs.The approach underlines the political dilemma that labor unrest poses for the Communist Party, which has continued to portray itself as a socialist guardian of worker\u2019s rights even as it has embraced capitalism and welcomed tycoons into its ranks.China trimmed the state sector of more than 30 million workers during a wave of privatization and restructuring during the late 1990s and early 2000s. But the economy was booming then, creating millions of jobs in new industries. It is still growing today, but at its slowest pace in a quarter century.At the same time, Mr. Xi is grappling with a labor force that is better informed and more easily organized because of social media, and also more assertive, in part because of grass-roots rights groups that have emerged.\u201cThis is probably the thing that keeps Xi Jinping up at night,\u201d said Eli Friedman, a scholar at Cornell University who studies Chinese labor issues. \u201cGovernments are not swimming in money the way they used to be, and there\u2019s less room to compromise.\u201dHere in the capital of Guangdong Province in southern China, several hundred workers at the state-owned Angang Lianzhong steel plant went on strike last month in response to a plan to decrease wages by as much as half and extend the workday to 12 hours for some employees.\u201cToward the sun, toward freedom!\u201d the workers chanted one morning as they demonstrated outside, reciting a World War II-era army song.They used WeChat, a popular messaging app, to rally support and raise money to buy protest banners. In one widely shared post, they described how the authorities had tried to stop them from playing the national anthem on a loudspeaker. (Its first line is, \u201cRise, we who refuse to be slaves!\u201d)After the police broke up the strike, the plant promised to delay its planned wage cuts. But several workers said they had returned to work only because they feared punishment.\u201cI lost hope that anything would change,\u201d said Mr. Li, the welder, adding that he was anxious about finding a new job to support his wife and son.Officials at the steel plant did not respond to requests for comment.Guangdong, which manufactures much of the world\u2019s toys, shoes, clothes and furniture, has been a hotbed of worker discontent. In recent months, many foreign-invested factories here have relocated to central China or Southeast Asia. Some have moved without making severance or pension payments, in violation of Chinese law. Last year, the province averaged more than one labor dispute a day, according to China Labor Bulletin.Protests have been reported in every part of the country, with the strife most pronounced in the manufacturing and construction industries, which accounted for two-thirds of the demonstrations.Miners and others there took to the streets complaining of unpaid wages after the provincial governor held up their company, Longmay, as an example of how state firms could be restructured without hurting workers. He made his remarks at the annual session of China\u2019s legislature, the National People\u2019s Congress.Despite rising discontent, there have been few signs that a national labor movement might emerge. The authorities have worked assiduously to block workers from joining forces.The government prohibits workers from establishing independent labor unions, instead requiring that they join only the party-controlled All-China Federation of Trade Unions. It is supposed to mediate labor disputes, but management usually chooses the workers who sit at the bargaining table.The authorities have also clamped down on social media, shutting accounts of labor activists, deleting news reports on strikes and monitoring chat forums for signs of collective action.In recent years, the nonprofit labor rights groups that have proliferated have sought to help workers negotiate contracts and maintain solidarity during strikes. The authorities had been mostly tolerant and sometimes treated them as allies in enforcing labor laws.Mr. Zeng, 41, had orchestrated successful campaigns against influential factories and state-owned firms in Guangdong and tutored a generation of labor activists. After his arrest, state news outlets began a smear campaign, accusing him of hiring prostitutes, stealing from workers and conspiring with hostile foreign forces.In interviews, several activists said they had gone into hiding. Mr. Zeng\u2019s center here, once a bustling meeting place for workers, now sits empty with a new security camera above its front door.Wu Guijun, a labor activist in nearby Shenzhen, said he had started warning workers against holding demonstrations, for fear that they might be arrested, too.\u201cThe environment has changed,\u201d he said. \u201cWe need time to grow up. We can\u2019t just die in the cradle. We have to change our strategy.\u201dAdam Wu contributed research.videoAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Unpacking a Chinese Company\u2019s U.S. Hotel Buying Spree", "Date": "2016-03-14", "News": "Supported byDealBookThe Aloft Hotel in Philadelphia, left, and the W in Washington.\u00a0A quarter-century later, it is China\u2019s turn.On Monday, in a head-turning series of deals, a Chinese insurance company that just over a year ago purchased the Waldorf Astoria, bought $6.5 billion of properties from the Blackstone Group and made a $12.8 billion offer to buy Starwood Hotels and Resorts Worldwide.The collection of brands \u2014 Sheraton, Westin, W Hotels, St. Regis \u2014 is remarkable. Properties include the Essex House on Central Park South; the Hotel del Coronado near San Diego, where \u201cSome Like it Hot\u201d was filmed; the Ritz-Carlton, Laguna Niguel and a smattering of Four Seasons and Fairmont properties.Should there be concern over Anbang\u2019s aggressive real estate push? And will the deals become part of the debate raging during the presidential campaign about foreigners taking American jobs and buying up assets here?So far, none of the candidates have made comments about the deal. But it wouldn\u2019t be hard to see it become a talking point. In one of Mr. Trump\u2019s position papers, he said: \u201cAmerica fully opened its markets to China, but China has not reciprocated,\u201d describing its \u201cGreat Wall of Protectionism.\u201dChinese companies have been on a foreign acquisition spree in recent years, looking abroad for deals in an effort to diversify. In January, the Wanda Group from China agreed to buy Legendary Entertainment, the film company behind Jurassic World, for $3.5 billion. The largest Chinese acquisition to date of an American company was Smithfield Foods\u2019 $5 billion sale to China\u2019s Shuanghui International Holdings in 2013. Last month, China National Chemical Corporation bought Syngenta, a Swiss agricultural and chemical giant, for $43 billion, the largest foreign purchase ever by a Chinese firm.The deals by Anbang, which has close ties to current and former Chinese government officials, will most likely be reviewed by Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, also known as Cfius, which reviews all deals for American companies that involve national security.Real estate holdings may not seem like a likely target of the interagency body, but it did review and approve the Waldorf sale. At the time of the Waldorf deal, Daniel B. Pickard, a lawyer at Wiley Rein, wrote in a note to clients that the transaction \u201cis a reminder that seemingly innocuous property transactions in the United States can have national security implications.\u201dAnd how \u201cnational security\u201d is defined is a moving target. Over the last year, at least 10 deals, mostly related to technology, were withdrawn over concerns that Cfius would block them.Then there is the question of whether these deals will turn out to be a success or follow the losing path of Japan. Nearly all the trophy buildings that Japanese companies acquired at stratospheric premiums in the late 1980s were sold at a steep loss within the decade.Anbang\u2019s deal-making raises concerns. It is paying $6.5 billion to Blackstone for its hotel portfolio, yet Blackstone paid only $6 billion for them three months ago. Blackstone, arguably the world\u2019s most skilled real estate investor, was all too happy to quickly flip it to them. And Anbang\u2019s offer for Starwood, in which it was joined by two financial partners, looks like an opening gambit to thwart Starwood\u2019s merger agreement with Marriott, so it is likely the final price will go even higher.Then there is the question of how Anbang, which didn\u2019t even exist 15 years ago, is paying for all of these deals. Well, it has entered the risky business of becoming a \u201cshadow bank\u201d in China by offering investment products that promise large interest payments. Already, some analysts are expressing nervousness that Anbang could be unable to pay back its investors because it has plowed so much money into real estate. But as China\u2019s economy cools, companies like Anbang are desperately trying to find places to invest cash outside of the country.Wall Street bankers and lawyers expect Chinese companies to continue to acquire assets in the United States. Anbang\u2019s deals are only the beginning. If the pace picks up, watch for this to become an issue as the presidential campaign heads into the general election.In 1989, Sony\u2019s chief, Akio Morita, was asked about all the consternation over his acquisition of assets in Hollywood. His reply?\u201cIf you don\u2019t want Japan to buy it, don\u2019t sell it.\u201dThe DealBook column on Tuesday, about a Chinese company\u2019s hotel-buying spree in the United States, misstated, in some copies, the amount the company, the Anbang Insurance Group, has offered for Starwood Hotels and Resorts Worldwide. It is $12.8 billion, not $10.8 billion.Advertisement"}

Leather breastplates brushed with pastel blooms became a bristling carapace (and so did petal pink vinyl), and nylon saddle bags in fuchsia and fire opal melted into giant hexagonal mouths, like a carnivorous lily.

Which, in this case, had to do with a reminder of a time that was \u201call about revolution,\u201d said Mr. Joffe: the French Revolution, the American Revolution, the Industrial Revolution.A time when, in other words, the 99 percent rose up against the 1 percent and machines changed the world economy.

{"Headline": "Gutfreund Shook Up Wall St., Laying the Groundwork for Disaster", "Date": "2016-03-10", "News": "Supported byBreakingviewsJohn H. Gutfreund is taking an old Wall Street model to the grave.In many respects, Mr. Gutfreund \u2014 immortalized in Michael Lewis\u2019s \u201cLiar\u2019s Poker\u201d \u2014 helped lay the groundwork for the excesses that took the industry to the brink of disaster almost two decades after he was forced out. But Mr. Gutfreund\u2019s era was one in which bankers could only put their own firms and personal wealth, rather than the global economic system, at risk.Mr. Gutfreund (pronounced \u201cGOOD-friend\u201d) started to shake up the firm and its industry within three years of taking the helm in 1978. He did so by selling it to the Phibro Corporation in a deal that prompted William Salomon, who had handpicked Mr. Gutfreund as his successor, to lament that his \u201cmaterialism is disgraceful.\u201dOne of the deal\u2019s effects was that a major Wall Street bank became publicly traded for the first time \u2013 and it transferred the bulk of the risk away from employees to shareholders. That helped spur even more risk-taking, a recurring theme of the next quarter-century on Wall Street. Salomon was, under Mr. Gutfreund\u2019s leadership, regarded as the industry\u2019s cutting edge.The sale to Phibro also spawned another Wall Street staple: boardroom coups. By 1984, Mr. Gutfreund had wrested control back from his erstwhile allies at Phibro. Within three years, problems hit several securities firms as junk bond bets soured. Unlike in 2008, though, private capital alone came to the rescue, rather than a taxpayer bailout; in Salomon\u2019s case, from Warren E. Buffett.That\u2019s largely because securities firms, unlike the banks they eventually became, were smaller, less complex and less interconnected than their contemporary incarnations. Even the rogue trader scandal in 1991 that almost wrecked Salomon did not have enough power to do more than rattle rivals. It did, though, effectively end Mr. Gutfreund\u2019s career. And unlike latter-day peers, he was sent packing without a golden handshake and with a ban from running a securities firm without previous approval from regulators.In retrospect, that lends his kind of risk-taking a degree of perverse charm compared to the economy-busting mega banks amassed within a few years of his departure, when Salomon was acquired by the behemoth that became Citigroup. In that regard, Mr. Gutfreund will be missed.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Along With President Obama, the 21st Century Visited Cuba", "Date": "2016-03-27", "News": "Supported byWhite House LetterOutside that theater and throughout Cuba, Internet access ranges from sluggish to nonexistent, and change is equally slow. The wounds that Mr. Obama spoke of are the defining grievances of Mr. Castro\u2019s lifetime and that of his older brother, Fidel.The 30 years between Mr. Obama, 54, and Mr. Castro, 84, help explain the vast gulf that separates the two leaders, on vivid display last week as the American president made a historic visit to Cuba.Mr. Obama\u2019s trip was calculated to highlight the generational contrast and appeal to a younger cohort both in Cuba and in the United States, presenting his vision for a thaw as the inevitable way of the future, and the hostility and isolation that came before as the stale remnant of another century.\u201cHe moved with this fluid, lanky, youthful movement, and that contrasted so strongly with Ra\u00fal and his stiff military bearing,\u201d said Richard Feinberg, a senior fellow in the Latin America initiative at the Brookings Institution, who traveled to Cuba last week to witness the visit.\u201cHis speech constantly focused on generational shift, youth, the future, let\u2019s put the past behind us,\u201d Mr. Feinberg added. \u201cA lot of these things didn\u2019t have to be said \u2014 you had the visual representation that sent the message.\u201dAt a news conference last Monday at the Revolutionary Palace, Mr. Obama was confident and in his element as he addressed reporters and fielded questions, while Mr. Castro, unaccustomed to such an exchange and apparently irritated with his translation headset, showed his age.\u201cThe iconic image was Castro getting all huffy about some pretty anodyne critiques of the human rights situation in Cuba,\u201d said Michael C. Desch, a political-science professor at the University of Notre Dame. \u201cThe gestalt of the visit for Obama was very much \u2018I know you\u2019re on your way out, and I\u2019m going to speak to the Cuban population about what the future looks like after you.\u2019\u201dIt was a message that Mr. Obama delivered visually as much as verbally. In Cuba, where two-thirds of the population is black or mixed-race \u2014 and Mr. Castro and the vast majority of his government are white \u2014 a mixed-race American president embodied possibilities that most Cubans consider out of reach.Mr. Obama, who built his first presidential campaign around support from younger voters and themes of generational change, gravitates to youths wherever he travels. Forums at universities or with young leaders active in their communities are staples of his foreign trips, and Cuba was no exception.\u201cIf you can\u2019t access information online, if you cannot be exposed to different points of view, you will not reach your full potential, and over time, the youth will lose hope,\u201d Mr. Obama said.\u201cI know these issues are sensitive, especially coming from an American president,\u201d he added.Mr. Obama\u2019s message is grounded in the political reality of a changing Cuban population, both in the United States and on the island.While older Cuban-Americans tend to harbor lingering feelings of anger and resentment about that country\u2019s Communist government, leading them to favor embargo and isolation, a younger generation has less emotional investment in those decades-old disputes. Likewise, while many members of older generations who remained on the island have a visceral connection to the revolution and all that followed, their children and grandchildren may have little memory of the roots of resentment toward the United States.Speaking directly to their perspective, Mr. Obama said in his speech: \u201cI know the history, but I refuse to be trapped by it.\u201dLopsided percentages of young people said re-establishing relations with Cuba would be good for the United States, according to the poll, while a smaller majority of older people did.Mr. Obama moved around Havana in the sleek black limousine known as \u201cthe Beast,\u201d through streets that appeared frozen in time, packed with classic American cars of the mid-20th century.\u201cYou drive around Havana and you say, \u2018This economy is not working,\u2019\u201d he said later. \u201cIt looks like it did in the 1950s.\u201dLikewise, the theater where he spoke to the Cuban people looks very much as it did 88 years ago, when Calvin Coolidge, the last sitting American president to go to Cuba, spoke there to a Western Hemisphere summit meeting.This time, though, Mr. Obama\u2019s staff made sure there was plenty of Internet connectivity for his message of change and transformation to be posted on Twitter, streamed and broadcast as widely as possible.And then, just as quickly, the president finished speaking, and the signal strength died. Mr. Obama left Cuba not long after, his motorcade passing by signs bearing old revolutionary slogans and portraits of Fidel in younger days as it went.Giovanni Russonello contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "China Moves to Bolster Lending by Easing Banks\u2019 Reserve Ratio", "Date": "2016-02-29", "News": "Supported byHONG KONG \u2014 China said Monday evening that it would free up banks in the country to lend more, as the government tries to shore up slowing economic growth.The country\u2019s top leaders are to convene in Beijing on Thursday for the first of the so-called two meetings, the annual gatherings of the full membership of the national legislature and a sprawling committee of political advisers.China\u2019s economy is faltering, prompting concerns that are now shaking global stock markets.Effective Tuesday, China\u2019s central bank said, the amount of cash that commercial banks are required to set aside as reserves will be reduced. Lowering the reserve requirement ratio essentially gives the state-controlled banking system more money to lend.This is the fifth time that the central bank, the People\u2019s Bank of China, has cut the reserve requirement ratio since the start of last year. The move on Monday could release around 630 billion renminbi, or about $96 billion, in additional liquidity to China\u2019s banking system, according to estimates from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.For the biggest banks, the ratio of total deposits that must be kept in reserve was reduced to 17 percent, from 17.5 percent.By lowering the reserve requirement ratio, or R.R.R., by half a percentage point, the central bank is partly seeking to offset its own actions in support of the currency. The central bank has been selling dollars and buying renminbi to prop up the value of its currency, which has been under pressure.As the economy stumbles, individuals and companies are pulling money out of China en masse, leaving the government scrambling to limit the outflows.But that has siphoned liquidity out of the system. In response, the central bank has been injecting billions of renminbi into the country\u2019s financial system. The reserve requirement ratio cut serves the same purpose, essentially representing a lending quota.In a news release on Monday, China\u2019s central bank said the reduction was intended \u201cto maintain adequate and reasonable liquidity in the financial system and guide the steady moderate growth of money and credit.\u201dIn recent months, the People\u2019s Bank of China has slowly been switching its focus away from changing reserve requirements. Instead, it has been putting greater emphasis on interest rates as a way to control liquidity. Still, the pressure on the renminbi to weaken remains such that the central bank will probably need to dig deeper into its monetary policy toolbox.Although the central bank has been moving toward more market-driven interest rates, traditional measures like the reserve requirement ratio cut still create across-the-board stimulus, Mark Williams, the chief China economist at Capital Economics, wrote Monday evening in a research note.\u201cThe move underscores a message that officials have repeated in recent days, including at the G-20 meeting: Policy makers still have room to support the economy,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Holding Their Noses, Louisiana Officials Act to Narrow State Budget Gaps", "Date": "2016-03-09", "News": "Supported byBATON ROUGE, La. \u2014 Facing the threat of layoffs, cancellation of university classes and a suspension of health care services, state lawmakers avoided more than $900 million in budget cuts by passing a package of tax increases and spending reductions Wednesday in the closing moments of a special session.But large shortfalls still plague the state and will continue to play out as a regular session convenes on Monday. In addition to a current shortfall of $954 million, lawmakers tried to eliminate a $2 billion budget gap for the fiscal year that begins July 1, but fell short by $800 million. The Senate president, John Alario, a Republican, said lawmakers may need to return in another special session this year.As the Legislature has repeatedly done in recent decades during dire economic times, it altered the state\u2019s sales tax structure, raising it a penny to 5 percent and removing most exemptions \u2014 but only temporarily. The House appropriations chairman, Cameron Henry, a Republican, said business and industry would share about 47 percent of that burden and would see other changes in the corporate income and franchise tax systems. But lawmakers were unable to close the entire shortfall of $954 million for the current fiscal year and left an estimated $30 million in needs unfunded. Mr. Edwards said the state Department of Corrections and the Department of Children and Family Services would probably suffer cuts. But they would not be alone. \u201cWe could have done better,\u201d Mr. Edwards said at a news conference Wednesday evening. \u201cIt is not a great day for the State of Louisiana.\u201d At his urging, lawmakers also approved higher taxes on cigarettes, alcohol, car rentals, cellphones, landlines and short-term rooms booked through websites. They rolled back a tax credit enjoyed by the insurance industry, and they approved a framework for collecting sales taxes from online retailers.Those revenue increases presented political challenges for House Republicans, who ran anti-tax election campaigns last fall.\u201cWe have members who made tax votes and are struggling with that,\u201d said the House speaker, Taylor Barras, a Republican. \u201cI had a friend text me this morning and call me the tax man.\u201dFor all that the Legislature accomplished in its special session, some critics noted that the changes lawmakers passed were temporary in nature and did not fundamentally alter the tax code and what Moody\u2019s Investors Service called a \u201cstructural deficit.\u201d\u201cThey did the absolute bare minimum that was required of them,\u201d said Jan Moller, the director of the Louisiana Budget Project. The shortened three-and-a-half-week time frame and other limits placed on Mr. Edwards\u2019s special session played a role in what the session produced. The House and Senate did create a task force to study budget and tax reforms and charged it with reporting its findings to the Legislature by Sept. 1.With the Katrina money gone and the economy worsening, spending started to outstrip tax collections over the past eight years as structural budget problems surfaced under Gov. Bobby Jindal. Mr. Jindal refused to raise taxes, and his administration and the Legislature privatized government services, sold state assets, redirected money from various funds and used pockets of one-time money for recurring expenses.As the 2015 governor\u2019s race began, tax collections started to dip and oil prices plummeted, costing Louisiana $12 million for every $1 decrease in the annual average price of a barrel of oil.\u201cFor all practical purposes, Louisiana is entering its own recession,\u201d said Greg Albrecht, the Legislature\u2019s chief economist.Advertisement"}

Sensing it was going to lose the elections, the previous party in power, Civic Platform, appointed five judges to the court, including two to fill terms that were not due to expire until after the election. The president refused to swear them in.Upon winning power, the Law and Justice Party appointed five judges of its own choosing, who were promptly sworn in. In December, however, the tribunal ruled that the old government had properly appointed three of the five judges it tried to install; the president has refused to seat them.Parliament then passed a law reorganizing the court, requiring a two-thirds majority for any decision to be binding, instead of a simple majority, and requiring that 13 of the 15 judges hear a given case, instead of nine. The decision announced on Wednesday was heard by only 12 judges, and the government argues that it is therefore not valid.\u201cThis situation \u2014 described by the media as paralysis, which unfortunately is not far from the truth \u2014 means that fundamental constitutional principles have been abused,\u201d Judge Stanislaw Biernat, a member of the tribunal, said at the court on Wednesday.Judge Biernat said that the Law and Justice party \u2014 the first party since the fall of Communism in Poland in 1989 to hold an absolute majority in Parliament \u2014 had abused \u201cthe rule of law, separation of powers, independence of the judiciary and the protection of the rights and freedoms of individuals.\u201dThe court also rejected the new two-thirds requirement as unconstitutional.The Constitution requires that the government publish all rulings by the Constitutional Tribunal immediately in the official Journal of Laws. The justice minister, Zbigniew Ziobro, said the prime minister would do no such thing.Mr. Ziobro said that the court appeared to have made up its mind before it even heard the case on Tuesday.\u201cThis whole thing could have been a put-up job,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s outrageous. The judges don\u2019t want to reach a compromise.\u201dThe Constitution does not specify what should happen if a sitting government ignores a ruling of the Constitutional Tribunal.\u201cThis will lead to a complete anarchy in our country,\u201d said Eugeniusz Klopotek of the opposition Polish People\u2019s Party. \u201cSocial tensions will escalate. I can already feel it.\u201dAdam Bodnar, Poland\u2019s human rights commissioner, told the tribunal during a hearing: \u201cThe Constitutional Tribunal will survive, but the question is whether its function will not be purely decorative. This court guarantees the real protection of citizens\u2019 rights and freedoms, but the Parliament intends to deprive citizens of this fundamental instrument to protect their rights.\u201d\u201cPoland is and must be a sovereign country,\u201d Mr. Kaczynski said.If the European Union finds that Poland has violated democratic norms, it could strip the country of its voting rights, though it is not clear whether officials in Brussels will be willing to go that far.Because of an editing error, an earlier version of this article gave an outdated position for Adam Bodnar.

{"Headline": "Masters of Chess, Not Self-Promotion", "Date": "2016-03-30", "News": "Supported by8 PhotosMOSCOW \u2014 In the chandeliered ballroom of Pashkov House, an 18th-century mansion on a hill overlooking the Kremlin, a chess grandmaster dressed in a jacket that seemed several sizes too big declined offerings of canap\u00e9s, vodka and wine.Surrounded by Moscow glitterati and well-groomed waiters who looked as if they had been borrowed from an expensive nightclub, the grandmaster, 23-year-old Fabiano Caruana of the United States, was not having much fun.\u201cThis is not my favorite thing,\u201d the cerebral Caruana said of the gala, held early this month to celebrate the start of the grueling World Chess Candidates tournament. \u201cI just want to go back to my hotel.\u201dHis discomfort at having to make small talk over cocktails with strangers who, for the most part, barely understood the game at which he excels helps explain why, in a sporting world filled with noisy stars and deep-pocketed corporate sponsors, chess remains a struggling also-ran.Many world-class chess players are simply not cut out for the nonstop self-promotion that celebrity culture demands.Those hopes took a big hit on Monday when Caruana, considered America\u2019s best hope in decades for a world championship title, lost his final match in the Moscow tournament, folding to Sergey Karjakin of Russia and missing the chance to advance to the event in New York.Caruana also used his Twitter post to congratulate Karjakin \u201con a well deserved victory,\u201d showing the kind of manners that Bobby Fischer, the last American-born player to win the world championship, in 1972, was not known for.Chess has come a long way since the days of Fischer, who sulked when he lost, gloated when he won and forfeited his title in 1975 when he declined to defend his crown.The economics of chess have also moved on. Fischer\u2019s Cold War showdown with Boris Spassky in 1972 in Reykjavik, Iceland, was preceded by bitter wrangling over money, with Fischer agreeing to play only after he had secured a doubling of the world championship prize fund, initially set at $125,000 (the equivalent of around $700,000 today).Ilya Merenzon, the chief executive of Agon, which holds the worldwide licensing and marketing rights to a series of tournaments held every two years to decide who is the world\u2019s best player, said the prize fund for this year\u2019s title match in New York would be 2 million euros ($2.2 million).\u201cWe are selling an elite event that we hope will be part of the global news cycle,\u201d Merenzon said in an interview. He also noted that far more people around the world played chess than played golf, which he described as \u201cmuch more boring than chess.\u201dThat chess has a passionate following was clear from a controversy that erupted during the Moscow tournament, which ended on Monday.That created an uproar in the chess world, with complaints that Merenzon, by trying to enforce exclusivity, would only curb interest in the game and thus undermine his goal of pushing chess into the mainstream.Merenzon, whose company has filed three lawsuits in Moscow seeking damages of nearly $900,000 from websites that violated this exclusivity, said he merely wanted to turn chess into a sport like any other by ensuring that sponsors could be sure where the audience was \u2014 just as they know which TV channel will have the broadcast rights to the Super Bowl or the World Cup.Holding chess tournaments costs lots of money, Merenzon said, so there has to be a system of exclusivity in place \u201cfor monetizing games in each world championship cycle.\u201dFor much of the 20th century, tournament funding often came from resort and spa towns \u2014 like Carlsbad (in what was then Czechoslovakia) \u2014 that sponsored chess events as a way to attract attention and business. Iceland put up money for the Fischer-Spassky championship match for much the same reason.Today, however, funding, including prize money, comes mostly from Merenzon\u2019s company, Agon, which organizes world championship events for the World Chess Federation, known as FIDE.Agon pays for halls, hotels, travel and a host of other costs and, in return, has exclusive rights to license the events, as it did with NRK, and to seek out corporate sponsors.But getting big-name companies that pour billions of dollars into other sports to cough up for chess has been a struggle.The principal sponsor of the Moscow event was a little-known Russia-based developer called Tashir, which plastered its corporate logo around the playing hall in a Soviet-era telegraph building near the Kremlin. Beluga, a high-end Russian vodka, sponsored a glassed-in V.I.P. room with leather club chairs and unlimited drinks.Caruana, although a supremely gifted player, has two niche sponsors: the Chess Club and Scholastic Center of St. Louis and the Liberty Science Center in Jersey City. He has their patches on the baggy jacket he wears to matches and other public events.Hikaru Nakamura, another American who played in Moscow and finished in fifth, is sponsored by Red Bull. He put a can next to the board at each of his 14 matches.The idea of making chess able to pay for itself and turn a profit like other sports gained prominence with the American entrepreneur Andrew Paulson, who set up Agon and in 2011 secured chess marketing rights for 11 years from the world federation. But he gave up trying to create a vibrant chess economy, sold Agon to Merenzon for a symbolic 1 pound and moved on to other ventures in London.Merenzon had hoped that a victory in Moscow by either Caruana or Nakamura would prod interest from big American sponsors for the coming world championship.\u201cWe would love to have an American be there,\u201d Merenzon, a Russian who was educated in the United States, said when it still looked as if an American might win the right to challenge Carlsen. \u201cIt would be great for us to get more eyeballs in America.\u201dAndrey Filatov, the president of the Russian Chess Federation, said he was rooting for a Russian to win the world championship but also said he hoped that the United States would embrace the game as a commercial, as well as intellectual, enterprise.To that end, Filatov said, he would like to see the victor in the American presidential election attend the opening of the world championship in New York and help give the sport some cachet.Even without an American at the table in New York, Merenzon thinks that the number of chess players around the world \u2014 estimated at more than 600 million \u2014 makes chess an easy way to reach a vast, committed and often high-earning population.Chess, Merenzon acknowledged, is often difficult to understand, particularly at the championship level, with games that include inscrutable moves and strategies that can leave even excellent players scratching their heads. But unlike other sports, Merenzon said, chess offers sponsors a chance to be associated with intelligence, discipline and cunning.\u201cIt effectively means being smart, and this is something everyone wants to be,\u201d he said.To help non-grandmasters better understand what was actually going on during each match in Moscow, WorldChess.com posted all the moves as soon as they happened, along with a computer-generated meter that indicated which player had the advantage after each move. Live online commentary by chess masters and postmatch interviews with the players also helped make the game more accessible.Seeking to add more pizazz to chess, Agon even used the Moscow event to try to rebrand Caruana and his rivals as hip, inviting photographers to take pictures of them as they strolled together across Red Square, as if they were members of a cool albeit unusually intelligent boy band.Before the gala, the players had their hair done, were fitted for designer clothing and selected expensive watches in preparation for a photo shoot by the Russian edition of the magazine GQ, part of an effort by a Moscow luxury goods merchandiser that sponsors chess to add some sparkle to the understated sport.The competitors all played along gamely, but some chess aficionados found the exercise a bit unsettling.\u201cThis is completely abnormal,\u201d Rustam Kasimdzhanov, a grandmaster from Uzbekistan, said as he waited for Caruana and other players to emerge from a high-end clothing boutique in central Moscow. \u201cBut it is a good thing. Chess needs a little bit of glamour.\u201dAdvertisement"}

He chastised Mr. Obama, 54, for his youth and for failing to recognize what Mr. Castro said were the major accomplishments of Cuba\u2019s Communist revolution, such as state pensions and salaries, the steps to eradicate racial discrimination and the role of Cuba\u2019s indigenous people in society.The letter urged Mr. Obama not to jump to conclusions about the Cuban system, or assume that the past could be so easily forgotten.Theodore Piccone, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution in Washington, said that Mr. Castro was \u201cexercising the Cuban people\u2019s muscle memory on the bad things the United States did after he led the revolution,\u201d but that the letter was probably not intended to derail the diplomatic opening.\u201cThe timing of the editorial \u2014 coming after the visit, during which Fidel was neither seen nor heard \u2014 signals an effort to do minimal harm to his brother\u2019s rapprochement with the U.S.,\u201d Mr. Piccone added.Mr. Castro\u2019s admonition comes across as something of a reminder to the Cuban people that shedding the government\u2019s long-running enmity with the United States and reforming its economic system should not undermine what he and other Cubans view as the ideals and achievements of the revolution.\u201cNobody should be under the illusion that the people of this dignified and selfless country will renounce the glory, the rights or the spiritual wealth they have gained with the development of education, science and culture,\u201d Mr. Castro wrote.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "In the Bizarro World of Negative Interest Rates, Saving Will Cost You", "Date": "2016-03-05", "News": "Supported byStrategiesHere\u2019s a proposition for you: Hand over your money. I\u2019ll skim some off the top, hold it for a while and return whatever is left in a year or two.Until a few years ago, that\u2019s the kind of offer a gangster might have made. In the world as we\u2019ve known it, if you lend someone your cash you expect to receive something \u2014 typically, interest \u2014 in return.But something radically different is afoot today. It\u2019s called negative interest \u2014 and it is an inversion of the traditional relationship between lenders and borrowers.\u201cIt\u2019s all upside down,\u201d said Kathy A. Jones, chief fixed-income strategist at Charles Schwab. \u201cNegative interest is hard to even think about. Our whole financial system is built the other way, on positive interest rates. This is mind-boggling.\u201dThe central banks have been going negative to stimulate their relatively weak regional economies and raise inflation levels, which have been perilously low. They hope negative rates will accomplish these goals in three ways. First, the central banks want commercial banks to lend more money at very low interest rates. Second, they want commercial bank customers to borrow more, spend more and save less.There is a third reason, which central bankers rarely enunciate in public: Negative interest rates tend to drive down the value of a country\u2019s currency, making its exports cheaper and more competitive in global markets.In the United States, Federal Reserve officials say they might use negative interest rates in a future crisis, but they don\u2019t expect to install them here anytime soon. Nonetheless, global markets are tightly linked, and negative rates in Europe and Asia are already influencing financial markets here, in that way affecting the lives of ordinary people.The effects have been mixed: Negative rates on foreign debt have helped keep a wide range of interest rates in the United States unusually low, which translates into good deals for borrowers and bad for ones for lenders, including major banks, whose profit margins have been compressed. For older people trying to live on their bond investments, low rates result in paltry income and painful choices.The unusual conditions defined by negative interest rates also complicate matters for the Federal Reserve, which has begun to raise short-term rates in the United States, only to see longer-term rates decline. That unexpected development is occurring partly because below-zero rates in European and Japanese bond markets have created greater demand for American bonds, raising their prices and driving down yields, which move in an opposite direction. Negative rates have not been common for very long and their consequences aren\u2019t entirely understood.Still, grasping the basics of how negative rates work and how they may be affecting the United States is important for anyone with money in the markets.Negative rates appeared during the global financial crisis in 2008, when yields on some United States Treasury bills fell below zero for brief periods. That happened because so many panicky people wanted to buy Treasuries that their prices soared and their yields dropped into negative territory. In essence, investors were willing to lose a small amount of principal in exchange for the safety. Those negative interest rates were a sign that the financial world was in trouble.Today\u2019s negative rates are not a short-term market anomaly. To the contrary, central banks in Europe and Asia have made negative interest rates part of their official tool kit. The European Central Bank; the central banks of Switzerland, Sweden and Denmark; and, last month, the Japanese central bank have all deliberately set at least some short-term rates below zero \u2014 effectively penalizing commercial banks for depositing funds with them, and giving them a strong incentive to move their money elsewhere.Negative rates abroad have caused another problem for the United States, and, perhaps, created an opportunity.They make it difficult to determine why interest rates in the United States are so low \u2014 much lower than would be expected if the American economy were truly healed from the last recession. Those low rates are a bit of a puzzle given the Fed\u2019s stated intention of continuing to raise short-term rates.Jim Paulsen, chief investment strategist for Wells Capital Management, said in an interview that while these risks were real, barring an unforeseen shock, it was probable that the American economy would continue to strengthen. And if that happens, current American interest rates \u2014 particularly those for inflation-indexed bonds called TIPS \u2014 have been set low. TIPS may be a good investment now because their pricing assumes that the inflation rate will be only about 1.4 percent a year for the next five years \u2014 and, if an economic recovery is in place, inflation is bound to move higher than that, giving investors a tidy profit.A riskier bet could be made with investments in the domestic stock market, which would be likely to rebound significantly if it turned out that despite negative rates abroad, the economy was robust in the United States, he said. \u201cWe would see a rally in a range of risk assets,\u201d he said. \u201cThere would be some real money to be made.\u201d The possibility of significant losses was high, too, he said.Conservative, risk-averse investors find themselves in a hard place. As long as interest rates remain negative for the bonds of major countries like Germany and Japan, it will be difficult for American bond yields to rise much. The safest investments, like 10-year Treasury notes, are providing extraordinarily low yields \u2014 only about 1.9 percent. Junk bonds, with higher yields, are risky when the economy is under stress, Ms. Jones of Schwab says. \u201cWe\u2019re pointing our clients toward a middle ground \u2014 investment-grade corporate bonds,\u201d she said. They provide a modicum of safety and somewhat better yields than government bonds do.That\u2019s not a happy situation. But in some respects it is an upside-down world. Sometimes the best you can do is hold on to your money.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "In One-Party Vietnam, Independents Vie for Assembly Seats", "Date": "2016-03-21", "News": "Supported byMs. Mai Khoi, 32, is among a group of around two dozen Vietnamese activists and celebrities who are running as independents this month for the authoritarian state\u2019s rubber-stamp National Assembly \u2014 and effectively daring the ruling Communist Party to not put them on the ballot. Analysts say it is the first time that more than two or three activists have run for office.Ms. Mai Khoi said her growing interest in social justice and youth issues \u2014 expressed through her songs \u2014 would make her an appealing candidate for many young Vietnamese who are not otherwise interested in politics.She already has thousands of supporters, she said after the concert between puffs of a cigarillo, \u201cbecause they already see what I\u2019m doing in my music.\u201dVietnam first allowed independent candidates in 2002, and just seven of a few hundred have won seats in the National Assembly in three elections since, according to an analysis by the United Nations Development Program. These independents have typically been businesspeople or academics who are party members or have deep connections to the government, and most have been weeded out well before voting began by a complex vetting process that the party controls, analysts said. Ms. Mai Khoi, like many other independents this year, is not a party member.The activist candidates this year mainly come from Hanoi, the capital, and Ho Chi Minh City, the country\u2019s business hub, and include writers, lawyers, educators and even a stand-up comedian.\u201cBefore, the National Assembly wasn\u2019t so much part of the national consciousness,\u201d but this year\u2019s crop of independents draws from a far wider cross-section of society, said Edmund J. Malesky, a Vietnam specialist and a professor of political economy at Duke University.Professor Malesky said that the independents were younger than ever and that many were discussing their platforms with a degree of openness that is rare in the one-party state. Debates in the National Assembly have become livelier in recent years, he said, and the rise of nontraditional candidates like Ms. Mai Khoi may reflect a growing interest among ordinary Vietnamese in domestic politics.The candidates do not have a uniform political ideology. Some, like Ms. Mai Khoi, do not consider themselves dissidents. Others, like Nguyen Trang Nhung, describe their candidacies as a direct challenge to a government that often faces heavy criticism from international human rights groups over its jailing of political dissidents.\u201cWe have a one-party regime; I would like to have a multiparty one,\u201d said Ms. Nhung, 34, a businesswoman and activist in Ho Chi Minh City. \u201cIf we have many parties, we can choose which one makes things work better.\u201dOne of the best-known independent candidates is Nguyen Quang A, a Hanoi businessman and activist who tried, and failed, to establish Vietnam\u2019s first independent research institute in 2007. In recent weeks, he said, he has collected 5,000 signatures from a diverse group of supporters that includes government officials, even though that was not technically required.\u201cWe\u2019re trying to expand our space, too,\u201d he said of the activist candidates.But Mr. Quang A conceded that his own bid had almost no chance of succeeding.\u201cThe electoral system is designed to be controlled by the party,\u201d he said.Reached by telephone on Friday, Nguyen Si Dung, the deputy secretary general of the National Assembly, said he was unavailable for comment.Vietnam initially allowed independent candidates as part of broader changes that were partly intended to allow the Communist Party to check the power of the prime minister, said Paul Schuler, a professor of political science at the University of Arizona who is writing a book about the National Assembly.Professor Schuler said that it would be interesting to see how the candidates fared and that if Mr. Quang A made the ballot, it would signal a noticeable \u201cbreak from the past.\u201d But he added that independents did not represent a fundamental challenge to Vietnam\u2019s political system because the Communist Party\u2019s candidate-vetting process still granted senior officials significant power to decide who could run for office.\u201cIf they don\u2019t control the process, then it\u2019s no longer a single-party regime, and I think they\u2019re firmly aware of that,\u201d he said.Danh-Quy Nguyen, the managing editor of the Vietnamese edition of Elle Magazine, said that as a pop singer, Ms. Mai Khoi had a reputation for being outspoken and freethinking, and that over the years, critics had accused her of being \u201ctoo opinionated.\u201d She is a vocal supporter of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender issues and a critic of domestic violence, and society websites have gossiped about her revealing attire.Ms. Mai Khoi is unapologetic about her public persona and political aspirations. But she has been careful to play by the government\u2019s rules as she vies for a seat in the National Assembly.The law bars her from holding political events, for example, so her campaign debut, such as it was, was a quiet meeting with a handful of journalist friends. And the visual centerpiece of her campaign is a digitally created billboard, featuring her face and slogan, that she has posted on Facebook. (The only physical version hangs on a wall in her Ho Chi Minh City apartment, just above her piano.)On Thursday, Ms. Mai Khoi\u2019s bid for the National Assembly passed an initial procedural hurdle, she said. The next test will be meeting with a group of Communist Party-approved voters in her hometown, the southern city of Cam Ranh. She would also need the approval of the Fatherland Front, a powerful Communist Party organization, to run for office in May.But Ms. Mai Khoi said that her campaign, which officially began on March 11, was meant to bring young people into the political process and that she would consider it successful even if she never made the ballot.\u201cI just want to make politics more public,\u201d she said.The crowd at her show on Friday night, at the venue Saigon Outcast, included supporters of her nascent campaign.Huynh Thanh Nguyet Anh, 24, a receptionist at a Porsche dealership here, said that she would vote for Ms. Mai Khoi if the singer is permitted to run and that it would be the first vote of her life.\u201cIt\u2019s got to be someone I can trust,\u201d she said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "2 Senate Democrats Introduce Bill to Curb Activist Hedge Funds", "Date": "2016-03-17", "News": "Supported byTwo Senate Democrats introduced a bill on Thursday that would take aim at activist hedge funds and their ability to act together in \u201cwolf packs\u201d to overtake public companies.The bill would shorten the number of days that activists have to disclose newly acquired shares in a company and force the disclosure of derivatives and other holdings that now don\u2019t have to be reported. It would also redefine the rules about who has to report when they have amassed a greater than 5 percent stake in a company.The bill, by Senator Tammy Baldwin of Wisconsin and Senator Jeffrey A. Merkley of Oregon, comes after years of debate about reforming share ownership disclosures both at the Securities and Exchange Commission and among shareholder advocacy groups. Senator Elizabeth Warren, the Massachusetts Democrat, and Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, who is vying for the Democratic nomination for president, are co-sponsoring the bill.Activism is on the rise. The pending merger of Dow Chemical and DuPont came after months of prodding by Nelson Peltz of Trian Fund Management. Carl C. Icahn threatened a proxy battle at the American International Group before the insurer agreed this year to give board seats to his firm and another activist, John Paulson of Paulson & Company.William A. Ackman has pushed for a merger of Canadian Pacific Railway and Norfolk Southern, which the latter has rejected three times. Mr. Ackman\u2019s fund is also being hurt by the sharp drop in the price of shares of Valeant Pharmaceuticals, with which he first teamed up in 2014 in an unsuccessful campaign to acquire its rival, Allergan.Last year, the number of companies receiving public demands by an activist investor grew 16 percent, to 551, according to Activist Insight. About half the demands sought board seats on the targeted companies, another fifth pushed mergers or other transactions, and 12 percent pushed for share buybacks or sales or spinoffs of real estate.The Senate bill was inspired by what happened at the Wausau Paper Company, the target of the activist fund Starboard Value in 2011. The battle between the two ultimately led to the closing of a paper mill in Brokaw, Wis., eliminating more than 100 jobs and devastating the local economy.\u201cWe cannot allow our economy to be hijacked by a small group of investors who seek only to enrich themselves at the expense of workers, taxpayers and communities,\u201d Ms. Baldwin said on Thursday.Investors have 10 days to report to the S.E.C. when they have acquired more than 5 percent of a public company\u2019s shares, but they don\u2019t have to report derivatives positions and they don\u2019t have to report when they fall below the 5 percent threshold.The bill aims at curbing the power of \u201cwolf packs,\u201d which occur when a lead fund tips off others that a disclosure is about to be made, giving the other funds the opportunity to buy the same stock before the 10-day window is up. The bill would shorten that window to two days.John C. Coffee Jr., a Columbia University Law School professor, has studied the \u201cwolf pack\u201d phenomenon and found abnormal buying in the days immediately leading up to an ownership disclosure.\u201cThis pattern should not be surprising,\u201d he wrote in a paper last May. Those who learn of the pending filing \u201cface a nearly riskless opportunity for profitable trading, if they act quickly.\u201dThe bill would define separate investors acting together as a single group for disclosure requirement purposes and force them to disclose derivatives positions.\u201cActivists are having a chilling effect on reinvestment in the United States as they threaten companies and advocate reduced investment through share buybacks versus investing to build long-term enterprises,\u201d said Hank Newell, the former chief executive of Wausau Paper.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Court Sets Deadline for a Volkswagen Diesel Fix, but Solution Could Prove Elusive", "Date": "2016-03-24", "News": "Supported by\u201cI haven\u2019t heard anything\u201d from the automaker about a solution, said Mr. German, the owner of a 2010 Audi A3 diesel compact wagon in Ithaca, N.Y. \u201cAre they just lying low and hoping this whole thing goes away? It\u2019s a little bit strange.\u201dVolkswagen missed a court deadline on Thursday to present a plan to bring the cars into line with clean air rules, but Judge Charles Breyer at United States District Court in San Francisco gave the company an extension until April 21.If no agreement is reached with the federal government, customers and dealers, a trial would be held this summer to determine what measures Volkswagen should be compelled to make and how much owners would be compensated.Volkswagen admitted that 11 million of its vehicles were equipped with software that was used to cheat on emissions tests. This is how the technology works and what it now means for vehicle owners.Lawyers trying to reach a settlement said during the hearing that they had made \u201csubstantial progress\u201d toward a solution. \u201cThe engineers are working around the clock,\u201d Robert Giuffra, a lawyer for Volkswagen, said during the hearing.The longer it takes for Volkswagen to come up with a way to stop the cars from spewing illegal levels of pollution, the greater the fines it is likely to have to pay the United States government. Car owners themselves face no legal jeopardy, but any repair is also likely to reduce fuel economy and cause parts of the emissions system to wear out more quickly. That will hurt the cars\u2019 resale value, and raise the amount Volkswagen must pay the owners as compensation.Some experts question whether it is even possible to make the cars in the United States conform to the law at a reasonable price. Those experts also cast doubt on the company\u2019s assertion that only a few low-level employees were responsible.People who have closely examined Volkswagen engine technology say that one reason the company cheated in the first place was that its engineers were unable to resolve a fundamental conflict in emissions technology, at least not at a price that fit their budget.Measures that reduce output of nitrogen oxides, which can cause lung ailments, automatically increase production of soot particles, which can cause cancer.If Volkswagen had turned up the equipment that reduced the nitrogen oxides, the additional soot output would have increased the need for the engine to periodically flush the particle filter by spraying diesel fuel into the exhaust system. That in turn would increase fuel consumption and raise the chances the car\u2019s particle filter would become overburdened and break down.That trade-off between soot and nitrogen oxides remains difficult and costly to resolve despite advances in technology since the diesels in question went on sale in the United States. In Europe, it was not as big a problem because limits on nitrogen oxides are not as strict. The few rival companies who sold diesel in the United States addressed these challenges with more expensive pollution-control technologies.Volkswagen, however, was intent on producing lower-cost, small cars and was in a major push to rebuild sales in the United States.Among them is Felix Domke, a self-described hacker who lives in L\u00fcbeck, Germany, who, on eBay, bought an example of the computer used by Volkswagen in its vehicles. He also examined the computer that came with his own car, a Volkswagen diesel van.He showed how the software adjusted variables like the amount of exhaust gas that was recycled back into the motor, one of the methods used to minimize harmful emissions. The software was precisely calibrated to track the simulated city, rural and highway driving that cars undergo during official tests on rollers in laboratories.Outside the cycle \u2014 in other words, under actual on-the-road driving conditions that regulators would not normally see \u2014 the computer turned down the emissions controls in a way that eased the burden on the particle filter, while also saving fuel.Daniel Lange, a former information technology executive at the German carmaker BMW who also spoke at the hackers\u2019 conference, expressed skepticism about Volkswagen\u2019s view that the software manipulation was the work of a small number of low-level employees.Software is heavily documented and it is very unlikely that engineers would have taken the risk of modifying the software without approval at a high level of management, Mr. Lange said in an interview.\u201cIt\u2019s completely unrealistic that a lonely engineer\u201d would have been responsible for the cheating, said Mr. Lange, who is founder and chief executive of Faster IT, a technology consulting firm.Volkswagen has not explained who inside the company was responsible for creating one of the biggest corporate scandals of the last decade. But in a German court filing last month, the company said that members of its management board \u201chad no knowledge of the rule violation.\u201dThe engine control software and onboard computer were provided by Bosch, one of the largest suppliers of electronic components for the auto industry. Bosch has been named along with Volkswagen as a defendant in class-action lawsuits filed by owners of Volkswagen-brand cars.Bosch declined to comment on the lawsuits or provide details about the way the engine software works, citing investigations by the authorities.The Bosch software, also used by other carmakers, can be customized for different vehicles and motors. One question for the courts will be whether Bosch shares any blame because of the relative ease with which the software could be used as a \u201cdefeat device\u201d to evade emissions tests.Another question is why Volkswagen\u2019s top managers never asked themselves why their engineers succeeded where others had failed in producing relatively inexpensive diesel cars that met American standards on nitrogen oxides, which are stricter than those in Europe.\u201cI was beating up on \u2019em pretty hard,\u201d Mr. Lutz said. \u201cThey\u2019re doing it and we can\u2019t? Nobody could figure out how they were complying and their engine technology is very similar to everybody else\u2019s.\u201dMr. German, the owner of the 2010 Audi, who recently moved to Ithaca from Austin, Tex., said by phone that he would gladly accept the car at its prescandal book value, with perhaps a little extra to cover \u201cthe hassle factor.\u201d According to Kelley Blue Book, an Audi A3 like Mr. German\u2019s was worth about $16,300 before the emissions cheating became known and about $14,370 now.\u201cI don\u2019t want my car anymore,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}

I will say, though, that I\u2019ve found conservative leaders on all sides of that question. What I always try to remind people is that the need for deep thinking and good ideas won\u2019t change, no matter what. Politics is like the weather; ideas are like the climate. Confusing them is a common but bad mistake. The struggle for ideas that bring freedom and opportunity to more people \u2014 especially people at the periphery of society \u2014 has to go on no matter what\u2019s going on in politics.The cognitive dissonance isn\u2019t just on the Republican side, however. Sanders proposes showering cash out of helicopters, and as far as I can tell, he is really only proposing higher taxes on the much-regretted billionaires. The truth is that middle-class taxes would have to rise under his spending scenarios.However, looking at the big picture, her economic program is far, far and away the most responsible of all the remaining presidential candidates.As for Clinton\u2019s economic program, there aren\u2019t any shocking surprises: tax cuts for some working families, more spending on infrastructure and research, a higher minimum wage, and so on. Obviously I would do many things differently, like expanding the Earned Income Tax Credit to better assist childless workers instead of hiking the minimum wage. But that\u2019s no surprise.Second, when it comes to cracking down on health costs, there\u2019s nothing that would deliver a bigger bang for the political effort than standing up to the pharmaceutical companies on drug prices.So I think that\u2019s a pretty fine trio of priorities. But what would you rather hear her say?I\u2019m starting to sound like John Edwards now, with his old \u201cTwo Americas\u201d schtick. I feel like I should take a shower.But back to the subject at hand. It\u2019s not low growth, exactly, but rather unbalanced growth that is fueling support for the surprisingly similar populisms of Trump and Sanders. Clinton surely understands that \u201cfree college for all\u201d and similar gewgaws won\u2019t fix what ails us. The situation requires tough-minded policies for balanced economic growth and job creation. A lot of policies that would help us toward these ends, like free trade, share support from economists on the left and right alike \u2014 but they aren\u2019t much in the conversation right now.Now it\u2019s your turn to make a prediction. I get asked this one constantly: Will Hillary be indicted, or is that just a crazy conservative fantasy?I point this out to Democrats who are rooting for the nomination of the eminently defeatable Donald Trump.One last thing: Today we\u2019ll get results from Utah and Arizona, plus Idaho for the Democrats.

{"Headline": "Russia, Light on Cash, Weighs Risks of a Heavy Tax on Oil Giants", "Date": "2016-03-23", "News": "Supported byMemo From RussiaBut the budget strains are worsening as the price decline grinds along, forcing the Kremlin to look for new sources of money \u2014 freezing pensions, withholding wages, raising some taxes, selling off chunks of state-owned companies, even reportedly trimming military outlays.Things have become so tight, insiders say, that the Kremlin is considering cracking open the one piggy bank that was always considered sacrosanct, one that carries long-term consequences for the Russian economy: taxing the funds that oil companies need to invest to ensure future oil production.That move would be the oil industry equivalent of eating the seed corn. The longer the government keeps extracting cash from the crucial oil sector, the greater the damage to the country\u2019s future economic prospects, even if oil prices rebound.\u201cThe only question is the slant of this line,\u201d he said. \u201cThe oil companies are not investing at all in exploration of new deposits because profits on these projects will only come in 10 years. Nobody will invest in these projects.\u201dOver the last two and a half years, the oil industry experienced its deepest downturn since at least the 1990s.This year, new taxes will cost oil companies about 200 billion rubles, or about $2.9 billion. But a far larger tax, reported by Russian news media to be up to $11 billion, is under consideration for the 2017 budget.There is little doubt that Russia needs the money now, and that the oil companies provide an enticing target. Because they are paid in dollars but conduct their domestic business in the battered ruble, Russia\u2019s oil majors have lots of cash. While globally most oil companies are deep in the red, cash reserves industrywide in Russia remain at an estimated $90 billion, a deep and tempting pool for the strapped Kremlin.But Mr. Putin, who personally oversees the energy industries, knows the dangers of taxing the companies too heavily and has long resisted the temptation. \u201cPutin faces a dilemma,\u201d Mr. Krutikhin said.The dilemma stems from the structure of Russia\u2019s oil tax system, which was designed for the state to capture the windfall of profits from high prices of oil and other commodities, rather than leaving them for the country\u2019s oligarchs.The higher the price, the more Russia\u2019s oil companies are paid in taxes. At an oil price of $100 a barrel, for example, the companies were paying taxes of $74, according to Renaissance, a Moscow investment bank. When oil prices collapsed, the government took most of the loss in diminished tax receipts. With oil at $35 a barrel, the tax is about $17, leaving $18 a barrel for the companies \u2014 not too much less than the $30 a barrel they made at the peak.The average cost of producing and transporting a barrel of oil is about $15. Adding a tax of $17 a barrel, when oil is selling for $35, leaves a profit of only $3, a margin that rapidly shrinks as the tax rises, leaving little or nothing to show for an investment.The quandary for the Kremlin is made worse by geology because oil deposits discovered and developed in Soviet times are nearing depletion. The country\u2019s oil future, like that of the United States, lies in offshore and shale projects that are more expensive to develop.Given oil\u2019s outsize role in Russia\u2019s economy, it is no surprise that a fierce fight has erupted over tax policies. The powerful industry and its allies in the Ministry of Energy are resisting tax increases, while equally powerful factions in government want to raise taxes to maintain spending at current levels, not least on the military.A study leaked from the Ministry of Energy, seen as allied with the oil industry, and published last week in the business daily Vedomosti, presented a doomsday scenario. Russia, the analysis predicted, could cease to be an oil power, with output plummeting to half the current level by 2035.The Ministry of Finance, in contrast, has pressed for new taxes on the oil industry as Russia prepares a revised budget for 2016, which is due in June. Vladimir Tikhomirov, chief economist at BCS Financial Group in Moscow, said the government was striving to keep the deficit within the legally required limit of 3 percent of gross domestic product.Even while piling up cash reserves, however, oil companies\u2019 investment rose at a rate of 11 percent, which was lower than inflation of 12.9 percent, last year. \u201cThe response from oil companies has been they will have to cut further into investment programs; otherwise, they will not be able to bring their books into balance,\u201d Mr. Tikhomirov said.Russian companies have not broken ground on a major new field here since the Trebs and Titov, a complex of oil fields in northern Russia, was tapped in 2014 just as Western sanctions took effect and oil prices slumped.Industry lobby groups have pushed back, so far as is possible in Russia\u2019s tightly coiled political system. It would not be the first time oil entered a spiral of declining volumes and rising demands from the state. Short of cash in an oil price downturn in the late Soviet period, the Kremlin squeezed the oil industry. It was deprived of capital, at the time, for such things as imported machines.A diminishing role for the oil industry is not so bad for Russia, politically or economically, Yevgeny G. Yasin, a former minister of economy, said in an interview. Russia should raise taxes on oil companies even if it diminishes the share of extractive industries in the economy in future years, and shift focus to other areas of Russian strength, such as education and science, he said. Instead, the revised budget proposes a 10 percent cut to nonmilitary outlays.\u201cThe United States is successfully developing shale oil so that even if prices go up, it will only lead to more shale oil production\u201d that would compete with new Russian output coming online years from now, Mr. Yasin said.\u201cIf we want Russia to be a developed country, we should orient ourselves toward the innovation economy,\u201d he added.\u201cThe fat years are over.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Cuomo Offers Tax Cut in Effort to Strike a Budget Deal", "Date": "2016-03-30", "News": "Supported byALBANY \u2014 Offering a billion-dollar tax cut and assurances that New York City would not be stuck with a $250 million Medicaid bill, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo inched closer on Wednesday to presenting an on-time budget with one major issue seemingly standing in his way \u2014 an increase in the minimum wage.Mr. Cuomo has faced strong resistance to his plan \u2014 under which the minimum wage would increase to $15 statewide by July 2021, with faster increases in New York City \u2014 in large part because of trepidation about such a pay level in upstate communities, which have long lagged behind downstate economically. Those concerns continued to percolate through the State Senate, where Republicans hold a slim majority and where upstate members repeatedly have said that $15 is simply too high for many employers to bear.The governor, cognizant of those complaints, has offered a variety of ways to mitigate the impact, signaling an openness to raise the wage to different levels in different regions. He has proposed allowing the state\u2019s budget division to review the economic impact after three years to determine if the wage should continue to rise \u2014 a \u201csafety valve\u201d of sorts, said Mr. Cuomo, who praised his plan as \u201cthe perfect design.\u201d He also seemed willing to extend the phase-in periods upstate, meaning that some parts may not reach the $15 level for years to come.In remarks to reporters outside his office, Mr. Cuomo acknowledged the concerns of Senate Republicans, saying, \u201cThe last thing I want is anything that slows the growth of the upstate economy.\u201d But, he added, \u201cI believe the minimum wage increase, done correctly, will stimulate the upstate economy, but that is a calibration.\u201dThe governor also seemed to sweeten the budget proposal, announcing the framework of a deal for $1 billion in tax cuts for families earning less than $300,000, echoing elements of a plan outlined by Republicans in early March.Even so, it was not at all certain that the doubts of some upstate senators were assuaged about the $15 wage, which is being pushed, perhaps by design, in an election year.\u201cWe\u2019ve had any number of people tell us that they cannot live with what the governor is proposing,\u201d said State Senator Rich Funke, a Republican from the Rochester area. \u201cAnd any number of us, in there, cannot live with what the governor is proposing.\u201dThe deadline for the state budget is Thursday at midnight. Mr. Cuomo, a Democrat who has prided himself on efficient governance, has described this budget process as \u201cmore tedious\u201d than years past, though he has remained optimistic that it will be approved on time.Still, the morning\u2019s events did not augur well for a quick deal: Mr. Cuomo\u2019s negotiating partners \u2014 Carl E. Heastie, the Bronx Democrat who serves as Assembly speaker, and John J. Flanagan, the Republican majority leader in the Senate \u2014 left a long meeting with the governor with little to say, beyond tersely confirming that they were still working.By late afternoon, however, Mr. Heastie said that from the Assembly\u2019s perspective, one budgetary hurdle \u2014 Mr. Cuomo\u2019s proposal to find $250 million in Medicaid savings, largely from New York City \u2014 had nearly been cleared. Under pressure from the Assembly, the governor clarified this week that the money would come from savings to be worked out between the city and the state, rather than from the city\u2019s budget.\u201cIt\u2019s better, we\u2019re closer, but we\u2019re not there yet,\u201d Mr. Heastie said. \u201cMedicaid for us, it kind of sucked up a lot of oxygen in the room, and the fact that that\u2019s better means we\u2019re in a better position.\u201dThere were other signs that the deadline was fast approaching: Late Wednesday evening, a few of the less controversial bills in the budget package were being printed.Part of legislators\u2019 negotiating power lies in Mr. Cuomo\u2019s attachment to his streak of on-time budgets \u2014 five years running, more or less. And while Mr. Cuomo has called the negotiations orderly and cordial, a sense of hardball did enter the talks when the governor said he was open to using a stick of his own: swaying the state\u2019s commission on legislative pay, three of whose members he appoints, to withhold raises for state lawmakers.State lawmakers have not had a raise since 1999, and the commission is expected to make its first recommendation for salary increases in November. But, Mr. Cuomo said, lawmakers had to earn their raises.\u201cWhen you say, \u2018I believe I deserve a raise,\u2019 the basis should be your performance,\u201d Mr. Cuomo said, citing passing ethics reform and an on-time budget as measures of their work. \u201cPerformance matters. If they don\u2019t pass the budget on time, obviously, that is a failure of performance.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Obama Faces a Tough Balancing Act Over South China Sea", "Date": "2016-03-29", "News": "Supported byNews AnalysisExpectations that anything of substance will be accomplished in the 90-minute meeting between Mr. Obama and Mr. Xi are minimal. So it may be surprising that some analysts here and in the United States say it would be relatively easy for the two leaders to ease tensions.Mr. Xi could pledge not to go any further in militarizing disputed islands, said Shi Yinhong, a professor of international relations at Renmin University in Beijing. In return, he said, the Americans could agree to stop sending warships and aircraft on \u201cfreedom of navigation\u201d patrols into territory claimed by China.The United States Navy has conducted two such patrols in the past several months, and there is a push in Congress for more.An American analyst, Douglas H. Paal of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, said a show of restraint by both sides would be helpful.\u201cOffers of reassurance that restraint on new actions by China will lead to restraint on new significant or permanent military deployments by the U.S.\u201d would be a start, he said. Beijing, for example, could agree not to use landfill to build up the Scarborough Shoal, part of the contested Spratly Islands, over which the Philippines lost control to China.China has been feverishly piling sand onto reefs in the South China Sea, creating seven new islets in the region and straining already taut geopolitical tensions.In China, even though Mr. Xi has orchestrated the South China Sea gambit, some foreign policy experts disagree with his stance. Those who are unhappy with his actions argue that the expansion alienates China\u2019s Asian neighbors, pushing them closer to the United States \u2014 the opposite of what Mr. Xi is trying to achieve through trade and diplomacy.Some Chinese scholars privately assert that in a gesture toward recognizing the authority of international maritime law, China could more closely set out its claim to the region by defining the so-called nine-dash line.The nine-dash line is a U-shape line that China has drawn on maps since the late 1940s to mark its claims over most of the South China Sea. The line overlaps territory claimed by countries including the Philippines, Vietnam and Malaysia. But China has never given the precise coordinates of the line, and the ambiguity gives Beijing room to maneuver.The Chinese Foreign Ministry quietly proposed doing just that in 2011, a year before Mr. Xi came to power, and then dropped the idea, said Mr. Paal, who was the director of the American Institute in Taiwan in the administration of George W. Bush.It is unlikely to happen now.According to Professor Shi, \u201cThe South China Sea is strategic hardball, and it goes to key national interests.\u201dLast week, at a briefing on Mr. Xi\u2019s trip, Li Baodong, the vice foreign minister, made no attempt to sugarcoat the issue. When it comes to the South China Sea, he said sternly, China \u201chas its own point of view and position.\u201d Under Mr. Xi, China has built artificial islands in disputed parts of the Spratly archipelago, equipping them with runways and ports capable of projecting substantial military power. In the Paracel Islands, which China has controlled since the early 1970s after pushing out Vietnam, the Chinese military has installed surface-to-air missile batteries and powerful radar facilities.Those projects strengthen China\u2019s hand in the strategic waterway, analysts said, in ways that it has never done before.Mr. Xi wants \u201cto force Asian maritime neighbors and the United States to accept the new status quo,\u201d Professor Shi said.Chinese children are taught that much of the South China Sea has belonged to China since ancient times, making any move seen as reducing Beijing\u2019s claim seem a capitulation, scholars say.The same day he meets with Mr. Xi, Mr. Obama will meet with the leaders of America\u2019s two chief Asian allies, President Park Geun-hye of South Korea, and Prime Minister Shinzo Abe of Japan.But in some quarters in China, there is probably quiet satisfaction about the idea that those American allies would no longer have the support they have long enjoyed, said Evans J. R. Revere, a former senior State Department specialist on East Asia. \u201cI strongly suspect China\u2019s People\u2019s Liberation Army is pleased to know that Trump would be prepared to dismantle the forward-deployed military presence that has kept the region at peace for over a generation,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Once I Saw Light in Iran. Now It\u2019s Mostly Shadows.", "Date": "2016-02-29", "News": "Supported byOp-Ed ContributorI REMEMBER vividly the first time I ever voted in an Iranian election. It was a balmy summer day in June 2001, in the election that won the reformist president Mohammad Khatami a second term. The blue stamp was the first on the voting page of my identification card, and I felt a sharp, exhilarating pride.That election is much on my mind now, as I watch the results of Friday\u2019s voting with my family, disagreeing on what it might mean for the future.Back in 2001, Iran was heading down an irrevocable path toward internal reform, a process untainted by any Western intrusion, with citizens and progressive-minded leaders showing the way. Those leaders seemed, at the time, as exciting as Vaclav Havel and the revolutionary cleric Musa al-Sadr rolled into one. Elections felt \u2014 unlike the vote this past weekend \u2014 full of consequence, a genuine chance to recast political power rather than an exercise in slightly recalibrating it.The reformists in those days were punchy; they invoked Karl Popper, and said one day freedom would come to Iran, and we would all support the Palestinians and thumb our noses at the West and be a beacon of progress for the rest of the Middle East, which in those days was a political wasteland, the kind of place that \u201cdidn\u2019t have politics.\u201dIn Tehran, dissidents didn\u2019t cower in the shadows as in Tunis or Cairo. They would write newspaper columns saying things like, \u201cMy family gave three martyrs to the war with Iraq; I\u2019m the only son left, I support change, and have the right to speak.\u201d People would throng newspaper kiosks and buy five papers each.I reported on trials where feminist lawyers, representing the families of dissident students killed by paramilitary forces, raised their voices against turbaned judges. To be a part of all this as a journalist felt like some sort of heart-stopping privilege; I would lay awake at night thinking about the day\u2019s conversations, and how it seemed that history was not made by charismatic leaders, but the daily decision of ordinary people not to be scared.But the seasoned correspondents in the Western press corps, I recall, were distinctly unmoved by all this fizz. They asked pedantic questions about constitutional reform, unelected institutions and parallel security services. They were no fun at all, and seemed to me, at the time, calcified cynics, immune to the buoyancy of Iranian youth and the vitality of the Tehran intelligentsia. They were unaffected by the revolutionary songs the students used to sing, songs that would bring me to tears, and didn\u2019t seem to appreciate how radical painting, avant-garde theater, and a highly sophisticated population, were reshaping Iran from below. A country was its people, I used to think.Today, I am the cynic. When anyone under 25, or anyone compulsively protective of the Islamic Republic, writes passionately about the state reforming on its own terms, about the choice between \u201cbad and worse,\u201d I go cold. If the past 15 years have made anything clear, it is that meaningful, legislated change does not emerge out of grass-roots evolution. Iran has had it all: hadith-driven feminism, vibrant civil society, a culture of engagement with politics and a patience for slow, internal reform. If these were the key ingredients required for political change, Iran would have had it by now. The hard truth is that those things are not enough. A country is both its people and its leaders.The reform-minded in Tehran are energized, but their strategists talk of making the economy a priority and taming the extreme hard-liners, rather than pursuing social or political liberalization. The reformists who used to shake their fists and claim that Islam was on their side now speak about the importance of moving slowly, grateful simply to be out of prison. Genuine reformism, as a relevant intellectual and political culture or strategy, is effectively stalled, waiting for some major shift of circumstance, or the much dreamed-for hard-line retrenchment, to make it viable again.I often think back to the young journalist I once was, eyeing the veterans with dismay. I was willing to do anything, wear the head scarf cheerfully when dealing with Iranian officials outside the country, spar with American conservatives determined to paint Iran black, if it would make a difference to how Iran was regarded. I remember saying over and over again, I reject the victim narrative. We are not victims, not yet, because our thinking and our culture remains passionately independent; we are ruled by the Islamic Republic yet we are not of it.But today, all those inspiring young people I sat in cafes with and wrote about aren\u2019t so young anymore. They\u2019re in their 40s, scattered across the world feeling dislocated and wasted, or stuck inside the country; they stopped believing they could change things, and became different people.One of the first friends I made in Tehran was a young fellow Iranian-American named Siamak Namazi. We sparred a lot over politics. I used to praise the Islamic Republic for its literacy rates and the astonishingly high number of university-educated women. \u201cJust look how far ahead of Egypt we are,\u201d I would say, to his irritation. \u201cStop comparing us to Egypt, that\u2019s no measure for Iran,\u201d he would say. \u201cWe should be comparing ourselves to South Korea, or if anything, Turkey.\u201dNow that Iran has rehabilitated itself by signing a nuclear deal with the West, the unyielding media images of a death-cult totalitarian land that I used to push back against have given way to elegant fashion spreads, lists of Persian foods that blow your tastes buds away and features touting skiing in Iran over the Alps. There is too little outrage that Tehran is holding another American citizen and imprisoning his aged father.Is the image of Iran that holds sway at any given moment tethered to any reality, or is it simply a projection of what we wish and require of it at the time? Many years ago, I was determined to see only the light in Iran, but now, perhaps like those before me who had friends imprisoned or had been watching long enough to know better, my gaze is drawn mostly to the shadows.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump and Sanders Test Economic Model Predicting a G.O.P. Win", "Date": "2016-03-19", "News": "Supported byStrategiesIf this were anything like a normal year, the Republicans would be favored to take the White House. That, at least, is what Ray Fair\u2019s economic model has been saying consistently since November 2014.Mr. Fair, a professor of economics at Yale and the author of \u201cPredicting Presidential Elections and Other Things,\u201d also says his model may well be wrong about this election. \u201cEach election has weird things in it, yet the model usually works pretty well,\u201d he said. \u201cThis year, though, I don\u2019t know. This year really could be different.\u201dProfessor Fair has been tracking and predicting elections in real time since 1978 with a good deal of success, using an approach that continues to be provocative. He ruthlessly excludes nearly all the details that are the basic diet of conventional political analysts \u2014 items like the burning issues of the day, the identities, personalities and speeches of the candidates and the strength of their campaign organizations. In fact, his model pays no attention whatsoever to the day-to-day fireworks of the political campaigns.Instead, he considers only economics, finding that economic factors usually correlate well with political outcomes. Using two open-source econometric models that he posts on his website, he first estimates the strength of the economy. He uses that economic analysis to predict the popular vote for the two main parties, the Democrats and the Republicans. He comes up with his first estimate two years before the presidential election and provides updates at regular intervals.In November 2014, he did his first projection for the 2016 election and found that the odds favored the Republican candidate \u2014 whoever that may be. The Republican side has been leading consistently ever since, and the margin has increased as he has fed in new data.From the blinkered viewpoint of the model, which sees the world through a narrowly focused economic lens, the problem, for the Democrats, starts with a handicap that is built into the equations: A two-term incumbent is in the White House. When that is the case, the opposition party has a roughly three-percentage-point edge, which can be surmounted fairly easily if the economy is quite strong. That\u2019s because historical data suggests that an incumbent president tends to be blamed for a bad economy and receive credit for a good one, Professor Fair says. That blame or credit spills over to the candidate from the president\u2019s own party.This time around, while the economy is not in recession, it is not particularly strong either, using the main criterion favored by Professor Fair. That is the rate of growth of real per capita gross domestic product. He estimates that for the nine months leading to this November\u2019s election, that growth rate, on an annualized basis, will be just under 2 percent, roughly in line with consensus forecasts. A growth surge could change the results of the model, but right now that doesn\u2019t seem likely, he said.In his latest update, done in late January, the spread exceeded the model\u2019s margin of error, suggesting that the ultimate Democratic Party candidate will have an uphill climb.\u201cThat\u2019s what the model shows,\u201d Professor Fair says. And the economic backdrop is worth noting, he says, though he\u2019s not certain how accurate the model will turn out to be this year. Clearly, the factors that Professor Fair excludes do matter. What\u2019s interesting is that often, the economy matters more.It probably was incorrect in the 1992 election, a terrible one for the model, which predicted that President George H. W. Bush would be re-elected. Ross Perot received 19 percent of the vote, probably hurting President Bush in ways not captured by the model, Professor Fair says. That was also the election in which the campaign of the victor, Bill Clinton, relied on the mantra, \u201cIt\u2019s the economy, stupid,\u201d which could also be the slogan for Professor Fair\u2019s model. He tweaked the model after that election, emphasizing economic factors even more. That was the last time he altered the model.I asked Professor Fair whether he believed that he should alter the model again, to accommodate factors like the personalities of the candidates, and the polarization and potential fracturing of the two political parties. What if voters this year cross party lines in larger numbers than usual? What if the two-party alignment is being transformed into something new?\u201cThe model might not pick any of that up,\u201d Professor Fair said. \u201cI think we\u2019ll have to wait and see how it does. Even if the model is off this year, I might not change it. The economy will continue to be important. It\u2019s possible this is simply a unique year.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Snowboarding, Once a High-Flying Sport, Crashes to Earth", "Date": "2016-03-06", "News": "Supported byAs the Swiss snowboarder Iouri Podladtchikov twisted, flipped and spun above the halfpipe at X Games Oslo last week on his way to a silver medal, the bottom of his board \u2014 one of the more valuable pieces of advertising real estate in the sport \u2014 displayed no corporate logo. Instead, it was adorned with an artistic design he had created for a college class assignment.The reason for the triumph of art over commerce: Podladtchikov, 27, the 2014 Olympic halfpipe champion, no longer has a board sponsor.Snowboarding \u2014 which scarcely existed 30 years ago and took over ski resorts around the world seemingly overnight, adding 5 million participants in two decades \u2014 has tumbled to earth recently. As the sport has been abandoned by participants and advertisers, equipment sales and sponsorship opportunities for athletes have dipped below their peak numbers of five years ago.\u201cIt\u2019s gotten really challenging,\u201d said Podladtchikov\u2019s agent, Circe Wallace, a former professional rider. \u201cWe\u2019ve got one-percenters in snowboarding, and then everyone else fighting for amateur dollars.\u201dAt the U.S. Open in Vail, Colo., one of the final competitive events of the season, the American Louie Vito was eliminated in the halfpipe semifinals Thursday. A 2010 Olympian and a two-time Winter X Games medalist, Vito was one of nearly a dozen riders sponsored by Nike. When the company discontinued its snow-sports division in 2014, several leading pro riders faced an uncertain future because other companies \u2014 many in the midst of slashing their rosters, too \u2014 could not afford to sign them all, reordering the entire market.\u201cA few bad winters and Nike pulling out meant a lot of good riders without a boot sponsor and an outerwear sponsor,\u201d said Vito, who also does not have a board sponsor and rides a board with his initials on the bottom. \u201cIt was a problem.\u201dAt the Winter Games in Sochi, Russia, Podladtchikov rode a board with the logo for Quiksilver, a billion-dollar board-sports apparel maker. The company filed for bankruptcy protection in September.Marie Case, the managing director for Board-Trac, a lifestyle research and marketing company focusing on action sports, said retail distribution that carried the culture of board sports across the country eventually proved too much.\u201cIt got oversaturated,\u201d Case said.A weakened global economy, shifting weather patterns and changing tastes and technology have added up to create a challenging atmosphere for snowboarding.According to the trade group SnowSports Industries America, snowboarding peaked in popularity with nearly 8.2 million participants in the 2010-11 season, declining in each of the next three years.Last season, there was a slight increase, to almost 7.7 million participants, because of growth among those under 17 and women 18 and older.Equipment sales have also declined. According to the National Sporting Goods Association, which tracks retail sales, snowboard equipment sales are down $60 million annually from 2007. SnowSports Industries America has also reported flat or declining equipment sales across skiing and snowboarding during the past five years. Preliminary data from this season indicates that although snowboard equipment sales have increased 25 percent across the Western United States, they are down 4 percent nationally.Variable snowfall totals have not helped, either. Twenty-five percent of snowboarders live on the West Coast, and California had been in a historic four-year drought until this El Ni\u00f1o season. Snow has also been scarce in the Northeast for much of this winter.\u201cThe original challenge is the weather dependency,\u201d said John Lacy, the president of Burton Snowboards, an industry pioneer. \u201cTo not have snow across the East Coast for this current winter really has an impact on getting people\u2019s mind-set on getting up to the mountain.\u201dAs snowboarding expanded from an outlaw sport banned at most ski resorts to a popular addition to the Olympics, it did so at the expense of Alpine skiing. Participation in that sport has been in free fall, with two million fewer participants than 20 years ago. With the old antagonism between skiers and snowboarders a thing of the past, skiing has co-opted much of the equipment technology, style and attitude of snowboarding. Freeskiing features many of the same tricks, on the same terrain, as snowboarding and grew by nearly a million participants from 2010-11 to 2014-15.Snowboarding and freeskiing are now in the Olympics, the venue in 2014 for Podladtchikov\u2019s upset of Shaun White, which was a ratings leader for NBC at the Sochi Games. Another snowboarding discipline, big air, in which riders soar 40 feet while performing tricks for judges, will be added to the program at the 2018 Games in Pyeongchang, South Korea.Yet television is no longer as dominant a medium for live events like snowboarding. Options for live streaming have affected ratings and advertising revenue and have made the cost of staging events prohibitive, said Chris Stiepock, a vice president for NBC Sports Ventures who, for two decades, worked in a production and marketing role for ESPN\u2019s X Games.\u201cAt ESPN, X Games was deemed a phenomenal marketing expense to get young people to watch ESPN, ESPN2 and ESPN.com,\u201d Stiepock said. \u201cThese days, it\u2019s no longer acceptable to chalk up a loss to a marketing loss.\u201dTelevision ratings for the Winter X Games are down compared with last year, and viewership for live streaming was up 58 percent this year, said Danny Chi, a spokesman for ESPN. And NBC announced last month that it would no longer stage the Dew Tour, a winter sports competition featuring snowboarding that has been scaled back to one event, from three.Even as television helped take snowboarding into the mainstream, that did not necessarily translate into more riders buying more gear, said Pat Bridges, the creative director at Snowboarder Magazine.Noting that the X Games were typically held in late January and the Winter Olympics in February, after the seasonal peak for equipment sales, Bridges said, \u201cWe\u2019ve never been a win-on-Sunday, sell-on-Monday phenomenon.\u201dBecause of an editing error, an earlier version of a picture caption with this article erroneously attributed a quotation to Iouri Podladtchikov. It was Circe Wallace, not Podladtchikov, who said, \u201cWe\u2019ve got one-percenters in snowboarding, and then everyone else fighting for amateur dollars.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Peculiar \u201960s Designer Who Redefined Men\u2019s Fashion", "Date": "2016-02-29", "News": "Supported byHe went by the name of Mr. Fish. And today, his gender-bending look \u2014 silk blouses, swishy florals and all \u2014 is back. 8 PhotosIf there\u2019s one word to sum up the fellows on the runway this season, and the reassertion of masculine flamboyance in fashion, it\u2019s \u2018\u2018pretty.\u2019\u2019 They looked pretty in J.\u2009W. Anderson\u2019s blousy shirting and ankle\u00ad-strap ballerina flats; in Thom Browne\u2019s geisha get\u00adups; in all that flowing, flowery stuff at Gucci. Alessandro Michele, the creative director of Gucci, has a penchant for brocade and ribbons in his men\u2019s wear, for cap sleeves and pajama suits in bright silks and lots of pussy-bow blouses knotted around young men\u2019s throats.These new dogs are actually up to some fairly old tricks. Michele acknowledges it: His collections, for all their pontificating cant about notions of the contemporaneous, and philosophical quotes from Roland Barthes, are rooted in turn-of-the\u00ad-\u201970s nostalgia. More precisely, in a small store, l\u00adong forgotten, in Mayfair, London, whose shopping bags carried the slogan \u2018\u2018Peculiar to Mr. Fish.\u2019\u2019 Because the clothing they contained was frequently peculiar \u2014 even in late 1960s London.The designer was Michael Fish \u2014 a name he shares with a BBC meteorologist far more widely known, but whose impact on the dress of the everyday man is far less important. While designing for the distinguished 19th-century men\u2019s outfitter Turnbull & Asser in 1965, Mr. Fish, as he liked to be called, originated the broad, brightly \u00adpatterned neckwear that became known as the \u2018\u2018kipper\u2019\u2019 tie. At least he\u2019s credited as such. (Ties had already crept wider among the outer echelons of society, such as the post\u00adwar zoot suiters, whose fashion was a form of sartorial rebellion.) Turnbull & Asser\u2019s \u2018\u2018kipper\u2019\u2019 foulards occupied the acceptable side of psychedelic male attire, adopted by the everyman, and, indeed, were introduced stateside by Ralph Lauren a year later, when an order for 1,200 placed by Neiman Marcus would help him found a company called Polo.But soon Fish would contribute to a seismic shift in men\u2019s wear across gender gaps and income brackets. Like Michele and his Gucci reinvention, he had perfect timing. Men in the mid-\u201960s, amid the sexual revolution, feminism and the influence of musicians like Mick Jagger and the Beatles, began to embrace pageantry and explore new modes of dressing in a manner unseen since the late 18th century. When Fish, a 26-year-old working\u00ad-class boy from Essex in a similar mold to David Bowie and John Lennon, opened his store in 1966, he became the movement\u2019s leading architect. Many of the signature looks from the late \u201960s \u2014 plush velours, heavily figured silks, foppishly high\u00ad button collars, knotted cravats and suits in any (and every) shade other than gray, black or navy \u2014 can be traced back to pieces in his eponymous, hellfire-red emporium. He dressed music royalty as well as a steady clientele of ordinary, if deep-pocketed, men. The designer himself described his clothes as \u2018\u2018pretty,\u2019\u2019 while the slightly more verbose Esquire columnist George Frazier dubbed the era\u2019s fashion transformation the \u2018\u2018Peacock Revolution.\u2019\u2019A splashy historian at heart, Fish referenced the 18th century in rich brocades, embroidery and military braid, and in his dandy highwayman shirts, ruffled of sleeve and bowed at neck. His \u2018\u2018dress for men,\u2019\u2019 sported by both Jagger and Bowie, had lines not dissimilar to the elongated shirts of the period; other Fish shirts were banded like Renaissance doublets. His mash-up of those references resulted in a stylistic bouillabaisse where history meets modernity: a 1940s-style trench coat rubbing shoulders with a maharajah\u2019s Nehru-collar suit; a fur cape with a pastel-pink trouser-suit. Fabrics were consistently lush \u2014 silks, brocades, velvets \u2014 with his most basic suits costing around $120, or about $1,000 today.That proved Fish\u2019s downfall. In events that underscore the tribulations still plaguing today\u2019s experimental designers, his original backer, John Barry Sainsbury, scion of the founders of the British supermarket chain, withdrew funding in the early \u201970s. The loss left Fish floundering. He took on new investors and tried moving to a different location, but the economy had depressed, and tastes had shifted. It was difficult for a designer whose particular aesthetic defined the \u201960s not to seem out of date a decade later. He later designed silk robes, among other things, for the New York label Sulka; in 1978, he was employed as a greeter at the Embassy Club, London\u2019s hedonistic counterpart to Studio 54.There\u2019s an undeniable whiff of Fish in this season\u2019s shows. It\u2019s in the clothes but, almost more importantly, in the attitude: the exuberance, the unapologetic decoration, the notion of the other. And in an odd twist of fate, a London men\u2019s wear entrepreneur, David Mason, recently purchased the rights to Fish\u2019s name, with plans to relaunch the line soon. \u2018\u2018You have to think differently before you can dress differently,\u2019\u2019 said Fish, an aphorism that could easily be ascribed to Michele or, indeed, to J.\u2009W. Anderson. Men were then, as now, suddenly thinking differently about their clothes, willing to experiment, to take risks. Fifty years ago, Fish was there, ready to help them slip into something a little less comfortable.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "In Shift, Obama Won\u2019t Open Southeast Atlantic Coast to Drilling", "Date": "2016-03-15", "News": "Supported byThe emotions were the same, just on opposite sides of the energy-environmental divide, when the Interior Department announced Tuesday that the administration was yanking Atlantic drilling off the table. And almost everyone was shocked.Obama administration officials said Tuesday that the decision was driven by many factors, but two stood out: an organized outpouring of opposition from the mayors and municipal councils in more than 100 of the coastal communities in the four states that would be affected by the drilling, and concern from the Pentagon that oil and gas exploration could threaten activities around Virginia\u2019s Naval Station Norfolk, the world\u2019s largest naval base.\u201cWe heard from many corners that now is not the time to offer oil and gas leasing off the Atlantic coast,\u201d Interior Secretary Sally Jewell said. \u201cWhen you factor in conflicts with national defense, economic activities such as fishing and tourism, and opposition from many local communities, it simply doesn\u2019t make sense to move forward with any lease sales in the coming five years.\u201dRepublicans reacted angrily to the move. House Speaker Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin said: \u201cPresident Obama is so intent on solidifying his radical climate legacy that he has backed out of his commitment to a large, bipartisan coalition of state leaders. These states simply want to explore their own energy potential, but the president\u2019s reversal has disenfranchised them of this chance. This is a lost opportunity for new jobs and economic growth in these coastal states.\u201dBut while Obama administration officials knew they would face an angry response to the move, they also benefited politically from another factor: The price of oil has plunged to near record lows, easing the public demand for fresh drilling.When developing the initial Atlantic drilling plan last year, Obama administration officials said they were chiefly listening to four people: Virginia\u2019s Democratic governor, Terry McAuliffe, and Pat McCrory, Nikki R. Haley and Nathan Deal, the Republican governors of North Carolina, South Carolina and Georgia. The governors told Mr. Obama they wanted the drilling, and they were backed by majorities in their state legislatures and senators.That initial January 2015 proposal, reflecting the wishes of the coastal state governors, came as part of the Interior Department\u2019s mandated release of regular five-year plans governing the federally owned waters of the nation\u2019s outer continental shelf.As they sought to revise and fine-tune the draft plan, the administration opened it for public comments. That tapped different voices in those states.Residents of coastal communities feared that drilling in the Atlantic would bring a repeat of the 2010 Deepwater Horizon disaster in the Gulf of Mexico, which killed 11 men and sent millions of barrels of oil spewing onto beaches.Mayors of a handful of small coastal communities assembled to pass resolutions asking Mr. Obama to take the Atlantic out of the drilling plan, sending those resolutions to the Interior Department. Environmental advocates began to organize aggressively. One group, Oceana, contacted mayors up and down the coast, urging them to pass similar resolutions.\u201cWe thought, maybe we could replicate this and scale it,\u201d said Jacqueline Savitz, a vice president of Oceana. \u201cAnd then we started seeing numbers like 30 resolutions and 50 resolutions.\u201dEventually, more than 106 coastal cities and towns in the coastal states enacted similar resolutions. Oceana teamed with regional groups, including the Southern Environmental Law Center. The groups covered lawns and beaches with \u201cNo to drilling\u201d signs, but focused their attention on pushing through municipal actions that would resonate in Washington. They also worked behind the scenes to coordinate several anti-drilling opinion pieces in local newspapers from Richmond to Charleston.In November 2015 and January 2016, Oceana arranged for several local coastal government and business leaders to travel to Washington to meet with White House officials, including Mr. Obama\u2019s top environmental policy adviser, Brian Deese, as well as with Abigail Hopper, the director of the Interior Department\u2019s Bureau of Ocean Energy Management. At the January meeting, Ms. Savitz presented the officials with a thick binder of the municipal resolutions, covered with a map highlighting all the towns that had passed those resolutions, dropping it on the desk with a thud.Frank Knapp, the president of the South Carolina Small Business Chamber of Commerce, was at those meetings. \u201cIt was clear that while they had heard from the governors, they hadn\u2019t heard from the smaller local groups,\u201d Mr. Knapp said. \u201cI talked to them about the threat to our tourist economy.\u201d In particular, Mr. Knapp stressed to the officials that even the process of seismic testing, which uses blasts of sound underwater to determine whether there was oil and gas, could distress coastal residents.Outside of those meetings, Ms. Hopper was traveling the region, asking for resident input in dozens of meetings.The Republican governors were not assuaged. \u201cPresident Obama\u2019s total reversal can only be described as a special political favor to far-left activists,\u201d Mr. McCrory said in a statement.In South Carolina, Ms. Haley, speaking at a news conference, said the administration had turned \u201caround to pull the rug out from under us.\u201dIn Virginia, Mr. McAuliffe suggested that there would be a way to move forward with the drilling after reassuring the Pentagon. \u201cToday\u2019s announcement is an opportunity to work with the Department of Defense to address the concerns they have raised, and to ensure that any offshore energy exploration is coupled with a revenue-sharing agreement that benefits our Commonwealth,\u201d he said in a statement.Because of an editing error, an earlier version of this article quoted incorrectly from comments by North Carolina Gov.

Are you tired of a handful of billionaires running our economy?\u201dNor, for that matter, was it much changed from his address to a spaghetti dinner of the Addison County Community Action Group in 1984, when he called for a \u201cpolitical revolution\u201d and urged working people to take power from a \u201cvery small group of wealthy people.\u201dIt is a political score Mr. Sanders has been singing for the last 40 years, and he does not seem ready to stop anytime soon. Regardless of the results on the scoreboard, the state on the map, the year or even the decade, Mr. Sanders has talked with clockwork consistency about an economy rigged against the working class, a campaign finance system that corrupts politicians and a corporate media that obscures the truth.\u201cYou could take one of his speeches from 1981, play it in the campaign this year, and no one would know, except his voice sounds a little bit younger,\u201d said Terry Bouricius, a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of Mr. Sanders\u2019s who was elected with him to the city government here that year and who has followed his career closely since.While politicians constantly try to stay on message, Mr. Sanders is the king of message discipline. While other candidates have been lampooned for robotic redundancies or caricatured as cut-and-paste campaigners, Mr. Sanders has made oratorical consistency his calling card.Mr. Sanders is not opposed to emphasizing different notes depending on the venue. In the South he talks more about civil rights, in the Rust Belt he hits trade harder, and his campaign said that in Wisconsin, which votes on April 5, he will highlight campaign finance reform.But they are simply variations on a theme.Matt Motyl, a political psychologist at the University of Illinois at Chicago who is studying how the candidates speak, said that while most politicians will adjust their language, if not their message, to what they believe the crowd wants to hear, Mr. Sanders does not.\u201cHe\u2019s peculiar in that he doesn\u2019t really respond to that,\u201d he said.To his detractors, Mr. Sanders\u2019s repetition makes him a doctrinaire ideologue, a broken record who lacks intellectual flexibility and fails to see the world any differently now than he did as a 20-something radical firebrand.Asked if Mr. Sanders had ever been forced to change his thinking, his campaign said that he had cast a vote for the war in Afghanistan, but then called for the withdrawal of American troops when the war seemed to become a quagmire. Other than that, said Michael Briggs, his spokesman, the senator had been \u201cremarkably consistent.\u201d There have been rare moments in Mr. Sanders\u2019s career in which the two chief tenets of his socialist worldview \u2014 a critique of American militarism and exploitation of the working class \u2014 have come into conflict.According to the Associated Press, Donald J. Trump and Hillary Clinton have each won enough delegates to claim their party\u2019s nomination for president.In 1983, he found himself in a tight spot when his allies in the peace movement protested at a local General Electric plant that made Gatling guns used in El Salvador. Mr. Sanders had urged the protesters to leave the unionized workers alone, saying, \u201cNot everybody has the luxury of choosing where they are going to work.\u201dMr. Bouricius, who had a front-row seat to Mr. Sanders\u2019s anguish, said issues like war and militarism were important to him. \u201cBut they were all seen as one step down from what he saw as the fundamental issues, which was capitalism and the privilege of wealth,\u201d he said.That clarity has been critical to Mr. Sanders\u2019s aura of authenticity and has attracted millions of young voters. It has also provided a stark contrast with Mrs. Clinton, who has echoed him by saying \u201cthe economy is rigged in favor of those at the top\u201d but who still has trouble convincing voters she is trustworthy.In the 1970s, Mr. Sanders argued his message from the political fringe, and then, starting in 1981, from his perch as the Socialist mayor of Burlington. From that office he sent news releases like one that read, \u201cIf the working people and people of moderate income do not become increasingly involved in the contemporary political struggles then the political decisions will continue to reflect the interests of the small clique of money people who presently dominate state and national politics.\u201dThe Burlington Free Press highlighted a quotation of Mr. Sanders\u2019s from 1971 \u2014 \u201cthe real issue is who controls the wealth of this country\u201d \u2014 and observed that 14 years later, \u201cHe\u2019s still singing the same tune.\u201dIn 1988, he ran for Congress, sending a note on personal stationery inviting Vermonters to help him \u201cmake basic changes in an economic and political system in which 1% of the population owns over 50% of the wealth.\u201d In countless speeches and interviews and debates in Congress, the Senate and now on the presidential trail, Mr. Sanders has essentially said the same thing over and over. Mr. Bouricius worried, though, that Mr. Sanders had not done enough to actually build the political revolution he had spent 40 years calling for. \u201cIf Bernie gets hit by a bus,\u201d Mr. Bouricius said, \"a lot of this just goes away.\u201dMr. Sanders is now facing a speeding bus in the form of Mrs. Clinton\u2019s formidable delegate advantage.But Tad Devine, Mr. Sanders\u2019s top strategist, said his message would resonate strongly in coming contests.\u201cHillary has a lead with delegates so therefore he should change that message? Well, no,\u201d said Mr. Devine. He said that voters found Mr. Sanders credible precisely because his speeches never seemed cooked up for the occasion; instead, he \u201cdelivers it as dictum.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Inside the Clinton Team\u2019s Plan to Defeat Donald Trump", "Date": "2016-02-29", "News": "Supported byBut others, including former President Bill Clinton, dismissed those conclusions as denial. They said that Mr. Trump clearly had a keen sense of the electorate\u2019s mood and that only a concerted campaign portraying him as dangerous and bigoted would win what both Clintons believe will be a close November election.That strategy is beginning to take shape, with groups that support Mrs. Clinton preparing to script and test ads that would portray Mr. Trump as a misogynist and an enemy to the working class whose brash temper would put the nation and the world in grave danger. The plan is for those themes to be amplified later by two prominent surrogates: To fight Mr. Trump\u2019s ability to sway the news cycle, Mr. Clinton would not hold back on the stump, and President Obama has told allies he would gleefully portray Mr. Trump as incapable of handling the duties of the Oval Office.Democrats say they risk losing the presidency if they fail to take Mr. Trump seriously, much as Republicans have done in the primary campaign.\u201cHe\u2019s formidable, he understands voters\u2019 anxieties, and he will be ruthless against Hillary Clinton,\u201d said Gov. Dannel P. Malloy of Connecticut. \u201cI\u2019ve gone from denial \u2014 \u2018I can\u2019t believe anyone would listen to this guy\u2019 \u2014 to admiration, in the sense that he\u2019s figured out how to capture everyone\u2019s angst, to real worry.\u201dNow, Mr. Mook and his colleagues regard Mr. Trump as a wily, determined and indefatigable opponent who seems to be speaking to broad economic anxieties among Americans and to the widely held belief that traditional politicians are incapable of addressing those problems. Publicly, the Clinton operation is letting the Republicans slug it out. But privately, it and other Democrats are poring over polling data to understand the roots of Mr. Trump\u2019s populist appeal and building up troves of opposition research on his business career.\u201cThe case against Trump will be prosecuted on two levels,\u201d said Geoff Garin, a Democratic pollster and Mrs. Clinton\u2019s chief strategist in 2008. \u201cThe first is temperament,\u201d and whether he is suited to be commander in chief, Mr. Garin said, echoing conversations that have dominated Democratic circles recently. The second \u201cwill be based on whether he can really be relied on as a champion for anyone but himself.\u201dBut the tactics the Clintons have used for years to take down opponents may fall short in a contest between the blunt and unpredictable Mr. Trump and the cautious and scripted Mrs. Clinton: a matchup that operatives on both sides predicted would be an epic, ugly clash between two vastly disparate politicians.\u201cHillary has built a large tanker ship, and she\u2019s about to confront Somali pirates,\u201d said Matthew Dowd, the chief strategist for former President George W. Bush\u2019s 2004 campaign, who is now an independent.This article is based on interviews with more than two dozen advisers, strategists and close allies of the Clintons, including several who have spoken directly with Mr. Clinton. Some spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss strategy publicly.In South Carolina and Tennessee, Mrs. Clinton began to lay the groundwork for what advisers call \u201ca campaign against bigotry,\u201d in which she will present herself as the fair-minded foil to Mr. Trump. She declared that Americans needed more \u201clove and kindness.\u201d\u201cInstead of building walls,\u201d she has started to say, \u201cwe need to be tearing down barriers.\u201dMr. Trump emphatically denies being bigoted, saying he is simply not \u201cpolitically correct.\u201d But he has already signaled that he would be vicious against Mrs. Clinton. He said that she should be indicted for her use of a private email server as secretary of state and that Mr. Clinton\u2019s extramarital affairs were \u201cfair game\u201d in the election because they were an \u201cabuse of women.\u201dWhile Mrs. Clinton radiates positive energy on the trail, Democratic groups are beginning to coalesce around a strategy to deliver sustained and brutal attacks on Mr. Trump.The plan has three major thrusts: Portray Mr. Trump as a heartless businessman who has worked against the interests of the working-class voters he now appeals to; broadcast the degrading comments he has made against women in order to sway suburban women, who have been reluctant to support Mrs. Clinton; and highlight his brash, explosive temper to show he is unsuited to be commander in chief.\u201cThere is something to this idea that nothing has stuck,\u201d Mr. Brock said, but that, he argued, is because the Republicans have been too restrained to avoid offending Mr. Trump\u2019s supporters.In the coming weeks, Priorities USA Action, a super PAC supporting Mrs. Clinton that effectively portrayed Mitt Romney as a cold corporate titan in the 2012 campaign, will begin scripting and testing ads that use a similar approach against Mr. Trump.As Mrs. Clinton tries to remain above the fray, Mr. Clinton would be unleashed to respond when Mr. Trump lashed out. Mr. Obama has already argued that Mr. Trump should not be trusted with the job and has told allies he will continue that charge. In February, asked about Mr. Trump, he said the president has \u201cthe nuclear codes with them and can order 21-year-olds into a firefight.\u201dJennifer Palmieri, a Clinton spokeswoman, said that she was focused on the primary, but that \u201cshe was the first person to call Trump out on either side, and we reserve the right to do that depending on the circumstances.\u201dEven as Democrats prepare to take on Mr. Trump, there remains deep anxiety that the messages may not break through.The woman won the legal battle and remained in her home, but the ad, which Mr. Trump disputed, did not dent his support.Unless these attacks are effective, Mrs. Clinton\u2019s advisers worry that Mr. Trump could pose a threat in some states Mr. Obama won in 2008 and 2012, including some the party once considered safe.Mrs. Clinton\u2019s uneven performance with male voters so far, especially white men, could create an opening for Mr. Trump to attract Democrats and independents who are socially and culturally moderate and open to his call for a strong military, fearless foreign policy and businessman\u2019s approach to the economy. Those voters could give him an edge in places like North Carolina, which Mr. Obama won in 2008. But Clinton advisers also worry about Ohio, Florida and Democratic-leaning states in presidential elections that Mr. Trump has vowed to contest, like Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.Edward G. Rendell, a former governor of Pennsylvania who is supporting Mrs. Clinton, said that he thought she would ultimately win Pennsylvania, but conceded that he could be wrong. \u201cHe has crossover appeal with some blue-collar working-class Democrats,\u201d Mr. Rendell said. The key to defeating Mr. Trump, he said, was to keep coaxing him into making offensive or extreme comments that would alienate independents and others who might normally vote for a Republican nominee.\u201cFor every one of those blue-collar Democrats he picks up, he will lose to Hillary two socially moderate Republicans and independents in suburban Cleveland, suburban Columbus, suburban Cincinnati, suburban Philadelphia, suburban Pittsburgh, places like that,\u201d he said.Former Gov. Jim Hodges of South Carolina, who campaigned there on Thursday with Mr. Clinton, said the former president was girding for a hard-fought election if Mr. Trump is the Republican nominee. \u201cThe president sees Trump as formidable, no question,\u201d Mr. Hodges said. \u201cHe takes him seriously. The campaign takes him seriously.\u201dThose types of comments, spoken by Mr. Trump over the years as he served as a tabloid regular and reality TV star, could help Mrs. Clinton excite suburban women and young women who have been ambivalent or antagonistic toward her candidacy.Stephanie Schriock, the president of Emily\u2019s List, said that an expanded research shop at the organization had compiled \u201can endless amount of misogynistic and outrageous comments towards women.\u201dThe strategy highlights a concern among Mrs. Clinton\u2019s allies that her chance to become the first female president has not led to widespread excitement among young women. Mr. Trump is the perfect solution to the enthusiasm gap, many Democrats say.And Mrs. Clinton has benefited in her career when male opponents have overstepped or appeared to bully her.But as Democrats hold their breath for the next sexist comment, they also acknowledge a problem that opposition research cannot fix: Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton are polar opposite politicians, and Mr. Trump\u2019s direct and visceral style could prove difficult for Mrs. Clinton, whose inclination is detailed policy talk and 12-point plans.\u201cCan you imagine what he\u2019ll do?\u201d Mr. Dowd, the former Bush strategist, said. She will bring up equal pay for women and abortion rights, Mr. Dowd said, \u201cand he\u2019ll turn to her and say, \u2018You can\u2019t even handle your stuff at home.\u2019 \u201dMr. Clinton calls Mr. Trump ideal in the era of the \u201cInstagram election,\u201d when voters want bite-size solutions (\u201cBuild a wall!\u201d \u201cBan the Muslims!\u201d) to complex problems. Mrs. Clinton, by contrast, can appear scripted and static when she tries to hurl planned one-liners in debates.It will be hard for Mrs. Clinton to focus on policy and stay above the fray as her opponent and her own operation dig in for a brutish campaign. \u201cHope and change, not so much,\u201d said David Plouffe, who managed Mr. Obama\u2019s 2008 campaign, referring to the slogan that defined that race. \u201cMore like hate and castrate.\u201d9 PhotosGardiner Harris contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

Their parents bought a one-bedroom post-grad apartment for Mrs. DeBellis in 2005 for around $680,000 in the west wing of the building, followed the next year by the purchase of a similar one-bedroom for around $650,000 for Mrs. Sandoval in the east wing.Since then, the women have lived their lives in sync, both marrying in 2012 and getting pregnant at about the same time, even delivering sons on the same day. Living in proximity has been a positive experience for both families.The nearness of in-laws \u201cmakes me feel wealthy, having them here for everything,\u201d said Ani\u2019s husband, Dre Sandoval, 34, the senior creative director at ABC News Marketing and Creative. \u201cHaving family built in, family dinners, activities. The ability to just get in a car together and go. Or go to the park. Or have them watch Desi,\u201d the Sandovals\u2019 19-month-old son.The DeBellis family recently welcomed a daughter, Rosie, who is 1 month old.\u201cThe boys, they\u2019re like brothers,\u201d Mrs. Sandoval said. \u201cBecause they share a nanny and are together every day and on the weekends, they almost look out for each other.\u201d\u201cThe other reason people value siblings,\u201d Mr. Tran said, \u201cis the rise of the \u2018sharing economy\u2019 \u201d \u2014 services like Airbnb and Uber \u2014 \u201cwhich is meant to reduce transactional costs in an era of growing financial insecurity and rising unaffordability. In this context of \u2018sharing,\u2019 many people would rather share with their siblings than with strangers.\u201d\u201cI really can\u2019t imagine how I\u2019d do it without her,\u201d said Mrs. Lin, who often puts in 16-hour work days, whether making her banh canh noodles with pickles and tofu in a coconut curry sauce, or washing dishes when short on help.Ms. Ho works at Fordham two days a week and Jaxon is enrolled in a preschool with flexible hours; Dr. Mauch often picks him up. Depending on how late her sister is working, Ms. Ho and Dr. Mauch may take Jaxon to their home and put him to bed there.\u201cNannies tend to leave or call in sick, and they\u2019re really expensive,\u201d Mrs. Lin said. \u201cIt\u2019s nice to know that Kathy and Sean are there and they\u2019re family and love him and take care of him just like I would.\u201dThe arrangement involved some reshuffling. When the Lins moved to New York from California in 2013, Ms. Ho was living on the Lower East Side. The Lins rented a two-bedroom apartment for $3,000 a month in the Boerum Hill section of Brooklyn, specifically because it was on the same subway line as Ms. Ho\u2019s apartment, to make drop-offs and pickups of Jaxon that much easier.Then, as the opening of Bricolage drew near, they enticed Ms. Ho and Dr. Mauch to consider Brooklyn. After some deliberation, Ms. Ho gave up her rent-regulated apartment and moved into a two-bedroom apartment in Downtown Brooklyn, also for $3,000 a month. The sisters now reside on the same street, just a five-minute walk from each other.The help has gone both ways, said Ms. Ho, who has been fed by her sister on countless nights as she completes her Ph.D.For the sisters, who are ethnically Chinese refugees from Vietnam, relying on relatives is nothing new. After the family fled to the United States in 1981, \u201cWe grew up in a house with 14 people in there,\u201d Mrs. Lin said, referring to her childhood home in California. \u201cOur three aunts lived with us, our grandparents lived with us. While my parents were at work, my grandma would watch us and my aunties were there. We just lived with each other and took care of each other.\u201d\u201cSometimes I\u2019ll run over to his side and just, like, body-slam him,\u201d John said. \u201c \u2018Wake up, wake up! It\u2019s Saturday morning!\u2019 \u201d\u201cI wanted the boys to have it easy,\u201d she said, referring to their hunt for a post-grad apartment. \u201cI was like, \u2018Don\u2019t go anywhere until you look in my building.\u2019 \u201dThe brothers split the rent, but otherwise operate on what they call \u201cthe college barter system.\u201d If one pays for dry cleaning, the other owes him beer. They do not worry about being too close for comfort.\u201cIt\u2019s a big enough building that everyone has their own privacy when they want it,\u201d John said. \u201cAnd if we need space from each other, one of us will go upstairs and hang out with Amanda.\u201dThe LaMelas are one another\u2019s backup. Take the night Amanda went to sleep early and was awakened by what she described as \u201can intense creditor knock\u201d on the door. She texted her roommate, who was out and who promptly texted her brother John.He had not been at home, either, but he was nearby. \u201cHe runs over and sweat is dripping from his face,\u201d Amanda said, only to discover that the insistent visitor was Nick, who had deviated from their usual secret sibling knock.\u201cSo I know if anything did go down, they\u2019d be here in 30 seconds,\u201d Amanda said.Aside from the outings, the LaMela siblings rely on one other for moral support. \u201cSay I had a bad day at work,\u201d John said. \u201cAmanda is the first person I call.\u201dDr. Logan said: \u201cThe sort of social support most young adults need is having someone to talk to, somebody to rely on. That doesn\u2019t necessarily require living in the same building, but being in the same town is quite important.\u201dThe call of homeownership will soon put the LaMelas under different roofs: Amanda is in contract to buy an apartment a four-minute walk away, and she and her roommate are moving there. But, she said, if that roommate leaves, she would consider rooming with John \u2014 Nick has a serious girlfriend. And maybe one or both of the twins will want to buy a place in her building; she\u2019ll be on the lookout.For the DeBellis and Sandoval families, real estate will also spell the end to the sibling setup. The Sandovals will move to Old Greenwich, Conn., this summer after the birth of their second child. Priced out of the city, they recently bought a three-bedroom fixer-upper for $646,000. And even though the DeBellises plan to eventually follow the Sandovals to suburbia, no doubt to a home within a short driving distance, the move marks the end of an era for the sisters.\u201cThe city can be tough,\u201d Mrs. DeBellis said, tearing up at the thought of the Sandovals\u2019 impending move. \u201cI love the city. But it will be a much different experience without my sister being down the hall.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Where is the E.U.\u2019s Moral and Political Courage?", "Date": "2016-03-15", "News": "Supported byPIRAEUS, Greece \u2014 Greece pulsates with people fleeing war and poverty, from the docks of this port to the muddy fields of Idomeni, where their great migration runs into the barbed wire fences of Europe\u2019s confusion and fear. Already drained by overwhelming debt, austerity and recession, the country is rushing to provide shelter and care for a surging number of stranded refugees and migrants who want nothing more than to keep moving, indifferent to the fact that their pursuit of freedom, stability and prosperity has thrown the European Union into its greatest crisis since its founding.An average of 1,442 people arrive each day from Turkey, according to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. Greece has hastily converted military camps, children\u2019s summer camps and facilities from the Athens 2004 Olympics into reception centers to care for the immigrants. The prospects for their moving on look bleak: Balkan borders are closed; in Germany, which took in more than a million people last year, a populist anti-immigration party made strong gains in three state elections last Sunday.Germany has been pushing the European Union for collective action that will share the burden but also respect principles of solidarity and humanism. The result has been acrimony and division. Many member states reject a quota system for distributing refugees. Stopping people on crowded rubber dinghies once they have set out from Turkey has proved impossible for the Greek Coast Guard and the European border agency Frontex. NATO warships, too, will be ineffective: They will rescue people at sea, as Greek fishermen have been doing for over a year, rather than prevent their launching. The latest effort to cut a deal with Turkey will most likely sow further division in Europe.Here in Piraeus, the refugees and immigrants arrive daily aboard huge ferries from Greece\u2019s easternmost islands. By last weekend, 141,787 had arrived this year and about 43,000 were still in Greece. Inside a cargo warehouse a banner in English declares: \u201cWelcome to Piraeus. Information, help and rest for a little while at the passengers\u2019 terminal E1 for free.\u201d The cavernous space is empty, apart from a few municipal workers and volunteers folding blankets, collecting shoes, slippers and other bits of clothing, disposing of half-eaten sandwiches and trash left by hundreds of people who have just moved out.Some have accepted bus rides to reception camps; others still place their hopes in smugglers\u2019 promises to get them through closed borders. Passenger terminals are crowded with families. The air is hot and humid, filled with the cries and laughs of women and children. Outside, in the winter sun, children draw, with crayons and paper handed out by volunteers; others hop, skip and jump; youngsters play soccer in vast spaces where trucks roll through. Small groups sit on the dock\u2019s edge, gazing at the choppy sea. Municipal and port authority workers, soldiers, police officers and all kinds of N.G.O.s and volunteers are at work: cleaners and barbers, medics and child care workers, people on their own arriving with food and personal care items.Similar scenes play out across the country, at 23 official camps and wherever else citizens find groups in need. This is a huge mobilization for a country with little experience of volunteerism, prompted by deep-rooted, personal empathy with people who have lost everything, who risk everything for a better life.Greece\u2019s history is full of war, dictatorship, economic hardship and mass migrations. In the last century alone, the Balkan Wars, in which Greece expanded at the cost of the Ottoman Empire, melded into World War I, in which Greece was on the winning side. In 1922, Turkish troops routed a Greek military campaign in western Turkey, forcing more than a million Greeks to leave their ancestral homes in Asia Minor. A large part of Greece\u2019s population is descended from those refugees. World War II and a brutal German occupation were followed by civil war. Through the century, hundreds of thousands of Greeks emigrated \u2014 mainly to America, Western Europe and Australia. The last military dictatorship, from 1967 to 1974, was followed by accession to the European Union and the longest period of peace and prosperity in Greece\u2019s history.Greece, the European Union country closest to the turmoil of the Middle East, faces the dangers of long coastal borders and risks isolation from its partners. There have been frequent suggestions in other countries that Greece be suspended from the Schengen area of passport-free travel. And yet the current crisis has brought Germany and Greece closer. Chancellor Angela Merkel\u2019s open welcome to refugees last year showed her as a supporter of European humanist principles, rather than a fiscal authoritarian who had been tough on Greece. Now her government\u2019s insistence that borders remain open puts Berlin and Athens on the same side of the issue. Countries that backed Germany\u2019s hard-line stance on Greece\u2019s economy are now at odds with Berlin, refusing to take in any refugees, while Greece, the black sheep, puts up a brave struggle to cope with the immigrants, defending European Union principles.The European Union-Turkey summit meeting on March 17-18 is aimed at concluding a deal with Turkey that will, in effect, make that country the union\u2019s gatekeeper. The proposal includes principles \u201cto return all new irregular migrants crossing from Turkey into the Greek islands\u201d and \u201cto resettle, for every Syrian readmitted by Turkey from Greek islands, another Syrian from Turkey to the E.U. Member States.\u201d In exchange, the visa requirement for Turks entering the Schengen area will be relaxed, Ankara will receive three billion euros (with more to be decided later), and talks for Turkey\u2019s accession to the European Union will pick up speed.The proposal has drawn fire from many sides:The United Nations refugee agency, Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch, the European Council on Refugees and Exiles and many others point out that mass fast-track returns threaten refugees\u2019 rights. Others note that Turkey\u2019s increasingly authoritarian government will be rewarded, gaining respectability by effectively holding refugees to ransom. Anti-immigrant forces in several countries will focus on the promise that Turkey\u2019s citizens, who are mostly Muslim, will have easier access to the union.Despite policy makers\u2019 confusion and populists\u2019 exploitation of citizens\u2019 unease, the European Union remains a beacon of freedom and stability. People will still come in the hope of a better life. Managing immigration must not make Europe less free, less stable, less fair, less united. Without political and moral courage, the crisis may defeat the European Union, and the defeat will be mostly self-inflicted. If the Greeks \u2014 bankrupt and tired, with a state that is dysfunctional at the best of times \u2014 can try their best, the union can try harder.Advertisement"}

At 68, he was not holding back.Mr. Homme has long professed his admiration for Iggy Pop, but they collaborated as equals who spurred each other on. Iggy Pop\u2019s curt lyrics cackle about decadence and disillusionment, but also \u2014 in \u201cBreak Into Your Heart,\u201d which starts as a boast and ends as something like an apology \u2014 show grown-up compassion. Other songs face down the modern world, as he has since the 1960s. \u201cSunday\u201d contends with the pressures of work and the economy; \u201cAmerican Valhalla\u201d ponders the possibility of an afterlife earned by heroic warriors. In \u201cParaguay,\u201d he longs for a tropical haven and ends up ranting about information overload, still deeply cantankerous.The music melds Iggy Pop\u2019s primal riffs with the arching melodies and structural convolutions that Mr. Homme has brought to his own songs, embracing the richness of his baritone while forging a band sound that is at once brutally effective and utterly clear: a crystalline hammer.The tour band includes Mr. Homme and the other two musicians who made the album: Dean Fertita (from Queens of the Stone Age) on guitar and keyboards and Matt Helders (from the Arctic Monkeys) on drums, along with Troy Van Leeuwen from Queens of the Stone Age on guitar and Matt Sweeney from Chavez on bass.Old and new, the songs grew even more forceful onstage. The musicians, dressed in tuxedos like a Motown-era backup band, never tried to upstage Iggy Pop \u2014 not that they could have. They dug into the details of the original 1977 arrangements, like the guitar filigrees within \u201cLust for Life\u201d and the twin-guitar coda of \u201cChina Girl.\u201d And they gave the new songs more heft and swagger while revealing why every note mattered.But it was Iggy Pop\u2019s show all the way. He sang with full-throated conviction, utterly hard-nosed within the songs but grinning and thankful between them. He struck poses with every muscle clenched, he jittered across the stage, he repeatedly kicked around his microphone stand and a stool he barely used. \u201cWe\u2019re playing a long time,\u201d he said, \u201cbecause it\u2019s a long life.\u201d After the set ended and the band had exited the stage, Iggy Pop remained, twitching with energy, before he left with some final fist-pumping and a big wave goodbye. The songs, from \u201cTonight\u201d to \u201cAmerican Valhalla,\u201d had faced up to death with muscle and sinew; the life force had won. It was an Iggy Pop concert, after all.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How Buyers React When Prices Rise and Fall", "Date": "2016-03-25", "News": "Supported bySpecial SectionWhen gasoline prices spike, do you go in search of the station with the lowest price or wait in a long line to save 5 cents a gallon? When prices fall, do you splurge and pay 10 cents more for brand-name gasoline that promises to make your engine run more smoothly?Why do people react this way? Balancing a budget is difficult. Prices fluctuate and unforeseen expenditures occur. It would require a sophisticated optimization routine to rebalance a budget smoothly across all expenses each time prices or personal income changed. To make this problem tractable, people divide and conquer by breaking down overall budgets into easy-to-remember categories and targets, such as gas money, rent money, grocery money and fun money. By remembering a few targets and sticking to them, people may win the overall budget battle and avoid spending or saving too much. Behavioral economists refer to this as \u201cmental accounting.\u201dMental accounting recommendations can be found in many self-help guides for budgeting. But mental accounting can cause us to behave in irrational ways, as we compartmentalize our decisions and lose sight of the larger picture.Economists are often irrational consumers too. Personally, I am tempted to buy a cheaper coffee bean than my favorite brand when prices rise. I often consider waiting in line for a cheaper brand of gasoline when gas prices rise, and I stop doing this when prices begin to fall. But waiting in line is not necessarily a good use of my time or a good way to save a couple of dollars out of all the ways I could save in my overall budget. Splurging on name-brand gasoline is also probably not a great way to spend the windfall created by low gas prices. Maybe I should spend that savings somewhere else \u2014perhaps on a better glass of wine.In the broader economy, mental accounting can be harnessed for good. Governments could nudge consumer behavior by targeting stimulus packages for durable goods in recessions, or by earmarking supplemental nutrition funds for fresh foods. Certainly companies recognize that a dollar is not always a dollar, as they try to win customers with gasoline rewards on their credit cards when prices are high and their mental accounting \u201cgas envelope\u201d is running on empty.My research has encouraged me to be less sensitive to categorical income and price changes. Instead of thinking that my coffee is 20 percent more expensive during a price peak and that I should try to save money on coffee, I remember that my overall income is now $4 less a month (or so). I remind myself to save a little extra money when an opportunity arises in any category, while still enjoying my favorite cup of coffee. I use credit cards that offer the cash-back bonus, remembering that an actual dollar returned in cash can be spent on gasoline or coffee, or in any other budget category I choose.JUSTINE HASTINGS is an economics professor at Brown University and director of the Rhode Island Innovative Policy Lab.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Calculate Your Economic Risk", "Date": "2016-03-18", "News": "Supported byGray MatterOur predictions of economic risk work in a similar way. Using hundreds of thousands of case records taken from a longitudinal study of Americans that began in 1968, we estimate the likelihood \u2014 based on factors like race, education, marital status and age \u2014 of an individual\u2019s falling below the official poverty line during the next five, 10 or 15 years. (The poverty line for a family of four in 2015 was approximately $24,000.)We have discovered that, for many Americans, the future risk of poverty is far from trivial. Take someone who might be thought of as having a relatively low probability of poverty: an American who is in his or her later 30s, white, not married, with an education beyond high school. It turns out that the 15-year risk of poverty for such a person is actually 32 percent. In other words, one-third of such individuals will experience at least one year below the poverty line in the not-so-distant future.If we project across a longer span of adulthood, it appears that a clear majority of Americans will experience poverty. For example, in earlier research we estimated that between the ages of 20 and 75, nearly 60 percent of Americans will spend at least one year below the official poverty line, and three-quarters will experience a year below 150 percent of the poverty line.In addition, our risk calculator helps underscore how vast the inequalities in the United States actually are. Race, education, marital status and age make a huge difference in terms of who is more or less likely to experience poverty. For example, the five-year risk of poverty is 5 percent for an American who is 45 to 49, white and married, with an education beyond high school. In contrast, the five-year risk for an individual who is 25 to 29, nonwhite and unmarried, with an education of high school or less is a whopping 72 percent.The gap between the haves and have-nots in the United States is now greater than it has been in decades. Our economic risk projections illustrate just how profound these demographic fault lines are likely to be in the future. As the country becomes increasingly nonwhite in the years ahead, with millions of young Americans priced out of higher education and less likely to marry, the percentage of the population experiencing poverty is certain to grow. The \u201copportunity structure,\u201d in particular the labor market, has been stacked against these groups for some time. Furthermore, our social policies, such as health care, housing and educational reforms, have done little to address the systemic disadvantages embedded in American society.We are in danger of becoming an economically polarized society in which a small percentage of the population is free from economic risk, while a vast majority of Americans will encounter poverty as a normal part of life.With our calculator, Americans can for the first time examine their own economic vulnerability. Our hope is that such information will be both sobering and a clarion call to action.Advertisement"}

Yet the law is playing only a secondary role in the American elections.Sure, Republican presidential candidates cater to their base by vowing to repeal and replace \u201cObamacare,\u201d and on the Democratic side, Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont promises to replace it with a government-run universal coverage system.But it doesn\u2019t dominate the dialogue and isn\u2019t a top priority on either side. Among the most embattled Senate Republican incumbents, the campaign websites of Kelly Ayotte of New Hampshire, Mark Kirk of Illinois and Ron Johnson of Wisconsin barely mention the health care law. . An exception is Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania.The explanation may be that for all its controversy and imperfections, the sweeping law has taken hold. \u201cThis is in the fabric of the nation,\u201d said Health and Human Services Secretary Sylvia Mathews Burwell.To be sure, the presidential election outcome will be a determinant of whether the health care law is reshaped, bolstered or downsized.But even some skeptics acknowledge that its numbers are rather impressive. About 20 million more Americans now have health insurance than before the law was enacted in 2010; in the last enrollment period on the health care exchanges, 12.7 million signed up and almost 40 percent were newcomers. The expansion of Medicaid for the poor is making a mark.Millions of Americans with pre-existing conditions no longer can be denied coverage, children can stay on their parents\u2019 plans until age 26, and health care inflation is the lowest in years.In the presidential campaign, the rhetoric still can get hot. Senator Ted Cruz of Texas says the Affordable Care Act is \u201cthe biggest job killer in this country. Millions of Americans have lost their jobs.\u201d (Over all, from March 2010, when the law was enacted, until today, the economy has added 13.7 million jobs.)But most Republicans insist that they would keep popular provisions such as guaranteeing coverage for people with pre-existing conditions. Gov. John Kasich embraced the law\u2019s expansion of Medicaid in Ohio. The Republican front-runner, Donald J. Trump, has said he likes the mandate to get health insurance \u2014 the centerpiece of the act and chief target of most conservative critics \u2014 and that he would not let people \u201cdie sitting in the middle of the street.\u201dWhen speculation surfaced that Mr. Trump and Gov. Kasich could run together, the conservative Weekly Standard lamented that it would be \u201cthe nightmare ticket for opponents of Obamacare.\u201dIf the Republicans win in November, however, even Mr. Trump would have to try to dismantle the law, given how important that is to the party\u2019s base. The targets for action could include the Medicaid expansion; the mandate requiring health insurance (by replacing it with some other program); and subsidies introduced under the law. The problem is that millions of newly insured people would probably lose coverage, which could create a political backlash.If Hillary Clinton is elected, she also would probably make changes to buttress the Affordable Care Act. The emphasis likely would be on cost controls.The health care law may not play much of a role in the outcome of this presidential election, but the partisan controversy has not gone away.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Ethics Group Urges Inquiry of Mortgage Banking Lobbyist Who Led F.H.A.", "Date": "2016-02-29", "News": "Supported byA nonprofit watchdog group on Monday called for an investigation of David H. Stevens, chief executive of the Mortgage Bankers Association, arguing that he may have violated ethics laws relating to his previous position as commissioner of the Federal Housing Administration.An investigation, the center said, would determine whether Mr. Stevens had violated federal rules barring former government officials from \u201ccommunicating or appearing on behalf of persons or entities with respect to matters in which the former officials \u2018personally and substantially participated\u2019 during their government service.\u201dThe ethics group also asked the government officials to look into whether Mr. Stevens had violated the law by trying to influence matters of interest to the mortgage bankers for a brief period when he was still in the government but had accepted the lobbying post. He was the F.H.A. commissioner, a post within HUD, from mid-2009 through March 2011.Mr. Stevens declined to comment. John T. Mechem, a spokesman for the association, replied on his behalf.\u201cSince ending his government service, Dave has regularly consulted with attorneys inside and outside M.B.A. to make sure that he and the association are always in full compliance with the law,\u201d Mr. Mechem\u2019s statement said. \u201cOutside counsel to M.B.A. has specifically reviewed Dave\u2019s activities on behalf of M.B.A. and its members and has confirmed that Dave has operated fully within the letter and spirit of the lobbying laws and ethics rules.\u201dThe statement added that the \u201cunfounded allegations are part of a concerted campaign\u201d by those with an apparent financial incentive to discredit Mr. Stevens and his work at the lobbying group.The request for an investigation from the National Legal and Policy Center is the second such call for scrutiny of Mr. Stevens\u2019s activities after he left government.A spokesman for the accountability group said the Justice Department had acknowledged its request in December, but that it had heard nothing since.In seeking an investigation, the legal and policy center said it had identified more than 25 potential ethics violations by Mr. Stevens.Before Mr. Stevens announced that he was leaving his government post for the Mortgage Bankers Association, he was a participant in deliberations over the status of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, which were taken over by the United States in September 2008, just as the housing market collapse erupted into the worst economic and financial crisis since the Depression. The companies remain in conservatorship under the oversight of the Federal Housing Finance Agency.The legal and policy center contended that as head of the association, Mr. Stevens had lobbied on some of the same issues that he had worked on as the F.H.A. commissioner. It cited correspondence he had submitted to housing agencies as they deliberated new rules for the mortgage industry.In calling for investigations, the ethics group also noted numerous meetings Mr. Stevens had attended with top officials at HUD, the White House and the Federal Housing Finance Agency.Mr. Stevens\u2019s communications with federal employees on these matters may have violated ethics rules, the group said, because the government still directly oversees Fannie and Freddie, which operated before the takeover as quasi-independent government-sponsored enterprises to support the housing industry and encourage homeownership.The rule was intended to discourage mortgage issuers from dumping high-risk loans into pools and escaping responsibility when they failed. This practice generated billions of dollars in losses for unsuspecting investors during the credit crisis.In the email, Mr. Stevens warned Mr. Cordray that the rule, as proposed, \u201cwill likely cause significant contraction in new mortgage lending\u201d and could hurt the overall economy.\u201cLook, I know I head this M.B.A.,\u201d Mr. Stevens wrote in the email, \u201cbut I am also a 30-year veteran of this industry and someone who spent a couple of years inside working on policy as you both know.\u201dThe consumer bureau posted Mr. Stevens\u2019s email on its website as an ex parte communication, indicating that it had not been submitted publicly.\u201cEven by Washington\u2019s current low standards,\u201d Ken Boehm, chairman of the National Legal and Policy Center, said in a statement, \u201cStevens was particularly brazen in apparently ignoring the pertinent statutes and ethics regulations.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Britain Gets Tougher on Corporate Rule Breakers", "Date": "2016-03-07", "News": "Supported byWhite Collar WatchCampaign rhetoric rarely gets into the details of just how the financial sector should be tamed. Simply calling for greater policing of management is unlikely to change how they operate, especially when there is little threat of personal liability for individuals.Under provisions approved by the Financial Conduct Authority and the Bank of England\u2019s Prudential Regulation Authority that went into effect on Monday, high-level management at banks have a \u201cstatutory duty of responsibility\u201d under which they must \u201ctake reasonable steps to prevent regulatory breaches in the areas of the firm for which they are responsible.\u201d A failure to take those steps can result in an enforcement action against the executive, which could lead to civil fines and even removal from the firm.This provision for individual management responsibility for violations is actually weaker than an earlier proposal. As originally drafted, the rules created a \u201creverse burden of proof\u201d that would have required executives to prove that they took all reasonable steps to prevent a violation, otherwise they could be punished. This was more of a \u201cshoot first, ask questions later\u201d approach to liability that drew substantial opposition from the banking sector.The new rules currently apply only to the banking sector, but will expand in 2017 to cover other financial companies that have a substantial impact on the economy, including insurance companies, securities firms and commodities brokers. The financial crisis showed that it was much more than the banks that contributed to the near meltdown, so a wider range of firms need to be brought under the regulatory umbrella.That law is much more limited than the new British rules because it only covers two top members of corporate management, and applies to just corporate financial statements and internal controls. Regulatory violations can come from a number of areas, such as environmental discharges and health care reimbursement, which have little to do with accounting yet can cost a company millions of dollars in penalties in addition to the cost of conducting an internal investigation.The quest to hold corporate executives accountable seems to be a never-ending search for a mechanism creating a strong enough incentive for them to change the corporate culture. Attacking bonuses has been offered as another means for getting the attention of senior management by putting their personal assets at risk.A provision of the Dodd-Frank Act expanded the use of clawbacks by requiring public companies to adopt policies to recover incentive-based compensation paid to executives when there is a restatement of previously issued financial statements. The problem with this approach is that it is prompted only by a restatement not by other regulatory violations, and gets to only one component of executive pay, leaving untouched regular salaries \u2014 some of which are quite substantial.Under their proposal, multibillion-dollar payments like those made by global banks JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America to settle cases for their sales of mortgage-backed securities in the years before the financial crisis would result in exposure for their executives, which at least puts their pocketbooks on the line even if the bulk of the penalty is absorbed by shareholders.Any effort to adopt rules like those of the regulators in Britain, or the professors\u2019 proposal, is likely to run into significant resistance from Wall Street. The Department of Labor\u2019s proposed rule to impose on brokers giving advice on retirement savings a requirement to put their clients\u2019 interests first, called a fiduciary duty, would seem to be unremarkable for firms helping to manage money for investors. But it has provoked criticism from Wall Street, including claims of financial catastrophe for small investors. The financial firms can be expected to fight any change that might expose their executives to greater liability or require more spending to comply with the law.Getting financial executives to change the culture of their firms will not be easy, as campaign promises to \u201cclean up Wall Street\u201d have been made before but cause hardly a ripple on Wall Street.The British rules might be worthwhile for a new administration to consider as a means to focus management on treating regulatory requirements as a topic worthy of their attention as much as increasing corporate profitability.Advertisement"}

It\u2019s located closer to Miami. American hotel chains are already circling, or pouncing.The world has sped up since the mid-1990s, when Vietnam embarked on the opening that has fast-forwarded its economy over the past two decades. Like China, it has demonstrated that nothing fires up capitalism quite like Communist political control in 21st-century guise.Why should Ra\u00fal Castro\u2019s Cuba be different? Money trumps liberty, which can be cumbersome and erratic. Give Havana a mere decade and it will be well down the Ho Chi Minh City road.Over all, that\u2019s good for Cubans, yet the homogenizing effect of global commerce has become so familiar that it\u2019s difficult to look at images of President Obama strolling the streets of Old Havana with his family and not feel \u2014 along with the thrill of this needed breakthrough \u2014 a twinge of ambivalence.It is a wonderful thing to have an American president in Cuba for the first time in almost nine decades, and equally wonderful to see the thawing of a half-century of American-Cuban hostility that had become anachronistic and pointless.But by now we know enough of how development can look \u2014 and how it can race ahead without accompanying political liberalization \u2014 to rejoice with some reserve. Cuba is certain to lose a fraction of its soul as money works its fascination. All the new malls may do nothing for the miserable fate of dissidents with democratic obsessions.Vietnam has been a remarkable success story. Annual trade with the United States has soared from a mere $220 million in 1994 to $29.6 billion in 2013. Four decades after the napalm, commerce has overcome enmity. America is a hedge against China; the temporary enemy has become a partner of sorts against the eternal enemy.The Vietnamese, their lives improving, express overwhelmingly positive views of America. Obama is expected here later this year to cement a new partnership important to the future of the United States as a China-offsetting power in Asia.It would be surprising if the Cuba opening did not produce similar rapid development and steady rapprochement with the United States. The Cuban revolution had its achievements, not least in education and medicine, but lost its raison d\u2019\u00eatre long ago. It was a generator of misery and paralysis on an epic scale \u2014 lives wasted, hopes quashed, youths reduced to idleness and inertia.The possibilities about to emerge for millions of Cubans are reason enough to say that, while it\u2019s no panacea, the Obama-Castro entente is cause for celebration.\u201cI was almost alone on a Sunday morning in Cuba\u2019s capital city of 2.2 million people. A couple of cars a minute passed, often finned \u201950s beauties, Studebakers and Chevrolets, extravagant and battered. Here and there, a stray mutt scrounged.

The imprisoning sea off Cuba will be imprisoning no more; it will grow dense with container ships and the masts of yachts before long. New buildings will rise and the old will be torn down. That is good, of course it is. Yet the global mall and tourist destination do leave something to be desired.You never know, as Vietnam and Cuba demonstrate. America loses a war against Communism in Southeast Asia, and in time capitalism triumphs.\u201cThe white man is finished in Asia,\u201d said Ho Chi Minh.

To see what conditions prime a place to support Mr. Trump for the presidency, we compared hundreds of demographic and economic variables from census data, along with results from past elections, with this year\u2019s results in the 23 states that have held primaries and caucuses. We examined what factors predict a high level of Trump support relative to the total number of registered voters.The analysis shows that Trump counties are places where white identity mixes with long-simmering economic dysfunctions.The places where Trump has done well cut across many of the usual fault lines of American politics \u2014 North and South, liberal and conservative, rural and suburban. One element common to a significant share of his supporters is that they have largely missed the generation-long transition of the United States away from manufacturing and into a diverse, information-driven economy deeply intertwined with the rest of the world.\u201cIt\u2019s a nonurban, blue-collar and now apparently quite angry population,\u201d said William Frey, a demographer at the Brookings Institution. \u201cThey\u2019re not people who have moved around a lot, and things have been changing away from them, but they live in areas that feel stagnant in a lot of ways.\u201dMr. Trump also has healthy shares of support from the affluent and the well educated \u2014 that point should not be lost.

So is the proportion of working-age adults who neither have a job nor are looking for one. The third-strongest correlation among hundreds of variables tested: the preponderance of mobile homes.Trump counties include places that have voted for both Republicans and Democrats, and the strongest predictors of Trump support include how a county responded to two very different third-party candidates: Trump territory showed stronger support for the segregationist George Wallace in the 1968 election than the rest of the country, and substantially weaker support for the liberal-leaning former Republican John B. Anderson in 1980.Mr. Trump has performed well thus far in Appalachian coal counties and in rural parts of Alabama and Mississippi, which are coping with economic and social dysfunctions like high unemployment rates and heroin addiction. But the Upshot analysis also shows the common thread between those places and more urban locations where Mr. Trump has either done well or is projected to.In Revere, Mass., a working-class suburb of Boston, Mr. Trump won 73 percent of the Republican primary vote. The New York Times\u2019s model suggests he will perform strongly on Long Island when the New York primary takes place April 19 and in Ocean County, N.J., on the Jersey Shore, during voting on June 7.There were only weak correlations between Trump support and various measures of economic performance from 2007 to 2014, including the lingering damage from the 2008 global financial crisis. Rather, the economic problems that line up with strong Trump support have long been in the making, and defy simple fixes.In places where Trump does well, relatively high proportions of workers are in fields that involve working with one\u2019s hands, especially manufacturing. The decline in manufacturing employment is not a story of merely a rough few years for the economy; nationwide factory employment peaked in 1979, and as a proportion of total jobs has been declining almost continually since 1943. Forces including mechanization and trade have put employment prospects in the sector in an ever-worsening position.Likewise, a better predictor of strong Trump support than a standard-issue economic indicator like the unemployment rate is a high proportion of working-age adults who aren\u2019t working (the correlation was strong for both men and women).To be counted as unemployed, a person must have actively looked for work in the last month. But \u201cnot working\u201d is a broader definition that would also include, for example, people who are discouraged by what seem like grim job prospects; who are living at home tending to the house; or who are disabled and stay home while receiving government assistance.Despite evidence that some individual Trump voters are driven by racial hostility, this analysis didn\u2019t show a particularly powerful relationship between the racial breakdown of a county and its likelihood of voting for Trump. There are Trump-supporting counties with both very high and very low proportions of African-Americans, for example.One of the strongest predictors of Trump support is the proportion of the population that is native-born. Relatively few people in the places where Trump is strong are immigrants \u2014 and, as their answers on their ancestry reveal, they very much wear Americanness on their sleeve.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Sanctions Eased, Iran Sends Black Market a Strategic Warning", "Date": "2016-03-19", "News": "Supported byMr. Zanjani\u2019s arrest in 2013, after President Hassan Rouhani came to power, was portrayed as a symbolic break with the high levels of corruption that defined the years under the presidency of Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, from 2005 to 2013. His conviction, by a lower court, was an attempt to show the Iranian public that, with the lifting of sanctions in January, the days of the sanctions-skirting middlemen are over.Reconnecting Iran to the world economy is a top priority for President Rouhani. But to fully reconnect, Iran needs to dismantle the network of thousands of intermediaries that was devised to get around the sanctions. The problem, economists and insiders say, is that enough sanctions remain in place that the Iranian economy still cannot function without the network.The government has taken some steps. The Ministry of Petroleum is working on a new, more competitive model for its oil contracts, and the Parliament signed a bill to fight money laundering, an important step toward more financial transparency.But there is only so much it can do. Regular financial transactions continue to be nearly impossible because the United States has designated the Islamic Republic a \u201cstate sponsor of terrorism,\u201d stemming from its support for the Lebanese Hezbollah movement. International banks doing business with Iran can face up to a billion dollars in penalties if they violate regulations.\u201cThe financial hegemony of the United States is so influential that European banks are scared to work with us,\u201d said Saeed Laylaz, an economist close to the Rouhani government. \u201cWe also don\u2019t have enough dollars in foreign bank accounts, no international credit, so obviously some former sanction breakers continue to have an intermediary role.\u201dIran has another reason to not dismantle the network too hastily. The middlemen it funneled money to for purchases around the world are sitting on billions of unspent dollars. Getting that money back is proving to be extremely difficult, experts say, and will only get harder if the network is dismantled. One financial consultant who requested anonymity because of his dealings with Iranian banks said the problem was exacerbated by a lack of record keeping.Mr. Laylaz estimates that between 5,000 and 10,000 people worked in the network, handling deals worth between $300 billion and $400 billion over the past decade.\u201cAt least 10 percent was taken for commissions,\u201d he said, adding that that number did not include the money still controlled by those in the network, given to them by banks and even government institutions to do business.The chances that the government will ever see that money again are slim, Mr. Laylaz said. \u201cThere are no traces of this money, the people involved have disappeared, heads of institutions have changed,\u201d he said.Nevertheless, the government holds out hope of reclaiming the funds. So for now, analysts say, Iran will limp along, half in the old sanctions-busting world and half out. This will be damaging, Mr. Laylaz said, because \u201ctransparency continues to be a major obstacle for international companies to do business with Iran.\u201dSome businesses have managed to conduct open operations, selling some oil in euros, for example. But that business is limited by traders\u2019 fears about running afoul of the United States Treasury, which enforces the sanctions.Other oil trading houses, such as Vitol and Glencore, have fallen back on bartering Iranian oil in exchange for other fuels. The financial consultant said that many people had become accustomed to the system and that, for the moment, they had no other options because bank transfers are highly complicated. But that simply invites more corruption, analysts say, a problem that reached epic proportions during Mr. Ahmadinejad\u2019s presidency and has still not disappeared. Foreign business delegations visiting Iran and expecting to conduct business in an open and transparent fashion are often taken aback by suggestions that they send money in suitcases or pay into third-party accounts. One European businessman recalled an Iranian counterpart\u2019s suggesting that he hand over cash.With a state-run economy and billions of dollars in oil money in the hands of the government, corruption has always been a problem in Iran, said Mousa Ghaninejad, an economics professor of economy at Shahid Beheshti University in Tehran. \u201cBut nearly a decade of sanctions has intensified the potential of corruption.\u201dQuasi-state companies were given the task of evading the sanctions, and with the assistance of people like Mr. Zanjani made sure the country would keep running.As sanctions slowly started to bite in 2006, Mr. Zanjani set up a worldwide web of dozens of front companies, operating out of Istanbul, Bangkok and Tashkent, Uzbekistan. Iranian state and private businesses would order goods from Mr. Zanjani in Iran, and he would have his foreign companies purchase virtually anything: concrete, food staples, airplanes. The merchandise would be funneled back to Iran, and he took commissions on the sales.A lot of money changed hands, and \u201ca lot of that money is wasted and gone forever,\u201d Mr. Ghaninejad concluded. But some might still be recoverable.That is where Mr. Zanjani comes in, his grim fate supposedly a warning to others in the network to return unspent funds to the government. But the picture is not as clear as officials might like to think, and their ability to intimidate Mr. Zanjani \u2014 and, by extension, others in the network \u2014 is clearly limited.As his case was heard in November, Mr. Zanjani, wearing striped prison pajamas, threatened to release information on corruption by government officials, said the $2 billion the courts say he owes the Ministry of Petroleum was \u201cchump change\u201d for him and added that he would have any sentence overturned on appeal. On that last point legal analysts agree, saying his death sentence is likely to be commuted after he repays the $2 billion.A spokesman for Iran\u2019s judiciary, Gholamhossein Mohseni-Ejei, virtually confirmed as much after the death sentence was handed down. Mr. Zanjani had missed many deadlines for repaying the funds, he said, \u201cbut clearly, if he does return the money this will have influence on his sentence.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Bank bonds, however, will be excluded from the asset-buying plan.The program, which is a form of quantitative easing, is similar to ones undertaken by the Federal Reserve in the United States and the Bank of England in Britain. It is meant to lower interest rates and encourage borrowing, in that way helping economic growth and inflation.Starting in June, the European Central Bank will offer four-year loans to commercial banks every three months until March 2017. It was not clear how many banks would be eligible for the program.Banks could, under special circumstances, be paid to take out the loans, meaning they would effectively receive interest both from the European Central Bank for borrowing the money and interest from the customers they lend the money to.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Competing Interests on Encryption Divide Top Obama Officials", "Date": "2016-03-05", "News": "Supported byDriven by competing and sometimes clashing interests about privacy, national security and the economy, some of the president\u2019s most senior aides are staking out a variety of positions on the issue.The White House denies there is disagreement over the effort to force Apple to break into the phone used by one of the terrorists in the San Bernardino, Calif., shootings, but the differences on how to deal with the broader questions raised by encryption have become increasingly apparent.The Federal Bureau of Investigation wants the ability to break into smartphones and computers for investigations. The Pentagon and intelligence officials worry that the same techniques could be used by foreign powers or hackers to drain data from phones used by the United States government, and that countries like China will demand the same access provided to American law enforcement officials.The conflicting positions were on display last week. On Tuesday, James B. Comey Jr., the director of the F.B.I., testified in Congress about the need for some kind of government action \u2014 he avoided the word \u201clegislation\u201d because the White House has specifically said it is not seeking that now \u2014 that would guarantee access to law enforcement, no matter how encryption technology evolves.A law \u201cwritten in an atmosphere of anger or grief,\u201d he said, is \u201cnot likely to be the right answer.\u201d Later he drove home the point, saying \u201cit would be better to work this out rather than have a law written.\u201d And throughout his talk, Mr. Carter made it clear that he is more interested in securing data than prying into it.Administration officials insist the comments do not reflect serious internal disagreements about policy. They say, for example, that the Justice Department and F.B.I. also support strong encryption \u2014 with limits \u2014 while the heads of the intelligence agencies, responsible for securing government communications, understand the stresses on those investigating serious crimes.In a statement, the White House said on Friday that \u201cour policy on encryption is clear.\u201d But the policy it described delineated the differing positions rather than resolving them.\u201cThe United States government firmly supports the development and robust adoption of strong encryption, which is a key tool to secure commerce and trade, safeguard private information, promote free expression and association,\u201d it said. \u201cAt the same time, encryption poses a grave challenge for our national security and law enforcement professionals.\u201dThe arguments were touched off two and a half years ago, with the revelations by Edward J. Snowden, the N.S.A. contractor, that the agency had gone to some lengths to undercut encryption.There was evidence \u2014 none confirmed, or discussed by the Obama administration \u2014 that the N.S.A. had gained access to the unencrypted communications of servers around the world owned by Google and others to tap into foreign communications. There were suggestions that it had also tampered with the products of a foreign manufacturer of SIM cards, which go into every mobile telephone, to make it easier to intercept calls and emails.The issues were taken up by a presidential commission that included legal scholars and intelligence experts, like Michael J. Morell, the former deputy director of the C.I.A., and Richard A. Clarke, a former senior national security official in the Clinton and Bush administrations who now works in cybersecurity. Their conclusion was unambiguous in opposing the building of so-called back doors for encrypted devices.The commission told President Obama that the United States government should \u201cnot in any way subvert, undermine, weaken or make vulnerable generally available commercial software,\u201d and it urged more companies to adapt such systems.Last month, Admiral Michael S. Rogers, commander of the United States Cyber Command \u2014 the Pentagon\u2019s digital arm, which both protects the Defense Department\u2019s networks and conducts offensive action \u2014 as well as director of the N.S.A., echoed that view in remarks to the Atlantic Council.The view of Admiral Rogers, many experts say, may be affected by the fact that his agency has the best code-cracking capabilities in the world, and he does not need to make public what systems he is already inside. Because he cracks the codes of foreign adversaries (and more than a few allies), he does not need a warrant, as Mr. Comey does. And his agency\u2019s less publicized job is securing the government\u2019s most vital secrets.The technology company has been locked in a major legal battle against law enforcement officials over privacy and security.With more and more government communications relying on mobile devices, including a so-called hardened version of the iPhone and the iPad, the N.S.A. is also not interested in advertising to the world ways in which those devices can be defeated.So far Mr. Obama has fully backed legal efforts by the F.B.I. to force Apple to help authorities unlock the iPhone of the San Bernardino terrorist, who was killed in the attack. But he has rarely spoken about the broader questions, and when asked recently, a senior administration official said the White House still does not favor legislation to solve the issue.The encryption issue seems particularly acute at the State Department and the Commerce Department, both of which have their own sets of concerns.But the system relies on encrypted conversations, to keep them away from Chinese state security or Egypt\u2019s brutal internal police. Any effort to force Apple to break that encryption, several American officials said \u2014 insisting on anonymity because the administration is still debating these issues \u2014 would be replicated from Beijing to Cairo.Commerce Department officials have made the point that if Congress ultimately mandates that all encrypted products must be accessible to investigators, it will be a boon to foreign producers of encryption hardware and software. And there are a lot of them.Bruce Schneier, a cybersecurity expert, published a study recently that said there were \u201cat least 865 hardware or software products incorporating encryption from 55 different countries.\u201d After the United States, Germany tops the list with 112. Most products, Mr. Schneier said recently, \u201care as good as what you would find in the United States.\u201dBut so far users are not flocking to them in mass numbers for a simple reason: For novices, they can be hard to use.Which is exactly what the F.B.I. is hoping for.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "China Sought Fed's Crash Notes", "Date": "2016-03-21", "News": "Supported byInside AsiaWASHINGTON \u2014 Confronted with a plunge in its stock markets last year, China\u2019s central bank swiftly reached out to the United States Federal Reserve, asking it to share its playbook from dealing with Wall Street\u2019s \u201cBlack Monday\u201d crash of 1987.The request came in a July 27 email from an official at the People\u2019s Bank of China, the central bank, with a subject line: \u201cYour urgent assistance is greatly appreciated!\u201dIn the email to a senior Fed staffer, the Chinese bank\u2019s New York-based chief representative for the Americas, Song Xiangyan, pointed to the day\u2019s 8.5 percent drop in Chinese stocks and said, \u201cMy Governor would like to draw from your good experience.\u201dIt is not known whether the People\u2019s Bank of China had contacted the Fed to deal with previous incidents of market turmoil. The Chinese central bank and the Fed had no comment when reached by Reuters.In a Reuters analysis last year, Fed insiders, former Fed employees and economists said that there was no official hotline between the Chinese central bank and the Fed, and that the Chinese were often reluctant to engage at international meetings.The Chinese market crash led to steep declines across global financial markets, and within a few hours the Fed sent China\u2019s central bank a trove of publicly available documents detailing the Fed\u2019s actions in 1987. Fed policy makers started their previously scheduled two-day policy meeting the next day and took note of China\u2019s stock sell-off, according the meeting\u2019s minutes. Several policy makers said a Chinese economic slowdown could weigh on America. Financial market contagion from China was one of the reasons cited by the Fed in September when it put off a rate increase that many analysts had expected, a sign of how important China has become both as an industrial powerhouse and as a financial market.The email exchange, which Reuters obtained through a Freedom of Information Act request, shows how alarmed Beijing has become over the deepening financial turmoil and offers a rare insight into one of the least understood major central banks.The exchange also shows that although the two central banks have a collegial relationship, they might not share secrets even during a crisis. \u201cCould you please inform us ASAP about the major measures you took at the time,\u201d Mr. Song asked Steven Kamin, the director of the Fed\u2019s International Finance Division, in the July 27 email.The message registered in Mr. Kamin\u2019s account just after 11 a.m. in Washington. Mr. Kamin quickly replied from his BlackBerry: \u201cWe\u2019ll try to get you something soon.\u201dWhat followed five hours later was a 259-word summary of how the Fed worked to calm markets and prevent a recession after the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index tumbled 20 percent on Oct. 19, 1987.Mr. Kamin also sent notes to guide Chinese officials through the many dozens of pages of Fed transcripts, statements and reports that were attached to the email.All of the attached documents had long been available on the Fed\u2019s website, and it is unclear whether they played a role in shaping Beijing\u2019s actions. Mr. Kamin\u2019s documents detail how the Fed began issuing statements the day after the Black Monday market crash, pledging to supply markets with plenty of cash so they could function. By the time Mr. Song wrote to Mr. Kamin, China had spent more than a month fighting a stock market slide, and many of the actions taken by the People\u2019s Bank of China and other Chinese authorities shared the contours of the Fed\u2019s 1987 game plan.China\u2019s central bank had cut interest rates on June 27 in similar fashion to the Fed\u2019s swift move to ease short-term rates in 1987.Mr. Song told Mr. Kamin that the Chinese central bank was particularly interested in the details of the Fed\u2019s use of repurchase agreements to temporarily inject cash into the American banking system in 1987. The People\u2019s Bank of China had increased cash injections in June and accelerated repurchase agreements in August as stocks continued to slide. The bank also eased policy on Aug. 11 by allowing a 2 percent devaluation in the renminbi. As Mr. Song and Mr. Kamin exchanged messages on July 27 and 28, other Chinese authorities were busy trying to contain the crash. The July 27 plunge in the Shanghai composite index was the biggest one-day fall since 2007. The Chinese market had lost nearly a third of its value over six weeks. China\u2019s securities regulator said on July 27 it was prepared to buy shares to stabilize the stock market and that authorities would deal severely with anyone making \u201cmalicious\u201d bets that stocks would fall.In 1987, the Fed contacted banks directly and encouraged them to meet \u201clegitimate funding needs\u201d of their customers, according to Mr. Kamin\u2019s email to Mr. Song.In addition to its pledges and cajoling, the Fed in 1987 eased collateral restrictions on Wall Street and tried to calm markets by intervening in trading earlier than normal. The United States economy continued to grow until a recession in 1990.The Chinese central bank does not have as free a hand to conduct policy as does the Fed, which answers to Congress but operates independently from the administration. The Chinese central bank\u2019s governor, Zhou Xiaochuan, implements policies ultimately decided by political leaders in Beijing and lacks the authority to lead debate or shed light on decision-making.China\u2019s vice finance minister told Reuters last year that Chinese supervisors needed to learn from countries like the United States.Premier Li Keqiang said last month that China\u2019s regulators did not respond sufficiently but that China had fended off risks to the system. United States central bankers say their relative transparency helps their effectiveness and legitimacy, but open records laws also make Fed officials cautious about their communications, much of which must be made public when requested. Stanley Fischer, the Fed\u2019s current vice chairman, has said that transparency makes it harder for policy makers to have informal discussions. Mr. Kamin pointed out in his email that everything he was sending was publicly available.\u201cI hope this is helpful,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Shouldn\u2019t Congress Tell Us How We\u2019ll Pay for Tax Cuts?", "Date": "2016-03-22", "News": "Supported byOp-Ed ContributorTHE long-endangered Republican Deficit Hawk is now extinct.In December, the Republican Congress passed into law a huge permanent package of tax measures as part of the tax and spending deal. However, Republicans refused to pay for the legislation, thereby adding a thunderous $2 trillion to the deficit over the next two decades, according to an estimate from the nonpartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget.As House Republicans prepare to leave for two weeks of recess without passing a budget for next year, the cost of this tax package is casting a long shadow over America\u2019s future, threatening to crowd out essential investments for hard-working American families.Why isn\u2019t there a rule requiring lawmakers to account for new expenditures by finding offsetting budget cuts or revenue increases when Congress enacts them? In fact, there is.In 1982, George Miller, a progressive Democratic Congressman from California, had a simple but transformative idea to cut the deficit and restore fiscal responsibility to Washington, which he called pay as you go, or paygo. Under this rule, when Congress wanted to pass a new law that would increase the deficit, legislators would have to pay for the cost with matching revenue increases or spending cuts.Paygo still allows for flexibility in overall discretionary budget increases and in times of emergency, but it forces lawmakers to account for the impact of laws that have consequences for federal revenues or mandatory spending.It\u2019s so common-sense that most people would be surprised it hasn\u2019t always been the rule. After all, even the priorities we want and need must still be paid for.The historic Tax Reform Act of 1986 \u2014 sponsored by Democrats and signed into law by President Ronald Reagan \u2014 was grounded in this rule. In 1990, paygo was passed into law as part of the budget process under President George H.W. Bush. We extended it through the deficit-reduction and budget agreements of the Bill Clinton years, driving four consecutive annual budgets that were either in balance or in surplus.Since then, however, Congress has often failed to do the hard, necessary work of paying for what it wants.President Clinton handed his successor, President George W. Bush, a projected $5.6 trillion 10-year budget surplus and eight years of economic expansion. But Republicans quickly abandoned any measure of fiscal responsibility and began a catastrophic spending spree. The completely unpaid-for tax cuts, including huge tax cuts for the wealthy in 2001, and two completely unpaid-for wars shattered our multitrillion-dollar surplus and created a vast new deficit.After President Bush left the White House, President Obama was faced with a staggering $1.2 trillion projected budget deficit in his first year alone, according to estimates from the Congressional Budget Office, and an economy in free fall. Under President Obama, the paygo law was reinstated, and we\u2019ve brought the annual deficit from $1.2 trillion when President Obama took office to $544 billion today.With the recent tax package, however, the Republican Congress is once again ignoring the inescapable mathematical realities behind budgeting. In advancing a narrow and expensive agenda largely benefiting special interests, they are adding trillions to the deficit in the coming decades.Some of the provisions in the tax package have long been championed by Democrats \u2014 especially credits that help put more money in the pockets of hardworking but low-earning men and women, as well as working parents raising children or trying to send a child to college. Modernizing and making the research and development tax credit permanent is central to Democrats\u2019 Innovation Agenda.However, Republicans used these provisions to advance hundreds of billions of dollars in unpaid-for tax breaks. Furthermore, Republicans refused to pay for any of the $622 billion in tax extenders, good or bad. With the additional cost of debt service factored in, this permanent tax package will add well over $800 billion to the deficit in the first 10 years alone \u2014 reaching $2 trillion over 20 years.In devising the December 2015 omnibus legislation to fund the government, Democrats were obliged to find money to cover every budget increase. We even scrounged on behalf of our 9/11 responders, coming up with the funds to cover $7 billion in the budget for their lost wages and treatment of their illnesses from exposure to toxins at ground zero.The Republican refusal to adhere to paygo is not only a problem for our deficit. It undermines the long-overdue passage of broad, bipartisan tax reform that would lower the corporate rate, close special interest loopholes, end costly tax expenditures, and ensure that all Americans are paying their fair share.To contain and reduce the national debt, we must return to a simple rule called pay as you go. We can restore fairness to the tax code, delivering reforms that support bigger paychecks and better infrastructure for the American people, even as we honor basic fiscal realities.Nancy Pelosi is the Democratic leader in the 114th Congress.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Project Reclaims an Abandoned Stretch of New Jersey Coast", "Date": "2016-03-08", "News": "Supported bySquare FeetSAYREVILLE, N.J. \u2014 A bleak expanse of coastal New Jersey, polluted by paint pigments and abandoned for decades, is undergoing a makeover that will bring a major development of housing, retail space and office space a half-hour\u2019s drive from Lower Manhattan.In coming weeks, the O\u2019Neill Properties Group will officially break ground on the 5.8 million-square-foot project, The Pointe. The 418-acre site, south of Staten Island, is at the heart of a highway network that already carries some 400,000 vehicles a day directly past the site, and on summer weekends, hundreds of thousands more.The groundbreaking will make way for the anchor retail tenant, Bass Pro Shops, to build a 200,000-square-foot store. The store is expected to open in June 2017 as the first stage of a planned 2.4 million square feet of retail space.The developer has also agreed with Regal Cinemas to build a 55,000-square-foot movie theater complex, and is in talks with about 20 other potential retail tenants.Over the next seven to 10 years, the development is to add 750,000 square feet of office space, up to 1,000 hotel rooms, and 2,000 apartments overlooking the Raritan River.By mid-2017, the complex is to have its own highway interchange, which will provide 12 on- and off-ramps for the adjacent Garden State Parkway and U.S. 9 and Route 35 nearby. Together, these highways carry some 600,000 people a day to and from jobs in New York City or to Jersey Shore towns to the south, according to data from the New Jersey Turnpike Authority, the state\u2019s Department of Transportation and Maser Consulting, an engineering firm working on the project.The high volume of traffic, and the accessibility of the new development to the major Northeast market, represent an unusual opportunity for potential tenants, said the developer\u2019s chief executive, Brian O\u2019Neill Sr.\u201cOne hundred percent of New Jersey shore visitors pass through this intersection if they are coming from the five boroughs of New York City, northern New Jersey and southern Connecticut,\u201d Mr. O\u2019Neill said, in an interview in a trailer on the edge of the site.\u201cIn summertime, there are days when there are a million cars, or two or three million people, coming through this intersection,\u201d he said, \u201cwhich makes for one of the most spectacular opportunities for retailers to expose themselves to their clientele.\u201dThe project is a joint venture of O\u2019Neill Properties and Prudential Real Estate Investors, and is expected to cost at least $2.2 billion by the time it is finished, Mr. O\u2019Neill said. The interchange is being constructed at a cost of $85 million, $15 million of which is being paid by the developer and the remainder by the state.New Jersey, America\u2019s most densely populated state, has long sought to redevelop its so-called brownfield sites, abandoned and often contaminated tracts formerly used for commercial or industrial purposes. O\u2019Neill Properties, based in King of Prussia, Pa., specializes in brownfield redevelopment.NL Industries was found to be at least partly responsible for contamination there, which included PCBs, titanium dioxide and technologically enhanced naturally occurring radioactive material. This required a multiyear environmental remediation project costing $45 million, and involving the removal or treatment of 360,000 cubic yards of soil.Cleaning up the lagoon turned out to be far more challenging than the company expected when it bought the property, said Brian O\u2019Neill Jr., Mr. O\u2019Neill\u2019s son, who manages the Sayreville project.\u201cWe were unaware of the depth and consistency of the material that was in the lagoon,\u201d Mr. O\u2019Neill Jr., 29, said. \u201cIn some places it turned out to be 10 feet thick of this acidic paintlike substance, like quicksand.\u201dThe solution was to inject 38,000 tons of portland cement into hundreds of cells in the lagoon, an operation that took a year and a half and has now created a stable site where Bass Pro Shops can build. Remediation on other parts of the site is continuing, and some environmental permits are still pending, Mr. O\u2019Neill Jr. said.Before O\u2019Neill Properties purchased the site, it was the subject of a number of lawsuits between NL Industries, Sayreville\u2019s economic development agency and the state Department of Environmental Protection, all of which were resolved by the purchase, Mr. O\u2019Neill Jr. said. NL Industries did not respond to requests for comment.The company says that the costly and time-consuming process of reclaiming the site from its toxic history is justified by the unique opportunity to own such a large parcel of developable land in the midst of one of the country\u2019s biggest markets.\u201cThe real estate fundamentals of this site are unparalleled,\u201d Mr. O\u2019Neill Jr. said, noting that the waterfront property promised to be an additional attraction for future residents.Matt S. Krauser, senior managing director in northern New Jersey for Integra Realty Resources, a national valuation company, agreed that the availability and development of a big parcel in a prime location were rare and promising.\u201cTo be able to acquire 400 acres right off the parkway with ease of accessibility both north and south, it\u2019s really an unusual project in an unusual location,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s more or less a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to be able to construct something like this.\u201dHe said that the project was a departure from the town center type of development that had dominated in recent years. With its office and residential components, the Sayreville project could be seen as a hybrid, he said.\u201cIt\u2019s building its own downtown in the suburbs,\u201d Mr. Krauser said.Combined with seven digital media towers, also alongside the Garden State Parkway, the development will create 226,000 square feet of digital signage, all of which has been approved by state and local authorities, the developer said.The signs represent a major opportunity for advertisers to reach millions of people at a lower cost than other forms of mass advertising, Mr. O\u2019Neill Sr. said. And millions of customers riding along the parkway, he added, \u201ccan\u2019t block it out.\u201dThe new development was welcomed by Kennedy O\u2019Brien, Sayreville\u2019s mayor, who said the borough\u2019s officials approved it because it was a mixed-use project with a residential element. That offers Sayreville the prospect of reviving its depressed center, he said, which was built more than 100 years ago and has scarce parking and very little economic opportunity.\u201cIt\u2019s not a gathering place for the people of Sayreville anymore,\u201d Mr. O\u2019Brien said, in contrast to the new development, which he called \u201ca natural evolution for a town like ours.\u201dSayreville, which formerly made bricks for the construction of Manhattan and munitions for World War I, is a middle-income community of some 43,000 people where homeownership is high, foreclosures are low and church attendance is widespread, Mr. O\u2019Brien said. \u201cIt\u2019s a Norman Rockwell American town,\u201d he said.Mr. O\u2019Brien added that the development would be a good source of new tax revenue to bolster the local economy.\u201cThis will provide a great injection of extra money into our tax base,\u201d Mr. O\u2019Brien said. \u201cIt will provide employment opportunities, and Bass Pro Shops will provide a great place for husbands to go when their wives go shopping.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Q. and A.: Jason Y. Ng on Aftermath of Hong Kong\u2019s Umbrella Revolution", "Date": "2016-03-24", "News": "Supported bySinosphereBut the picture is not all rosy. Social awakening notwithstanding, Occupy ultimately failed to gain any concessions from Beijing on the issue of universal suffrage. That left many Hong Kongers disillusioned and bitter. Society is more polarized than ever, anti-mainland sentiment is at an all-time high and the rise of localism is radicalizing the opposition. We are bracing for more turbulence ahead.Hong Kong is ranked No. 1 on The Economist\u2019s crony-capitalism index. Rampant government-business collusion is widening the income gap and pushing property prices through the stratosphere. One in five people here lives below the poverty line, and a decent home continues to elude even the middle class.I also wanted to humanize the movement. For readers who didn\u2019t have the opportunity to participate in or witness the protests, I wanted to recreate the experience for them by weaving anecdotal accounts and recurring characters into the narrative.None of that should be surprising. After Occupy ended without achieving any political results, young people needed to get their frustrations out of their system so that the healing could begin. If South Korea and Taiwan managed to eventually reach their political maturity and blossom into full-fledged democracies, so can Hong Kong. Or so we hope.But that\u2019s exactly what Beijing doesn\u2019t want to see happen. The Chinese leadership would like Hong Kong to remain an economic city devoid of ideology or a sense of identity.I believe Beijing has given the Hong Kong government specific orders to avoid human causalities, which could spark yet another uprising and give the foreign press a story to write about. The Chinese leadership has enough on its hands these days: an epic antigraft campaign, a sputtering economy and sporadic regional insurgencies. It can\u2019t afford to have a mini-Tiananmen Square massacre in Hong Kong.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Raise the Minimum Wage to $15?", "Date": "2016-03-11", "News": "Supported byLettersTo the Editor:While it is true that it would be very difficult to live on one\u2019s own on $9 an hour, it is even harder with no job at all. And when someone is sharing a home with family, friends or a domestic partner, every income, however modest, helps meet expenses. A low-wage \u201cstarter job\u201d is often the best way for teenagers, immigrants and labor force re-entrants to acquire the skills that will eventually qualify them for higher-paying jobs.The $15 minimum wage proposed by Gov. Andrew Cuomo will at best drive these jobs underground, and at worst will turn the lowest-skilled into perpetual welfare clients by denying them entry-level employment. Instead of raising the minimum wage, New York\u2019s legislators should eliminate it altogether.J. HUSTON McCULLOCHNew YorkThe writer is an adjunct professor of economics at New York University.To the Editor:Republicans in New York, and everywhere else in the country for that matter, use scare tactics in the quest to defeat legislation for a livable wage. \u201cSmall-business owners will be ruined.\u201d \u201cLow-wage workers will lose jobs.\u201d And on and on.But I read Paul Krugman, so I know that workers making minimum wage will spend the increase in their salaries, and spend it in their local communities. A living wage means buying a pizza and new shoes for the kids, a new television and curtains for the living room, and even splurging for tickets to a ballgame. Those are, of course, the components of a vigorous economy.Republicans in the State Senate will oppose, stall, misinform and beat back any threat to their livelihood, which is to carry out the wishes of corporations and the entitled class. Personally, I am middle class and make a lot more than $15 an hour, but I have the good sense to know a move in the right direction when I see it. If state Republicans cannot see it, perhaps a change of view for them come Election Day is warranted. PIETRO ALLARForest Hills, QueensTo the Editor:Those who support a higher minimum wage are wrongly assuming that everyone who is currently earning $9 per hour will be earning $15 per hour when the minimum wage increases. As a small-business owner who employs minimum wage workers, I assure you that when the wage increases, small businesses like mine will most likely dismiss our current workers and hire much more competent workers (that is, college educated). I feel for the uneducated who will end up unemployed when the wage increases.DAVID PACCHIANACortlandt Manor, N.Y.To the Editor:We agree with your editorial regarding the need to support a minimum-wage increase for New York. But the governor\u2019s proposed state budget contains no additional Medicaid funding to pay for the increased costs of a higher minimum wage for those offering home care services, which are primarily funded through Medicaid. Home care agencies funded through Medicaid have faced years of increased costs, inadequate reimbursements and delayed payments that have put many agencies in crisis.Home care workers deserve to be paid more, but increasing their wages will mean nothing if home care agencies are no longer there to employ them or to provide services due to the lack of Medicaid funding for increased minimum-wage costs.

{"Headline": "Transcript of the Democratic Presidential Debate in Miami", "Date": "2016-03-10", "News": "Supported bySALINAS (through translator): Now, we\u2019re going to welcome the protagonists of this debate. First, former Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton.(APPLAUSE)And Senator from Vermont Bernie Sanders.(APPLAUSE)Welcome to both of you. Thank you for being here.(SPEAKING IN SPANISH)SALINAS (through translator): Welcome to both of you.RAMOS (through translator): But before we continue, we want to welcome Sebastian de la Cruz (ph) who is going to sing the national anthem.Sebastian, welcome. Good evening.(STAR SPANGLED BANNER)(APPLAUSE)(COMMERCIAL BREAK)SALINAS (through translator): Thank you for being with us. The Washington Post and Facebook, these are the results of this debate that the candidates have accepted. They will have 90 seconds to answer each question. When their rival mentions them in an answer, they will have 30 seconds to answer and another 30 seconds to answer questions, follow-up questions that we ask.RAMOS (through translator): We will make our questions in English and they will be translated simultaneously into Spanish for our viewers. And right now, each one of them has one minute for your initial words. We begin with Secretary Clinton.(APPLAUSE)And tonight I am looking forward to the opportunity to discuss how we knock down the barriers that stand in the way of people getting ahead and staying ahead, starting with the economic ones. My focus is on more good paying jobs with rising incomes for families and how we prevent corporations from taking jobs out of our country by imposing an exit tax, making them pay back any tax breaks they\u2019ve gotten.But we also need to be having a positive agenda for manufacturing. for small businesses and entrepreneurs, for more clean energy jobs. And I also look forward to discussing comprehensive immigration reform with a path to citizenship that will be one of my priorities in my first 100 days as president. And I will also be talking about education, every child deserves a good teacher and a good school.Together we\u2019re going to have to overturn this disastrous Citizens United Supreme Court decision. (APPLAUSE)And here in Miami...(APPLAUSE)First question, Secretary, you have been starting to sound like the nominee lately, but many voters are saying, not so fast. Where did you fail last night in Michigan?So this is a marathon, and it\u2019s a marathon that can only be carried out by the kind of inclusive campaign that I\u2019m running, a campaign that reaches out to everybody, a campaign that offers real positive solutions to the problems that we face, a campaign that is based on how together we can make progress, because I am a progressive who likes to get things done.So I\u2019m excited about the upcoming contests, including right here in Florida. And we\u2019ll continue to work as hard as I can to earn the vote of every single voter.(APPLAUSE)(APPLAUSE)And I think in the coming weeks and months, we are going to continue to do extremely well, win a number of these primaries, and convince superdelegates that Bernie Sanders is the strongest candidate to defeat Donald Trump.(APPLAUSE)That goes against a memo that you personally sent to your employees in 2011 directing all of them to use official email, precisely because of security concerns. So it seems that you issued one set of rules for yourself and a different set of rules for the rest of the State Department.So who specifically gave you permission to operate your email system as you did? Was it President Barack Obama? And would you drop out of the race if you get indicted?And some other parts of the government, we\u2019re not exactly sure who, has concluded that some of the emails should be now retroactively classified. They\u2019ve just said the same thing to former Secretary Colin Powell. They have said, we\u2019re going to retroactively classify emails you sent personally.CLINTON: Now I think he was right when he said this is an absurdity. And I think that what we have got here is a case of overclassification.(APPLAUSE)(APPLAUSE)When he was engaging in rhetoric that I found deeply offensive. I said basta (ph), and I am pleased that others... (APPLAUSE)(APPLAUSE)I\u2019m not going to engage in the kind of language that he uses. I think we can make the case against him if he is the nominee, by pointing out what he has said. What he claims to believe in The values he\u2019s promoting and I think that\u2019s a better way for the American people to draw their conclusions.(APPLAUSE)(APPLAUSE)(APPLAUSE)Maria Elena?So, are you flip-flopping on this issue? Or are you pandering to Latinos, what some would call Hispandering?(LAUGHTER)I think our best chance was in 2007, when Ted Kennedy led the charge on comprehensive immigration reform. We have Republican support. We had a president willing to sign it. I voted for that bill. Senator Sanders voted against it.Just think, imagine where we would be today is we had achieved comprehensive immigration reform nine years ago. Imagine how much more secure families would be in our country, no longer fearing the deportation of a loved one; no longer fearing that they would be found out.So I am staunchly in favor of comprehensive immigration reform and have been so over the course of my public career.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)(END VIDEO CLIP)(CROSSTALK)Of course, that type of (inaudible) leads to a race to the bottom for all of our people. And I worked very hard on that issue. And of course, I supported the 2013 immigration reform bill. And what I believe right now is not only that we need comprehensive immigration reform, if the Congress does not do its job, as president of the United States I will use the executive powers of that office to do what has to be done, to do what President Obama did, and expand on that.(APPLAUSE)... if you\u2019re saying that you would expand on the executive actions, how do you that they\u2019re not going to end up in a legal battle just like Obama\u2019s executive actions?But to your point, we have to do the best we can. I applaud President Obama for his efforts on DAPA and DACA. And I think we have got to expand those efforts.(APPLAUSE) You know, I think it\u2019s very hard to make the case that Ted Kennedy, Barack Obama, me, La Raza, United Farmworkers, Dolores Huerta, leaders of the Latino community, would have supported a bill that actually promoted modern slavery. That was one of the many excuses used not to vote for the 2007 bill.And I will go back to what I said. If we had been able to get that passed, we would be so much further along now. I\u2019m committed to defending DAPA and DACA. I\u2019m committed to going even further to get more people deferred action, to go as far as I can under the law. And I am committed to introducing comprehensive immigration reform with a path to citizenship in the first 100 days of my presidency.SALINAS: Secretary Sanders (sic). Senator, would you like to respond?(APPLAUSE)When we talk about immigration, the secretary will remember that one of the great tragedies, human tragedies of recent years is children came from Honduras where there\u2019s probably more violence than almost any place in this country, and they came into this country. And I said welcome those children into this country, Secretary Clinton said send them back. That\u2019s a difference.First of all, that is something that is not fair about what I said. I did say we needed to be very concerned about little children coming to this country \u2014 on their own, very often \u2014 many of them not making it. And when they got here, they needed, as I have argued for, legal counsel, due process, to make a decision. We need to end private detention, we need to end family detention.And in 2006, when Senator Sanders was running for the Senate from Vermont, he voted in the House with hard-line Republicans for indefinite detention for undocumented immigrants, and then he sided with those Republicans to stand with vigilantes known as Minute Men who were taking up outposts along the border to hunt down immigrants.So I think when you were running for the Senate, you made it clear by your vote, Senator, that you were going to stand with the Republicans. When you got to the Senate in 2007, one of the first things you did was vote against Ted Kennedy\u2019s immigration reform which he\u2019d been working on for years before you ever arrived.(APPLAUSE)(APPLAUSE)And I went there on my own. Wasn\u2019t an issue really for the state of Vermont to expose the horrendous working conditions and the semi slavery, if you like, that those workers lived under. And the result of that hearing and the work that many, many people did was to significantly improve the wages and working conditions of those workers.(APPLAUSE)RAMOS (through translator): So this is the moment of talking about deportations. We\u2019re going to immigrants.SALINAS (through translator): (inaudible) Facebook page (inaudible). Tell us what you think of the debate in the comment section. We will come back after the break.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)RAMOS (through translator): We\u2019re back to the Democratic debate.Secretary Clinton, the last time we talked in January, in Iowa, I asked you if you could be the next deporting chief. And you told me, no, that you wouldn\u2019t be the next deporter in chief. However, you refused two times to say you would not deport children. This is what you said.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)(END VIDEO CLIP)(APPLAUSE)(APPLAUSE)Secretary Clinton did not support those children coming into this country. I did.Now I happen to agree with President Obama on many, many issues. I think he has done a great job as president of the United States. He is wrong on this issue of deportation. I disagree with him on that.(APPLAUSE)(APPLAUSE)When I was secretary of state, I worked to try to support many different approaches to ending the violence in Central America. I was there meeting with leaders, security leaders, and others. And I think the Congress should support the president\u2019s request to fund programs that would protect people and change the culture of criminality and violence in Central America, helping people be able to stay safely in their homes and countries.(APPLAUSE)And I worked very hard in improving the guest worker provisions so that in 2013 a bill I strongly supported, people who were in the guest worker program in America would not be treated like slaves. (APPLAUSE)They have proven to be right in the succeeding years. I only hope that we can put together a coalition to pass comprehensive immigration reform in the next Congress. And as I said earlier, in 2006, Senator Sanders supported indefinite detention for people facing deportation...So look, I think the goal here is to elect a Democratic Senate, elect a Democratic president and get to work immediately to get comprehensive immigration reform.(APPLAUSE)No, I did not oppose the bailout or the support of the automobile industry. No, I do not support vigilantes, and that is a horrific statement, an unfair statement to make.(APPLAUSE)I will stand (inaudible) of my career, political career fighting for workers, fighting for the poorest people in this country. Madame Secretary, I will match my record against yours any day of the week. (APPLAUSE)A month later, in January, a new piece of legislation was offered that contained the money that would be used for the auto rescue. Then President-elect Obama \u2014 before he\u2019d even been sworn in \u2014 sent word to all of us that he really hoped we would support it. He was still in the Senate, I was still in the Senate.And I voted for it. It was a hard vote. I\u2019ll tell you, it was a hard vote. A lot of the votes you make are hard votes. But the fact is the money that rescued the auto industry was in that bill.(APPLAUSE)(APPLAUSE)And I find it interesting that when Secretary Clinton, who was the former senator of New York, of course, when she defended her vote, she said, well, it\u2019s going to help the big banks in New York. Those are my constituents. And then you go to Detroit and suddenly this legislation helps the automobile workers. There was an article just yesterday...(APPLAUSE)Next question. Secretary Clinton, you recently said instead of building walls we need to tear down barriers. However, last November in New Hampshire, you openly said that as senator you voted numerous times to build the wall with Mexico. What\u2019s the difference between what you did, voting to build the wall, and what Donald Trump wants to do now?Apprehensions coming across the border are the lowest they\u2019ve been in 40 years, which just strengthens my argument that now it\u2019s time to do comprehensive immigration reform. CLINTON: The Republicans, the opponents no longer have an argument. And certainly, we hear a lot coming from the Republican side that is absolutely out of touch with reality. We raised money through the congressional appropriations process. We enhanced the border security. That part of the work is done.Everybody that I know has looked at it said, okay, we have a secure border. There\u2019s no need for this rhetoric and demagoguery that\u2019s still \u2014is carried out on the Republican side. You\u2019ve run out of excuses. Let\u2019s move to comprehensive immigration reform with a path to citizenship. And I think that makes a very strong argument in favor of doing it.(LAUGHTER)Right? A beautiful tall wall. The most beautiful tall wall, better than the Great Wall of China, that would run the entire border. That he would somehow magically get the Mexican government to pay for. And, you know, it\u2019s just fantasy. And in fact, if he cared to know anything about what members of Congress, like the senator and I have done, where it was necessary, we did support some fencing.Where it was necessary, we did add border patrol agents. We have done what by any fair estimate would have to conclude is a good job, quote, \u201csecuring the border\u201d. So let\u2019s get about the business of comprehensive immigration reform.(APPLAUSE)But to answer your question, the essence of what we are trying to do is to unite families, not to divide families.(APPLAUSE)That is beyond comprehension and policies that should not be allowed to exist. So, ma\u2019am, I will do everything that I can to unite your family. Your children deserve to be with their mother.(APPLAUSE)You are doing your very best to support your children. But it is time to bring families together. And I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any doubt that we must do more to let stories like yours be heard more widely so that more Americans know what the human cost of these policies are.And I will do everything I can to prevent other families from facing what you are facing. And I will do everything I can to pass laws that would bring families back together. And I hope that your children are all either citizens born in this country or eligible for the programs that President Obama has put into place, DACA and DAPA, because I will defend those and I will absolutely protect your children, yourself, and try to bring your family back together.(APPLAUSE)Secretary Clinton, they are U.S. citizens (inaudible).(APPLAUSE)Thank you.Now let\u2019s go back to Karen.Secretary Clinton, a Washington Post poll just yesterday found that only 37 percent of Americans consider you honest and trustworthy. Now, when you\u2019ve been asked about this in the past, you have said that this is the result of many, many years of Republican attacks upon you. But Americans have also had 25 \u2014 more than that \u2014 years to get to know you for themselves.Is there anything in your own actions and the decisions that you yourself have made that would foster this kind of mistrust?And I also have, you know, very much committed to the best of my ability my energies and efforts to helping people. That\u2019s something that I care deeply about. And I will continue to do that, to demonstrate by my past actions and my present levels of commitment and plans that people can count on me.That is certainly what happened to me in New York, where people got to know me. They saw me in action. And they did.Look, I have said before and it won\u2019t surprise anybody to hear me say it, this is not easy for me. It\u2019s not easy to do what I think is right, to help people, to even the odds, to hear a story like the woman\u2019s story we just heard. And to know that I can make a difference and I want to in every way possible.I am not a natural politician, in case you haven\u2019t noticed, like my husband or President Obama. So I have a view that I just have to do the best I can, get the results I can, make a difference in people\u2019s lives, and hope that people see that I\u2019m fighting for them and that I can improve conditions economically and other ways that will benefit them and their families.(APPLAUSE)Senator Sanders, you have demanded that Secretary Clinton release the transcripts of her paid Wall Street speeches. Why is this important? Do you have reason to believe that she says one thing in private and another in public?SANDERS: Well, what I have said is that when you get I believe it is $225,000 for giving a speech, and she gave several speeches to Goldman Sachs, one of the Wall Street financial institutions whose greed and illegal behavior helped destroy our economy a number of years ago, when you get paid $225,000, that means that that speech must have been an extraordinarily wonderful speech.(APPLAUSE)(LAUGHTER)(APPLAUSE)(CROSSTALK)(APPLAUSE)Now, the secretary says it doesn\u2019t influence her. Well, that\u2019s what every politician says who gets money from special interests.(APPLAUSE)(APPLAUSE)I went to the Orlando area during the \u201908 campaign to make the same case, visiting with families who had been defrauded by mortgages, these subprime mortgages that put them and their homes at risk.(APPLAUSE)(APPLAUSE)(APPLAUSE)(BOOING)(CROSSTALK)(LAUGHTER)(APPLAUSE)(APPLAUSE)But they did just put up a little video praising you for being the only Democrat who stood with the Republicans to try to eliminate the Export/Import Bank, which has helped hundreds and hundreds of companies here in Florida be able to export their goods and employ more Floridians. So from my perspective, you sided with the Koch brothers.(APPLAUSE)(APPLAUSE)(BOOING)(BOOING)(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)(END VIDEO CLIP)I and everybody in the administration, all the people she named, the president, the vice president, Susan Rice, we were scrambling to get information that was changing, literally by the hour. And when we had information, we made it public. But then sometimes we had to go back and say we have new information that contradicts it.So I testified for 11 hours.(APPLAUSE)And this is not the first time we lost Americans in a terrorist attack. We lost 3,000 people on 9/11. We lost Americans serving in embassies in Tanzania and Kenya when my husband was president. We lost 250 Americans, both military and civilian, when Ronald Reagan was president in Beirut.And at no other time were those tragedies were they politicized(APPLAUSE).(APPLAUSE)We have captured one of the lead terrorists and he admits it was both a terrorist attack and it was influenced by the video. This was fog of war. This was complicated. The most effective, comprehensive reports and studies demonstrate that.Look, as I said in the beginning, I deeply regret that we lost four Americans.And I wish that there could be an easy answer at the time, but we learned a lot, and the intelligence kept...Gadhafi was a brutal dictator, there\u2019s no question. But one of the differences between the secretary and I is I\u2019m not quite so aggressive with regard to regime change. I voted against the war in Iraq because I had a fear of what would happen the day after.(APPLAUSE)And Secretary Clinton talks about Henry Kissinger...(APPLAUSE)We\u2019re taking a break. (through translator) We\u2019ll continue with topics that are of interest to Spanish (inaudible) education, what to do with student debt. Two topics that we will deal in a moment in the Democratic debate.RAMOS (through translator): We remind you that you can download (inaudible) and we\u2019ll come back with the Democratic presidential debate.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)(UNKNOWN) (through translator): And we continue now, connected with Univision for you to send us (inaudible) first Democratic debate focusing in Hispanic topics. I have (inaudible) that supported (inaudible).Good evening, good evening.We heard a lot about immigration, about the deportations and race. In your opinion, who (inaudible) better and who presented the immigration proposal?The six months \u2014 that we have seen as immigration is concerned, and we see that they\u2019re moving towards. The community needs to not only immigration reform, but the raids have to stop. Families that we have seen that are suffering, they have to be reunited.(UNKNOWN) (through translator): We heard very emotional testimony of a mother that was brave enough to come here with her five children. How did you feel when you heard her story? And do you think that the candidates had empathy with the story?And this is what we see that is happening, that Republicans are doing not \u2014 by not approving a migratory reform, but also President Obama. So we need \u2014 we need not only words, but plans as well. And we need as a community to both stand up and support women as her.(UNKNOWN) (through translator): Thank you, Gabby (ph), and now the debate \u2014 the Democratic debate continues with Jorge Ramos and Maria Elena Salinas. Thank you.We\u2019ll continue with the debate now.Senator Sanders, you call your opponent Hillary Clinton an establishment politician. You yourself are a career politician. Why should voters prefer a career politicians over an establishment politician?I don\u2019t take money from the pharmaceutical industry because I believe they are ripping off the American people and charging us the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs.(APPLAUSE)I don\u2019t take money from the fossil fuel industry because they are destroying \u2014 they are destroying this planet through their emissions of carbon and creating the terrible climate change that we are seeing.So I think it is true that I have served in Congress for many years. But if you check my record, it is a record of strength for the environment, for workers, for seniors. Unlike the secretary, I believe we should expand Social Security benefits. It is a record of achievement for veterans, working with Republicans, helping to craft the most significant veterans healthcare bill passed in many decades.So I think the point is look at the record, and it\u2019s a record that I am proud of.(APPLAUSE)So, last week you tweeted that for the GOP, the economy is an after thought. Well, many Latinos feel that they are an after thought. Do you understand what the specific needs of Latinos are to improve their living conditions?And there are several things that need to be addressed. We do have to do more infrastructure spending. That will put many Americans to work. It\u2019s a good job that gets you on the ladder to the middle class. We need to improve the conditions for manufacturing in our country and punish those companies that want to export jobs. We need them to be incentivized to create jobs right here in America.We also do have to combat climate change, and no state has more at stake in that than Florida. And the best way to do that is not only enforcing the laws we have, but also the clean power plan that President Obama has put forth that I support, and the Paris agreement that I think was a huge step forward in the world, that Senator Sanders said was too weak, but I helped to lay the groundwork for that.CLINTON: But we need more clean energy jobs and we have to do more to help small businesses. You know, the fastest-growing segment of small businesses are minority and women-owned small business, and we need to help businesses get started.The very distinguished congresswoman from New York who\u2019s been on the Small Business Committee, Congresswoman Velasquez, knows exactly what we need to be doing to create more small businesses. We do need to raise the minimum wage and we have to guarantee equal pay for women.(APPLAUSE)Every child deserves a good teacher in a good school, regardless of the zip code that they live in. Following behind that is health care and how important it is to continue to build on the Affordable Care Act and provide access to health care. And then there are a number of other issues \u2014 comprehensive immigration reform certainly at the top.(LAUGHTER)One of the points that I\u2019ve been making, and media does not seem to pick up on it, is that we have a real crisis not only with real unemployment in America being close to 10 percent, but youth unemployment in this country.If you look at Latino kids between 17 and 20 who graduated high school, 36 percent of them are unemployed or underemployed...(APPLAUSE)We have got to raise the minimum wage to $15 an hour. The United States has got to join the rest of the industrialized world in guaranteeing health care to all people as a right.(APPLAUSE)We need to rebuild our crumbling infrastructure. And when we do that, under my plan, we create 13 million decent-paying jobs.(APPLAUSE)(APPLAUSE)We have got to go beyond first grade to 12th grade when we talk about public education.(APPLAUSE)So I do believe we should make public colleges and universities tuition-free, and I don\u2019t believe we should punish millions of young and not-so-young people with outrageous levels of student debt.The point is we are going to get to Donald Trump by raising the taxes on the top 1 percent and our millionaires and billionaires. But all of our people, in my view, regardless of income, should have a right to get a higher education. I want children in the third grade to know that if they study hard, no matter what the income of their families, my family didn\u2019t have any income, my parents didn\u2019t go to college, they didn\u2019t have good income. I want every kid to know if you do your school work, study hard, yes, you will be able to get a college education. (APPLAUSE)(APPLAUSE)And you can refinance your house to get a lower interest rate. You can refinance your car. Corporations can refinance their debt. Under my plan, you will be able to also lower your debt, move into a program to pay it back as a percentage of your income and more than that, my plan for debt-free tuition at public colleges and universities will eventually eliminate any student debt.But for people who have it, I\u2019m going to put a date certain that after a certain number of years, you no longer have to pay anything. The government has to quit making money off of lending money to young people to get their education.(APPLAUSE)(APPLAUSE)You know how I\u2019m going to pay for it? I\u2019m going to pay for it by imposing a tax on Wall Street speculation.(APPLAUSE)So, the Treasury was out nothing. Now that will no longer happen because we have Dodd-Frank and we will break up banks that pose a systemic threat to our economy.(APPLAUSE)And a lot of the answers say that this is going to be much more expensive than anything Senator Sanders is admitting to. This is going to increase the federal government dramatically. And, you know, my dad used to say, if it sounds too good to be true, it probably is.(APPLAUSE)(APPLAUSE)You may not think the American people are prepared to stand up to the insurance companies or the drug companies. I think they are. And I think we can pass...(APPLAUSE)But I just respectfully disagree. Between the Republicans trying to repeal the first chance we\u2019ve ever had to get to universal health care, and Senator Sanders wanting to throw us into a contentious debate over single-payer, I think the smart approach is build on and protect the Affordable Care Act. Make it work. Reduce the cost.(APPLAUSE)Many of you may have insurance, but you have outrageously high deductibles and co-payments. One out of five Americans cannot afford the prescription drugs their doctors prescribe. Elderly people are cutting their pills in half.I do believe that we should do what every other major country on earth does, and I think when the American people stand up and fight back, yes, we can have it, a Medicare for all health care system.(APPLAUSE)(APPLAUSE)Senator Sanders, is it possible to move forward on this issue if you do not get a bipartisan consensus, and what would you do?(APPLAUSE)(APPLAUSE)(APPLAUSE)You can see already what\u2019s happening in Miami, particularly in Miami Beach with tides rising. So we do have to invest in resilience and mitigation while we are trying to cut emissions and make up for the fact that this is clearly man-made and man-aggravated. CLINTON: And there are certain things that the president has done through executive action that I will absolutely support. All the Republican say they will, if they\u2019re elected, heaven forbid, repeal all of those executive actions. I will maintain them and act on them.The clean power plan is something that Senator Sanders has said he would delay implementing, which makes absolutely no sense. We need to implement all of the president\u2019s executive actions and quickly move to make a bridge from coal to natural gas to clean energy.That is the way we will keep the lights on while we are transitioning to a clean energy future. And when I talk about resilience, I think that is an area we can get Republican support on.(CROSSTALK)(CROSSTALK)(APPLAUSE)(CROSSTALK)(APPLAUSE)Let\u2019s be clear. You\u2019re looking at the senator who introduced the most comprehensive climate change legislation in the history of the United States Senate.(APPLAUSE)Now, I hope that Secretary Clinton would join me if we are serious about climate change, about imposing a tax on carbon on the fossil fuel industry and making massive investments in energy efficiency and sustainable energy. And by the way, while we are on the subject of energy, I hope you\u2019ll join me in ending fracking in the United States of America.(APPLAUSE)(CROSSTALK)Three of the last four Treasury secretaries appointed by Democratic presidents had ties to Citigroup. Do you agree with Elizabeth Warren\u2019s criticism that both your husband\u2019s administration and President Obama\u2019s have relied too heavily on advisers who represent the world view of the big banks?But I think it\u2019s important also to look at what we want to accomplish. You know, in the debates we\u2019ve had \u2014 maybe this is the seventh or so \u2014 Senator Sanders is always criticizing the two recent Democratic presidents \u2014 President Clinton and President Obama. And that\u2019s fine, but I wish he would criticize and join me in criticizing George W. Bush, who I think wrecked the economy and created the conditions for the great recession. You know, at the end of the \u201990s, we had 23 million new jobs. Incomes went up for everybody. We were talking earlier about what needs to be done for Latinos and African Americans. Well, we were doing it by the end of the \u201990s. Median family income went up 17 percent. For minorities, it went up even more.Along came the Republicans, trickle-down economics \u2014 one of the worst ideas since snake oil \u2014 was put back into place. And we ended up with the great recession. President Obama had to rescue the economy. And I don\u2019t think he gets the credit he deserves for doing that.(APPLAUSE)(LAUGHTER)Or followed my work in the Congress as very few people stood up to George W. Bush whether it was the war in Iraq or any other of his policies.(LAUGHTER)Now, when we talk about the policies of the 1990s, I worked closely and supported President Clinton. And obviously, I have worked very closely in supporting President Obama, who has taken our economy a very long way from where Bush left us.SANDERS: But when you go back to the 1990s, let\u2019s remember, that\u2019s when Wall Street deregulation took place.(APPLAUSE)(COMMERCIAL BREAK)(UNKNOWN) (through translator): We continue with the Democratic debate.Secretary Clinton and Senator Sanders, it will be my welcome to Miami question. So it goes as follows. President Barack Obama is going to Cuba in two weeks. Forty percent of Cuban Americans supporting to uphold \u2014 oppose a new White House policy towards Cuba.If you were president, would you meet with the dissidents in Cuba? Would you meet with Fidel Castro? And would you consider Raul Castro a president or a dictator? Welcome to Miami.So the more that we can have that kind of movement back and forth, the more likely we are to be able to move Cuba toward greater freedom, greater respect for rights.You know, I\u2019m looking forward to following the president\u2019s trip. I do think meeting with dissidents, meeting with people who have been voices, tribunes of freedom and opportunity is important.The Cuban people deserve to have their human rights respected and upheld, they deserve to be able to move towards democracy where they pick their own leads. And I think both Castros have to be considered authoritarian and dictatorial because they are not freely chosen by the people that are in Cuba.(APPLAUSE)I hope someday there will be leaders who are chosen by the Cuban people, and I hope that democracy will be deeply rooted in Cuban soil and that the people of Cuba will have every opportunity to fulfill their own dreams in their own country. That is my hope.(APPLAUSE)I believe that we should move towards full and normalized political relations with Cuba. I think at the end of the day, it will be a good thing for the Cuban people. It will enable them, I think when they see people coming into their country from the United States, move in a more democratic direction, which is what I want to see. So right \u2014 I\u2019m sorry.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)(END VIDEOTAPE)Throughout the history of our relationship with Latin America we\u2019ve operated under the so-called Monroe Doctrine, and that said the United States had the right do anything that they wanted to do in Latin America. So I actually went to Nicaragua and I very shortly opposed the Reagan administration\u2019s efforts to overthrow that government. And I strongly opposed earlier Henry Kissinger and the \u2014 to overthrow the government of Salvador Aliende (ph) in Chile.I think the United States should be working with governments around the world, not get involved in regime change. And all of these actions, by the way, in Latin America, brought forth a lot of very strong anti-American sentiments. That\u2019s what that was about.(APPLAUSE)...on the other hands, it would be wrong not to state that in Cuba they have made some good advances in health care. They are sending doctors all over the world. They have made some progress in education. I think by restoring full diplomatic relations with Cuba, it will result in significant improvements to the lives of Cubans and it will help the United States and our business community invest.(APPLAUSE)And what we see in Puerto Rico now is a lot of suffering. We see schools being closed, we see health care being denied and we see a thousand Puerto Rican families a month moving to the United States, mostly to Florida.Puerto Ricans are citizen of America.(APPLAUSE)I just couldn\u2019t disagree more. You know, if the values are that you oppress people, you disappear people, you imprison people or even kill people for expressing their opinions, for expressing freedom of speech, that is not the kind of revolution of values that I ever want to see anywhere.(APPLAUSE)And many of the bonds that they are paying off were purchased by vulture capitalists for 30 cents on the dollar. And what I have said in talking to the leaders of Puerto Rico, we\u2019ve got to bring people together. And it\u2019s not the people of Puerto Rico, or the children or the schools.Secretary Clinton, there is a vacancy on the supreme court at a very crucial moment. Among other things, the court is considering the most significant abortion restrictions in a generation.So I would like to share with you a question that we got from Facebook from Joshua Dansby, a law student in Washington, D.C. who wants to know what specific forms of qualifications you would look for in a Supreme Court justice?(APPLAUSE)(APPLAUSE)(APPLAUSE)And understand the balance of power that their decisions can disrupt one way or the other. So clearly, I would look for people who believe that Roe v. Wade is settled law and that Citizens United needs to be overturned as quickly as possible. (APPLAUSE)(CROSSTALK)SALINAS (through translator): We go to a commercial. And when we come back, conclusions (inaudible).RAMOS (through translator): (inaudible) which has heads of space and it\u2019s the candidates to the presidents (inaudible) that are the (inaudible).(COMMERCIAL BREAK)SALINAS (through translator): We come back with the Democratic debate, sponsored by Univision, Washington Post and Facebook. We are reaching the end, asking the candidates to give their last words.Secretary Clinton, you\u2019re first.So I am going to take on those economic barriers. I have a plan to create jobs and raise incomes. I\u2019m going to take on the education barriers that often leave too many children behind even after they have completed schooling. I\u2019m going to take on the healthcare barriers.I\u2019m going to do everything I can to make sure that we unite our country. I will find common ground, just as I have as first lady, as senator and secretary of state. I will also stand my ground wherever matters of principles are at stake.CLINTON: I would be honored to have your support in the upcoming primary on Tuesday, and hope to have the great honor of serving you as your president.(APPLAUSE)Is it acceptable that Wall Street and billionaires are spending hundreds of millions of dollars trying to buy elections? Is that democracy or this that oligarchy? Which is why I believe we\u2019ve got to overturn Citizens United and move to public funding of elections.Is it right that in the greatest, wealthiest country in the history of the world, so many of our young people can\u2019t even afford to go to college or leave school deeply in debt, in the wealthiest country in the history of the world? If we stand up, fight back, we can do a lot better. That\u2019s why I\u2019m running for president.(APPLAUSE)(APPLAUSE)RAMOS (through translator): We want to use these last moments, it\u2019s very important to go out and vote, remember next Tuesday, March 15th is elections in Florida, Illinois, Missouri, North Carolina, Ohio, all these states \u2014 in all these states the Hispanic vote is crucial (INAUDIBLE). Talk about the importance of Hispanic votes, how in very close races it is the Hispanic vote that can choose the next president of the United States. This is Hispanic power, but the only way that this can happen is if we all go out and vote.So you know it perfectly, who does not vote doesn\u2019t count.SALINAS (through translator): And as you know, nobody can reach the White House without the Hispanic vote. Remember, don\u2019t let others decide for you. The power is in your hands, you have to participate, you have to vote. Thank you for being with us this evening and thank you for trusting in Univision. Good evening.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Breathing Life Into Spaces Well Beyond 6 Feet Under Beijing\u2019s Streets", "Date": "2016-03-21", "News": "Supported byBeijing JournalBEIJING \u2014 The Digua Shequ community center in Beijing is painted in cheery pastel tones and festooned with colorful paper dragons hung from the ceiling. Inside are a hair salon, a cafe and a gym \u2014 normal shops for a typical neighborhood \u2014 except that they are underground.All of the storefronts are two floors below the street, built inside a former bomb shelter designed to withstand a nuclear war.Digua Shequ, a start-up that turns unused basements into community centers and whose name is Chinese for Sweet Potato Community, has been renovating the shelter in northeast Beijing for the past year. It wants to reimagine the future of the city\u2019s underground spaces, once largely ignored but now contested by an unlikely combination of government, commercial and artistic interests.The center\u2019s founder, Zhou Zishu, a former designer at the National Museum of China, said he was inspired by the debate over what to do with Beijing\u2019s bomb shelters, which currently house well over 100,000 people.\u201cOur work is not just about renovating basement spaces and making them look better,\u201d Mr. Zhou said. \u201cIt\u2019s actually about improving the lives of residents and creating a new sense of community. We want to take these private spaces and make them public again.\u201dBut not everyone agrees with Digua Shequ\u2019s vision. The uncertain fate of the shelters, as well as the rules for their use, has drawn attention from several competing stakeholders.Beijing\u2019s more than 10,000 concrete bunkers, built over 40 years ago, were a crucial part of Mao\u2019s Cold War defense strategy. Some of the bunkers, which were handed over to neighborhood authorities in the 1980s, when the country\u2019s economy was liberalized, were turned into shops or offices. Most were converted into living spaces and rented out to migrant workers or residents trying to duck Beijing\u2019s soaring real estate prices.One pressing question facing the city is what to do with the people who still live in the bunkers. Estimates of their numbers range from 150,000 to a million. Nearly every apartment building in the Digua Shequ center\u2019s neighborhood has a former shelter or a basement. Most of the residential units in them are rented out for 500 to 900 renminbi a month, or roughly $77 to $138 \u2014 about one-third of what it would cost to live aboveground.\u201cWorkers\u2019 wages aren\u2019t rising as fast as the cost of living,\u201d said Xu Tong, who both rents out and lives in an underground space in eastern Beijing. \u201cIf you get rid of these basement units, where will the migrants live?\u201dGovernment data shows that migrant workers\u2019 wages increased about 14 percent in 2014 from a year earlier, compared with a nearly 22 percent increase in their cost of living. Mr. Xu\u2019s lease illustrates the uncertainty about how serious the government\u2019s ban on underground dwellings is: Although the new rule takes effect in 2017, his contract does not expire until 2019.Migrant workers\u2019 use of the former bomb shelters remains a delicate topic. After The New York Times submitted an interview request to the neighborhood committee, Mr. Zhou said, an official there who supports the project called him and recommended that he not mention the \u201cfloating population\u201d or \u201cnorthern drifters\u201d \u2014 two euphemisms for migrant workers.So far, Digua Shequ\u2019s work remains an exceptional case for having legally repurposed the spaces under the new rules. Currently, the Civil Air Defense Department of Beijing grants one-year leases on former bomb shelters to individuals and companies.The order to end residential use means that some stand to lose a source of revenue, as few local officials and landlords are willing to spend to transform the units into commercial spaces. As a result, many shelters and basements occupied before the ban was announced are still being quietly rented out as housing.\u201cIt\u2019s like a wave,\u201d said Wang Jinhui, who runs a hotel in a former bomb shelter near the Digua Shequ center. \u201cYou just put your head down and wait for it to pass.\u201dHe has rented out the space since 1998 and is optimistic that the political will to enforce the new regulations will dissipate.\u201cThey\u2019ve said they\u2019d clean out these underground spaces for years and not succeeded,\u201d Mr. Wang said. \u201cIt just might be that places like mine will survive.\u201dSubletting underground spaces can be lucrative. A lease for an entire basement or shelter typically costs about 150,000 renminbi a year, but subdividing the space can generate far more income. The shelter that Digua Shequ took over once housed more than 100 residents who together paid nearly 600,000 renminbi a year, Mr. Zhou said.\u201cA lot of landlords have spent money renovating the spaces they lease, so they don\u2019t want to stop renting out basements,\u201d said Guo Chengbao, a security guard who was once a basement landlord. He lives in an underground unit above the Digua Shequ center.Private investors have also been eyeing underground spaces. Renovating the basement that now houses the Digua Shequ center cost nearly 3 million renminbi, most of which was covered by Feng Lun, the founder of Vantone Holdings and its real estate subsidiary, Vantone Real Estate.\u201cWe\u2019ve constructed a lot of buildings,\u201d he said, \u201cbut there\u2019s no one today who is operating underground spaces like this. If other real estate developers came and saw your space, they might invite you to develop their underground spaces during construction.\u201dMr. Feng did not respond to a request for an interview.Mr. Zhou\u2019s project was noticed by a sympathetic official and partly financed by the local and municipal governments as a promising model for Beijing\u2019s other bomb shelters and basements. With the support of the neighborhood committee, Digua Shequ got a lease and is negotiating to turn another shelter in the Haidian district into a second community center.\u201cNo one had a very nuanced understanding of these places,\u201d Mr. Zhou said. \u201cEveryone thought only poor people lived in them and that they were dark and dirty.\u201dMr. Zhou tried several different models before arriving at his plan for the community center. At first, he ran a training program for young workers, but attendance was too inconsistent. He considered turning basements into libraries but then observed that residents used similar areas as restrooms rather than as places for borrowing books. After studying theories about the sharing economy, Mr. Zhou hit on the idea of transforming basements into community centers.The entrance to the Digua Shequ center is like that of any other bomb shelter: rusting metal gates at street level that open onto a ramp down into the chilly, subterranean darkness. The ramp ends at a bright orange steel door set into mottled concrete, behind which lies the center\u2019s warmly lit interior.Renovations began on the shelter in 2015, after three years of surveying residents about what they wanted in a community center. When the new space opens on Friday, it will feature a 3-D printing station, co-working spaces and a movie theater.Mr. Zhou said that underground dwellings might never be eliminated entirely because of the different interests at play, but that he hoped the Digua Shequ model would be replicated in other neighborhoods. He said he saw it as a chance to transcend differences in social class and origin.Mr. Guo, the security guard, likes what it has done so far. After work, he sometimes eats dinner in the community space.\u201cI\u2019ve lived in Beijing for 14 years. Before, I didn\u2019t know any of the people who lived upstairs,\u201d he said, laughing. \u201cNow, we\u2019re all familiar with each other.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "VW Scandal Clouds Prospects for Other Diesel Makers at Geneva Motor Show", "Date": "2016-03-03", "News": "Supported byWheelsGENEVA \u2014 Thanks a lot, Volkswagen.Although diesel generates more harmful nitrogen oxide pollution than does gasoline, diesel engines produce less carbon dioxide, a cause of global warming. Carmakers saw diesel \u2014 which accounts for more than half of the vehicles sold in Europe \u2014 as essential to meeting the Continent\u2019s tougher carbon dioxide quotas.But automakers\u2019 plans have been upended by Volkswagen\u2019s admission in September that it programmed 11 million vehicles to cheat in order to pass tailpipe emissions exams. The scandal called attention to lax European Union testing procedures, and sped plans to scrutinize tailpipe emissions under more rigorous road conditions. At present, cars in the European Union are tested in labs.The scandal, which prompted the company to put on a more demure exhibition here than usual, has also unsettled regulatory officials and made it more difficult to get approval for new vehicles, Dieter Zetsche, the chief executive of Daimler, said in Geneva. \u201cWe see situations where you get more questions and things are somewhat slowed down,\u201d he said during a meeting with reporters. Mr. Zetsche declined to say what countries he was referring to.Carmakers say they have the technology to allow their vehicles to pass emissions tests under a broader range of driving conditions. But cars with diesel engines will become more costly as manufacturers add extra hardware to neutralize nitrogen oxides, which are linked to serious lung ailments. European limits on nitrogen oxides, which were not only less strict but also less strictly enforced than in the United States, were set to become more stringent even before the Volkswagen cheating became known.The problem for many carmakers is that better emissions equipment is not a selling point for most customers. Buyers may just see the extra cost, and perhaps decide to buy a gasoline car instead.\u201cDiesel will have to be equipped with even more technology,\u201d said Peter Schwarzenbauer, a member of the BMW management board responsible for sales. \u201cThat is all technologically conceivable, but someone has to pay for it.\u201dVolkswagen admitted that 11 million of its vehicles were equipped with software that was used to cheat on emissions tests. This is how the technology works and what it now means for vehicle owners.Plug-in hybrids and all-electric vehicles will help, but so far consumer demand is slack.\u201cWe have electric vehicles today,\u201d Barb J. Samardzich, chief operating officer for Ford of Europe, said during a meeting with journalists. \u201cWhat we don\u2019t have is consumer pull.\u201d She and other auto executives said that governments should provide incentives to get customers to buy battery-powered cars.European policy has long favored diesel because of its superior fuel economy. Diesel engines extract more energy from a liter of fuel than a gasoline engine extracts from the same quantity. A car that uses fuel more efficiently also produces less carbon dioxide.In Germany, diesel fuel costs about 20 euro cents less per liter than gasoline because of lower taxes. As a result, diesel has been particularly attractive for buyers of larger luxury cars that consume more fuel. About three-quarters of the cars sold in Europe by BMW and Audi, a Volkswagen brand, are diesels.\u201cThe European industry is dangerously dependent on diesel,\u201d Ferdinand Dudenh\u00f6ffer, a professor at the University of Duisburg-Essen in Germany, wrote in a study published last week.By contrast, in the United States, federal taxes on diesel are higher than for gasoline. The higher tax has been seen as a way of charging the trucking industry, heavy users of diesel, for the extra burden they put on highways. The price of diesel helps explain why diesel vehicles that run on it account for a tiny percentage of the cars that BMW and Mercedes-Benz sell in America; the scandal is unlikely to affect their sales very much in the United States.The same cannot be said of Volkswagen. The company aggressively marketed diesel in the United States and other countries, targeting the same environmentally conscious buyers who might otherwise have bought a hybrid like a Toyota Prius.The company is now struggling to reach agreement with United States and California officials on how to fix about 600,000 vehicles under its Volkswagen, Audi and Porsche brands that are on the road and still emitting illegal levels of nitrogen oxides.A United States District Court judge in San Francisco, who is overseeing class-action suits against Volkswagen, has given the company until March 24 to provide a definite answer on how it would bring the cars into compliance.In a reflection of its battered public image, Volkswagen made a show of humility in Geneva this year. It did not stage one of the elaborate presentations that typically precede the opening of a major car show, and for which Volkswagen had been known. In past years, the Volkswagen extravaganzas have featured laser light shows, a parade of new car models, and surprise appearances by pop stars like Pink or the Pet Shop Boys.This year, Volkswagen had a more modest reception in a dining space adjacent to the exhibition hall. The only people on stage were Matthias M\u00fcller, the chief executive, and Johann Jungwirth, a former Apple executive whom Volkswagen hired in November to oversee its digital strategy.Mr. Jungwirth described a rosy future of self-driving, emissions-free electric cars, but whether that future will arrive soon enough to fill the gap left by diesel is questionable.Although the cost of batteries is falling, electric vehicles will still be substantially more expensive than comparable diesel cars for some time to come, and carmakers say they cannot sell large numbers of them without government help.\u201cWe know that the cost of batteries will go down in the future,\u201d Thierry Koskas, executive vice president for sales at the French carmaker Renault, said in an interview. \u201cBut we are not today in a situation where you can match the total cost of ownership of diesel without incentives. We need incentives.\u201dElectric vehicles, which account for a sliver of the market so far, could attract more buyers as people factor in other advantages.

{"Headline": "China Air Quality Study Has Good News and Bad News", "Date": "2016-03-30", "News": "Supported bySinosphereHere\u2019s how you can feel the fear and move to China anyway, while minimizing your health risks:Relocate to Guangzhou, the capital of the southern province of Guangdong, near Hong Kong. Second best: move to Shanghai.Don\u2019t move to Beijing, Chengdu or Shenyang, if you can help it.In an interview, Mr. Chen said the study was prompted by a sense of \u201cdisgust\u201d at air pollution. \u201cI felt that as scientists we should do something about the situation facing a billion Chinese people,\u201d he said.The team scrutinized three years of air quality data for the measure known as PM 2.5, the fine particulate matter that is especially hazardous to health. One source of the data was the Chinese Ministry of Environmental Protection. The other was the United States Embassy in Beijing and consulates in Guangzhou, Shanghai, Chengdu and Shenyang.By using two independent data sets, the researchers answered a second question: Is the Chinese government\u2019s air quality data trustworthy? The answer: Yes, at least in these five cities. That was one piece of good news.China began releasing PM 2.5 figures for hundreds of locations in 2013, five years after the United States Embassy began publishing readings from monitors on its grounds that drew wide attention among Chinese. Suspicions linger to this day about the reliability of the Chinese government data.Another piece of good news: PM 2.5 levels declined over the last three years in all five cities. In Beijing, they fell from 99 micrograms per cubic meter to 81, and in Shanghai from 61 to 50. In Guangzhou, they fell from 54 to 39.That was because of two factors: stricter emissions regulations that took effect on Jan. 1, 2015, and a slowing economy.\u201cThe economic downturn helped,\u201d Mr. Chen said.But there was bad news, too. In all five cities, the air pollution readings remained higher than the World Health Organization\u2019s upper safety limit of 35 micrograms of PM 2.5 per cubic meter.The researchers defined a level of under 35 as \u201cgood,\u201d and under 75 as \u201clight\u201d pollution, and found that Guangzhou and Shanghai had the most \u201cgood\u201d or \u201clight\u201d days. About 80 percent of days each year fell into those categories. Chengdu and Shenyang had about 60 percent. Beijing came last with 50 percent.\u201cThis shows the grave challenge facing China in its air pollution prevention efforts,\u201d the report says.\u201cThe more I looked at it, the more disgusted I felt,\u201d Mr. Chen said. \u201cThen, on a very polluted day in early March\u201d of 2014, \u201cI said, \u2018I have to do something.\u2019 I called together a team.\u201dTo test the accuracy of the Chinese government data, the researchers used readings from two or three ministry monitors in each city as close as possible to the American sites. They found a \u201chigh\u201d similarity, the report says.\u201cThey show a lot of consistency,\u201d Mr. Chen said. \u201cThey won\u2019t be exactly the same, because of data randomness and because they\u2019re not at exactly the same locations.\u201d\u201cIf they were still manipulating the data, that would be really hopeless and I\u2019d leave China,\u2019\u2019 he said. \u201cBut it does show that the government and the Ministry of Environmental Protection are serious.\u201dStill, there were significant data problems on the Chinese side, he said.The report recommends improving data collection and publication.The team also factored in meteorological factors and consumption of coal, petroleum and diesel to get a better picture of the relations among emissions, weather and pollution. But here too they encountered a lack of information.\u201cThe economic and energy data are very sparse,\u2019\u2019 Mr. Chen said. \u201cWe couldn\u2019t find data on consumption, especially of petroleum products. We don\u2019t know how much gasoline was sold in 2013, and we think petroleum products may be a bigger problem than coal in Beijing.\u201dAsked where a family moving to China should settle to minimize exposure to polluted air, Mr. Chen said, \u201cI grew up in Beijing and I love Beijing, so you put me in a very hard position.\u201dThe North China Plain, where Beijing is, and the Sichuan Basin, where Chengdu is, \u201care not good places to be. They\u2019re not suitable for heavy industry,\u2019\u2019 Mr. Chen said. Their physical settings trap pollutants. \u201cIf you have heavy industry there, this is what you\u2019ll get.\u201d\u201cShanghai and Guangzhou are more fortunate,\u2019\u2019 he said, \u201cbecause they\u2019re close to the sea and have more rainfall.\u201dBeijing\u2019s saving grace: a strong northwesterly wind in winter that helps clear the air. But that doesn\u2019t address the source of the problem. Another recommendation: reduce emissions.\u201cThe core of the problem is you have to cut down emissions,\u2019\u2019 Mr. Chen said. \u201cPeople blame the weather, but actually they should blame emissions.\u201dVanessa Piao contributed research.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Does a Carbon Tax Work? Ask British Columbia", "Date": "2016-03-01", "News": "Supported byEconomic SceneBut those views are not widely shared by conservatives elsewhere around the world. Indeed, not that long ago in a not too distant country, a right-leaning party that shares many of the antitax, pro-business beliefs of Republicans in the United States did exactly what its unbelieving candidates so fear.In 2008, the British Columbia Liberal Party, which confoundingly leans right, introduced a tax on the carbon emissions of businesses and families, cars and trucks, factories and homes across the province. The party stuck to the tax even as the left-leaning New Democratic Party challenged it in provincial elections the next year under the slogan Axe the Tax. The conservatives won soundly at the polls.Their experience shows that cutting carbon emissions enough to make a difference in preventing global warming remains a difficult challenge. But the most important takeaway for American skeptics is that the policy basically worked as advertised.British Columbia\u2019s economy did not collapse. In fact, the provincial economy grew faster than its neighbors\u2019 even as its greenhouse gas emissions declined.\u201cIt performed better on all fronts than I think any of us expected,\u201d said Mary Polak, the province\u2019s environment minister. \u201cTo the extent that the people who modeled it predicted this, I\u2019m not sure that those of us on the policy end of it really believed it.\u201dThe tax made fuel more expensive: A gallon of gas, for example, costs 19 United States cents more. It encouraged people to drive somewhat less and be more careful about heating and cooling their homes. Businesses invested in energy efficiency measures and switched to less polluting fuels.\u201cWe were not very happy when it was first announced,\u201d said Jock A. Finlayson, head of policy at the Business Council of British Columbia. Now, \u201cwithin the business community there is a sizable constituency saying this is O.K.\u201dChristopher Knittel, an expert on energy economics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, said a properly calibrated carbon price in the United States could effectively replace all the climate-related regulations businesses hate so much, including renewable fuel mandates and President Obama\u2019s Clean Power Plan.That would create a clear incentive for businesses and consumers to use less fuel, invest in efficiency and switch to cleaner energy. The only other necessary action, in Professor Knittel\u2019s view, would be more government support for research and development to accelerate the quest for new energy technologies.Here in British Columbia, however, it wasn\u2019t the efficiency argument alone that won people over. The pioneering legislation provided critical political cover by ensuring every single carbon tax dollar would be returned to families and businesses through a variety of breaks.That \u201cis the thing that saved us,\u201d said Carole Taylor, the provincial minister of finance at the time the tax was introduced. \u201cIf I had said, \u2018Give us the carbon tax and trust us,\u2019 I knew it would have been a failure.\u201dThe corporate income tax was cut to 10 percent from 12 percent, to stimulate a flagging economy in 2010. Though it is back to 11 percent, it is still the lowest among Canada\u2019s provinces. The bottom two personal income tax rates were also cut. Low-income families got a tax credit.All in all, the government will return about 1.7 billion Canadian dollars to businesses and families this year, more than the 1.2 billion dollars it expects to collect though the carbon tax, which amounts to roughly 5 percent of the province\u2019s total tax revenue.With few exceptions, British Columbia\u2019s tax is the steepest and broadest in existence. While that sets British Columbia apart as a leader on the cutting edge, it is also part of its problem. For the policy to work best, it needs the rest of the world to catch up.Nobody in British Columbia is talking about going that far. But to hit its long-term target, the advisory panel concluded that the tax must start increasing again in 2018, at a rate of 10 Canadian dollars a ton a year, perhaps all the way to midcentury.And that\u2019s where the support from business starts to break down. If British Columbia were to proceed on its own without providing some form of protection to its energy intensive industries, Mr. Finlayson argued, they would simply lose markets to producers outside its borders that pay no carbon tax.The advisory panel recommends unspecified adjustments to protect such trade-exposed industries. Still, the Business Council of British Columbia opposed an increase.British Columbia could do with some help from its neighbors. Four other provinces have carbon prices either pending or in place, though they are generally much lower. If more embraced a carbon tax, they would mitigate many of the concerns over competitiveness.The new Canadian government, headed by Justin Trudeau, seems ready to come on board, imposing some pan-Canadian minimum price. If the United States embraced a carbon tax as part of a comprehensive overhaul of its tax system, the path would be much easier.That, however, would require Republicans in Washington to recognize that the threat of climate change is not simply a left-wing fantasy. If they do, British Columbia underscores there is a market friendly way to do something about it.An earlier version of this article gave an incorrect attribution for a study of Canada\u2019s carbon tax. It was by economists at Duke University and the University of Ottawa, not the University of Ontario.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "With \u2018Gigs\u2019 Instead of Jobs, Workers Bear New Burdens", "Date": "2016-03-31", "News": "Supported byEconomic TrendsMost remarkably, the number of Americans using these alternate work arrangements rose 9.4 million from 2005 to 2015. That was greater than the rise in overall employment, meaning there was a small net decline in the number of workers with conventional jobs.That, in turn, raises still bigger questions about how employers have succeeded at shifting much the burden of providing social insurance onto workers, and what technological and economic forces are driving the shift.And the shift away from conventional jobs and into these more distant employer-employee relationships accelerated in the last decade. By contrast, from 1995 to 2005, the proportion had edged up only slightly, to 10.1 percent from 9.3 percent. (The data are based on a person\u2019s main job, so someone with a full-time position who does freelance work on the side would count as a conventional employee.)This change in behavior has profound implications on social insurance. More so than in many advanced countries, employers in the United States carry a lot of the burden of protecting their workers from the things that can go wrong in life. They frequently provide health insurance, and paid medical leave for employees who become ill.They pay for workers\u2019 compensation insurance for people who are injured on the job, and unemployment insurance benefits for those who are laid off. They help fund their workers\u2019 existence after retirement, at one time through pensions, now more commonly through 401(k) plans.Perhaps most significant of all, the implicit contract between an employer and an employee is that there is a relatively high bar for firing the employee if business slumps. If the economy turns down or business slows, a contract worker is, as a rule, far more likely to be out of a job than a conventional employee.It\u2019s true that the Affordable Care Act has made health insurance more easily within reach for independent contractors, for example, and temporary services firms can offer retirement benefits and workers\u2019 comp. But over all, there\u2019s little doubt that workers in these nonconventional work arrangements carry some of the burden of protecting themselves from misfortune that employers traditionally have carried.That makes the question of why the shift has happened particularly important.You could imagine a world in which more workers become independent contractors voluntarily, trading the social insurance functions of traditional employers for higher pay and greater flexibility. If the period from 2005 to 2015 had been one when workers had a lot of power in the job market, that might even be plausible.It wasn\u2019t. The unemployment rate was above 7 percent for nearly half of the period, from the end of 2008 to late 2013. Employers had the upper hand. That suggests it\u2019s more likely that employers were driving the shift to these alternate arrangements.But Mr. Katz and Mr. Krueger raise the possibility that something has changed beyond the weak job market of the last several years. And that\u2019s technology.When people working as a team need extensive experience working together, it can be tricky to contract out the work. But when there are clear, simple measurements of how successful each person is, and a company can monitor it, the employer now has flexibility.\u201cNew technologies may allow some things to be shipped out and standardized and easily monitored,\u201d Mr. Katz said. \u201cCall center workers can be at home. Independent truck drivers can be monitored for the efficiency of their routes. Monitoring makes contracting more feasible.\u201dSo Uber alone may not be a major force reshaping the nature of work. But the same technologies that made it possible could be making employers more interested in building a work force of nonemployees. A weak job market has probably given them more ability to make it a reality.A big question for the next decade is whether this was a one-time shift or whether it will continue in the years ahead, even with a tighter labor market. The answer may determine if the employer-provided social insurance that was a staple of the 20th-century American economy will remain there in the 21st.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Silicon Valley Has Not Saved Us From a Productivity Slowdown", "Date": "2016-03-04", "News": "Supported byEconomic ViewAmerican middle class wages haven\u2019t been rising as rapidly as they once were, and a slowdown in productivity growth is probably an important cause.In mature economies, higher productivity typically is required for sustained increases in living standards, but the productivity numbers in the United States have been mediocre. Labor productivity has been growing at an average of only 1.3 percent annually since the start of 2005, compared with 2.8 percent annually in the preceding 10 years. Without somehow improving productivity growth, living standards will continue to lag, this widely held narrative concludes.Still, not everyone views the situation this way. For instance, Marc Andreessen, the Silicon Valley entrepreneur and venture capitalist, says information technology is providing significant benefits that just don\u2019t show up in the standard measurements of wages and productivity. Consider that consumers have access to services like Facebook, Google and Wikipedia free of charge, and those benefits aren\u2019t fully accounted for in the official numbers. This notion \u2014 that life is getting better, often in ways we are barely measuring \u2014 is fairly common in tech circles.Professor Syverson notes that a slowdown has come to dozens of advanced economies, more or less at the same time, which indicates it is a general phenomenon. Furthermore, the countries with smaller tech sectors still have comparably sized productivity slowdowns, and that is not what we would expect if a lot of unmeasured productivity were hiding in the tech industry.An additional problem for the optimistic interpretation is this: The productivity slowdown is too big in scale, relative to the size of the tech sector, to be plausibly compensated for by tech progress. Basically, under a conservative estimate, as outlined by Professor Syverson, the productivity slowdown has led to a cumulative loss of $2.7 trillion in gross domestic product since the end of 2004; that is how much more output would have been produced had the earlier rate of productivity growth been maintained. To make up for this difference, Professor Syverson estimates, consumer surplus (consumer benefits in excess of market price) would have to be five times as high as measured in the industries that produce and service information and communications technology. That seems implausibly large as a measurement gap.Keep in mind that while Facebook is free to its users, much of the tech industry consists of services that are measured and at least partly incorporated into G.D.P. For instance, the free Uber app arranges paid transportation. Even Facebook, Google and Wikipedia have a lot of their value expressed in G.D.P. figures, albeit indirectly. Those services make people eager to pay for smartphones, broadband connections and iPads, and those purchases are recorded as part of G.D.P.From this standpoint, the measurement problem isn\u2019t all that serious. It\u2019s like going to an all-you-can-eat restaurant buffet. The chicken may be free, but the presence of so many quality items induces customers to pay more for the overall bundle, and that registers as a sale, regardless of the price of the individual items you put on your plate. Also, some of the value of Google and Facebook comes from the advertisements, which induce many purchases, which again are recorded in the national statistics. Consumers pay for many apps as well.Or look at it this way: The tech economy just isn\u2019t big enough to account for the productivity gap. That gap has caused measured G.D.P. to be about 15 percent lower than it would have been otherwise, yet digital technology industries were only about 7.7 percent of G.D.P. in 2004. Even if the free component of the Internet has become more important since 2004, it\u2019s hard to imagine that it is so much better now that it accounts for such a big proportion of G.D.P.None of these remarks should be taken as a lack of appreciation for information technology. Arguably the Internet brought its biggest gains in the mid- to late 1990s, and in those years measured economic productivity was in fact very high. Information technology is still one of the most dynamic sectors of the American economy, and it probably will remain so, and grow yet more influential, even if its absolute impact is not as large as the optimistic revisionists suggest.That still leaves us with a big productivity problem. We need to acknowledge that while many Internet entrepreneurs are economic heroes, statisticians are also pretty good at what they do, and we may simply need to accept some of the lessons embedded in their numbers. America\u2019s productivity crisis is real and it is continuing. While information technology remains the most likely source of future breakthroughs, Silicon Valley has not saved us just yet.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "With Bet on Japan, Sharp Stumbles", "Date": "2016-03-02", "News": "Supported by\u201cWe were winners then,\u201d said Yukihiko Nakata, an engineer who worked for 33 years at Sharp.Those days are over. Sharp is now mired in losses and its future is in doubt.Sharp\u2019s plight is a story of missteps by executives who failed to anticipate major shifts in the global electronics industry. China, long the home of cheap manufacturing, has become increasingly sophisticated, making gadgets that can rival Japan\u2019s in quality. Rivals elsewhere are challenging Japanese companies on innovation. The industry\u2019s center of power has moved away from Japan to places like China, South Korea and Silicon Valley in the United States.Sharp\u2019s leaders were slow to adapt, employees and industry experts say. Unwilling to change strategy when business conditions turned against them, they doubled down on investments in increasingly unprofitable businesses, deepening the company\u2019s financial distress.As prices of liquid-crystal displays, or LCDs, began falling quickly in the mid-2000s, because of advances in manufacturing and a supply glut in China, Sharp scrambled to keep ahead of cheaper competitors. It developed ever-bigger TV displays and expanded into touch screens for smartphones and tablet computers. But rivals matched it more quickly than executives had anticipated, said Mr. Nakata, who left Sharp a decade ago and is now a professor at Ritsumeikan Asia Pacific University in Japan.\u201cFirst computer monitors became commoditized. Then it was TVs, and finally smartphone screens,\u201d he said.Sharp may be in bigger trouble that it initially acknowledged. Last Thursday, the same day Sharp\u2019s board voted in favor of selling the company, its suitor, Foxconn, abruptly suspended its offer. Foxconn cited the \u201cnew material information\u201d revealed at the 11th hour by Sharp. According to the person with knowledge of the situation, the information was a list of about 100 contingent liabilities \u2014 potential costs that could emerge depending on business conditions or other matters \u2014 totaling close to 350 billion yen, or $3.1 billion. Sharp declined to comment on the negotiations.Sharp chose Foxconn over an investment fund backed by the Japanese government. The fund, Innovation Network Corporation of Japan, already owns troubled LCD assets once run by Toshiba and others, and government officials see it as a potential savior for Japan\u2019s flat-screen industry. Still, the fund may need to take a second look at Sharp\u2019s books to see what might be lurking inside.Sharp was blinded by its early success in flat-screen TVs, employees and experts say.Soon after the Kameyama factory started churning out TVs, Sharp started work on an even bigger Japanese plant, near its Osaka headquarters in the industrial suburb of Sakai. Four times as large as Kameyama, it cost more than $4 billion to build.\u201cThey had enough production capacity with Kameyama, but they went ahead and built Sakai,\u201d said Mr. Nakata, the former Sharp engineer. \u201cThat was a fundamental mistake.\u201dSharp\u2019s executives didn\u2019t see it that way. They sought to exploit economies of scale while preserving what they saw as the company\u2019s lead in quality and technology. \u201cOur rivals might pursue this kind of scale, but we\u2019ll have a cost advantage for some time,\u201d Mikio Katayama, then Sharp\u2019s president, said when the Sakai plant opened.Sharp has since been through two restructurings and bailouts by its banks. About 6,000 full-time jobs have been cut through voluntary buyouts, equivalent to nearly one-quarter of its work force in Japan.Monaliza Lastimoza came to Japan from the Philippines eight years ago to take a job at a Sharp factory in Taki, near Kameyama in central Japan. There she cut sheets of glass into palm-size rectangles for smartphone displays.Last year, she said, she and her husband, also from the Philippines, were fired along with dozens of other foreign workers at the plant. Ms. Lastimoza was pregnant at the time and was about to go on maternity leave, she said.\u201cThe factory seemed busy, but then suddenly they gave us a termination notice,\u201d she said.Sharp said the agency that provided the foreign workers in Taki should ensure that labor standards were followed in hiring or dismissing them. Sharp also declined to provide figures for the number of contractors and other irregular workers whose jobs have been eliminated.Mr. Gou, of Foxconn, has made vague promises to protect jobs at Sharp, which employs about 20,000 people in Japan and thousands more worldwide. Foxconn also says it does not plan to break up Sharp.The Innovation Network Corporation had different plans. In 2012, it combined LCD businesses it purchased from Toshiba, Hitachi and Sony into a new company, Japan Display. The company has struggled, and its backers hoped that adding Sharp\u2019s production volume would make it more competitive. The network corporation was also negotiating with Toshiba to have Sharp sell Toshiba its home appliances division.The fund offered to invest about $2.7 billion but said the real value was larger because it could use its influence with Japanese banks to secure additional financial support.Yet the banks appear to favor Foxconn. Two members of Sharp\u2019s board installed by the electronics company\u2019s biggest lenders, Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ and Mizuho Corporate Bank, supported Foxconn\u2019s offer.\u201cThe banks lent too much money, and this saves them the embarrassment of writing it off,\u201d said Atul Goyal, an analyst at Jefferies, a brokerage firm.Should Sharp strike a new deal with the Innovative Network Corporation, that would suit the agenda of officials in Japan\u2019s powerful ministry of industries who think its operations could be saved. But Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has been preaching the virtues of foreign investment, and using taxpayer money to bail out Sharp could be awkward.\u201cSharp\u2019s technology is not essential to Japan\u2019s industrial structure today,\u201d said a senior Abe administration official, who asked not to be named to discuss a private business matter. \u201cIf it was, Japanese companies would have put up money to buy it.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "China\u2019s National People\u2019s Congress: Key Points", "Date": "2016-03-04", "News": "Supported byMr. Li said China\u2019s economy would grow by 6.5 percent to 7 percent this year. He gave a picture of a government facing some trying times, including \u2014 implicitly \u2014 problems left by his predecessors.\u201cDomestically, problems and risks that have been building up over the years are becoming more evident,\u201d he said in his report. \u201cDownward pressure on the economy is increasing.\u201dStill, with the right changes, Mr. Li said, it would be possible for China to achieve an average annual growth rate of 6.5 percent from 2016 to 2020.China\u2019s economy is faltering, prompting concerns that are now shaking global stock markets.Mr. Li devoted a big part of his report to the potentially painful adjustments to industries that will be needed to shore up growth.Gluts of coal, steel, cement and other industrial commodities have been generating heavy pollution but dwindling profits. Mr. Li indicated that China would need to lay off millions of workers in failing factories and mines. But the government will set aside about $15.3 billion to support laid-off workers, he said.\u201cWe will focus on addressing the overcapacity in the steel, coal and other industries facing difficulties,\u201d he said. \u201cWe will address the issue of \u2018zombie enterprises\u2019 proactively yet prudently by using measures such as mergers, reorganizations, debt restructurings and bankruptcy liquidations.\u201dA big reason the government needs to reduce excess production was laid out by the Ministry of Finance in a report issued Saturday: the income of many state-owned corporations is plunging. The ministry forecast that in 2016 the operating income of China\u2019s biggest, centrally managed state conglomerations \u2014 built to be pillars of the socialist economy \u2014 would fall by more than 13 percent. The main reason, it said, was \u201cthe falling profits in the oil and petrochemical, steel, coal and other sectors.\u201dEven as the Chinese government is trying to shore up economic growth, it is attempting to reduce smog, polluted water and contaminated soil, topics that have stirred popular anger.But reducing the pollution blighting many parts of China depends on cutting back on the heavy industry, mining and coal use that underwrite much of the economy.The government\u2019s next five-year plan, which was issued along with Mr. Li\u2019s report, laid out goals to cut pollution from this year to the end of 2020. The carbon intensity of the economy \u2014 the amount of carbon dioxide pollution released to create each unit of growth \u2014 would fall 18 percent over those years, according to the plan.For many Chinese citizens, industrial toxins that have soaked into the water and soil are equal, if not greater, worries than smoggy skies. They worry that heavy metals and other pollutants have contaminated so much of the countryside that food is unsafe.The five-year plan includes proposals to expand monitoring of polluted soil, and to set up hundreds of model farming and construction sites to show how toxic earth can be cleaned up. But a lasting solution may be a long way off.China surprised many experts when its military budget for the year grew by 7.6 percent, far below the double-digit increases that have become the norm. But the Ministry of Finance report shows that the growth of government revenue is slowing down, along with the general economy. This year, revenues for the central and local governments are projected to grow by 3 percent, about half of last year\u2019s rate of 5.8 percent.China has been feverishly piling sand onto reefs in the South China Sea, creating seven new islets in the region and straining already taut geopolitical tensions.China has come a long way from the period in the 1950s when it absorbed ideas and expertise from the Soviet Union. But a few legacies persist, including a liking for grand five-year plans, and on Saturday the government released its next blueprint, which will guide the country through to the end of 2020.But there is an important aspect to this old-fashioned planning device where climate change and the planet\u2019s future are concerned. In the latest plan, the government elaborated on its goals to cut carbon dioxide pollution from coal and other fossil fuels, and to expand construction of nuclear power plants, hydropower dams, and solar and wind power.Owen Guo and Adam Wu contributed research.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Program That Lets Foreigners Write a Check, and Get a Visa, Draws Scrutiny", "Date": "2016-03-15", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The easiest way to gain entry into the United States is not to walk across the border in the dead of night. It is to write a check.A visa process enacted by Congress in 1990 to create jobs and pump billions of dollars into the economy has evolved into a program that federal investigators and some prominent lawmakers say has become a risk to national security and an easy mark for abuse, particularly from China.But EB-5 has been the subject of increasing scrutiny since investigators uncovered numerous cases of fraud, discovered individuals with possible ties to Chinese and Iranian intelligence using fake documents and learned that international fugitives who have laundered money had infiltrated the program.\u201cIt\u2019s no secret that the program has long been riddled with corruption and national security vulnerabilities,\u201d said Senator Charles E. Grassley, Republican of Iowa and a frequent critic of the program.A number of Democrats echo his criticism, in large part because while most visa applicants must meet education or work requirements, the primary requirement for the EB-5 program is a \u201clawful source of investment income,\u201d one Department of Homeland Security memo said.\u201cI don\u2019t believe that America should be selling visas and eventually citizenship,\u201d said Senator Dianne Feinstein, Democrat of California, who wants to terminate a part of the program that allows foreign applicants to invest through regional development centers that pool investor money. \u201cThe right to immigrate should not be for sale.\u201dThe Department of Homeland Security, led by Secretary Jeh Johnson, said it was taking steps to address the issues raised by senators like Mr. Grassley and Ms. Feinstein. \u201cThe secretary intends to do all he can within his legal authority to do so,\u201d said Marsha Catron, a spokeswoman for the department.The foreign investor visa has defenders. One is Senator Chuck Schumer, Democrat of New York, along with some in the Obama administration who say it has delivered billions of dollars into the American economy: $8.7 billion and 35,140 jobs since Oct. 12. But federal auditors have found that in many cases, those numbers are \u201cnot valid and reliable.\u201dSupporters of the EB-5 program, including real estate developers, spent as much as $3 million to help defeat legislation sponsored by Mr. Grassley and Senator Patrick J. Leahy, Democrat of Vermont, intended to address fraud and national security concerns.Mr. Schumer, who opposed the Grassley-Leahy legislation, said he supported national security and fraud reforms to the EB-5 program.New criticism of the program surfaced recently when a former federal investigator, Taylor Johnson, a special agent with Immigration and Customs Enforcement, said she was fired after raising questions about the vetting of individuals involved in a development project in Las Vegas. She filed a complaint with the Merit Systems Protection Board, a quasi-judicial agency that protects whistle-blowers, saying she was fired because she exposed national security concerns. Immigration and Customs Enforcement said Ms. Johnson\u2019s termination was unrelated to her EB-5 investigation.But her accusations have prompted investigations by the Office of Special Counsel, an independent agency that protects federal employees from reprisal, and the Department of Homeland Security\u2019s Office of the Inspector General.Foreign investors can gain green cards by investing $1 million in a new business or $500,000 through one of nearly 800 regional development centers across the country that pool EB-5 money and are certified by the federal government. Most EB-5 visa seekers \u2014 about 95 percent \u2014 invest through these regional centers, which are largely unregulated. In some cases, the investors can also gain citizenship.The program has grown rapidly, to nearly 9,000 conditional visas last year, of which 80 percent were issued to Chinese investors, from 64 EB-5 visas in 2003. Investigators have found that security risks have risen rapidly with the growth.A Government Accountability Office report released in August found that the agency could not be sure that money used for the visas was not coming from \u201cthe drug trade, human trafficking or other criminal activities.\u201dOfficials at Homeland Security Investigations, a division of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, said they were concerned that those who prepare overseas documents \u201cmay try to use increasingly sophisticated methods to circumvent\u201d the program. In a 2013 memo, the agency suggested that the EB-5 regional center program end because \u201cthere are no safeguards that can be put in place that will ensure the integrity\u201d of the regional center model.Court records and law enforcement documents show that several individuals with questionable backgrounds have used the program to launder money and gain entry to the United States.A growing concern among United States intelligence and law enforcement officials is that foreign government agents might be trying to infiltrate the program to conduct economic espionage or gain access to technology that is banned from export.A 2013 Homeland Security investigation found that an individual involved in the EB-5 program who was later arrested in connection with exporting electronics to Iran had ties to Iranian intelligence operatives who might try to abuse the programs to enter the United States.Officials from Citizenship and Immigration Services acknowledged that the EB-5 program has had problems, but they said the agency had made a number of changes to address them, including shutting down 35 troubled centers since 2014.And Homeland Security officials said they were being more proactive in tracing the sources of foreign investor income, including establishing working relationships with Chinese government officials and conducting overseas visits to verify applicants\u2019 sources of income.Mr. Grassley, the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, said he was not convinced the changes were enough.An earlier version of this article stated incorrectly the type of visa that was granted to Hector Javier Villarreal Hernandez, the former treasurer of the Mexican state of Coahuila. He did not receive a visa under the EB-5 program, which allows wealthy foreign investors to receive a visa for a price ranging from $500,000 to more than $1 million; he received a visa under a different program.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Transcript of the Democratic Presidential Debate in Flint, Mich.", "Date": "2016-03-06", "News": "Supported byFollowing is a transcript of the Democratic debate, as transcribed by the Federal News Service.And now we want to welcome the Democratic candidates for president of the United States, please welcome Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont.(APPLAUSE)(APPLAUSE)(APPLAUSE)And now will you please rise for our national anthem performed by the Flint City Wide Choir, conducted by Darnell Ishmel. (MUSIC PLAYING, \u201cTHE STAR-SPANGLED BANNER\u201d)(APPLAUSE)Candidates take your positions behind the podium. Before we begin as the candidates take their positions, I just want to set out some ground rules as moderators, I\u2019ll ask questions, I\u2019ll ask follow- ups and guide the discussion. The candidates will have one minute and 15 seconds to answer questions. They\u2019ll have 30 seconds for follow- ups. CNN\u2019s Don Lemon will join me in the questioning, as will members of our audience here tonight. The members of our audience are Democrats and independents from Flint and elsewhere in Michigan. We\u2019ve reviewed their questions just so they don\u2019t overlap.COOPER: Now we\u2019ve come to Flint because this is a city in crisis, a city where, as you probably know, the tap water is toxic. Public servants, public institutions not only failed to prevent the crisis, their decisions created this crisis. The state of Michigan, in an effort to save money, switched Flint\u2019s water source to a cheaper, but riskier alternative, the Flint River. Safeguards were ignored. That river water corroded residential pipes, and for nearly two years, lead leaked into the water used in people\u2019s homes. Now, for much of that time, the state downplayed the danger, even in the face of growing complaints and physical evidence.For 100 days, the federal government knew about it, and yet in all that time nobody told the people of Flint. They bathed in the water, they drank it, and so did their kids. Even today, lead is still present in some of the water.Tonight the Democratic candidates are here to answer questions about what they would do for Flint, as well as about other issues facing their country right now.Each candidate has one minute for an opening statement, Senator Sanders is first. We begin with him. Senator Sanders?Over the last several weeks I had the opportunity to meet with a number of residents of Flint at a town meeting in Flint, and I have to tell you what I heard, and what I saw literally shattered me. And, it was beyond belief that children in Flint, Michigan in the United States of America in the year 2016 are being poisoned.That is clearly not what this country should be about.As Anderson indicated, there\u2019s a lot of blame to go around, and one of the points that I have made is that I believe the Governor of this state should understand that his dereliction of duty was irresponsible. He should resign.(APPLAUSE)(APPLAUSE)(APPLAUSE)We are here in Flint, I\u2019m very grateful that my request that we hold this debate be held here so we can continue to shine a very bright spotlight on what has happened in this city.I agree, the Governor should resign, or be recalled...(APPLAUSE)I support a hundred percent the efforts by your senators and members of congress to get the money from the federal government in order to begin the work that must occur to fix the infrastructure. The state should also be sending money immediately to help this city.(APPLAUSE) (CHEERING)(APPLAUSE)Your government at all levels have let you and your children and the people of Flint down. So I think that there are there several things. All the repair work that is being done \u2014 and Mayor Weaver program that we support to begin to help train people in Flint to be able to do this work to distribute the water. Everything that is done has to be triple checked to regain your trust and to hold those who are responsible for fixing the pipes and delivering the clean water which has you said, you bathe in it and drink it and wash food in it. You do everything with it.Every one of us should have to run through in our minds how we use water every single day to understand the pressures and the real pain that families are going through. So I will make sure as President that I double and triple check. I will work with elected officials who I trust like your mayor and like your senators and member of Congress so that we can assure you that when it\u2019s fixed, you can trust it. You deserve nothing less.When it comes to the water itself, we are supporting a program that Mayor Waver announced through Flint Waterworks to pay people in Flint, not outsiders, but people here to deliver the water while we are fixing the pipes. I would do even more of that. As president, what we were able to put together was a beginning. As president, I would concentrate resources on the city for economic development for more jobs as we fix the water and provide the health and education, interventions that children need. COOPER: Senator Sanders for Ms. Wade specifically?(APPLAUSE)What is absolute incredible to me is that water rates have soared in Flint. You are paying three times more for poison water than I am paying in Burlington, Vermont for clean water.First thing is you say, people are not paying a water bill for poison and that is retroactive.(APPLAUSE)Second of all, to ease anxiety, CDC has to come in and examine every child and adult in this community in terms of the amount of lead they may have. Thirdly, the wealthiest country has to rebuild the crumbling infrastructure, our water systems. I have a bill for a trillion dollars, it creates 13 million jobs rebuilding flint, Michigan and communities all over the country.(APPLAUSE)We will have more on the infrastructure shortly but I want to follow up with you.This crisis in flint as you know, as everybody in the room knows was created by the government. Your policies are about expanding government. Why should people from flint trust that more government is the answer?Listen, I suppose they can trust the corporations who have destroyed Flint by a disastrous trade policy which have allowed them to shut down plants in flint and move to China or Mexico. We could trust them I\u2019m sure.(APPLAUSE)(APPLAUSE)... because we know their honesty and integrity has done so much for the American people. Look, we live in a democracy, and I\u2019m not in (ph) the last person to deny that government is failing in many respects.But at the end of the day, I will trust the people to create a government that works for them, rather than Wall Street or corporate America.(APPLAUSE)It\u2019s easy to blame the Republican governor, Rick Snyder. But the federal government also dropped the ball here. According to Section 1414 of the Safe Drinking Water Act, the EPA has to step in and take action when a state is informed at (ph) \u2014 about water problems and doesn\u2019t do anything for 30 days, as the state here didn\u2019t do.The EPA knew for months and months, never warned the people of Flint not to drink the water. As president, would you fire the head of the EPA?So I would have a full investigation, determine who knew what, when. And yes, people should be fired. How far up it went, I don\u2019t know. But as far as it goes, they should be relieved, because they failed this city.But let me just add this, Anderson. This is not the only place where this kind of action is needed. We have a lot of communities right now in our country where the level of toxins in the water, including lead, are way above what anybody should tolerate.(APPLAUSE)We have a higher rate of tested lead in people in Cleveland than in Flint. So I\u2019m not satisfied with just doing everything we must do for Flint. I want to tackle this problem across the board. And if people know about it and they\u2019re not acting, and they\u2019re in the government at any level, they should be forced to resign.(APPLAUSE)(APPLAUSE)And President Sanders would make the point that, how does it happen, in the wealthiest country in the history of the world? What are our priorities when, among others, Republicans today are fighting for hundreds of billions of dollars in tax breaks for the wealthiest people?How did we have so much money available to go to war in Iraq and spend trillions of dollars...(APPLAUSE)... but somehow not have enough money \u2014 not just for Flint, the secretary is right. There are communities all over this country \u2014 it\u2019s not just infrastructure, it is education. Detroit\u2019s public school system is collapsing.(APPLAUSE)She says she\u2019s undecided, and has a question for both of you to answer, but we\u2019ll start with Senator Sanders. Ms. Walters?(APPLAUSE)So, I want to do exactly what you said. We will commit to a priority to change the water systems, and we will commit within five years to remove lead from everywhere.We were making progress on this in the 1990\u2019s. I worked with then Senator Obama to get more money, more support to do more to remove lead.(APPLAUSE)If it leads to civil penalties, if it leads to criminal responsibility. There has to be an absolute accountability, and I will support whatever the outcome of those investigations are.Imagine this for a second, imagine a mother who had a bright seven-year-old gregarious girl doing well in school. Two years later, that child is now in special education, intellectual capabilities significantly deteriorated. That is a crime against that child, and the people of Flint. And, clearly, people are going to have to be held accountable.(APPLAUSE)I want to turn now to Bryn Mickle, the editor of the Flint Journal, he\u2019s our local partner in this debate. He has our next question.Bryn?And, this problem is one that is particularly outrageous and painful at the same time.So, when I heard about it I immediately sent people here to find out what was going on. It was almost unbelievable. We have this problem in other places, but we don\u2019t say that it was actually caused by decisions made by public officials in positions of authority, as this one was.Then, when I talked to the mayor I basically said, \u201cWhat can I do to help?\u201dThen, when I came here, and I met with some of the mothers, and met their children, and heard their stories \u2014 I\u2019m just determined to do whatever I can. So, I have put together resources from the private and philanthropic communities to help provide a bridge because you\u2019ve got to get the federal money, you\u2019ve got to get the state money, but I\u2019m going to do everything I can. And, I will be with Flint all the way through this crisis in whatever capacity I am.And, if I\u2019m president, it will always be a priority for action from me.(APPLAUSE)And the second thing I did is hold a town meeting, which was as nonpolitical as I could make it for hundreds of people to tell me and the world through the media exactly what was happening here in Flint. I think the fear and the legitimate fear of the people of Flint is that a certain point the TV cameras and CNN will disappear.(APPLAUSE)And people are going to be left struggling in order to live in a safe and healthy community. All I can say is if you check my record going back a long time, I have stood with those who are hurting. I have stood with those who have no money, and I have taken on virtually every powerful special interest in the United States of America. That\u2019s my record and I\u2019m proud of it.This city is also facing a jobs crisis, 75 percent of Flint\u2019s manufacturing jobs have been lost in the last 25 years and about the same amount of time, Michigan lost 230,000 manufacturing jobs.I want to go to Tanisha Motron, she grew up in flint and now works in Detroit at the Shinola watch factory which as you know, is often held up as the blueprint for how to save American industry jobs. She says she\u2019s leaning towards secretary Clinton and has a question for her.We\u2019re also going to invest more on infrastructure as we both have said, \u201cit\u2019s woefully under resourced.\u201d That will put a lot of people to work. I want to do more to help small businesses, they are the source of two thirds of our jobs and we have to help them start and grow, particularly minority and women-owned small businesses.We need to do more to help create clean energy as a source of good jobs but I am also going to go after companies. You know, when a company decides to leave like Nabisco is leaving and they have gotten tax benefits from Chicago and Illinois to stay there, I will claw back the benefits. They will have to pay them back if they are leaving a place that actually invested in them.I am also going to go after companies like Johnson Controls in Wisconsin. They came and got part of the bailout because they were an auto parts supplier and now they want to move headquarters to Europe. They are going to have to pay an exit fee. We are going to stop this kind of job exporting and we are going to start importing and growing jobs again in our country.Secretary Clinton supported virtually every one of the disastrous trade agreements written by corporate America.(APPLAUSE)NAFTA, supported by the Secretary cost, us 800,000 jobs nationwide, tens of thousands of jobs in the Midwest. Permanent normal trade relations with China cost us millions of jobs. Look, I was on a picket line in early 1990\u2019s against NFATA because you didn\u2019t need a PhD in economics to understand that American workers should not be forced to compete against people in Mexico making 25 cents an hour.(APPLAUSE)(APPLAUSE)... should not be forced to compete against people in Vietnam today making a minimum wage of $0.65 an hour. Look, what we have got to do is tell corporate America that they cannot continue to shut down. We\u2019ve lost 60,000 factories since 2001. They\u2019re going to start having to, if I\u2019m president, invest in this country \u2014 not in China, not in Mexico.(APPLAUSE)The money was there, and had to be released in order to save the American auto industry and four million jobs, and to begin the restructuring. We had the best year that the auto industry has had in a long time. I voted to save the auto industry.(APPLAUSE)He voted against the money that ended up saving the auto industry. I think that is a pretty big difference.(APPLAUSE)(CROSSTALK)When billionaires on Wall Street destroyed this economy, they went to Congress and they said, \u201cplease, we\u2019ll be good boys, bail us out.\u201d You know what I said? I said, \u201clet the billionaires themselves bail out Wall Street.\u201d It shouldn\u2019t be the middle class of this country.(APPLAUSE)But ultimately, if you look at our records, I stood up to corporate America time and time again. I went to Mexico. I saw the lives of people who were working in American factories and making $0.25 an hour.I understood that these trade agreements were going to destroy the middle class of this country. I led the fight against us (sic). That is one of the major differences that we have.(APPLAUSE)... to set the record straight, I voted against the only multinational trade agreement that came before me when I was in the Senate. It was called CAFTA. I came out against the TPP after it was finished. I thought it was reasonable to actually know what was in it before I opposed it. I oppose it.(APPLAUSE)Now let me get back to what happened in January of 2009. The Bush administration negotiated the deal. Were there things in it that I didn\u2019t like? Would I have done it differently? Absolutely.But was the auto bailout money in it \u2014 the $350 billion that was needed to begin the restructuring of the auto industry? Yes, it was. So when I talk about Senator Sanders being a one-issue candidate, I mean very clearly \u2014 you have to make hard choices when you\u2019re in positions of responsibility. The two senators from Michigan stood on the floor and said, \u201cwe have to get this money released.\u201d I went with them, and I went with Barack Obama. You did not. If everybody had voted the way he did, I believe the auto industry would have collapsed, taking four million jobs with it.(APPLAUSE)(APPLAUSE)And what I proposed \u2014 and I had an amendment that was defeated \u2014 it was defeated by a voice vote on the floor of the Senate \u2014 that said to those people on the top who benefited from Wall Street greed \u2014 I said, \u201cyou pay for the bailout. Don\u2019t go to my constituents, who are struggling to make ends meet.\u201dIn terms of the auto bailout, of course that made sense. In terms of the stimulus package, of course that made sense, and I strongly supported President Obama\u2019s position on that.SANDERS: But let us be clear, one of the major issues Secretary Clinton says I\u2019m a one-issue person, well, I guess so. My one issue is trying to rebuild a disappearing middle class. That\u2019s my one issue.(APPLAUSE)He sent a letter, an authorized letter, asking us to support that to save the auto industry. Yes, were there things in it that you and I would not have necessarily wanted? That\u2019s true. But when it came down to it, you were either for saving the auto industry or you were against it. I voted to save the auto industry. And I am very glad that I did.(APPLAUSE)(APPLAUSE)Well, let\u2019s have some facts instead of some rhetoric for a change. I went to Wall Street when I was a United States senator. I told them they were wrecking the economy. I asked for a moratorium on foreclosures. I asked that we do more to try to prevent what I worried was going to happen. I also called for closing loopholes including the carried interest loophole. I also called for changes in CEO pay. I have a record. And you know what, if you were going to be in some way distrusted or dismissed about whether you can take on Wall Street if you ever took money, President Obama took more money from Wall Street in the 2008 campaign than anybody ever had.And when it came time to stand up to Wall Street, he passed and signed the toughest regulation since the Great Depression with the Dodd-Frank regulations.Second of all, when we talk about being tough on Wall Street, and this galls me and the American people. Recently Goldman Sachs, among many other major financial institutions on Wall Street, as you know, reached a settlement with the federal government for $5 billion because they were selling worthless packages of subprime mortgages, $5 billion settlement.You know how many people, executives on Wall Street have gone to jail? If you are a kid caught with marijuana in Michigan, you get a police record. If you are an executive on Wall Street that destroys the American economy, you pay a $5 billion fine, no police record.If I am elected president, we are going to bring justice back to a broken criminal justice system.(APPLAUSE)Because we now have tools, laws that we didn\u2019t have before. And I am very happy we did. Because there does need to be accountability, including criminal accountability if it is called for.COOPER: Senator Sanders, I just want to show the audience, you sent a tweet, I want to return to trade.You sent a tweet on Thursday, this is the tweet, I\u2019m showing it to viewers. It says the people of Detroit know the real costs of Hillary Clinton\u2019s free trade policies. It shows pictures of crumbling buildings. It seems like you\u2019re blaming her for the situation in Detroit.Do you know...(APPLAUSE)Those trade policies, as much as any other set of policies, has resulted in the shrinking of the American middle class. And, I\u2019ll tell you what else it did. It\u2019s not only job loss by the millions, it is the race to the bottom so that new jobs in manufacturing, in some cases today, pay 50 percent less than they did 20 years ago. How stupid is that trade policy?(APPLAUSE)There had been a net increase of 54,000 manufacturing jobs. There had been a net increase of 653,000 jobs overall.And, one of the ways jobs were brought to, and grown here in Michigan was through something called the Export-Import Bank which helped a lot of businesses, particularly small businesses, be able to export around the world.Senator Sanders opposes that. I think we\u2019re in a race for exports. I think China, Germany, everybody else supports their businesses. Here in Michigan there\u2019s been $11 billion dollars in recent years used to support exports, primarily from small businesses.I favor that, he\u2019s opposed it. I want to do everything I can for us to compete and win in the global economy...The Export-Import Bank, it\u2019s a federal agency, it gives loans to companies that export American products. Senator Sanders, you do oppose it. The vast majority of the bank\u2019s customers are small businesses, 176 right here in Michigan. What do you say to small business owners....Seventy-Five percent of the funds going from the federal government, the Export-Import Bank, goes to large, profitable corporations. Many of these corporations have shut down in America, and have gone abroad to exploit poor people.You know what? I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a great idea for the American taxpayer to have to subsidize through corporate welfare profitable corporations who downsize in the United States of America.(LAUGHTER)I just believe that Senator Sanders took that lonely position because most of us who saw the results \u2014 I saw it as a senator from New York. Your Senators saw it here in Michigan. They can give you the names of 240 companies in Michigan that have been helped.There is a company in Levonia being helped, there are companies all over this state. I know, if we are going to compete and win in the global economy, we can\u2019t let every other country support their companies and we take a hands off approach. I will not agree with that.I did go in many places around the world to sell American products because the alternatives were usually European, Asian, primarily Chinese products. That to me was an unacceptable concession. So yes, Boeing and other big companies get support just like their competitors do from the companies that they are from in the countries that provide the support.Senator sanders?Second of all.(APPLAUSE)Second of all, secretary Clinton traveled the world, she has been to Europe. And let\u2019s talk about Europe versus the United States. I\u2019m sure that when you were in Europe, and France, and Germany and the U.K., and all of the other countries; you noticed something and that is every one of those countries guarantees health care to all of their people as a right.(APPLAUSE)And I am sure you know as you know you do that in countries like the U.K. compared to America, we are spending almost three times as much as they spend in the U.K. for health care for our people. We are spending 50 percent more than the French. When we talk about Europe and their pluses and minuses, one thing they have done well that we should emulate and that is guaranteed health care for all people for a better care for all.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)As most of you know, two weeks ago, an Uber driver in Kalamazoo, which is two hours from where we are tonight, went on a shooting rampage, killing six people, injuring two people.One of the injured was a 14-year-old girl. Her name is Abigail Kopf. She was shot in the head, her heart stopped, she was on life support \u2014 looked like she might \u2014 might not make it. But amazingly, Abigail pulled through. Her father...(APPLAUSE)... her father Gene Kopf is here tonight. And I know, Gene, you have a question. But before you ask your question, I just want to ask, how is Abigail doing tonight?(APPLAUSE)What do you plan to do to address this serious epidemic? I don\u2019t want to hear anything about tougher laws for mental health or criminal backgrounds, because that doesn\u2019t work.(APPLAUSE)I think we have to try everything that works to try to limit the numbers of people and the kinds of people who are given access to firearms. The Brady Bill, which has been in effect now for about 23 years, has kept more than two million purchases from going forward. So we do have to continue to try to work on that because not every killer will have the same profile.But the comprehensive background checks, closing the gun show loophole, closing the online loophole, closing what\u2019s called the Charleston loophole, where you get a gun at the end of three days, even if the background check is not completed which is what the killer in Charleston did. And then they found out later, he shouldn\u2019t have gotten the gun when he killed nine people at Mother Emmanuel Church.I also believe, so strongly Gene (ph), that giving immunity to gunmakers and sellers was a terrible mistake.(APPLAUSE)And then I do think we have got to have a public...(APPLAUSE)Any lunatic tomorrow, any person can walk into a theater and do something horrific. And you know what? For us to tell you that that absolutely will not happen would be untrue. But what the president said, he said look, this is a tough issue. But we have got to do everything we possibly can to minimize the possibility of these mass killings.You are looking at a guy who comes from a rural state with no gun control. I have a D minus voting record from the NRA. You are looking at a guy who in 1988 lost a statewide election for Congress because I was the only candidate who said you know what, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a great idea in this country to be selling military-style assault weapons which are designed to kill people.(APPLAUSE)Right now, families of Sandy Hook victims announced that they are going to sue Remington, who made the AR-15 which was used in the Newtown massacre.(APPLAUSE)Now, they believe \u2014 those families believe that \u2014 that Remington, the distributors, the sellers \u2014 should be held legally responsible for how that gun \u2014 how their product is used.Now, the lawsuit may not go anywhere because of the bill you voted for \u2014 legislation that prevents gun makers from being sued. Tonight, what do you say to those families?If that is the point, I have to tell you I disagree. I disagree because you hold people \u2014 in terms of this liability thing, where you hold manufacturers\u2019 liability is if they understand that they\u2019re selling guns into an area that \u2014 it\u2019s getting into the hands of criminals, of course they should be held liable.But if they are selling a product to a person who buys it legally, what you\u2019re really talking about is ending gun manufacturing in America. I don\u2019t agree with that.(APPLAUSE)Because of the proliferation of guns, because of the epidemic of gun violence in our country, there were a group of cities, states, and other concerned people who, in the late 90s and in the early 2000s, were working on legal theories that they thought would force gun makers to do more to make guns safer and force sellers to be much more responsible.The NRA saw this happening, and they said, \u201cwe\u2019ve got to stop it. Last thing in the world we want is to have guns that you can only shoot with your fingerprint, or to have guns with such strong safety locks on them that they may not be sellable.\u201dSo the NRA went to the Congress, and the head of the NRA has said this was the most important NRA legislation in more than 20 years...(CROSSTALK)(APPLAUSE)As I understand it \u2014 and maybe I\u2019m wrong on this, but what you were essentially saying, and what people are saying, is that, if somebody who is crazy or a criminal or a horrible person goes around shooting people, the manufacturer of that gun should be held liable.And if that is your position, then what you are saying, essentially \u2014 if that is the case, as I understand it \u2014 it\u2019s not what Secretary Clinton is talking about. I agree with what she said.But if that is the case, then essentially, your position is there should not be any guns in America, period.(CROSSTALK)And you can \u2014 there are people who hold that view. And that\u2019s fine, if you hold it. I think what you do is you hold those people who have used the gun accountable. You try to make...Now, they are trying to prevent that from happening to any other family.But, as I understand what your question is \u2014 and, you\u2019re not the only person whose heart was broken. I know, I was there in the Senate when we learned about this killing. It is almost unspeakable to talk about some lunatic walking into a \u2014 I mean; it is hard to even talk about it.We all feel that way. But it, as I understand it, Anderson, and maybe I\u2019m wrong, what you\u2019re really talking about is people saying let\u2019s end gun manufacturing in America. That\u2019s the implications of that, and I don\u2019t agree with that.As a black man in America, if I were born today I\u2019d have a one in three chance of ending up in prison in my life. Secretary Clinton, on the campaign trail, you are calling for an end to the era of mass incarceration, but a lot of folks in the black community blame the 1994 Crime Bill, a bill you supported for locking up a generation of black men.Given what\u2019s happened since 1994, why should black people trust you to get it right this time?Now, my husband said at the NAACP last summer that it solved some problems, but it created other problems, and I agree. And, one of those problems was, unfortunately, a move to expand the reasons why people would be incarcerated, not just at the federal level which is what this bill about, but in states and localities as well. And, that\u2019s why the very first speech that I gave in this campaign was about criminal justice reform, and ending the era of mass incarceration because I believe absolutely that too many families were broken up, too many communities were adversely affected. So, we\u2019ve got to do a bunch of things.On the criminal justice side, look, we\u2019ve got to have better policing. That means body cameras, that means ending profiling, that means doing everything we can to make sure there\u2019s respect between the community and the police.And, when it comes to incarceration...(APPLAUSE)Now, if I have voted against that bill, Secretary Clinton would be here tonight and she\u2019d say, \u201cBernie Sanders voted against the ban on assault weapons. Bernie Sanders voted against the violence against women act.\u201d Those were provisions in the bill, as the Secretary just indicated. So, in that bill there was some good provisions, I have been a fierce fighter against domestic violence ever since I was mayor in Burlington.Violence against women act has protected millions of women in this country, it was in that bill. The ban on assault weapons, that\u2019s what I have fought for my whole life. It was in that bill.Now, what you are reading though is I went to the floor, as I recall, and that\u2019s what I said. I tried to get the death penalty aspects in that bill out. Secretary Clinton have a disagreement. I was then, and I am now opposed to the death penalty.(APPLAUSE)But where we are right now is having more than 2.2 million people in jail \u2014 more than any other country on earth. This is a campaign promise, at the end of my first term, we will not have more people in jail than any other country.(LAUGHTER)(APPLAUSE)I think the most important that happened to me was a combination of my church and youth minister when I was a teenager, insisting that we go in to inner-city Chicago because I lived in a suburb and have exchanges with kids in black and hispanic churches. It was also important for me to be a baby-sitter for the children of migrant workers and to learn more about their lives, and to hear Dr. King speak in Chicago when I was about 14 years old. That got me thinking about what I needed to do to try to fulfill my faith.When I was in law school, I had the opportunity to mead a visionary woman, named Mary Right Adelman, who worked with Dr. King who was the first African-American woman who passed the Mississippi bar. I asked her for a job and she said she didn\u2019t have any money. I was working my way through law school and she said if I could get a job and get myself paid, she would give me a job. So I got law students a Civil Rights Research Council Grant.The first thing she did was send me to look at South Carolina, to investigate juveniles being sent to adult jails. The second thing she did was to send me to Alabama to investigate segregated academies. So from that moment until today, I am so grateful for my experiences as a very young woman driven by my church and my experiences working for the Children\u2019s Defense Fund which have given me some insight and have lit a fire inside me to do everything I can to address systemic racism.(APPLAUSE)That is what I will try to do to deal with what I know is the racism that still stalks our country.(APPLAUSE)Senator Sanders, on a personal front, what racial blind spots do you have?He said, no, I don\u2019t get cabs in Washington, D.C. This was 20 years ago. Because he was humiliated by the fact that cabdrivers would go past him because he was black. I couldn\u2019t believe, you know, you just sit there and you say, this man did not take a cab 20 years ago in Washington, D.C. Tell you another story, I was with young people active in the Black Lives Matter movement. A young lady comes up to me and she says, you don\u2019t understand what police do in certain black communities. You don\u2019t understand the degree to which we are terrorized, and I\u2019m not just talking about the horrible shootings that we have seen, which have got to end and we\u2019ve got to hold police officers accountable, I\u2019m just talking about every day activities where police officers are bullying people.So to answer your question, I would say, and I think it\u2019s similar to what the secretary said, when you\u2019re white, you don\u2019t know what it\u2019s like to be living in a ghetto. You don\u2019t know what it\u2019s like to be poor. You don\u2019t know what it\u2019s like to be hassled when you walk down the street or you get dragged out of a car.And I believe that as a nation in the year 2016, we must be firm in making it clear. We will end institutional racism and reform a broken criminal justice system.(APPLAUSE)So how would you be more effective in tackling racial issues than President Barack Obama?(APPLAUSE)But here\u2019s what I would do. I would end \u2014 I would make sure that the Department of Justice investigated every killing of a citizen of this country when they are under apprehension from a police officer or when they are killed in police custody.I would end the militarization of local police departments.(APPLAUSE)(APPLAUSE)Secretary Clinton, in 1996, you used the term super predators to describe some young kids. Some feel like it was racial code. Was it and were you wrong to use that term?Because my whole life, to go back to what I was saying to Mr. Mcgee (ph), is, you know, really, ever since I went to work for the Children\u2019s Defense Fund, is to try to figure out ways to even the odds for people that are left out and left behind.And I know very well that we have too many kids in our country right now who are living in poverty, who are going to schools like the ones in Detroit that have mold and rodents in them. I saw that in South Carolina. It\u2019s unfortunately across America. So what we have got to do is provide more opportunities earlier in the lives of every child.That\u2019s why I believe in supporting families, early childhood education, universal pre-kindergarten, help kids be successful. And here is Flint, we\u2019ve got to do more to mitigate against the effects of lead, because too many kids are having the experiences I\u2019ve been told about, where they\u2019re falling back in school, where they are having headaches because of the lead exposure.And what that legislation ended up doing is increasing extreme poverty, the poorest people in this country have become much poorer as a result of that \u2014 really a bill that was written by Republicans. Bad bill.But if we are going to talk about the \u201990s, let\u2019s talk about 23 million new jobs, incomes went up for everybody. The median African- American income went up 33 percent at the end of the \u201990s and we lifted more people out of poverty than at any other time in recent history.So we were on the right path. More jobs, rising incomes.(APPLAUSE)(APPLAUSE)We passed NAFTA and other disastrous trade agreements which had a horrendous impact on African-Americans in particular, in Flint, in Detroit and all across this country. So when we talk about the \u201990s, you\u2019re right. A lot of good things happened, but a lot of bad things happened.In nearby Detroit, the public schools have become a national symbol of neglect and failure. That school system is $3.5 billion in debt. Officials say they could run out of money by April.I want to bring in Shoniqua Kemp. She\u2019s right here \u2014 Ms. Kemp. Her 14-year-old daughter Imani is a student in Detroit. Shoniqua is one of ten parents suing Detroit public schools \u2014 not for money, she says, but to improve conditions.She says she\u2019s currently leaning towards Senator Sanders. Her question will go to both of you, but we\u2019ll start with Senator Sanders. Ms. Kemp?Not only that \u2014 in our schools, as you\u2019ve stated, we have issues with rats, mold, no working water fountains, not to mention non- certified teachers, lack of accountability around transportation and special education, and so much more.QUESTION: With that said, our students can no longer suffer due to lack of these things, or having these dilapidated issues take place. So, my question is who\u2019s going to step up? Who\u2019s going to ensure that the policies procedures are put in place that will ensure, and bring forth a successful future for our students because my daughter cannot wait eight more years for success to take place at your hands. At the leader\u2019s hands.(APPLAUSE)And, let me be very honest with you, hard thing to say, but it is true. A great nation is judged not by how many millionaires and billionaires it has, but by how it treats the most vulnerable amongst us, and that is the children, and that is the elderly. And, do you know what?We should be ashamed of how we treat our kids and our senior citizens.(APPLAUSE)Somehow we can\u2019t make sure that there are summer programs for your children, and after school programs for your children. Somehow we cannot do what other countries around the world, is provide quality childcare and pre-K. We have got to change our national priorities, no more tax breaks for billionaires, and large corporations.We are going to invest in our children, and have the best public school system in the world.(APPLAUSE)(APPLAUSE)(APPLAUSE)(APPLAUSE) (CHEERING)(APPLAUSE)Secretary Clinton, you\u2019ve been endorsed by two of the biggest teachers\u2019 unions. There\u2019s an awful lot of great teachers in this country. It\u2019s an incredibly difficult job, one of the most difficult jobs there is but union rules often make it impossible fire bad teachers and that means disadvantaged kids are sometimes taught by the least qualified. Do you think unions protect bad teachers?A lot of what has happened and honestly it really pains me, a lot of people have blaming and scape-goating teachers because they don\u2019t want to put the money into the schools system that deserve the support that comes from the government doing it\u2019s job.You know, teachers do so much good, they are often working under most difficult circumstances. So anything that could be changed, I want them to look at it. I will be a good partner to make sure that whatever I can do as president, I will do to support the teachers of our country.So starting with the top, now I know some people think it\u2019s a radical idea, I don\u2019t. I believe that every public college and university in this country should be tuition free.(APPLAUSE)So that your child regardless of the income of your family knows that if she\u2019s studies hard, she is going to be able to go to college. And you know what else we do? We invest in child care. Right now, you\u2019ve got child-care workers making McDonald\u2019s wages, that is crazy.Secretary, I want to turn now from the state of our nation\u2019s school to the state of our nation\u2019s crumbling infrastructure, which you talked a little bit about in the beginning of this debate. But beyond the Detroit schools and Flint water crisis; pipes, roads, and bridges are in need of repair. It would take trillions of dollars to fix it all. Senator Sanders has proposed a one trillion dollar plan but yours is only a quarter of that, is your plan big enough to fix the crumbling infrastructure in this country?I want to put 250 billion dollars additional, on top of what Congress has done. That gets us to a half a billion. I want to start a National Infrastructure Bank. I want to capitalize it with 25 billion that I believe will leverage 10 times that, that\u2019s another 250 billion.So I\u2019m trying to do this in a way that will gain support and be affordable but there\u2019s no doubt, we have to do more on our roads, our bridges, our tunnels, our ports, our airports. And as we\u2019ve talked in the beginning here, under our ground, our water systems, our sewer systems. We have pipelines that are leaking and that are dangerous. We have so much work to be done and if we can put millions of peoples to work, I think my plan is a very good way to begin doing that work and get people out there doing it.We have suggested a trillion-dollar investment. Now, you know how we\u2019re gonna pay for that? I\u2019ll tell you how we\u2019re gonna pay for that. Right now, this country is losing $100 billion every single year because profitable corporations are stashing their profits in the Cayman Islands, Bermuda and in other tax havens...(APPLAUSE)... and in some cases, not paying five cents in federal income tax. I will eliminate that outrageous loophole, and we will raise $1 trillion. And by the way, not only do we rebuild our crumbling infrastructure \u2014 $1 trillion over five years creates 13 million decent-paying jobs.(APPLAUSE)The issue of climate change has been a major talking point for both of you. I wanted to bring in Sarah Bellaire, she\u2019s a student at the University of Michigan at Dearborn who says she\u2019s currently undecided.Ms. Bellaire has a question on fracking, which, for viewers, is a process of oil and gas drilling that\u2019s led to a significant increase in American energy production and jobs, but also raises serious environmental concerns.Sarah, your question is for Secretary Clinton, but you\u2019ll both be able to weigh in. Sarah?So by the time we get through all of my conditions, I do not think there will be many places in America where fracking will continue to take place. And I think that\u2019s the best approach, because right now, there places where fracking is going on that are not sufficiently regulated.So first, we\u2019ve got to regulate everything that is currently underway, and we have to have a system in place that prevents further fracking unless conditions like the ones that I just mentioned are met.(APPLAUSE)And by the way \u2014 by the way, Anderson, I\u2019m glad you raised the issue of climate change, because the media doesn\u2019t talk enough about what the scientists are telling us, and that is, if we don\u2019t get our act together...(APPLAUSE)... the planet that we\u2019re gonna leave our children may not be healthy and habitable. I have introduced the most comprehensive climate change legislation in the history of the Senate, which, among other things, calls for a tax on carbon, massive investments...(APPLAUSE)... in energy efficiency, wind, solar and other sustainable energy.(APPLAUSE)... to Secretary Clinton\u2019s point, there are a number of Democratic governors in many states who say that fracking can be done safely, and that it\u2019s helping their economies. Are they wrong?(APPLAUSE)You know \u2014 you know, one of the differences \u2014 look, Secretary Clinton \u2014 and I\u2019ve said this before, and I admit it \u2014 she has the support of all the governors \u2014 Democratic \u2014 all the Senators, all the Congressmen. I don\u2019t. I am not part of that establishment. I plead guilty.(APPLAUSE)I happen to be a member of the Environmental Committee. I have talked to scientists all over the world. And what they are telling me \u2014 if we don\u2019t get our act together, this planet could be 5 to 10 degrees warmer by the end of this century \u2014 cataclysmic problems for this planet.This is a national crisis. And I talk to scientists who tell me that fracking is doing terrible things to water systems all over this country. We have gotta be bold now. We gotta transform our energy system to energy efficiency and sustainable energy. We\u2019ve gotta do it yesterday.(APPLAUSE)Are you suggesting that she\u2019s in the pocket of the fossil fuel industry? SANDERS: No, what I am suggesting is that we have a corrupt campaign finance system. And instead of standing up to that finance system...(APPLAUSE)(LAUGHTER)(APPLAUSE)Secretary Clinton?What I am looking at is how we make the transition from where we are today to where are today to where we must be. I worked with President Obama during the four years I was secretary of state to begin to put pressure on China and India and other countries to join with us to have a global agreement which we finally got in Paris.So I am committed to and focused on how we make that transition. I\u2019ve already said we are taking away the subsidies for oil and gas, but it is important that people understand that a president can\u2019t go ordering folks around. Our system doesn\u2019t permit that. I am going to set the goals. I will push everybody as hard as I can to achieve those goals. We will make progress on clean renewable energy and create millions of jobs through that.And I just want to make one point. You know, we have our differences. And we get into vigorous debate about issues, but compare the substance of this debate with what you saw on the Republican stage last week.(APPLAUSE)(LAUGHTER)(APPLAUSE)The question the American people have to ask is, why are these people putting millions of dollars into candidates if it\u2019s not going to make a difference?(APPLAUSE)(APPLAUSE)(APPLAUSE)(COMMERCIAL BREAK)(APPLAUSE)Democrats want to know, your supporters want to know, if you\u2019re the nominee, how are you going to take him on?(APPLAUSE)So, I will look forward to engaging him because, you know, I don\u2019t think we need to make America great again. America didn\u2019t stop being great, we have to make it whole again. We have to knock down the barriers, we have to end the divisiveness, we have to unify the country.And, if I\u2019m fortunate enough to be the nominee that\u2019s exactly what I will do.(LAUGHTER)For a start, but almost \u2014 not all, but almost every poll has shown that Sanders versus Trump does a lot better than Clinton versus Trump.(APPLAUSE)(APPLAUSE)(APPLAUSE) (CHEERING)I think we are exciting working class people, young people who are prepared to stand up and demand that we have a government that represents all of us.(APPLAUSE)I am here tonight, and I\u2019m running for president. I\u2019m a United States Senator from my great state of Vermont because I believe that, because I believe morally and ethically we do not have a right to turn our backs on children in Flint, Michigan who are being poisoned, or veterans who are sleeping out on the street.(APPLAUSE)(APPLAUSE)Look, my father\u2019s family was wiped out by Hitler in the Holocaust. I know about what crazy and radical, and extremist politics mean. I learned that lesson as a tiny, tiny child when my mother would take me shopping, and we would see people working in stores who had numbers on their arms because they were in Hitler\u2019s concentration camp.I am very proud of being Jewish, and that is an essential part of who I am as a human being.(APPLAUSE)I pray for the will of God to be known that we can know it and to the best of our limited ability, try to follow it and fulfill it. I have said many times that, you know, I am a praying person, and if I haven\u2019t been during the time I was in the White House, I would have become one. Because it\u2019s very hard to imagine living under that kind of pressure without being able to fall back on prayer and on my faith.So I do pray for people in authority. I try to think about what they are going through, even when I disagree with them. Trying to find some common ground, some common understanding that perhaps can make me more empathetic. I don\u2019t always succeed. I will tell you that.So I pray on a pretty regular basis during the day, because I need that strength and I need that support. And especially when you are in the position that I\u2019m in and that Senator Sanders is in, where you are asking people to vote for you, to give you the most important job, not only in our country, but I would argue in the world.I think humility is one of the most important attributes that you bring to both that seeking and then if you\u2019re fortunate enough, to that holding of office and that\u2019s what I will try to do.(APPLAUSE)But it\u2019s not just in Flint, Michigan. We are have 29 million people who have no health insurance. We\u2019re the only major country on earth that doesn\u2019t provide paid family and medical leave. We have school systems around America that are collapsing. And yet we are the wealthiest country in the history of the world. But most people don\u2019t know that because almost all of the new incoming wealth is going to the top one percent.I believe, and with all due respect to my good friend, Secretary Clinton, that it is too late for establishment politics and establishment economics. It is too late for a corrupt campaign finance system and super-PACs that raise enormous amounts of money from special interests.We need in this country a political revolution where ordinary people stand up and reclaim the government that men and women fought and died for. Thank you.(APPLAUSE)We have barriers to education. That\u2019s why I want to start early and provide debt-free tuition, and deal with student debt so it is no longer the burden that weighs down so many young Americans. And I do want to take on the barriers of systemic racism. I may not have experienced them, but I see the results every single day.So I\u2019m asking for your support in the primary here in Michigan on Tuesday. I\u2019m asking for it, and I will do whatever I can as the Democratic nominee to run a campaign you\u2019ll be proud of.I don\u2019t intend to get into the gutter with whoever they nominate, but instead to lift our sights, to set big goals, to make it clear that America\u2019s best days can be and are ahead of us.(APPLAUSE)I want to thank the candidates, the Democratic National Committee...(APPLAUSE)... our hosts here at the Flint Cultural Center, and most of all, the people of Flint. Just two days from now, it\u2019s another Super Tuesday, when Michigan and three other states have primaries. We\u2019ll have all-day coverage.On Wednesday we\u2019ll simulcast the next Democratic presidential debate. We\u2019ll air on CNN in English, and then on Univision in Spanish.

{"Headline": "Video Review: Lexus Adds a Few Twists to the New RX350", "Date": "2016-03-17", "News": "Supported byDrivenLuxury crossovers see little off-road duty, but they have helped automakers find the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow \u2014 none more so than Lexus, which invented the lucrative segment with the RX.Originally a spiffed-up version of the Japanese-market Toyota Harrier, Lexus strained to keep up with demand in the United States when the RX 300 made its debut in 1998. It has long been the brand\u2019s best seller. Cruise any upper-middle-class neighborhood and you would swear RXs are given as housewarming gifts.The RX\u2019s second and third generations were drawn with a genteel design language that Lexus called L-Finesse. The fourth iteration might be called L-Intense.Lexus knows its customers, and apparently they craved something much less staid. This angular design is a gutsy move considering RX helped build Lexus. One has to imagine that the Lexus crew was disappointed that the Nissan Murano\u2019s floating roof treatment hit the market first.Like Japanese kanji on wheels, the sheet metal is full of flourishes. Bold? Sure. Harmonic? Not so much. The two dynamics are not mutually exclusive; look at a Cadillac. That said, I predict current owners will simply trade in their old RXs for new ones. Lexus loyalty runs strong.Like its predecessors, the new RX is sold with a 3.5-liter V6 (the RX 350) and a hybrid powertrain (the RX 450h). The fourth generation is longer by nearly five inches; the cabin is a bit wider. The F Sport model tested has an even more aggressive look, adaptive suspension and bolstered sport seats. It does not buy extra power, though.The V6 produces 295 horsepower and 267 pound-feet of torque higher in the rev range. All-wheel-drive RX350s do the dash from 0 to 60 miles an hour in about 7.5 seconds. Available in front- and rear-wheel drive, the F Sport with its 8-speed transmission uses data from G-force sensors to know when to hold gear ratios while cornering.Lexus continues to improve in driving dynamics. Ride quality is on the firm side of comfortable; body roll is quelled. It\u2019s not a BMW M type of affair, but hey, Lexus owners don\u2019t tend to wring out their cars hard. The RX delivers a controlled and quiet dynamic, the kind that takes the edge off a long day of commuting, shopping and shuttling kids to lacrosse practice.With standard grade gas, the RX350\u2019s fuel economy is about par with the competition, rated by the federal government at 19 miles per gallon in the city and 26 on the highway. The Mercedes GLC is the efficiency champ, though it wants premium (and so does the RX450h hybrid, which averages 30 m.p.g.). Cheap gas won\u2019t be around forever.The interior is now stitched up with a more handcrafted look and an analog clock. F Sport abandons wood trim for metallic accouterments. Tech defines luxury these days, and the RX can be bought with blind-spot warning, radar-assisted cruise control and auto braking with pedestrian detection. The unique interface joystick is adjustable for sensitivity, though I find its operation awkward.There\u2019s good news in the back seat: The floor is flat, chairs slide fore and aft, and the backs fold 40/20/40 so four people can go skiing and keep their gear securely inside.Front-drive models start at $42,850 (my all-wheel-drive model was $58,575 as tested). The RX may have been the first luxury crossover, but the segment is now crowded. Lexus will soon learn if loyal buyers find the daring creases appealing or if its designers crossed the line.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Water Is Broken. Data Can Fix It.", "Date": "2016-03-17", "News": "Supported byOp-Ed ContributorAS a nation, we have become disciples of data. We interview 60,000 families a month to determine the unemployment rate, we monitor how much energy we use every seven days, Amazon ranks sales of every book it sells every hour.Then there is water.Water may be the most important item in our lives, our economy and our landscape about which we know the least. We not only don\u2019t tabulate our water use every hour or every day, we don\u2019t do it every month, or even every year.The 2010 report runs 64 pages of small type, reporting water use in each state by quality and quantity, by source, and by whether it\u2019s used on farms, in factories or in homes.It doesn\u2019t take four years to get five years of data. All we get every five years is one year of data.The data system is ridiculously primitive. It was an embarrassment even two decades ago. The vast gaps \u2014 we start out missing 80 percent of the picture \u2014 mean that from one side of the continent to the other, we\u2019re making decisions blindly.In the time it took to compile the 2010 report, Texas endured a four-year drought. California settled into what has become a five-year drought. The most authoritative water-use data from across the West couldn\u2019t be less helpful: It\u2019s from the year before the droughts began.In the last year of the Obama presidency, the administration has decided to grab hold of this country\u2019s water problems, water policy and water innovation. Next Tuesday, the White House is hosting a Water Summit, where it promises to unveil new ideas to galvanize the sleepy world of water.The question White House officials are asking is simple: What could the federal government do that wouldn\u2019t cost much but that would change how we think about water?The best and simplest answer: Fix water data.More than any other single step, modernizing water data would unleash an era of water innovation unlike anything in a century.That\u2019s exactly the state of water \u2014 we\u2019ve got crises percolating all over, but lack the data necessary to make smart policy decisions.Congress and President Obama should pass updated legislation creating inside the United States Geological Survey a vigorous water data agency with the explicit charge to gather and quickly release water data of every kind \u2014 what utilities provide, what fracking companies and strawberry growers use, what comes from rivers and reservoirs, the state of aquifers.Good information does three things.First, it creates the demand for more good information. Once you know what you can know, you want to know more.Second, good data changes behavior. The real-time miles-per-gallon gauges in our cars are a great example. Who doesn\u2019t want to edge the M.P.G. number a little higher? Any company, community or family that starts measuring how much water it uses immediately sees ways to use less.Finally, data ignites innovation. Who imagined that when most everyone started carrying a smartphone, we\u2019d have instant, nationwide traffic data? The phones make the traffic data possible, and they also deliver it to us.The truth is, we don\u2019t have any idea what detailed water use data for the United States will reveal. But we can be certain it will create an era of water transformation. If we had monthly data on three big water users \u2014 power plants, farmers and water utilities \u2014 we\u2019d instantly see which communities use water well, and which ones don\u2019t.We\u2019d see whether tomato farmers in California or Florida do a better job. We\u2019d have the information to make smart decisions about conservation, about innovation and about investing in new kinds of water systems.Water\u2019s biggest problem, in this country and around the world, is its invisibility. You don\u2019t tackle problems that are out of sight. We need a new relationship with water, and that has to start with understanding it.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "American Hotels, Led by Starwood, Begin Descent Into Cuba", "Date": "2016-03-22", "News": "Supported byUpdateDreary hotel rooms with no hot water. Or no hotel room at all. While Cuba has many lures, the quality and even availability of its accommodations are not among them.Now, though, the re-entry of major American hospitality chains into Cuba\u2019s overstretched hotel market could alter the landscape, adding competition to an industry dominated by Cuban state tourism companies and their European partners.\u201cFor the industry, it\u2019s a game changer,\u201d Mr. Lubbers said. American hotels were not necessarily better, he said, but catered to American expectations, which include bigger bedrooms and wider beds. Americans would be drawn to brands they knew from home, he said.Between having American hotels in Cuba and new rules that make it much easier for Americans to travel without organized groups, \u201cthings become more normal,\u201d Mr. Lubbers said.The deals to run the Hotel Inglaterra and Hotel Quinta Avenida, which Starwood plans to refurbish, will take a little pressure off a hotel sector that tourism operators said has been \u201coverwhelmed\u201d by the surge in bookings to Cuba since the United States announced a d\u00e9tente with the island in December 2014.But Havana has only a half dozen properties that meet international five-star standards, and many more deals like the Starwood one are necessary if the hotel sector is to meet surging demand from visitors, tour operators said.As hundreds of Americans traveling as part of President Obama\u2019s entourage arrived in Havana this week, hundreds of visitors were packed off to stay in hotels in Varadero, a beach resort 90 minutes away, tour operators said. Lucy Davies, founder of Cubania Travel, said that her organization stopped taking bookings for the first half of 2016 in October last year because they could not guarantee hotel rooms.Bob Guild, a vice president for Marazul, which offers travel services to North American travelers visiting Cuba, said Havana would need to at least double the number of high-quality hotel rooms in the next few years.That could be done through deals like Starwood\u2019s, to refurbish and manage existing properties. The Cuban tourism ministry also has plans for a big five- or six-star hotel on the Parque Central near Old Havana, which is home to several of the city\u2019s top hotels, and is developing properties to run as boutique outfits, he said.These hotels, however, \u201cwill sell out instantly,\u201d Mr. Guild said. The number of American travelers who booked through Marazul in 2015 \u2014 excluding Cubans and Cuban-Americans going to visit family \u2014 rose 67 percent.In addition, said Mr. Guild, the city needs \u201cclean economy hotels\u201d to accommodate student groups and other American travelers who cannot afford top rates. Many hotels start the season in decent shape, he said, but deteriorate as visitors arrive back-to-back and the staff is unable to keep up with maintenance.How quickly the Cuban state-run tourism companies would develop new hotel infrastructure was unclear, travel agents said. Cuban officials may be wary that the next president will reverse recent changes and clamp down on travel to the island.Mr. Guild said United States elections may be \u201ca factor for them and whether it is worth making these investments.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Hillary Clinton Stops Apologizing and Starts to Sprint", "Date": "2016-03-13", "News": "HIGHLAND HILLS, Ohio \u2014  Hillary Clinton began the final sprint to Tuesday\u00e2\u0080\u0099s nominating contests in five states with a visit to church here on Sunday. She had spent the previous few days apologizing for wrongly saying that Nancy Reagan had \u00e2\u0080\u009cstarted a national conversation\u00e2\u0080\u009d about HIV/AIDS during the administration of her husband, President Ronald Reagan. At the Mount Zion Fellowship, a predominantly African-American church outside Cleveland, Mrs. Clinton stressed her resilience to congregants on Sunday by sharing a favorite saying of Eleanor Roosevelt. \u00e2\u0080\u009cA woman is like a tea bag,\u201d Mrs. Clinton said. \u201cYou don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know how strong she is until she gets into hot water.\u00e2\u0080\u009dThe church\u2019s followers represented a key constituency for Mrs. Clinton as she seeks to shore up support among minority voters ahead of Tuesday\u00e2\u0080\u0099s contests, hoping her strength among African-Americans can counter inroads Senator Bernie Sanders has made with young voters and working-class whites.Clinton aides predict tight races in the Midwestern states where economically struggling voters have gravitated to the populist pitch of Mr. Sanders. But even if she loses in the Rust Belt, they see tremendous upside in Florida and North Carolina, where black, Latino and older voters are expected on Tuesday to give Mrs. Clinton a healthy edge in the race for delegates.\u00e2\u0080\u009cEven if he won in Ohio, Michigan, Illinois,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Robby Mook, Mrs. Clinton\u2019s campaign manager, said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe would still have more delegates on the 15th because of their performance in delegate-rich Florida and North Carolina.\u201dOn Monday, Mrs. Clinton will campaign in Chicago and Springfield, Ill., followed by a get-out-the-vote rally in Charlotte, N.C.  As Mr. Sanders runs ads attacking Mrs. Clinton\u00e2\u0080\u0099s positions on global trade deals that many voters blame for widespread job losses, Mrs. Clinton has emphasized her proposals to bring jobs back to the United States and has criticized Mr. Sanders for not presenting specific plans to do the same.Speaking to a crowd of about 500 people at M7 Technologies, a factory in Youngstown, Ohio, on Saturday night, Mrs. Clinton vowed to end steel dumping by China and other nations, a factor that had hit the economy in the state\u2019s Mahoning Valley area. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI have always been committed to bringing back manufacturing,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m the only candidate, on either side, who actually has a plan to do that.\u00e2\u0080\u009dOn Sunday afternoon, Mrs. Clinton stopped in at the 8 Sisters Bakery in Marion, Ohio. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI really want to have a conversation,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she told a dozen potential voters seated at wooden tables near a display of pastries.\u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099m very interested in hearing from each of you about your lives,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mrs. Clinton said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat you think is working, your challenges, how the economy is going or not going, what needs to be done to create more opportunities in Marion and around it.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\t\tFirst Draft provides fast-paced and comprehensive coverage of politics and elections by The New York Times.

{"Headline": "How the Candidates Fared in Georgia, Massachusetts, Texas and Virginia", "Date": "2016-03-02", "News": "Supported byMr. Reed\u2019s assessment was prescient, and Mrs. Clinton picked up a commanding victory in a state whose 102 delegates made it one of Super Tuesday\u2019s most valuable.The outcome in Georgia, especially in predominantly black areas, was a disappointment for Senator Bernie Sanders, who appeared at Morehouse College, which is historically black, last month.Mrs. Clinton\u2019s widely expected victory was a reversal of her electoral fortunes in Georgia in 2008, when she lost to Barack Obama by 35 percentage points statewide and faltered in most counties in metropolitan Atlanta.But on Tuesday, news organizations projected Mrs. Clinton\u2019s victory as soon as the polls closed. She was expected to win by significant margins in the state\u2019s most populous counties, some of which are traditional Democratic strongholds in general elections.It was all too much for Mr. Sanders, who struggled to win the support of many African-American voters here. Exit polling indicated that at least eight in 10 black voters cast their ballots for Mrs. ClintonMr. Trump\u2019s victory was projected by The Associated Press soon after voting ended on Tuesday, one day after he appeared at an enormous rally in Valdosta, near the Florida border. The outcome of the scramble to be the runner-up was far less clear.Although exit polls showed that Mr. Trump performed well among evangelical voters, a vast voting bloc in Republican politics in Georgia, he also captured the support of half of voters who said that a candidate\u2019s religion did not matter.Mr. Trump may have benefited from decisions by some of the state\u2019s leading Republicans not to endorse a candidate, but his support appeared widespread and, according to some polling, might have grown in the final days.Mr. Cruz and Mr. Rubio made late efforts in Georgia to cut into Mr. Trump\u2019s support, and each other\u2019s. Mr. Cruz made a pair of stops here on Saturday, while Mr. Rubio returned twice in three days.Mr. Rubio\u2019s schedule showed a clearer play for voters in vote-rich metro Atlanta, but Mr. Cruz seemed to seek a broader blend of suburban and rural support.Massachusetts was perceived as a must-win for Mr. Sanders: If he could not win a progressive Northeast state that had half a million college students and bordered his home state of Vermont, his viability elsewhere would be seriously questioned. And so he poured in resources here, visited twice in the last week and matched the Clinton ground game.But Mrs. Clinton had a lot going for her in Massachusetts, which has 116 delegates. She won the state in 2008 against Barack Obama by 16 percentage points. She had widespread institutional backing from Democratic officials, including the mayor of Boston, Martin J. Walsh. She raised more than $4 million from residents, almost three times as much as Mr. Sanders. And she significantly increased her television spending in the last week, though he still outspent her by more than two to one.Mr. Sanders did win over voters under 30 by nearly two to one, according to exit polls by Edison Research. But Mrs. Clinton did better among older voters, and led by double digits among those 30 to 44. Among voters with family incomes below $100,000, Mr. Sanders topped Mrs. Clinton by about 10 percentage points; among those with family incomes above that threshold, Mrs. Clinton won by about 20 points.Nearly 20,000 Massachusetts voters dropped out of the Democratic Party in recent weeks and changed their affiliation to Republican \u2014 most likely to vote for Mr. Trump, according to Secretary of State William Galvin, a Democrat. Unenrolled voters can vote in either primary.Mr. Galvin said in an interview that he had seen such shifts in previous primaries, including in 2000, when Democrats switched parties to vote for Senator John McCain. But, he said, the movement this year was the most he has seen in such a short time frame. \u201cIt\u2019s clearly all Trump-related,\u201d he said.The state has plenty of angry white, working-class voters who were drawn to Mr. Trump, much as they were drawn to Scott Brown in his successful Senate race in 2010.Mr. Trump dominated nearly every demographic group, losing only among voters with postgraduate degrees, who supported Senator Marco Rubio, according to exit polls by Edison Research.Mr. Trump\u2019s several visits to the state and outspoken admiration for the Patriots quarterback Tom Brady probably did not hurt, nor did Mr. Brady\u2019s reciprocal support.Mrs. Clinton defeated Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, whose strength with Hispanic voters in the Nevada caucuses had worried the Clinton campaign.Mrs. Clinton\u2019s share of Texas\u2019 252 delegates, more than twice the number at stake in any other Democratic race on Tuesday, should widen a gap that is increasingly difficult mathematically for Mr. Sanders to bridge.The victory was expected after Mrs. Clinton had led in Texas polls by double digits before Tuesday. Mr. Sanders rarely campaigned in the state in recent days, instead focusing on states outside the South where Democratic turnout is not as heavily Hispanic and African-American.About three in 10 voters were Hispanic, according to exit polls by Edison Research, and about two-thirds of them supported Mrs. Clinton. Hispanics accounted for about one in three registered Democrats in Texas in 2012, and they participated in the 2014 midterm elections at a higher rate than blacks, according to exit polls.Eight in 10 black voters supported her, according to the exit polls taken Tuesday.Two in three Texas Republicans said in exit polls by Edison Research that they would be satisfied with Mr. Cruz as the nominee, compared with fewer than half who would be satisfied with Mr. Trump.Hispanics represented about 10 percent of voters,and almost a third of them supported Mr. Cruz. No candidate won a higher share of their votes. Voters were split over whether illegal immigrants should have a path to legal status or should be deported.Mr. Cruz, who won his Senate seat in 2012 as an uncompromising outsider, ended up retreating to Texas \u2014 where 155 delegates were at stake, the most of any state voting on Tuesday \u2014 as if it were his own personal Alamo. On Monday, he held rallies in Dallas, San Antonio and Houston, assuring supporters, \u201cWe\u2019re going to have a very good Super Tuesday.\u201dAnd despite leading a government shutdown in 2013, Mr. Cruz lost the anti-establishment mantle to Mr. Trump.Mrs. Clinton\u2019s win appeared attributable, in large part, to Democratic voters in favor of the status quo. Six in 10 voters said the next president should generally continue President Obama\u2019s policies, and these voters overwhelmingly supported Mrs. Clinton, according to exit polls conducted by Edison Research.Another important demographic in Mrs. Clinton\u2019s win appeared to be blacks, who accounted for about a quarter of Democratic primary voters in the state, according to exit polls. More than eight in 10 of them supported Mrs. Clinton, who also won a majority of white voters.The top issue to Democratic primary voters in Virginia was the economy, and the candidate quality most important to voters was experience. Mrs. Clinton won the support of two-thirds of voters who cited the economy, and more than nine in 10 voters who prioritized experience.Even as she led in polls, Mrs. Clinton campaigned Monday in Virginia, where 110 delegates were at stake.Voters who supported Mr. Trump appeared to strike a sharp contrast with those who backed Mr. Rubio, according to exit polls conducted by Edison Research.Mr. Trump won among men, lower-income and less-educated voters, conservatives, veterans, evangelicals and those who preferred a government outsider. Mr. Rubio seemed to take a larger share of women, while winning among well-educated and higher-income voters, and those who favored political experience.Mr. Trump led with 35 percent of the vote, with 93 percent of precincts reporting. Mr. Rubio was second, with 32 percent, having pulled in a larger share of votes in suburban areas near Washington like Fairfax County.What appeared to make it a narrower race was Mr. Rubio\u2019s broad appeal. A majority of voters said they would be satisfied with Mr. Rubio as the nominee, while only about four in 10 said they would be satisfied with either Mr. Trump or Senator Ted Cruz. About three in 10 voters leaving Republican primary sites identified as independents, exit polls showed.Back in November, Mr. Trump was the first of the Republican candidates to submit signatures for the primary in Virginia, where there were 49 delegates at stake, awarded proportionately.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Why Therapists Should Talk Politics", "Date": "2016-03-15", "News": "\u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099m meeting my boss later,\u00e2\u0080\u009d my patient said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099m worried she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s going to tell me I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not pulling my weight, and that I should volunteer to work more hours to show my commitment.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat am I supposed to tell my children?\u00e2\u0080\u009d she asked, breaking down.Typically, therapists avoid discussing social and political issues in sessions. If the patient raises them, the therapist will direct the conversation toward a discussion of symptoms, coping skills, the relevant issues in a patient\u00e2\u0080\u0099s childhood and family life. But I am growing more and more convinced that this is inadequate. Psychotherapy, as a field, is not prepared to respond to the major social issues affecting our patients\u00e2\u0080\u0099 lives. When people can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t live up to the increasingly taxing demands of the economy, they often blame themselves and then struggle to live with the guilt. You see this same tendency, of course, in a variety of contexts, from children of divorce who feel responsible for their parents\u00e2\u0080\u0099 separation to the \u00e2\u0080\u009csurvivor guilt\u00e2\u0080\u009d of those who live through disasters. In situations that may seem impossible or unacceptable, guilt becomes a shield for the anger you otherwise would feel: The child may be angry with her parents for divorcing, the survivor may be angry with those who perished.This is no different at the social level. When an economic system or government is responsible for personal harm, those affected can feel profoundly helpless, and cover that helplessness with self-criticism. Today, if you can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t become what the market wants, it can feel as if you are flawed and have no recourse except to be depressed.Over the last 30 years, I believe, these changes in the workplace have been slowly taking a psychological toll, though in a more diffuse, less detectable way than with any one traumatic event. To a degree that they may not be aware of, people feel less hope and more stress; their self-regard is damaged; they believe they are fated to take what they can get; they exist in a state approaching learned helplessness.There comes a time when people can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t take it anymore, when too much is being demanded of them. How much blame can people tolerate directing at themselves? When do they turn it outward?My sense is that psychotherapists are playing a significant role in directing this blame inward. Unfortunately, many therapists, because they have been trained not to discuss political issues in the consulting room, are part of the problem, implicitly reinforcing false assumptions about personal responsibility, isolation and the social status quo.If the patient describes a nearly unbearable work situation, the therapist will tend to focus on the nature of the patient\u00e2\u0080\u0099s response to the situation, implicitly treating the situation itself as unchangeable, a fact of life. But an untenable or unjust environment is not always just a fact of life, and therapists need to consider how to talk about that explicitly. This is, in ways, an old quandary in psychotherapy. Should therapy strive to help a patient adjust, or to help prepare him to change the world around him? Is the patient\u00e2\u0080\u0099s internal world skewed? Or is it the so-called real world that has gone awry? Usually, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s some combination of the two, and a good psychotherapist, I think, will help the patient navigate between those two extremes.Too often, when the world is messed up for political reasons, therapists are silent. Instead, the therapist should acknowledge that fact, be supportive of the patient, and discuss the problem. It is inherently therapeutic to help a person understand the injustice of his predicament, reflect on the question of his own agency, and take whatever action he sees fit. When I am in this situation with a patient, I will introduce into our dialogue the idea that what is happening is unfair. This opens an opportunity for us to explore how my patient reacts to the notion that he is being mistreated, which can be revelatory and vital to the therapy.I once had a patient who had reached a breaking point with the situation in the startup where she was employed. In her therapy, she had been struggling for two years with the idea that it was possible to have authentic communication in relationships. Our therapy helped her hone her anger into a courageous, well-considered and pointed group email that resulted in nearly half of her co-workers supporting her and prompting direct labor negotiations with the chief executive. The supportive role therapy plays in such events may strike some people more as social work or organizing than as mental health treatment. But that would be wrong. Therapists need to consider such political interaction in the consulting room as inherent to the therapeutic process. Patients become motivated to change the world around them as a solution to what had become internal stressors. This is an experience of not just of external but internal change, bringing new confidence and a sense of engagement that becomes a part of the patient\u2019s character.You would be surprised how seldom it occurs to people that their problems are not their fault. By focusing on fairness and justice, a patient may have a chance to find what has so frequently been lost: an ability to care for and stand up for herself. Guilt can be replaced with a clarifying anger, one that liberates a desire \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and a demand \u00e2\u0080\u0094 to thrive, to turn outward toward others rather than inward, one that draws her forward to make change.More From Fixes \u00bbMore From Private Lives \u00bbMore From Couch \u00bbMore From The Stone \u00bbMore From Moviegoers \u00bbMore From The End \u00bbMore From Draft \u00bbMore From Anxiety \u00bbMore From Menagerie \u00bbMore From Disunion \u00bbMore From Bedside \u00bbMore From The Conversation \u00bbMore From The Great Divide \u00bbMore From Errol Morris \u00bbFollowAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "George Osborne Warns of Brexit Risks and Cuts Growth Forecasts", "Date": "2016-03-16", "News": "Supported byLONDON \u2014 In a budget meant to appeal to voters before a looming referendum, Britain\u2019s chancellor of the Exchequer, George Osborne, on Wednesday mainly offered tax breaks, while warning the public against the risks of opting to quit the European Union.Despite a worsening economic outlook and a downward revision of growth forecasts, Mr. Osborne postponed billions of pounds of further reductions in public spending that he would need to keep his budget plans on track, while offering some significant tax cuts for individuals and businesses.The most controversial item was a new tax on sugary soft drinks, a measure meant to combat childhood obesity. The leader of a soft-drink industry trade group dismissed the tax as \u201cabsurd.\u201dOver all, though, Mr. Osborne\u2019s budget statement seemed intended to avoid antagonizing key groups of voters before the June 23 referendum on whether Britain should remain in the 28-nation European Union or leave it in a so-called Brexit.Mr. Osborne, who like Prime Minister David Cameron, favors staying in the European Union, warned of economic instability if Britain votes for Brexit.\u201cBritain will be stronger, safer and better off inside a reformed European Union,\u201d Mr. Osborne said in Parliament, adding that \u201cwe should not put at risk all the hard work that the British people have done to make our country strong again.\u201dHe added that turbulent financial markets, low productivity in Western nations and a weak outlook for the global economy made for \u201ca dangerous cocktail of risks.\u201dThe budget is expected to be approved by Parliament, coming as it does from the treasury chief of the controlling Conservative Party.The most unexpected initiative was the sugar tax on the soft-drink industry. This would apply, starting in April 2018, to drinks with a total sugar content above 5 grams per 100 milliliters, with a higher rate for beverages with more than 8 grams per 100 milliliters. Milk-based drinks and fruit juices would be exempt.\u201cFive-year-old children are consuming their body weight in sugar every year,\u201d Mr. Osborne told lawmakers, adding that \u201cone of the biggest contributors to childhood obesity is sugary drinks.\u201dThe plan to target soft drinks, but not other products with a high sugar content, was derided as \u201csimply absurd\u201d by Gavin Partington, director general of the British Soft Drinks Association, which says it represents a range of British manufacturers, importers and suppliers.\u201cWe are extremely disappointed by the government\u2019s decision to hit the only category in the food and drink sector which has consistently reduced sugar intake in recent years \u2014 down 13.6 percent since 2012,\u201d Mr. Partington said in a statement.Mr. Osborne\u2019s budget also announced moves to close tax loopholes, including one in which foreign suppliers use sites like eBay and Amazon to sell goods without paying Britain\u2019s sales tax, known as the value added tax.Britain\u2019s economic picture has worsened in recent months. Official growth forecasts for 2016 were revised downward on Wednesday, to 2 percent, compared with the 2.4 percent predicted earlier.The revised projections are based on the assumption that Britain stays in the European Union. The Office for Budget Responsibility, whose job it is to provide an independent analysis of public finances, had warned of \u201can extended period of uncertainty\u201d about Britain\u2019s relationship with the bloc if there was a vote to leave, Mr. Osborne said. That comment prompted protests from opponents of European Union membership that Mr. Osborne had quoted selectively from the report.Despite slower than expected growth, corporate tax rates will be cut to 17 percent by 2020.The amount that people can earn without paying taxes will rise, as will the earnings threshold that they need to cross before moving into a higher tax bracket.There were also tax concessions for the struggling North Sea oil and gas industry and a freeze on taxes on fuel and many types of alcohol. The capital gains tax would be cut to 20 percent, from 28 percent.Mr. Osborne missed one objective by failing to ensure that government debt would fall this year as a proportion of the country\u2019s gross domestic product.Jeremy Corbyn, leader of the opposition Labour Party, said on Wednesday that the budget had \u201cunfairness at its very core\u201d and that Mr. Osborne had \u201cfailed on the budget deficit, failed on debt, failed on investment, failed on productivity, failed on the trade deficit.\u201dPostponing further public spending cuts of 3.5 billion pounds, or $4.9 billion, until the fiscal period 2019-2020, Mr. Osborne remains on track to hit his target of a surplus by the end of the decade.But in aiming to meet this objective \u201cwithout squeezing the economy harder now, Mr. Osborne has backloaded the fiscal pain,\u201d Ian Stewart, chief economist at Deloitte, the business advisory firm, said in a statement. As a result, Mr. Stewart said, the government would need to find spending cuts of \u00a38 billion in 2019-20.\u201cMr. Osborne is hoping that, in the run-up to the next general election, the U.K. will be better placed to cope with the squeeze needed to wipe out the deficit,\u2019\u2019 Mr. Stewart said.\u201cHitting the government\u2019s most important and most cherished fiscal target,\u201d he added, \u201cwill need hard slog and luck.\u201dAn earlier version of the headline for this article misspelled the surname of Britain\u2019s chancellor of the Exchequer. As the article correctly notes, he is George Osborne, not Osbourne.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "What You Missed in the Debate", "Date": "2016-03-10", "News": "Supported by_______MIAMI \u2014 The four candidates still battling for the Republican nomination for president gathered at the University of Miami for the party\u2019s 12th debate, hosted by CNN. Donald J. Trump leads in both delegates and states won, with Gov. John Kasich\u2019s home state, Ohio, and Senator Marco Rubio\u2019s home state, Florida, both heading to the polls on Tuesday.\u2022 In a surprise twist, the first question, on jobs and the economy, goes to Mr. Kasich. Asked by Jake Tapper, the debate moderator, if his advocacy for trade deals had come at the \u201cexpense of the middle class,\u201d Mr. Kasich cited his blue-collar background \u2014 his father was a mailman and his family worked in the steel industry \u2014 and said he believes in \u201cfree trade, but fair trade.\u201d\u2022 Mr. Rubio \u2014 who supports increasing the number of H-1B visas for high-skilled workers \u2014 was asked about the case of Disney, which used a loophole in the program to lay off American workers and replace them with foreign workers. Companies like Disney that abuse the program, he said, \u201cshould be barred from using it in the future.\u201d\u2022 On the question of visas for high-skilled workers, Mr. Trump seemed to try to have it both ways. As a businessman, he said, he uses the program and \u201cI do what I have to do.\u201d But, he added, it\u2019s \u201cunfair\u201d for workers \u2014 \u201cAnd we should end it.\u201d\u2022 Senator Ted Cruz of Texas used the H-1B question to switch to the issue of illegal immigration, a hot topic for the Republican base. He said he would cut federal funds to \u201csanctuary cities\u201d that don\u2019t follow the nation\u2019s immigration laws. And, he added, Democrats don\u2019t have the political will to fix the nation\u2019s broken immigration system, because they \u201cview those illegal immigrants as potential voters.\u201d\u2022 \u201cFirst of all, Ted was in favor of amnesty,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cThere\u2019s no question about that.\u201d In any other debate, those would have been fighting words. But none of the candidates have really had a highly heated exchange yet. As Mr. Trump himself said, just moments later, \u201cI cannot believe how civil it\u2019s been up here.\u201d\u2022 Mr. Cruz and Mr. Trump did get into a brief back-and-forth over Mr. Trump\u2019s threat to impose a 45 percent tariff on foreign goods. Mr. Trump called it a \u201cthreat\u201d that would become a tax only if foreign countries, like China, \u201cdon\u2019t behave.\u201d Mr. Cruz countered that \u201cit\u2019s not China who pays the tax,\u201d but the \u201cworking men and women\u201d here in the United States.Not so, Mr. Trump argued, explaining that he would \u201cstart building those factories and those plants here instead of China,\u201d thus creating more jobs. And then it was time for a commercial break.\u201cI\u2019m not interested in being politically correct \u2014 I\u2019m interested in being correct,\u201d Mr. Rubio retorted, saying the nation would need to work with Muslim countries to help defeat radical extremism. Mr. Kasich, similarly, said that the United States would need Muslim and Arab countries to fight the Islamic State.\u2022 On an issue that has dogged Mr. Trump in recent weeks \u2014 his calls for violating international law and targeting the families of suspected terrorists \u2014 the New York billionaire called on existing laws to be expanded in order to fight terrorists on \u201cequal footing.\u201d Both Mr. Cruz and Mr. Rubio, meanwhile, quickly and firmly said they would not target the families of terrorists.\u2022 Mr. Trump said that he would be a strong supporter of Israel, citing a somewhat unlikely list of credentials: his Jewish son-in-law, his daughter Ivanka who converted to Judaism, and his Jewish grandchildren. He also mentioned that he had served as the grand marshal of the Israeli Day Parade down Fifth Avenue.He also added that a peace deal between the Israelis and the Palestinians would be a tough negotiation. But, he said, \u201cI\u2019d like to give it a shot.\u201d\u2022 Asked about his comments seeming to praise authoritarian governments \u2014 calling both President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia and China\u2019s government during the Tiananmen Square massacre \u201cstrong\u201d \u2014 Mr. Trump said that \u201cstrong doesn\u2019t mean good,\u201d adding that he was not endorsing the massacre.\u201cPutin is a strong leader, absolutely,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t say that in a good way or a bad way. I say that as a fact.\u201d Mr. Kasich, asked a follow-up question, was swift in his rebuke: \u201cI think the Chinese government butchered those kids,\u201d he said.\u201cI hope not, I truly hope not,\u201d Mr. Trump said. But, he said, when his supporters see protesters, when \u201cthey see what\u2019s going on in this country, they have anger that\u2019s unbelievable.\u201d And, he added, \u201cWe have some protesters who are bad dudes\u201d and are \u201creally dangerous.\u201d\u2022 \u201cThere are only two of us who have a path to winning the nomination \u2014 Donald and myself,\u201d Mr. Cruz said, responding to a question about the possibility of a brokered convention, and noting that he has finished ahead of Mr. Trump in eight states. He then appealed to voters, saying that if Mr. Trump is the nominee, Hillary Clinton will win in November and urging, \u201cCome and join us.\u201dBut Mr. Trump also returned to the numbers. What Mr. Cruz doesn\u2019t mention, he said, is that he has actually beaten Mr. Cruz far more frequently \u2014 in 13 states.The New York Times will be checking assertions made throughout the 2016 presidential campaign.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Scenes From Palmyra Indicate ISIS Slowed Assault on Treasures", "Date": "2016-03-28", "News": "Supported byCAIRO \u2014 As photographs and video footage emerged on Monday from the ancient Syrian city of Palmyra, antiquities experts were relieved and horrified at what Islamic State militants had wrought in the months they had controlled the city.A day after Syrian government troops retook control of the city, the most hopeful appraisal came from Maamoun Abdulkarim, Syria\u2019s antiquities director, who said 80 percent of the Unesco World Heritage site that encompasses the 2,000-year-old ruins remained intact. He said that the militants appeared to have deliberately slowed their assault on the ruins, fearing that they would stir a revolt among the local population.But archaeologists abroad expressed shock at the damage inside the Palmyra Museum, where Syrian state television showed shattered statues and other artifacts torn from their mountings and damage apparently caused by shelling.The damage to the museum was \u201csevere,\u201d said Michael D. Danti, a professor of archaeology at Boston University. \u201cThe release of video and photography of some of the galleries shows substantial damage to the buildings,\u201d he wrote in an email message, adding that there was evidence that the Islamic State had \u201ccarried out acts of deliberate destruction of sculptures.\u201dSyrian government troops fully captured the city on Monday, after a three-week assault supported by Russian air power. The expulsion of the Islamic State, whose tenure in Palmyra was marked by public beheadings and the attacks on its heritage, prompted a sense of collective relief rare during Syria\u2019s five-year-plus war.In an episode that came to define the militant\u2019s occupation of the city \u2014 and their violent disdain for its residents and Palmyra\u2019s cultural legacy \u2014 the militants publicly executed Khalid al-Asaad, who had worked for decades as the city\u2019s head of antiquities, possibly because he refused to reveal the locations of ancient artifacts.The years of combat between the government and its opponents have killed more than 200,000 people and displaced more than half of Syria\u2019s population. Amid the carnage, many Syrians have continued working, often in vain, to protect the country\u2019s historical sites from heavy weapons and other threats, including looters.The worries for the ancient treasures in Palmyra, an oasis city in Syria\u2019s central desert, began even before the Islamic State captured the city in May. The Temple of Baal, one of the ancient city\u2019s best-preserved sites, had been damaged by mortar fire, and grave robbers had stolen artifacts from tombs.Within months of taking control of the city, Islamic State militants had destroyed the temple\u2019s primary building and other structures, as well as the nearby Temple of Baalshamin. In October, they destroyed decorative arches dating to the second century, built by the Romans.But in contrast to the gleeful videos the militants have released detailing their destruction of ancient artifacts in other places, they had made little attempt to publicize their actions in Palmyra. Mr. Abdulkarim said that in October, after the militants destroyed the arches, the Islamic State had begun to regard its campaign as potentially dangerous provocation to locals, for whom the ancient city was not just a treasure, but also a central pillar of the local economy.Mr. Abdulkarim, who works in Damascus, said he had pushed residents to warn the Islamic State to stop the destruction, delivering the message through employees of his ministry still working in Palmyra, as well as the family of Mr. Assad, the murdered antiquities head.\u201cI think Daesh understood very strongly that if they continued to destroy buildings, they would be attacked by the local community,\u201d he said, using an Arabic acronym for the Islamic State.Mr. Abdulkarim said that the damage to Palmyra\u2019s medieval citadel, including to a bridge and a wall, could be repaired within two years. Blocks from the triple arch are in good condition, and they can also be rebuilt, he said. The restoration of the two temples, along with funerary towers that had been destroyed, will take years, and will require support from Unesco, he said.Professor Danti, who is also a director of an initiative focused on documenting and protecting the cultural heritage of Northern Iraq and Syria, said that while the damage had been expected, it was \u201cboth severe and extensive with some monuments in better condition and some worse than expected.\u201dThe sculptures in the museum had suffered, \u201cbut most if not all can be reconstructed,\u201d he said. \u201cWe can say the same for Palmyra\u2019s major monuments, but debates over authenticity, priorities, and motivation will not be far behind,\u201d he said.An article on March 29 about an assessment of the damage done by the Islamic State to the ancient Syrian city of Palmyra referred incorrectly to the second-century triple arch ISIS destroyed. The arches were decorative, not triumphal, and therefore were not built by the Romans to celebrate their victory over the Persians. The errors also appeared in another article on March 29, as well as in a picture caption, about efforts to create three-dimensional digital models of Palmyra\u2019s threatened monuments in case the originals are damaged beyond repair, and the errors were repeated last Tuesday in a photo essay and in a caption by a Times photographer who visited Palmyra to document the destruction. The errors also appeared in an article and a picture caption on Oct. 6, 2015, about ISIS\u2019 destruction of the arches.Sarah Almukhtar contributed reporting from New York.Advertisement"}

Working in small groups, students will investigate one of five countries: China, India, Japan, Nigeria and Germany. As part of their research, they should answer these questions:As China ends its one child policy, some parents ponder the pros and cons of having a second child.In the late 1970s and early \u201980s, China\u2019s central government enacted a nationwide policy that forced families to have only one child. The country\u2019s birthrate quickly plunged, but what also dropped was the percentage of girls being born. Influenced by a cultural preference for boys, many families opted to illegally abort baby girls \u2014 or even commit infanticide \u2014 so their one child would be a boy. China recently revised its rule to limit families to two children. Today China faces the twin demographic challenges of a sizable imbalance in the number of boys and girls, and an aging population. Use the following articles to start your research about China\u2019s demographic challenges:2. IndiaIn only six years, India is forecast to pass China as the world\u2019s most populous country. Unlike China, India did not implement a strict population control program that limited the entire population\u2019s family planning choices. Instead, for decades it has relied on a program of mass sterilizations. In the 1970s the government faced protests because many of the sterilizations were forced. Today, millions of largely poor women are paid incentives to agree to undergo sterilizations.Now India is taking steps to modernize its family planning policies instead of relying on female sterilizations. The government has announced that it will make injectable contraceptives free of charge in government facilities, and that implanted contraceptives may follow.Use the following articles to start your research about India\u2019s demographic challenges:3. JapanJapan\u2019s population is shrinking. In just the last five years, the country lost almost a million people. With one of the lowest birthrates in the world and little immigration, Japan might continue to face persistent economic woes as the population continues to age. The government has tried to encourage women to have more children, but to little effect.

And, Nigeria is both included on that list and is the most populous country in Africa. In her article, Ms. Sengupta pointed out that Nigeria faces a serious youth bulge. In the United States, the median age is over 37; in Nigeria, it\u2019s just over 18. While the country is rich with oil, its middle class is growing and the population is quickly becoming more urban, large families are still highly valued in the culture and birth control has been slow to catch on.Recently the government has become alarmed, and officials have begun promoting smaller families and have made contraceptives free.

{"Headline": "The Right Wing\u2019s Casting Agency, and Its Agent", "Date": "2016-03-06", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Over the last year, the Lynde and Harry Bradley Foundation, a Milwaukee group that has financed decades of research into curbing the power of public sector unions, hired three new staff members: a fund-raiser, an administrative aide and a program officer.It enlisted a recruiting outfit called Talent Market, which helps staff free-market advocacy groups, think tanks and foundations. In two of those cases, the Bradley Foundation, whose efforts Gov. Scott Walker of Wisconsin drew on, hired candidates whom Talent Market\u2019s executive director, Claire Kittle Dixon, had recommended.\u201cShe has a personal knowledge of the conservative movement and lots and lots of contacts,\u201d said Michael W. Grebe, who is stepping down as the foundation\u2019s president this year. Such is the foundation\u2019s confidence in Ms. Kittle Dixon that it asked her to assist in finding Mr. Grebe\u2019s successor.Unlike many long-established job placement services on the right and the left, which devote most of their efforts to posting ads or advising job-seekers, Talent Market is essentially a full-time recruiting operation.In the case of the Bradley Foundation, Mr. Grebe said, Ms. Kittle Dixon was involved at every step, from writing the job description to unearthing candidates and encouraging them to apply. She is, in effect, the visible hand for those who worship the invisible hand.Libertarian groups and activists backed by deep-pocketed conservative donors have been successful in recent years in pushing beyond Washington into dozens of states. They have provided the intellectual and political muscle for elected officials who have rolled back regulations, cut taxes and tried to remake public education.Perhaps most significantly, they have helped pass anti-union legislation in once heavily unionized states and embarked on well-organized campaigns to discourage workers from paying union dues and fees in liberal bastions like Washington State.\u201cAt the state level, some of these so-called think tanks are beginning to do the real organizing work against unions,\u201d said Steve Rosenthal, a former A.F.L.-C.I.O. political director who now tracks the flow of conservative money into anti-union efforts.The strategy depends on a cadre of committed recruits, which is where Ms. Kittle Dixon and Talent Market come in. The firm\u2019s reason for being, according to its website, is to ensure that the \u201cfree-market nonprofit sector has the talent it needs to defend liberty.\u201dIn this vein, Talent Market says it has helped over 160 organizations find personnel since its founding in 2009, including prominent ones like the Cato Institute, the Competitive Enterprise Institute and the Charles Koch Foundation.But it has also been active among more obscure players, ensuring a level of quality control and ideological cohesion at free-market groups across the country. In many ways, Ms. Kittle Dixon is the casting director for the so-called liberty movement.Talent Market, he said, \u201chelps take a lot of the mystery out of hiring.\u201dAfter earning a master\u2019s degree in public policy from Georgetown, she worked on talent development at the Koch Foundation in suburban Virginia, where she ran an internship program along with a fellowship known as the Koch Associate Program. She later became research director of a free-market think tank in Ohio. She has crossed paths with hundreds of libertarian wonks and activists over the years and stayed in touch with many of them.\u201cShe is a known quantity, \u2018persona grata,\u2019 \u201d said Jonathan Rick, who runs a public relations firm and met Ms. Kittle Dixon when he interviewed for the Koch Associate Program in 2006.Job-matching networks that serve a particular ideological niche have been around since at least the 1980s, when the Heritage Foundation created what became a widely trafficked database of jobs with conservative organizations and politicians. Another group called the Leadership Institute has long hosted a job bank and advised young conservatives on how to find entry- to middle-level positions.The left has created a similar infrastructure, with a variety of email lists and message boards connecting activists and operatives with prospective employers. One, called JobsthatareLEFT, started in 2002 \u201cas a way to help a few unemployed campaign staffers seek lefty jobs,\u201d according to its Google group page. It says it has shared over 20,000 positions with 25,000 members since then.Another group, called Inclusv, has helped progressives of color land jobs.Paul Oyer, a labor economist at Stanford University\u2019s Graduate School of Business, said there are two characteristics that make niche matchmaking services successful: If the niche can claim a lot of members, and if not being in the niche is a \u201cdeal breaker\u201d for those who are in it.Talent Market gives every indication of serving such a niche. To upload a r\u00e9sum\u00e9 or sign up for the site\u2019s newsletter, a candidate must first answer three questions on \u201cthe best way to solve societal problems,\u201d \u201cthe proper function of government,\u201d and the prospect\u2019s \u201cview of how markets function.\u201d (Sample option: \u201cFree markets almost always lead to the most efficient allocation of resources.\u201d)Like most of the organizations it advises, Talent Market is a nonprofit. It charges clients no fee, subsisting instead on contributions from donors, foundations and other nonprofits.It appears to be a bargain. Talent Market received at least $120,000 a year from 2011 to 2013 from DonorsTrust, a so-called donor-advised fund provider that helps wealthy people contribute anonymously to free-market causes, according to Internal Revenue Service filings. Other conservative and free-market groups, like the State Policy Network and the Vernon K. Krieble Foundation, have contributed over the years.Clients say Talent Market excels at finding hard-to-attract fund-raising staff members and at time-consuming searches for senior officials. But its greatest value may be in connecting far-flung organizations with talent they might not otherwise find.\u201cWashington, D.C., is one giant high school campus \u2014 everybody knows each other,\u201d Mr. Caldara, the Denver activist, said. \u201cBut those of us fighting for limited government in the states are spread apart. Sometimes the best person for a job is not someone in our current state.\u201dMr. Caldara said his organization recently hired a fund-raiser from the Washington area whom Talent Market brought to its attention.By contrast, Sherry Ettleson, a full-time recruiter for progressive nonprofits who may be the closest counterpart of Ms. Kittle Dixon on the left, says her efforts focus almost entirely on Washington, New York and San Francisco. Ms. Ettleson says this is because she does not have connections outside those cities, and because the network of progressive think tanks and advocacy groups is not as well developed in other regions as it is on the right.\u201cThe left was slow to that game,\u201d she said.There is almost no corner of the country where Ms. Kittle Dixon has not dispatched conservative crusaders. Since late 2014, according to its monthly newsletter, Talent Market has placed people at the Freedom Foundation in Olympia, Wash.; the Beacon Center of Tennessee in Nashville; the James Madison Institute in Tallahassee, Fla.; and the Ashbrook Center in Ashland, Ohio.Until recently, Michael Schaus lived in Colorado, where he was a freelance writer and the host of a local talk-radio show. Last autumn, he contacted Ms. Kittle Dixon, who encouraged him to pursue his interests in the policy world.Ms. Kittle Dixon, he said, alerted him whenever she came across an opening that fit his ambitions and skills. After the first interview she brokered, Ms. Kittle Dixon contacted him again to see how it had gone and whether she could refine the search further.But in this case, it was unnecessary. The Nevada Policy Research Institute offered him a job as its communications director, and he accepted, attracted by the organization\u2019s focus on taxes and education reform. The whole process lasted roughly one month.\u201cShe was good at what she does,\u201d Mr. Schaus said. \u201cI love the job. I\u2019m doing the type of stuff I like.

{"Headline": "Three Rules of Kremlin Power", "Date": "2016-03-23", "News": "Supported byDon\u2019t be deceived by such expressions of humility. Many Russians view Mr. Putin as highly successful \u2014 and the president himself very much agrees. His approval rating has reached levels upward of 80 percent for nearly two years, and few, certainly none at a Kremlin event, are making a public case for redefining or even amending the notion of what constitutes a Moscow leader\u2019s success.Take the economy. Throughout the years of oil-driven growth, economic performance was a measure of \u201csuccess.\u201d No longer. Russian officials project that the economy will contract 1 percent to 1.5 percent this year, provided oil prices stay within the $35-$40 range per barrel, after having shrunk 3.7 percent in 2015. Growth isn\u2019t expected to arrive until 2017 \u2014 and only if the price of oil averages $52 or more a barrel, by no means a certainty.The news gets worse. Real incomes are falling for the second year now. The country\u2019s infrastructure is in terrible shape, while investment is going down for the fourth year in a row. People are losing jobs and Russia is losing talent. But even if some people recognize these things as failures, they are not generally viewed as Mr. Putin\u2019s responsibility. The outcomes may be unpopular but the decisions that caused them are not.His use of the phrase \u201cdizzy with success\u201d may help explain why.Every Russian knows the slogan: It was the headline of an article written by Joseph Stalin in 1930 for the newspaper Pravda, his messenger of choice. Stalin wrote \u201cDizzy With Success\u201d at the height of his campaign to turn Soviet farmers into an agricultural proletariat. In less than a year tens of millions of peasants were bayoneted into joining new collective farms. Those who resisted were arrested or exiled. In the year that Stalin was writing about success, more than three million peasants were in revolt. Millions died as a result of deportations or famine. The country\u2019s agricultural economy never fully recovered, but the leader at the top remained popular. Even today Stalin enjoys a staunch \u2014 although by no means universal \u2014 following among my countrymen.Stalin was asserting that collectivization was a success except for isolated cases of overzealous bureaucracy. He took credit for establishing a socialized agriculture in just a few months and shifted blame for the many brutalities involved to local authorities and others. Many of those people were later arrested and punished.My point is not to draw a direct comparison between Stalin and Mr. Putin: They are very different leaders living in very different times. I just cannot help noticing that they seem to follow the same playbook for being a successful autocrat .Indeed, if there were a secret manual describing the Kremlin\u2019s art of governance, it would almost certainly include three rules that both men have mastered.Rule No. 1 calls for attributing all victories to oneself \u2014 regardless of who or what contributed to the perceived success. A victory in war won by the people at impossible cost has to be ascribed to the leader. Prosperity, even if a gift from Mother Nature or market forces, is an achievement of the ruler.Rule No. 2: Failures must be ascribed to subordinates or external forces. Stalin didn\u2019t invent this trick but he perfected it with brutal efficiency. He created disaster after disaster, but his associates and subjects just kept admiring, or at least fearing, him.Rule No. 3 is the ability to manipulate what used to be called the party line. One day Hitler is an enemy, the next a friend, then later an enemy once again. One day left-wing forces are the party\u2019s enemies, the next day its best friends.Mr. Putin has proved adept at all three. He took credit for the oil-driven economic boom (rule No. 1). Then when the economy tanked, he has allowed blame to be placed on his ministers, particularly Prime Minister Dmitri A. Medvedev, or pointed a finger at the West (rule No. 2).And he has changed the party line with dizzying agility (rule No. 3). One day Russia is a business-friendly economy, the next it is a statist power. One day Russia is busy integrating with the former Soviet republics, the next day it is fighting them. One day Russia proclaims sovereignty sacred, the next day it annexes Crimea, a neighboring country\u2019s territory. The next day it again proclaims sovereignty sacred, to justify propping up the beleaguered regime of President Bashar al -Assad in Syria.And this is the flip side of the myth of Putin leadership that in some quarters of Europe and even the United States, other would-be czars seek to emulate.Maxim Trudolyubov, editor at large for the business newspaper Vedomosti, writes The Russia File blog for the Kennan Institute and is a fellow at the Bosch Academy in Berlin.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Review: \u2018Ironbound\u2019 Stars Marin Ireland as a Struggling Immigrant", "Date": "2016-04-24", "News": "Supported byWe first meet Darja (Ms. Ireland) sitting at a lonely bus stop beneath a freeway in 2014. The play spans more than 20 years, moving back and forth in time, but the bus stop, where all the scenes are set, remains in place, looking as bleak as a bus stop can (which is pretty bleak). It\u2019s a winter night, and her boyfriend, Tommy (Morgan Spector), a letter carrier, is cajoling her to get into his car rather than wait for a bus that will still require her to walk through the dark streets of Newark to their apartment.Darja swats away his pleas with chilly contempt. She knows that Tommy has been having an affair with another woman \u2014 a woman for whom she cleans house. Darja demands to know how many times they slept together, although it turns out she has already done her homework by guessing his cellphone password. \u201cFourteen times it\u2019s not mistake,\u201d she says.\u201cFourteen times it\u2019s career,\u201d she adds with sour humor.The next scene takes place exactly 22 years before, and Darja is sharing the bus stop with her husband, Maks (the wonderfully tender Josiah Bania), another Polish immigrant. They flirt and kiss but have their own sources of tension. He hopes to move to Chicago to pursue his dream of becoming a blues musician. The pragmatic Darja, who at this point works two jobs \u2014 at a factory near the bus stop and cleaning one house \u2014 has already grown disillusioned about the promise of America. Another thing: She\u2019s pregnant.Ms. Majok\u2019s perceptive drama, with its bone-dry humor and vivid characters, illustrates how vulnerable people like Darja are, hostages to the vagaries of chance, unless they can manage to climb out of poverty. At times, Ms. Ireland positively vibrates with the force of will that keeps Darja moving ahead, even after the factory closes, and she has to turn to full-time housework. But no amount of tough talk, no thick carapace of cynicism, can insulate a woman in her position from the hardships of the world she has to negotiate.Although we never see him, we glean that Darja\u2019s second husband was abusive \u2014 from Tommy\u2019s scornful references to him and from a scene in which she is once again seated at the bus stop at night. This time, however, she\u2019s not heading to or from work but fleeing her husband\u2019s brutality. The bus stop at least provides the comfort of the familiar (grim and even dangerous though it is).This scene brings some welcome humor, as she\u2019s joined by the teenage Vic (a vibrantly funny Shiloh Fernandez), who\u2019s not exactly the tough street kid he appears to be \u2014 he works, willingly, as a male prostitute but also attends a fancy high school \u2014 and who offers her sympathetic advice.Ms. Ireland, a Tony nominee for \u201creasons to be pretty\u201d and something of a star in Off Broadway productions, never leaves the stage for the roughly 80-minute duration of \u201cIronbound\u201d (the title refers to a neighborhood in Newark), which has been directed with economy and delicacy by Daniella Topol. That\u2019s tough enough for an actor, but with her extensive background on the stage, I imagine it\u2019s the least of the challenges Ms. Ireland finds in the role.What\u2019s harder is softening the edges of a character who is, at times, her own worst enemy. When she\u2019s in combative mode, as she often is when sparring with Tommy, Darja has a take-no-prisoners tone that rebuffs sympathy even when she needs it most. But she must also put aside her pride and ingratiate herself, even accepting a gift of money from Vic after initially refusing it outright.Ms. Ireland moves between Darja\u2019s mercurial moods with a fluidity that makes us sense the calculations behind them, the ever-present sense that she is continually forced to make compromises to keep herself afloat. She also makes achingly clear how deeply Darja loves and misses her son, for whom she will do just about anything, although she\u2019s bound by circumstances that repeatedly thwart her.When, in an early scene, Maks insists that money isn\u2019t everything, that \u201cwhat\u2019s most important in this life is this thing you have what no one can take from you,\u201d Darja listens blankly. Then she glumly retorts, with a knowledge born of hard experience, \u201cI can\u2019t think what\u2019s something can\u2019t someone take.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Daylight Saving Time: Why Does It Exist? (It\u2019s Not for Farming)", "Date": "2016-03-11", "News": "Supported by(This article has been updated.)We spring forward, and then fall back.But why?The reason the United States and many other countries, mostly in the West, shift to daylight saving time is contentious and confusing, and some of the more popular explanations are not grounded in reality. (It isn\u2019t for farmers, as you may have learned in school.)In 2017, the ritual will take place on Sunday, when Americans will push their clocks forward an hour. The general concept is to move an hour of sunlight from the early morning, when many would sleep through it, to the evening, when you could most likely do more with the light.\u201cFor most people, an extra hour of daylight in the evening after work or after school is much more usable than the hour of daylight in the morning,\u201d said David Prerau, the author of \u201cSeize the Daylight.\u201dExtra daylight means extra time to spend money.And if you\u2019re in the United States, you\u2019re probably going to get in your car to go spend that money.\u201cAmericans really do leave their homes when there is more sunlight at the end of the day,\u201d said Michael Downing, a lecturer at Tufts University and the author of \u201cSpring Forward: The Annual Madness of Daylight Saving Time.\u201d\u201cWe go to the parks, and we go to the mall, but we don\u2019t walk there,\u201d he said. \u201cDaylight saving increases gasoline consumption.\u201dNo one is more aware of that than gas stations, which is why the Association for Convenience and Fuel Retailing, a lobbying group for convenience stores, has pushed to start daylight saving time earlier in the year. In 2010, Jeff Miller, the group\u2019s chairman at the time, said the industry had added an estimated $1 billion in annual sales since the organization lobbied to add a month to daylight saving in 1986.Those in the leisure industry have also benefited, Mr. Downing said. For example, he said, the Chamber of Commerce has lobbied on behalf of retailers that sell gardening, home repair or sports equipment. Lobbyists from the golf industry estimated in 1986 that an extra month of daylight saving would be worth $200 million to $400 million.It might be surprising to find farmers in this category considering the common belief that they are the reason for daylight saving time.\u201cI don\u2019t know how that ever became a myth, but it is the exact opposite,\u201d Mr. Prerau said. He said daylight saving time actually disrupts farmers\u2019 schedules.Initially, farmers were the strongest lobby against the change. But since then, opposition has fragmented into much smaller interest groups, Mr. Downing said, including religious groups that schedule prayers around sunrise. Parents have also complained about having their children walk to school in the dark.And some anti-federalists are opposed to what they consider unnecessary government intervention. (Arizona and Hawaii are the only two states that have held out.)The idea was originally rooted in saving candle wax, not electricity.Historians have traced the notion back to Benjamin Franklin, who realized he was sleeping through some daylight hours while visiting Paris in the 18th century. He suggested French officials shoot cannons at sunrise to jolt people out of bed, optimizing the amount of hours they spent awake when it\u2019s light out. That way, they could cut down on using candles to light their homes while awake, Mr. Prerau said.But the first idea to move the clock hands came from William Willett, who unsuccessfully proposed it to the British Parliament in 1908. Germany, however, seeking cost savings during World War I, heard the idea and enacted it in 1915. Three weeks later, the British followed, and other world powers were close behind, including the United States in 1918.Mr. Downing said the idea was originally based on having \u201can eight-hour economy,\u201d but electricity demand is no longer based on sunrises and sunsets \u2014 not when there\u2019s air conditioning.\u201cIt has long been a cynical substitute for real energy policy,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s the ideal energy policy because it has no apparent direct cost to consumers, and it asks no one to consume less.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "How Much More Can the Labor Force Grow?", "Date": "2016-03-04", "News": "Supported byJobs ReportThe American work force, according to the Labor Department\u2019s survey of households, rose by a whopping 555,000 people in February. Over the last three months, that number totals 1.52 million, the highest it has been in 16 years. In other words, this winter a lot more people have been either working or actively looking for work.That\u2019s good. The proportion of Americans in the labor force plummeted during the 2008 recession and its aftermath. That was partly because of demographic forces, like baby boomers retiring.It was also caused by millions of Americans who saw little opportunity and became disengaged from the workplace, their incomes suffering, their skills atrophying and the nation\u2019s economic potential diminishing in the process.But there is evidence that in the last few months that trend has started to reverse. The proportion of the adult population in the labor force and the proportion of the population with a job are both up half a percentage point since September. For the first time in years it\u2019s fair to say that these changes are decisively pointed in the right direction.Just last summer, as the United States expansion entered its seventh year with booming job growth, there was reason to doubt that an improving job market would ever start to pull people in who had become detached from the labor force. After all, if seven years of job growth wasn\u2019t enough to make more people enter the work force, what would be?We still don\u2019t know for sure how much more room there is to grow. Presumably most people who dropped out of the labor force around retirement age are out of the work force for good, no matter how many job opportunities present themselves. But the data in 2016 will help us find out how much room for expansion there really is in labor force participation.There is some interplay between the growth in the number of workers and the most disappointing signal in the February jobs numbers, which was a step down in average hourly earnings. Over the last year, this number has risen 2.2 percent, which amounts to a modest rise in pay for American workers thanks to very low inflation. But it hardly suggests the kind of booming economy indicated by the low unemployment rate.What seems to be happening is the pool of \u201cshadow workers,\u201d who have been employable but were not looking for work, has kept a lid on wage increases. We\u2019ve been able to keep up strong job growth without strong wage gains because there are still a lot of people who are not working and not formally looking for a job, but who are available to take one when the opportunity arises.As 2016 unfolds, which of these forces will prove more powerful? If the labor force keeps growing at the gangbusters pace of the last three months, all those new entrants will keep the downward pressure on wages. On the other hand, it might take higher wages to keep pulling people out of their homes and into the workplace.But here\u2019s the wild card. All this assumes the strong rate of job creation \u2014 242,000 positions added in February, plus positive revisions to previous months \u2014 doesn\u2019t get undone by an era of Federal Reserve interest rate increases and volatile global markets.For the first couple of months of the year, the big story in the job market has been rising participation. The question for the months ahead is how long that can persist absent stronger wage growth \u2014 and whether the momentum driving job growth is strong enough to persist despite ever-present risks.The evidence from the February numbers points in both directions for the Fed, as it decides how quickly to raise interest rates. The solid rate of job creation will give the central bank confidence that the recovery is proceeding reasonably robustly and that higher interest rates make sense.On the other hand, the combination of the sharply rising size of the labor force and flat wage growth support the idea that there is plenty more slack in the job market and that inflation isn\u2019t an imminent risk. That suggests the Fed could wait longer before raising rates again to see whether potential workers are becoming so scarce that wages start rising sharply, creating pressure on inflation.That\u2019s why the rising labor force isn\u2019t just good for the millions of people who have an income that they wouldn\u2019t otherwise, but also because their existence can allow the Fed to be more patient about waiting for wages to pick up.For now, the thing to do is celebrate the 1.5 million Americans who are in the labor force who weren\u2019t in November \u2014 and to look for evidence of how many more people like them are out there, ready to work, as they increasingly have the opportunity.Advertisement"}

Republicans are falling apart.The most consequential night of voting so far in the presidential campaign crystallized, in jarring and powerful fashion, the remarkably divergent fortunes of the two major parties vying for the White House.Now, as the parties gaze ahead to the fall, they are awakening to the advantages of consensus and the perils of chaos.\u201cIf the Republican Party were an airplane, and you were looking out a passenger window, you would see surface pieces peeling off and wonder if one of the wings or engines was next,\u201d said Tim Pawlenty, the former governor of Minnesota and a Republican candidate for president in 2012.The groups who were the strongest supporters for each Republican candidate.\u201cI could not in good conscience vote for Trump under any circumstance,\u201d said Blake Lichty, 33, a Republican who worked in the George W.

Goldwater of Arizona, has a major party faced such a crisis of identity.\u201cHistory is repeating itself,\u201d said the historian Richard Norton Smith. \u201cThe party changed then as permanently and profoundly as can be in politics, effectively becoming two parties.\u201dDemocrats are now poised to exploit a fortuitous intersection of forces: an improving economy with low unemployment; a Democratic president with a nearly 50 percent approval rating; a Supreme Court battle in which Republicans are energizing liberal voters with vows of obstruction; and now, what is likely to be a relatively smooth nomination process that will give Mrs. Clinton a chance to bring together the party\u2019s disparate strands.But officials in both parties acknowledge that Democrats are now better positioned to capture the presidency in November.\u201cThe Democrats are having a loud squabble, but the party is broadly unified behind certain themes,\u201d said David Axelrod, the Democratic strategist. \u201cThe Republicans are engaged in a full-out civil war, fundamentally riven by mistrust, and it is very hard to see how they put the pieces back together once this fight is done.\u201dThe groups who were the strongest supporters for each Republican candidate.With every nasty turn of the Republican nominating contest, Mrs. Clinton\u2019s position seems to strengthen. Day by day, the anti-Trump forces are marshaling, vowing to drag the primary process out until the convention in July.In an extraordinary show of defiance toward a potential presidential nominee, Senator Ben Sasse, a Republican from Nebraska, just wrote an open letter to Trump supporters explaining why he could not support the real estate mogul should he become the party\u2019s nominee. \u201cI sincerely hope we select one of the other G.O.P. candidates,\u201d Mr. Sasse wrote, pledging not to vote for Mrs. Clinton. \u201cBut if Donald Trump ends up as the nominee, conservatives will need to find a third option.\u201dIn the past 48 hours, Representative Scott Rigell of Virginia appealed to fellow Republicans in his state to reject Mr. Trump, calling him \u201ca bully unworthy of our nomination,\u201d and Gov. Susana Martinez of New Mexico would not commit to supporting him if he won the nomination.Speaker Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin, the party\u2019s vice-presidential nominee four years ago, took the unusual step of scolding the Republican front-runner from the halls of the Capitol building for failing to reject the support of David Duke. \u201cIf a person wants to be the nominee of the Republican Party,\u201d Mr. Ryan said, \u201cthere can be no evasion and no games. They must reject any group or cause that is built on bigotry.\u201dIn a discussion with little modern precedent, several high-profile Republicans are expressing uncertainty about how aggressively they would support Mr. Trump as the nominee, suggesting they might need to lose the campaign to save the party.13 Photos\u201cPresident Trump, which I don\u2019t believe is possible, would be an unmitigated disaster and would set the party back decades,\u201d said Mike Murphy, a longtime Republican strategist who oversaw the \u201csuper PAC\u201d that supported Jeb Bush this year. \u201cIt\u2019s like a computer designed him to lose elections for us. Who does he offend? College-educated white women and Latinos, the groups we need to win.\u201dBut any move to deny Mr. Trump the nomination risks further provoking the angry movement that he has ignited.Heather Cox Richardson, a Boston College professor and the author of a new history of the Republican Party, predicts a violent rupture that cleaves the party in two: a hard-line conservatism, as embodied by Pat Buchanan, Newt Gingrich and Mr. Trump, and an old-fashioned strain of moderate Republicanism that recalls Theodore Roosevelt, Dwight Eisenhower and Nelson Rockefeller. \u201cIt is going to be really ugly,\u201d she said.For now, the revulsion for Mr. Trump could produce a nightmare scenario for Republicans on Election Day: abandonment by rank-and-file voters who, like a growing number of party leaders, cannot stomach the concept of the mogul as their standard-bearer. \u201cI think it\u2019s a sad day for the Republican Party,\u201d said David Phillips, 72, an executive recruiter and longtime Republican from Avon, Conn., who called Mr. Trump \u201ca tremendous divider.\u201d\u201cIf he were the nominee,\u201d he said, reluctantly, \u201cI would probably vote for Hillary.\u201dJeremy W.

{"Headline": "On Trade, Angry Voters Have a Point", "Date": "2016-03-15", "News": "Supported byEconomic SceneWere the experts wrong about the benefits of trade for the American economy?The nation\u2019s working class had another opportunity to demonstrate its political clout Tuesday, as primary voters went to the polls in Illinois and Ohio, Rust Belt states that have suffered intensely from the loss of good manufacturing jobs. Last week, the insurrection handed Michigan\u2019s Democratic primary to Bernie Sanders while continuing to buoy the insurgent Republican candidacy of Donald Trump.They examined the experience of American workers after China erupted onto world markets some two decades ago. The presumed adjustment, they concluded, never happened. Or at least hasn\u2019t happened yet. Wages remain low and unemployment high in the most affected local job markets. Nationally, there is no sign of offsetting job gains elsewhere in the economy. What\u2019s more, they found that sagging wages in local labor markets exposed to Chinese competition reduced earnings by $213 per adult per year.\u201cThese results should cause us to rethink the short- and medium-run gains from trade,\u201d they argued. \u201cHaving failed to anticipate how significant the dislocations from trade might be, it is incumbent on the literature to more convincingly estimate the gains from trade, such that the case for free trade is not based on the sway of theory alone, but on a foundation of evidence that illuminates who gains, who loses, by how much, and under what conditions.\u201dStill, though trade may be good for the country over all \u2014 after netting out winners and losers \u2014 the case for globalization based on the fact that it helps expand the economic pie by 3 percent becomes much weaker when it also changes the distribution of the slices by 50 percent, Mr. Autor argued. And that is especially true when the American political system has shown no interest in compensating those on the losing side.The impact of China\u2019s great leap into the market economy \u2014 which drew hundreds of millions of impoverished peasants into the manufacturing sector, mostly making goods for export to the United States and other wealthy nations \u2014 is waning. China\u2019s wages are rising fast. Its exports and economy are slowing.The Chinese export onslaught, however, left a scar on the American working class that has not healed. That disproportionate impact suggests Washington officialdom might do well to reassess its approach to future trade liberalization. Most important, it points to reconsidering how policy makers deal with trade\u2019s distributional consequences.It doesn\u2019t mean walling off the United States from the rest of the world, but it does mean learning from the experience of other advanced nations that had a much healthier response to China\u2019s rise.Mr. Autor suggests that Americans\u2019 low savings rate was a big part of the story, coupled with foreigners\u2019 appetite for accumulating dollar assets, which helped keep American interest rates low and the dollar strong, in that way fueling a persistent trade deficit.The United States might have leaned against China\u2019s export-led strategy, they argue, perhaps by insisting more forcefully that Beijing let its currency rise as its trade surplus swelled. It might have tried to foster the cutting-edge industries of the future, as government had done so many times before, encouraging the shift from textiles to jumbo jets and from toys to semiconductors.What Washington did, instead, was hitch the nation\u2019s future to housing and finance. But Wall Street, instead of spreading prosperity, delivered the worst recession the world had seen since the 1930s. Even at best, they write, the transformation of banking and finance has \u201cproduced nothing (or exceedingly little) of value.\u201dSo where should policy makers go from here?There are no easy answers. Tearing up existing trade agreements and retreating behind high tariff barriers \u2014 as Mr. Trump, and perhaps Mr. Sanders, would have it \u2014 would be immensely unproductive. It would throw a wrench into the works of a wobbly world economy. And reneging on international treaties would vastly complicate the international coordination needed to combat climate change.But in any future trade liberalization \u2014 including the Obama administration\u2019s pending Trans-Pacific Partnership deal, if it is to go forward at all \u2014 policy makers must be much more careful about managing the costs. Mr. Autor suggests any further deals to increase trade should be gradual, to give much more time for exposed companies and their workers to retool and shift into other jobs and sectors.Perhaps most important, the new evidence from trade suggests American policy makers cannot continue to impose all the pain on the nation\u2019s blue-collar workers if they are not going to provide a stronger safety net.That might have been justified if the distributional costs of trade were indeed small and short-lived. But now that we know they are big and persistent, it looks unconscionable.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Stalin, Russia\u2019s New Hero", "Date": "2016-03-11", "News": "Supported byOpinionPenza, Russia \u2014 AT School No. 58 in Penza, a regional capital that is an eight and a half hour drive southeast of Moscow, the jury is still out on Joseph Stalin.\u201cHe was a great man, unique in history,\u201d Zhenya Viktorov, an 11th grader, told me on a recent visit. His classmate Amina Kurayev was more circumspect: \u201cIt wasn\u2019t as terrible as they say.\u201dAnd what about the millions of Soviets who were shot or sent to the gulags? \u201cNo one was repressed for no reason,\u201d Zhenya said. When I asked him how many political opponents Stalin killed, he told me \u201cthousands,\u201d and argued that the purges weren\u2019t as \u201cbig or inhumane as the media likes to say.\u201dAt least 15 million people were killed in prisons and labor camps under Stalin and his predecessor Vladimir Lenin, according to Alexander Yakovlev, who led a commission on rehabilitating victims of political repression under President Boris N. Yeltsin. Estimates vary, but Stalin\u2019s victims alone certainly number in the millions.This quiet rehabilitation began after Vladimir V. Putin came to power in 1999. Stalin\u2019s legacy has become a tacit justification as the Putin government has strengthened its own grip on power. Under Stalin, \u201corder\u201d and national prestige trumped human rights or civil liberties.\u201cBy raising the figure of Stalin, the Putin regime is trying to raise the idea that collective interests are more important than individual lives, and that means the regime has less responsibility to society,\u201d Lev Gudkov, who conducts the Levada Center\u2019s Stalin polls, told me.Here in Penza, the Communist Party opened a Stalin Center in December. It\u2019s just a few rooms of old photographs and newspapers and a lecture hall with a giant portrait of Stalin, but it makes a statement. A golden bust of Stalin stands in front of the building.Sites like these are becoming more and more common. In 2015, the Communist Party, which has 92 of 450 seats in Parliament and often toes the Kremlin line, raised a banner with pictures of Lenin and Stalin as the backdrop for the party plenary session. At Victory Day celebrations last May 9, his image adorned a fence next to a Moscow police station. Moscow\u2019s best-known bookstore was recently promoting a book called \u201cHow Stalin Defeated Corruption.\u201dSchool textbooks and state television programs, even if they briefly mention his human rights abuses, celebrate Stalin as a great leader. Mr. Putin has backed a planned monument to the victims of Soviet political repressions in Moscow, but that\u2019s likely pure politics. He wants to play to the masses who are growing enamored of Stalin without alienating those Russians, such as the Moscow intelligentsia, who abhor him. The president has also carefully praised Stalin: \u201cWe can criticize the commanders and Stalin all we like, but can anyone say with certainty that a different approach would have enabled us to win?\u201d he once said about World War II.Why is Stalin now gaining popularity? For one, people remember less and less about his purges and prison camps \u2014 which in Russia began to be thoroughly investigated and openly discussed only in the 1980s. As the sharp edges of Stalin\u2019s image have gone out of focus, he has become what Ilya Budraitskis, a leftist thinker and activist, described to me as an \u201cempty shell that can be filled with different meanings.\u201dI saw this firsthand in Penza. The Communists at the Stalin Center longed for his command economy, arguing that the hyperinflation and collapses of the 1990s were far worse than Soviet-era shortages; a right-wing, neo-pagan taxi driver told me that his favorite historical figures are Stalin and Hitler because they were able to \u201ckeep order.\u201dIn today\u2019s Russia, corrupt officials steal from the budget, police officers demand bribes and judges are believed to be bought and sold. Longing for the \u201corder\u201d of the past is palpable. The problem is that the fans of order never picture themselves as the ones being repressed, said Sergei Oleynik, head of the Penza branch of the liberal Yabloko Party. \u201cWhen they talk about the Stalin era, they imagine the holster at the side, but not the barrel to the back of their neck,\u201d he told me.The Kremlin also plays on Russian nostalgia for superpower status, stressing the glories of the Soviet past \u2014 first and foremost, victory in World War II \u2014 over the persecutions and famines. When Russia is besieged by enemies, including a government in Ukraine that the state news media has described as a \u201cfascist junta,\u201d the image of Stalin the defender against Nazis wins out over that of Stalin the paranoid tyrant. Can Mr. Putin\u2019s strong hand similarly defend the motherland?Russia won\u2019t be able to reform its increasingly authoritarian and corrupt government \u2014 which rejects \u201cWestern\u201d values like human rights and democracy while buying into its capitalist economic model \u2014 as long as it refuses to acknowledge the excesses of the most tyrannical government in its past. Victor Erofeyev, a novelist whose father was a translator for Stalin, has said that \u201cwhen Stalin dies in the soul of the last Russian, then you can say our country has a future.\u201d Unfortunately, Mr. Putin is happy to keep him alive.Alec Luhn is a journalist based in Moscow.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Law Firm\u2019s First Latina Partner, With Boost From N.Y.U. Program", "Date": "2016-03-03", "News": "Supported byAs a young girl helping her parents run their Brooklyn bodega, Damaris Hern\u00e1ndez would not have dared to dream that she would one day become a lawyer, let alone a partner in one of world\u2019s most rarefied legal firms.But Ms. Hern\u00e1ndez was recently promoted to the job , making her the first Latina to reach that coveted spot at Cravath, Swaine & Moore.That achievement is an acknowledgment of her talent and hard work. But the story of her route to the top also reveals how much more complex the journey is for minorities and women than for the white men who overwhelmingly dominate the firms. Skill is only one of the keys. Being able to navigate unspoken rules is at least as important.\u201cWhen I was the only one of color or the only woman in the room, I had the confidence to believe in my ability,\u201d said Ms. Hern\u00e1ndez, 36, describing the advantages of the program to her. \u201cWhen you are the first, you need someone to have your back.\u201dOver the last decade and a half, she and 100 others who attended the New York University School of Law received that support from a scholarship program that paid their full tuition and also gave them access to a network of luminaries including federal judges, law firm partners and even Supreme Court justices.Graduates, who typically are the first in their families to seek a professional or graduate degree, have gone on to jobs at elite law firms such as Davis Polk & Wardwell or Shearman & Sterling, as well as public interest jobs. The scholarships \u2014 which each provide about $175,000 for three years of legal education \u2014 are for those from disadvantaged backgrounds, said the program\u2019s founder, Anthony Welters, a 1977 N.Y.U. law school graduate who is executive vice president of the health care company the UnitedHealth Group.\u201cThe program aims at economic diversity,\u201d said Mr. Welters, 60, an African-American who grew up in Harlem and was the first in his family to pursue an advanced degree. After stints as a Capitol Hill aide and securities lawyer, he made his fortune when AmeriChoice, the Medicaid services provider he founded, later merged with UnitedHealth.\u201cIt\u2019s not just giving cash,\u201d he said of the program, which he and his wife, Beatrice, a former American ambassador to Trinidad and Tobago, founded in 1998. They called it AnBryce, a name derived from the first initial of each family member\u2019s name. \u201cIt\u2019s more than academic credentials. It takes a hell of a lot to become a successful lawyer. These students can compete; they just have to know the rules of the road.\u201dThose rules are crucial to securing jobs at premier law firms, which can pay their partners salaries in the millions of dollars but where varied personal backgrounds can often be missing. African-American and Latino lawyers are scarce at the coveted partner level, hovering around 2 percent for each group. Ms. Hern\u00e1ndez is joining a select group since about a few dozen Hispanic women are partners at firms that have 500 to 700 lawyers each.Only a handful of schools have programs providing tuition as well as opportunities for professional development and mentoring, said Evan R. Chesler, partner and chairman of Cravath, Swaine & Moore, which participates in several diversity efforts to broaden its choice of legal recruits.\u201cThe legal profession traditionally is not one that looks inward and helps itself,\u201d said Mr. Chesler, a 1975 N.Y.U. law school graduate. But the Welters, he said, took an approach that would develop professionals \u201cright from the beginning of their time in law school.\u201dMr. Welters, who also is chairman of the law school\u2019s board of trustees, said he funded the scholarship because he wanted to give exceptional students the \u201cembedded knowledge\u201d that those from more privileged backgrounds come by automatically.The program has benefited from the participation of prominent friends and colleagues. Interviews for the first scholarship, for instance, were held in the chambers of Justice Clarence Thomas, of the United States Supreme Court, a friend and colleague of Mr. Welters.That interview was intimidating and memorable, said Leila K. Mongan, 41, who was one of the early scholarship recipients. Even though she had a troubled childhood \u2014 her father had taken her and her sister, at ages 7 and 9, changed their names and moved them to Mexico for two years \u2014 she excelled when she returned to school. The mentoring aspect of the AnBryce scholarship was more appealing to her than the money, she said.\u201cI was startled because they wanted to know about my experiences, not my grades, which was a weird reversal,\u201d she said of her interview. \u201cThey made it seem like my life was not a strike against me but an honor.\u201dAnBryce has gradually expanded with more donor money, and it now chooses 10 scholars per law school class, for a total of around 30 each year based on economic background and leadership potential \u2014 regardless of race or ethnicity.It includes scholars like Angela M. Libby, 29, who is white and grew up in Limington, a town in rural Maine. She said the participants formed a close bond because \u201cwe were all outsiders in some way.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m from a small, white farming town in Maine without a strong culture of college and little understanding of race,\u201d Ms. Libby said. Her adjustment to law school was not smooth, she added. Initially, she said, \u201cI wasn\u2019t even sure I wanted to be a lawyer.\u201d She has practiced at Davis Polk since her 2011 graduation.Like others, Ms. Libby relied on the AnBryce network to help her through. Many scholars develop close personal relationships with the Welters, who make themselves available for questions and advice, hold dinners for students at their New York apartment, invite business and legal leaders for regular talks and host each scholar for at least one Thanksgiving at their Virginia residence.\u201cIt was, and is, very much a family,\u201d Ms. Hern\u00e1ndez said. Her father died when she was an undergraduate at Harvard, and she took two years off to work at several jobs in Buffalo, where her future husband was in school. Her mother, originally from Puerto Rico, lost the bodega and moved to live with her in Buffalo.Later, Ms. Hern\u00e1ndez returned to Harvard and graduated in 2003. She was accepted to N.Y.U. law school the next year and won an AnBryce scholarship \u2014 also interviewing in Justice Thomas\u2019s chambers. She said that she took a photograph just to prove she had been there.\u201cThe scholarship is meant to take away economic need so a person can focus on their studies, but I also had a family to take care of,\u201d she said.Aside from the personal, the scholarship network connects students like Ms. Hern\u00e1ndez to top-ranked law firms to compete for scarce first-year summer jobs, which can help shape a legal career. Ms. Hern\u00e1ndez landed at Dewey Ballantine for her first summer. But when the economy was starting to reduce the number of legal jobs, she was able to turn to scholarship contacts \u201cto open doors you didn\u2019t know existed.\u201dWhen she graduated in 2007, Ms. Hern\u00e1ndez was hired by Cravath, which is known for its team training that allows rotation among different legal areas.\u201cI called it \u2018curly locks\u2019 \u2014 meaning my hair \u2014 and the three partners,\u201d she said of her litigation team experiences, which included representing IBM in a federal investigation of some of its overseas operations, Novartis Pharmaceuticals and Credit Suisse. She then earned the status of partner.\u201cDamaris is an exceptional lawyer,\u201d said Mr. Chesler, who interviewed Ms. Hern\u00e1ndez before she was hired and has since worked with her on two cases.More law schools, he said, \u201cneed to have programs like AnBryce, which provides a constellation of support for students who came from families who were not able to help them, and equips them with a basket of skills they would not necessarily have.\u201d\u201cAnd skills,\u201d he said, \u201care an enormous leveler in the legal profession.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Killing of Italian Student, Giulio Regeni, Puts Focus on Egypt\u2019s Stability", "Date": "2016-03-18", "News": "Supported byEgyptian news media accounts, lawmakers and government officials have variously blamed an auto accident, sexual misadventure, drugs, espionage, a mystery assassin, the outlawed Muslim Brotherhood \u2014 everything, it seems, except the scenario that Washington, Rome and other European capitals think is most likely: that Mr. Regeni was abducted, gruesomely tortured and killed by an element of Egypt\u2019s own security forces.The case is still headline news in Egypt and Italy, and Western officials say the furor has crystallized their concerns about a much broader problem. They worry that escalating political repression and human rights abuses in Egypt are signs of weakness in President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi\u2019s grip on power, potentially threatening the stability of a key Middle Eastern ally.Reports of abductions, torture and brutality by Egypt\u2019s security forces have surged in recent months, prompting debates in several Western countries about how to deal with Egypt. Secretary of State John Kerry met with senior State Department officials last week to consider the issue.Egypt\u2019s human rights record has come in for considerable criticism since Mr. Sisi came to power in 2013, but things have gotten worse recently. Advocacy groups say that hundreds of people have disappeared into detention centers where torture is common, and anger over police brutality is growing. A protest erupted in one Cairo neighborhood recently after a policeman shot and killed a taxi driver over a fare.\u201cThe United States is deeply concerned about the human rights situation in Egypt,\u201d said Ned Price, a spokesman for the National Security Council.\u00a0That resolution carries only symbolic force, and most Western countries remain careful in their public criticism of Egypt, mindful that even the mildest rebuke can draw an angry reaction from a country where the West has deep strategic, economic and counterterrorism interests.\u201cWe have to try and work and thread a needle carefully,\u201d Mr. Kerry said last month.Attempts to press Egypt by putting restrictions on the $1.3 billion a year it receives in American military aid have achieved little. One State Department official said that part of the problem was that other agencies like the C.I.A. and Pentagon had not made human rights a priority in dealing with Egypt.\u201cWe\u2019re concerned about some mixed messaging coming from the U.S. government,\u201d said the official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to discuss private conversations with foreign officials. Still, the outcry over Mr. Regeni, a doctoral candidate at Cambridge University who had come to Egypt to research its labor unions, has brought a new focus to the rights problem.The nature of the injuries led many Italian officials to conclude that the Egyptian security forces were involved. They also noted some troubling coincidences. On the day the body was found, Mr. Sisi was receiving an Italian trade delegation and Alberto Manenti, Italy\u2019s foreign intelligence chief, was meeting with his Egyptian counterparts in Cairo.Western officials have puzzled over whether some element of Egypt\u2019s security apparatus purposely dumped Mr. Regeni\u2019s body on that day to send a message to Italy, or even to Mr. Sisi.The inner circle surrounding Mr. Sisi is notoriously opaque, but many analysts say they believe he operates as first among equals, a leader whose power is circumscribed by some fiercely autonomous elements of the Egyptian security services.\u201cThere are plenty of signs of disorder in the security apparatus,\u201d said Ms. Dunne of the Carnegie Endowment. \u201cAfter 2011, they were unified for a time against the Muslim Brotherhood. But now they are squabbling among themselves again.\u201dThe investigation into Mr. Regeni\u2019s death could hinge on an Italian autopsy report, not yet released, which could answer whether he was tortured over an extended period, which would point to detention by a state security agency.For now, Italian officials are relying on Egyptian cooperation. After a visit to Cairo this week by the chief prosecutor of Rome, Giuseppe Pignatone, Egypt agreed to provide Mr. Regeni\u2019s cellphone records and surveillance footage from the area where he disappeared, the Italian news agency ANSA reported.\u201cThis is not just about Regeni,\u201d Ms. Dunne said. \u201cThere\u2019s a sense the Egyptians are determined to crush a human rights community that has been there for 30 years. And if they close them down, nobody will know what\u2019s going on.\u201dMark Mazzetti contributed reporting from Washington, Gaia Pianigiani from Rome, and Nour Youssef from Cairo.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "\u2018The End of Karma,\u2019 by Somini Sengupta", "Date": "2016-03-18", "News": "Supported byWhen you purchase an independently reviewed book through our site, we earn an affiliate commission.In November 1949, India had been independent for slightly more than two years, and through that duration, a drafting committee labored to devise a constitution for the new nation. The work was nearly finished, but critics grumbled about how long it had taken; one pundit thought the panel ought to have been called the \u201cdrifting committee.\u201d B.\u2009R. Ambedkar, the Columbia-educated lawyer heading the group, defended his colleagues. Their task was difficult. The constitution incorporated 395 articles and 2,473 amendments, a density that reflected India\u2019s complications \u2014 its iniquities of caste, its poverty, its various languages and faiths. India already had political democracy (one vote per citizen), but the constitution also needed to foster social democracy. \u201cHow long shall we continue to deny equality in our social and economic life?\u201d Ambedkar said in a speech. \u201cWe must remove this contradiction at the earliest possible moment, or else those who suffer from inequality will blow up the structure of political \u00addemocracy.\u201dThe lives of India\u2019s poor and its lowest castes have improved in many ways, but the country remains riddled with inequality; in fact, over the last 35 years the gulf between the wealthiest and the most impoverished has widened. In \u201cThe End of Karma,\u201d Somini Sengupta delivers a portentous warning that echoes Ambedkar\u2019s, updated for the present. A quarter of India\u2019s 1.25 billion people are younger than 15; every month, until 2030, nearly a million Indians will turn 18, raring for more education and employment prospects. The size and energy of such a work force is a nation\u2019s dream \u2014 the celebrated \u201cdemographic dividend.\u201d But the state\u2019s failure to supply these young people with schools, universities and jobs, and to help them climb into prosperity, will tug India into perilous waters, Sengupta writes. \u201cIn the coming years, India can thrive because of its young. Or it can implode. Or both. There\u2019s little time left.\u201dSengupta, a reporter for The New York Times, served as the newspaper\u2019s New Delhi bureau chief from 2005 to 2009. She had first left India 30 years earlier, when her father decided, in the teeth of a nationwide crackdown on civil liberties, to move the family to Canada and thence to the United States. Now, returning to a transformed nation \u2014 its economy in bloom, its cities abuzz \u2014 she sensed a fresh impatience of aspiration. Sengupta refers to the Hindu notion of karma, a preordained destiny based on the virtues and sins of previous lives, a psychic past that is impossible to escape. The invocation is loose. She avoids making the unwise argument that Hindu fatalism had, in earlier years, persuaded Indians to be resigned to their hardscrabble times. It is only that, right now, \u201cthe demands of India\u2019s young are pushing India to break free of its past. They are no longer willing to put up with their lot.\u201d\u201cThe End of Karma\u201d shifts in and out of three modes of narrative. The weakest involves Sengupta\u2019s recollections of a childhood in India and North America, as well as her decision, during the stint in New Delhi, to adopt a baby girl. Her interest in India\u2019s youth, she suggests, was quickened by this entry into her life by her daughter, a bona fide member of these restless generations, a unit of India\u2019s demographic dividend. But much of this feels tenuous, the sort of material an editor commonly asks for, reproaching a writer because her manuscript is Not Personal Enough. The book\u2019s second mode is expository \u2014 summations of news, history and statistics, which Sengupta delivers in cool, swift language. Two pages about Laloo Prasad Yadav, a powerful politician in the state of Bihar, are a marvel of economy, laying bare his background, his machinery of caste politics, his wrecking of Bihar, and his folksy charisma.In the book\u2019s most vibrant sections, Sengupta profiles seven young Indians, shadowing some of them over years. All grew up in poor or lower-middle-class homes \u2014 the socioeconomic brackets that hold a majority of India\u2019s populace \u2014 and their lives illustrate the ways in which the state is failing its youth.A young woman named Rakhi from one of West Bengal\u2019s numerous underdeveloped villages joins a Maoist insurgency after her family slides suddenly into penury. She can list the people she has killed: \u201cEach leaves a vivid memory,\u201d Sengupta writes. \u201cThe time of day, the season of the year, the name of the victim.\u201d Near Mumbai, the police, provoked by a right-wing mob, arrest two girls who complained, on Facebook, that the city had come to a grinding halt just to accommodate a politician\u2019s funeral cortege. In Gurgaon, a 17-year-old named Varsha thirsts for more education, so that she can become a cop. Her father, who drives an auto rickshaw, has to be cajoled out of his reluctance: Schools cost money and pull his daughter too far out of the orbit of their world. \u201cHe loves her, but he also sabotages her. .\u2008.\u2008. She keeps pushing the bounds, and he has to figure out how far to let her go.\u201dSengupta\u2019s finest profile is of Anupam Kumar. In Patna, Bihar\u2019s capital, Anupam grew up in a tiny brick house with a corrugated tin roof; pigs prospected in a trash dump next door. His father, like Varsha\u2019s, drove an auto rickshaw. His mother, recognizing brightness in Anupam, scoured the neighborhood for affordable private schools and tuition classes, short-circuiting the abysmal, erratic government schools. \u201cThe latest survey results, from 2014, showed that most Indian children in Class 5 are functionally illiterate,\u201d Sengupta writes. \u201cMore than half cannot subtract.\u201dAnupam studied hard, entered the most competitive engineering school in the country, lost his way there, switched colleges, then got an M.B.A. and began working for India\u2019s equivalent of the Securities and Exchange Commission. \u201cAnupam is no Horatio Alger. His country is not a country of Horatio Algers,\u201d Sengupta notes carefully. His story gains its potency by hinting at the reserves of talent and intelligence within India, but also by revealing how close India is coming to squandering it all, content to watch only the prodigious few burst free of the gravitational field of their past.Samanth Subramanian is the India correspondent for The National.

{"Headline": "What Trump and Sanders Get Wrong About Free Trade", "Date": "2016-03-16", "News": "Supported byOp-Ed ContributorHARDLY a Democratic or Republican debate passes without claims that international trade is responsible for the country\u2019s growing economic insecurity and inequality.But the bombast from the right and the left is as misdirected as it is angry. Viewing trade as toxic for American workers obscures reality, ignores the problems we face and undermines steps needed to strengthen the economy.Here are some facts lost in the heat of primary season. Excluding oil, the United States actually has a trade surplus in manufactured goods (you read that right) with the 20 countries with which it has trade agreements (although that does not include China). Over all, the United States enjoys an annual trade surplus in services, driven by financial services and intellectual-property licensing, of more than $200 billion.Trade agreements support these trends by prying open foreign markets for American goods and services. Without greater access, the United States will have a difficult time creating more jobs: Nearly all of the world\u2019s population lives outside its borders.The Department of Commerce estimates that every increase of $1 billion in exports sustains nearly 6,000 jobs, and that export-related jobs pay on average 18 percent more than jobs focused on the domestic market. We\u2019d be foolish to start a trade war by imposing tariffs on products from China, Mexico or other countries, which would increase prices and invite retaliation that would hurt American exports.To understand how dismantling trade barriers helps the country, we also need to take a broader view of the American economy, and not focus solely on disruptions and lost jobs in particular sectors. And among major advanced countries, our growth rate is nothing to be ashamed of, especially given substantial economic headwinds from abroad.Exports remain a steadily growing component of United States gross domestic product, which is even more significant in light of declining growth in global trade. Job growth in 2014-15 was as strong as it was in the 1990s, hourly wages have grown at their fastest pace since the Great Recession and unemployment today is less than 5 percent. China\u2019s growth rate remains higher but is widely believed to be overstated and has fallen to a 25-year low.To better address job loss, the United States needs strong, enforceable trade agreements that can lift wages and ensure respect for fundamental labor laws by its trading partners. We can and should do more to crack down on countries that manipulate their currency, and we should stop shying away from making currency discipline an enforceable part of our agreements.Another essential step is to strengthen our domestic safety net so that if a factory closes, for any reason, its workers can immediately retrain and not worry whether their families will be taken care of during the transition to a new job. The federal Trade Adjustment Assistance Program, though underfinanced, has helped over two million workers since 1974. But nearly a quarter of them have had difficulty finding new employment, and they would benefit from a greater focus on enhancing their skills, as is done in other countries.Rather than blaming international trade for economic woes, we need to have an honest conversation about what the United States must do to strengthen its economy. More than 20 percent of American children today live in poverty. Our educational system, once the envy of the world, now ranks in the bottom half of much of the developed world. The tax system rewards companies that exploit loopholes, infrastructure is crumbling and training programs lack the kind of apprenticeship and credentialing opportunities that Germany and other major economies offer.The American people deserve clarity about the true impact of trade. It was a more open trade policy that helped the United States recover from the Great Depression. In 1934, Congress gave President Franklin D. Roosevelt the authority to negotiate trade agreements and unwind the devastating Smoot-Hawley tariffs; within five years he had signed 19 such agreements.Expanded trade can also accelerate our recovery from the Great Recession. Of course it is easier to score points by denouncing trade than to tackle the tough issues, but such demagogy ignores the roots of economic insecurity and inequality. It also obscures the reality that trade, done right, offers a chance to strengthen America\u2019s competitiveness.Miriam Sapiro, a principal at Summit Strategies International, was a deputy United States trade representative from 2009 to 2014.rAdvertisement"}

For Apple, It\u2019s All About the Dollar.", "Date": "2016-03-26", "News": "Supported byStrategiesDon\u2019t obsess about the svelte new iPhone or the price cut for the Apple Watch.Don\u2019t worry too much about Apple\u2019s courtroom battles over privacy and national security, at least not now. Those issues moved to the back burner on Monday when the Justice Department said that it might not need Apple\u2019s help to break into an iPhone connected to a mass shooting.Instead, if you\u2019re interested in Apple as the world\u2019s most valuable company, and not just in Apple as a maker of cool gadgets, the biggest news affecting it lately has arguably come from another quarter: the foreign currency markets.For a reading on where Apple\u2019s share price may be heading, look to the dollar.The underlying reason is this: The dollar\u2019s rise and fall have a direct effect on Apple\u2019s earnings, which ultimately drive share prices. When the dollar strengthens, sales of iPhones abroad are worth less in American currency, hurting profits and, sooner or later, knocking down share prices. When the dollar weakens, on the other hand, those overseas profits become more valuable.Despite a partial recovery over the last few days, the greenback has been weakening and Apple\u2019s shares have been rising. Apple has been getting a dollar bonus.And what\u2019s true for Apple is true for many of the multinationals in the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index, which declined last year and fell sharply for much of the start of this one. Corporate profits fell 5.1 percent in 2015, the largest drop since 2008, the Commerce Department said on Friday. Profit margins continue to be pressured, but the turn in the value of the dollar gave earnings a nudge upward, helping American multinationals prosper. It is no accident that the S.&P. 500 began to recover in late January, as the dollar began to weaken.Apple is a case in point. When it reported earnings on Jan. 26, the dollar had been rising for months, and Timothy D. Cook, its chief executive, discussed the repercussions during an earnings call with Wall Street analysts. Two-thirds of \u201cApple\u2019s revenue is now generated outside the United States,\u201d he said, \u201cso foreign currency fluctuations have a very meaningful impact on our results.\u201dHe illustrated that impact this way: Between the last three months of 2014 and the same stretch in 2015, every dollar\u2019s worth of sales that Apple earned outside the United States lost 15 cents when translated into dollars. In its latest quarter alone, he added, Apple lost six percentage points of sales growth to the rising dollar.The iPhone is the company\u2019s profit engine, but the strong dollar chipped away at its power. The average sales price for the iPhone globally at the end of 2015 was $691, according to Luca Maestri, Apple\u2019s chief financial officer. But he said the strong dollar reduced the effective sales price by $49, or roughly 7 percent.Apple\u2019s share price, which buoyed the overall stock market in past years, fell 4.6 percent in 2015 and dropped more than 11 percent through Jan. 27. Since, then, though, Apple shares have risen more than 13 percent.The dollar\u2019s direction has been changing recently as well. On a trade-weighted basis, after gaining more than 9 percent in 2015, it has weakened by nearly 2.5 percent this year. That has helped American companies with significant international earnings, especially technology companies. Within the S.&P. 500 index, half of that sector\u2019s earnings come from outside the United States.Compare that with the utility companies in the index: They obtain only 4.4 percent of their earnings abroad. Over the last 12 months, utilities, which pay hefty dividends and have been insulated from the dollar\u2019s fluctuations, have returned 15.5 percent, compared with 6.6 percent for information technology shares. Since late January, tech shares have nearly kept pace with utilities. The decline in the dollar has helped account for that.Where the dollar heads now is a matter for pure speculation. Clearly, the Federal Reserve\u2019s shifting monetary policy is important. As John Higgins, chief markets economist for Capital Economics, put it, the Fed \u201cappears to have turned more dovish, which has undermined the dollar.\u201d In an election year in which the trade deficit is a major issue, you wouldn\u2019t be sticking your neck out very far in assuming that the Fed might retain a dovish bias and that the dollar might remain fairly weak.That said, the Fed couldn\u2019t entirely control the dollar\u2019s value, even if it wanted to do so. Foreign exchange rates are determined by traders who compare currencies, many of which have been weakened by their own sputtering local economies and by central banks that have adopted near-zero or negative short-term interest rates. In comparison, the United States may be a bastion of stability, and the dollar could rise.It is quite possible, in short, that the dollar\u2019s ebb has given companies like Apple only a temporary reprieve. And the dollar is only one ingredient in Apple\u2019s corporate mix. Other transient factors \u2014 the iPhone\u2019s shape and power, the Apple Watch\u2019s price and appearance, and the security of Apple\u2019s devices \u2014 may play a more dominant role in determining Apple\u2019s fortunes.Obsess about that if you must, but don\u2019t underestimate the dollar.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "In Democratic Debate, Bernie Sanders Pushes Hillary Clinton on Trade and Jobs", "Date": "2016-03-06", "News": "Supported byFLINT, Mich. \u2014 Senator Bernie Sanders, anxious that the Democratic nomination is slipping away from him, launched a series of cutting and sarcastic attacks against Hillary Clinton over trade, welfare reform and Wall Street in a debate Sunday night that often felt like a war over Bill Clinton\u2019s legacy and the moderate Democratic policies of the 1990s.Even Mrs. Clinton joined in the repudiation of her husband\u2019s 1994 crime bill and 1996 welfare law, which both disproportionately harmed African-Americans. Both she and Mr. Sanders are aggressively courting black voters in Michigan, Ohio and other racially diverse states that hold primaries over the next nine days, but Mr. Sanders has an urgent need to cut into Mrs. Clinton\u2019s support among African-Americans.Mr. Sanders, who has fallen far behind Mrs. Clinton in their all-important race to accumulate delegates to clinch the party\u2019s nomination, has rarely been so aggressive. He portrayed Mrs. Clinton as an unapologetic champion of free trade for much of her career, in hopes of hurting her with Rust Belt Democrats. He tied her aggressively to the North American Free Trade Agreement, Mr. Clinton\u2019s signature trade policy, and to the Trans-Pacific Partnership, President Obama\u2019s 12-nation trade pact, which she supported as secretary of state but then denounced as a presidential candidate.Mr. Sanders also attacked Mrs. Clinton\u2019s support of the federal Export-Import Bank, the credit agency that antigovernment populists on both sides have called an instrument of \u201ccorporate welfare,\u201d and he feigned amazement when she expressed criticism of some trade deals.\u201cSecretary Clinton has discovered religion on this issue, but it\u2019s a little bit too late,\u201d Mr. Sanders said. \u201cI was on a picket line in the early 1990s against Nafta, because you didn\u2019t need a Ph.D. in economics to understand that American workers should not be forced to compete against people in Mexico making 25 cents an hour.\u201dFor the most part, Mrs. Clinton deftly parried her rival\u2019s arguments, deriding many of them and agreeing with a few, and at times interrupting Mr. Sanders in hopes of provoking a testy explosion.Mr. Sanders grew visibly angry at times, though he was not as volatile as the Republican candidates have been in recent debates.When he attacked Mrs. Clinton over what he called \u201cthe Wall Street bailout where some of your friends destroyed the economy,\u201d she tried to cut him off.\u201cExcuse me, I\u2019m talking,\u201d he said.After a brief dramatic pause, Mrs. Clinton said sharply, \u201cIf you\u2019re going to talk, tell the whole story.\u201d\u201cLet me tell my story and you tell yours,\u201d Mr. Sanders shot back.Mrs. Clinton, who is focused on protecting her delegate lead, sought to stay positive, pointing to more salutary achievements from her husband\u2019s two terms.\u201cIf we\u2019re going to talk about the 1990s, let\u2019s talk about 23 million new jobs \u2014 incomes went up for everybody, median African-American income went up 33 percent at the end of the \u201990s, and we lifted more people out of poverty than at any other time in recent history,\u201d she said.The focus on the economic fortunes of African-Americans had a powerful setting in Sunday\u2019s debate: Flint, a city in the midst of a public health emergency over lead-tainted water, and a symbol of a middle class that rose to prosperity with the auto industry, but where 42 percent of the majority African-American population now lives below the poverty line. Mrs. Clinton came armed with a resonant retort to Mr. Sanders over his Wall Street attacks, reminding the Michigan audience that Mr. Sanders voted against the auto industry bailout and again calling him a \u201csingle issue\u201d candidate too narrowly focused on Wall Street.\u201cIf everybody had voted the way he did, I believe the auto industry would have collapsed, taking four million jobs with it,\u201d she said.Mr. Sanders allowed that perhaps he was a single-issue candidate. \u201cMy one issue is trying to rebuild a disappearing middle class,\u201d he said.The candidates also grew testy on gun control. When the father of a young girl injured in a recent shooting in nearby Kalamazoo asked what the candidates would do about gun control, Mrs. Clinton criticized Mr. Sanders. \u201cGiving immunity to gun makers and sellers was a terrible mistake because it removed any accountability from the makers and the sellers,\u201d she said, referring to Mr. Sanders\u2019s position.\u201cMaybe I\u2019m wrong, but what you\u2019re really talking about is people saying, let\u2019s end gun manufacturing in America,\u201d Mr. Sanders said of the immunity issue. \u201cThat\u2019s the implication of that and I don\u2019t agree with that.\u201dWhen Mrs. Clinton pounced again, Mr. Sanders was terse: \u201cCan I finish please? All right?\u201dMore than she has in past debates, Mrs. Clinton sought to reach out to Mr. Sanders\u2019s supporters in hopes of uniting the factions of the Democratic Party in anticipation of a general election campaign.Instead of looking away as Mr. Sanders spoke, as she often did in past debates, Mrs. Clinton watched him and nodded frequently as he talked about Flint. She colorfully agreed with him in the debate\u2019s opening moments when, after Mr. Sanders decried the water crisis, she said, \u201cAmen to that.\u201d For the first time she echoed his call for the resignation of Gov. Rick Snyder of Michigan (or, alternatively, she said he should be recalled).\u201cI know the state of Michigan has a rainy-day fund for emergencies,\u201d Mrs. Clinton said. \u201cIt is raining lead in Flint.\u201dBut at Sunday\u2019s debate, Mr. Sanders struck some more aggressive notes on Flint than he had in the past, embracing Mrs. Clinton\u2019s call to have the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention evaluate the health of every adult and child in the city. \u201cFederal government comes in, federal government acts,\u201d Mr. Sanders said.Mrs. Clinton then sounded some tougher notes, saying that she would \u201chave a full investigation to determine who knew what when\u201d in the Environmental Protection Agency, and that \u201cpeople should be fired.\u201d Mr. Sanders followed with an even sharper statement, saying, \u201cPresident Sanders would fire anybody who knew about what was happening and did not act appropriately.\u201dThe Flint debate was the first since the South Carolina primary, when Mrs. Clinton began to open up a commanding lead over Mr. Sanders in the race for the 2,383 delegates needed to clinch the Democratic nomination. On Sunday night, she sought to protect her edge with African-Americans, who have helped her more than any other constituency.She pushed back against a question from a CNN debate moderator, Don Lemon, about why black voters should trust her promises to reform the criminal justice system since she supported the 1994 crime bill, which sent so many black men to prison.Mrs. Clinton noted that Mr. Sanders had voted for the bill, but she then criticized it, saying, \u201cToo many families were broken up, too many communities were adversely affected.\u201d But when Mr. Lemon pressed Mrs. Clinton about why African-Americans should stand by her, she struggled a bit: \u201cSenator Sanders voted for it as well,\u201d she said. \u201cAre you going to ask him that question?\u201dMr. Sanders said there were parts of the legislation, like the Violence Against Women Act and the assault weapons ban, which he supported. \u201cThere are bills in Congress that have bad stuff. There are bills in Congress that have good stuff \u2014 good stuff and bad stuff in the same bill,\u201d he said, as Mrs. Clinton nodded.When each candidate was asked about racial blind spots, Mrs. Clinton said, \u201cBeing a white person in the United States of America, I know that I\u2019ve never had the experience that so many of the people in this audience have had.\u201d She urged white people to think about what it\u2019s like for African-American parents \u201cto have the talk with your kids\u201d about potentially getting in trouble with the police because of the color of their skin.Mr. Sanders spoke of friends who were discriminated against decades ago and of the Black Lives Matter movement today. \u201cWhen you\u2019re white, you don\u2019t know what it\u2019s like to be living in a ghetto, you don\u2019t know what it\u2019s like to be poor,\u201d he said. \u201cYou don\u2019t know what it\u2019s like to be hassled when you walk down the street or get dragged out of a car.\u201dOne of Mrs. Clinton\u2019s most uncomfortable moments came when she was asked about her comments in a 1996 speech about crime in which she referred to some young urban gang members as \u201csuper predators.\u201d Mrs. Clinton said that it had been \u201ca poor choice of words\u201d and that she had not used the term since then.Mr. Sanders, who seldom speaks of his Jewish faith, answered a question about it by saying he was \u201cvery proud of being Jewish\u201d and called it \u201can essential part of who I am as a human being.\u201d Recalling that his father\u2019s family was \u201cwiped out by Hitler in the Holocaust,\u201d he added, \u201cI know what crazy and radical and extremist politics mean. I learned that lesson as a tiny, tiny child.\u201dMrs. Clinton said she prays each day. \u201cI need that strength and I need that support,\u201d she said. \u201cI pray for the will of God to be known so that we can know it and, to the best of our limited ability, try to follow it and fulfill it.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misquoted Senator Bernie Sanders\u2019s comments about the public health emergency over lead-tainted water in Flint, Mich. He said that if he became president, he would fire anyone who had known what was happening and had not acted \u201cappropriately,\u201d not \u201caccordingly.\u201dAmy Chozick reported from Flint, and Patrick Healy from New York.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Chinese Problems on America\u2019s Shores", "Date": "2016-03-21", "News": "Supported byEditorialWhat is known is that people seek a safe haven for their money in uncertain times, and that usually means the United States. This is especially true now that the United States has higher interest rates than other developed economies.As money rushes in, regulators should be thinking about the lessons of the 2008 financial crisis. In such times, lenders tend to lower their standards and make questionable loans. In 2015, loans held by American banks expanded at the fastest pace since 2007, driven mainly by commercial-property loans and also by car loans, credit cards and residential mortgages. The surge far outpaced growth in the overall economy last year, a sign that too much money may be chasing too few good opportunities and that lenders may be compromising standards.Another lesson was that banks, hedge funds and other financial firms are often linked through speculative bets they place on financial developments. Currently, some American hedge funds are making large bets on a devaluation of China\u2019s currency in the next 12 to 18 months. Regulators should be anticipating how this could reverberate through the financial system.The lessons of the last financial crisis are clear. Less clear is whether regulators have the tools and the willingness to apply what they have learned to new circumstances and new threats.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Why Sanders Trails Clinton Among Minority Voters", "Date": "2016-03-21", "News": "Supported byTwo months later and on the eve of another important primary voting day, Mr. Sanders remains on the wrong side of a yawning gap among African-Americans even as his performance among whites has been impressive.One important reason for this may be that African-Americans have experienced somewhat more favorable economic trends in recent years. While still worse off than whites, African-Americans have seen their jobless rate fall a little further than whites have, relative to a prerecession average. Furthermore, the decline has been faster for African-Americans in the last year.Still, the economic data is sufficiently tentative and murky that it is unlikely to tell the full story.That is all the more true given the stark difference between Mr. Sanders\u2019s performance among working-class whites and African-Americans. Typically in Democratic primaries, insurgent liberal candidates fail to make significant inroads in either of these groups. But Mr. Sanders carried white working-class voters by large margins in states like Illinois, Massachusetts, Michigan and New Hampshire. He nearly tied Mrs. Clinton among white working-class voters in states where he otherwise lost badly, such as Florida and Ohio.Moreover, Mr. Sanders has done so while facing some of the same disadvantages that weigh him down with African-Americans: low name recognition and the group\u2019s longstanding affection for the Clinton family. Recent polling shows that Bill Clinton\u2019s favorability rating among working-class white Democrats is roughly equivalent to his rating among African-Americans.Perhaps a better explanation for Mr. Sanders\u2019s divergent performance is that while African-Americans and white working-class Democrats are experiencing broadly similar economic trends, they interpret them differently.\u201cThe major source of economic anxiety for working-class white men is not whether they have a job tomorrow,\u201d Mr. Garin said, \u201cit\u2019s that they still haven\u2019t had their personal recovery. Their recovery is about assets and income.\u201d For African-Americans, on the other hand, \u201cyou don\u2019t take job growth for granted.\u201dAn interactive delegate calculator that lets you simulate how the 2016 Republican nomination could unfold.He cited polling data showing that working-class white Democrats were roughly as concerned about inequality as they were about job growth and economic growth, while African-Americans were overwhelmingly concerned about the latter two. It is no surprise, Mr. Garin said, that Mrs. Clinton, who has had a similar emphasis in her campaign, did better among African-Americans, while Mr. Sanders\u2019s emphasis on inequality resonated more with whites.In a similar vein, there is anecdotal evidence suggesting that African-Americans and Hispanic voters are more likely to use the economy\u2019s recent low point, in 2008 and 2009, as the base line for their judgment than are whites, who may focus on more recent performance, where improvement has been less pronounced.David Simas, the White House political director, recalled sitting in on focus groups when he worked for the 2012 Obama campaign for ads that began by reminding voters how bleak the economy had been when Barack Obama first took office. \u201cThe folks who responded to it the most were African-Americans and Hispanic voters,\u201d he said.Mr. Minor said that while he received his health care through the Department of Veterans Affairs, many of his friends \u201chad no insurance and no possibility of getting insurance.\u201d\u201cObamacare has been a boon to them,\u201d he said.By contrast, many whites, who were insured at a higher rate than the other groups before the Affordable Care Act took effect, saw the program as detrimental to their interests. \u201cThe promise of Obamacare was to make it more affordable for everybody,\u201d said J. J. Price, a firefighter and union member in Roanoke, Va., who voted for Mr. Obama in 2008 but Mitt Romney in 2012. \u201cIt\u2019s done nothing but make it more expensive on us, the working class.\u201dMrs. Clinton, of course, has been a dogged defender of the Affordable Care Act, while Mr. Sanders has dwelled on the program\u2019s not going far enough. He prefers a single-payer system akin to expanding Medicare for the entire population.The dynamic on the Affordable Care Act suggests a broader difference when it comes to African-Americans and working-class whites: When Mr. Sanders implicitly criticizes Mr. Obama from the left, white working-class Democrats may see it as advocating for their economic interests, but the claims tend to fall flat with many blacks, among whom the president is still wildly popular.Larry Cohen, a senior adviser to Mr. Sanders and past president of the Communications Workers of America, said that Mrs. Clinton\u2019s perceived loyalty to the administration, as well as the nearly uniform support for Mrs. Clinton within the black political establishment, especially in the South, were key factors in limiting Mr. Sanders\u2019s support among African-Americans.Others largely agree. \u201cI don\u2019t think you can discount how important President Obama is,\u201d said Stanley B. Greenberg, a former Clinton White House pollster who recently conducted focus groups with African-American voters in Philadelphia and Cleveland. \u201cObama and his election and re-election is seen as on a scale of what the civil rights movement achieved.\u201dHe added that Mrs. Clinton, by way of her service in the administration and her eagerness to defend the president\u2019s policies on the campaign trail, \u201cis seen as having a more instinctive identification with Obama.\u201dGiovanni Russonello contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Fed\u2019s Plans to Raise Interest Rates Are Delayed, Not Derailed", "Date": "2016-03-13", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Federal Reserve officials will gather in Washington on Tuesday and Wednesday to debate whether a bumpy start to the year is now in the rearview mirror, clearing the way for higher interest rates.The Fed is not likely to raise rates this week, but the steady growth of the domestic economy \u2014 despite the wobbles of financial markets and the weakness of other developed nations \u2014 is strengthening the hand of officials who say that higher rates are necessary to maintain control of price inflation.The challenge now confronting Janet L. Yellen, the Fed\u2019s chairwoman, is forging a consensus among Fed officials about how soon to resume the march begun in December, when the Fed raised rates, by 0.25 percent, for the first time since the financial crisis.Some Fed officials still emphasize caution, arguing there is little risk in moving slowly. Lael Brainard, a Fed governor, has been particularly vocal in warning that the weakness of the global economy could weigh on domestic growth.Financial conditions tightened early in the year as investors pulled back from riskier loans and demanded higher interest rates. The effect by the end of January was the equivalent of the Fed raising rates by one percentage point, according to economists at Goldman Sachs.But the tightening has almost completely reversed. The Dow Jones industrial average, which lost 10 percent of its value during the first six weeks of the year, has rebounded and is now down just 1 percent this year. Indeed, some analysts say the Fed overreacted and should have preserved the option of a rate increase in March.\u201cWe get that when it comes to monetary policy, concerns about market stability and global headwinds have trumped the resilience in the U.S. economy,\u201d said Tom Porcelli, chief United States economist at RBC Capital Markets. \u201cBut even here, there has been considerable improvement.\u201dBut analysts do not expect the Fed to surprise investors, who have written off the chances of a policy change this week. Instead, most are looking for the Fed to signal that rate increases will resume in the coming months.The Fed\u2019s next scheduled meetings are in April and June.Wage growth remains slow, which some Fed officials see as evidence that employers are still finding an abundance of candidates for available jobs. Such slack in the labor market might suggest the Fed should persist in its stimulus campaign.In a recent analysis, however, researchers at the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco argued that the weakness of wage growth reflected a shift in the composition of the work force as relatively high-paid baby boomers retire and companies hire younger, cheaper workers.Ms. Brainard suggested last month that the Fed might be limited in its ability to raise rates at a time when other major central banks are pressing ahead with stimulus campaigns. The divergence tends to amplify the impact of rate increases, for example by increasing the value of the dollar and restraining exports.The central banks of Japan and China are also continuing to pump money.Economists at Goldman Sachs, however, concluded in a recent analysis that the current differences among the major central banks were not \u201cunusual or implausible\u201d by the standards of recent decades.If the economic fortunes of the United States continue to diverge from those of other developed nations, it is likely that the Fed\u2019s path will diverge, too.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "To Woo Apple, Foxconn Bets $3.5 Billion on Sharp", "Date": "2016-03-30", "News": "Supported byHONG KONG \u2014 The Apple iPhone transformed the technology industry by popularizing the smartphone and blazing a path to a mobile future. But to do it, the company needed an important ally: a penny-pinching Taiwan-based factory operator named Foxconn.Employing hundreds of thousands of workers at vast facilities in mainland China, Foxconn figured out a way to assemble the iPhone at a cost low enough that middle-class Americans could afford it. The business offered low profit margins, but the work buffed Foxconn\u2019s financial results and cemented its status as the world\u2019s largest maker of hardware for companies like Apple and Sony.Those relationships are now shifting \u2014 and Foxconn is betting heavily to keep up.On Wednesday, Foxconn said it had struck a deal to acquire control of the Japanese screen maker Sharp for $3.5 billion, after weeks of negotiations and high-profile setbacks.The deal, for a 66 percent stake in Sharp, is intended to make Foxconn a more attractive partner for Apple. The American technology company uses Sharp screens, which could give Foxconn added leverage in dealings between the two.The screen is an especially lucrative piece of the smartphone, costing as much as $54 each, according to estimates by the research firm IHS. Sharp provides roughly 25 percent of the iPhone displays, IHS said.Still, the Sharp purchase will saddle Foxconn with an ailing business that will take considerable money and effort to turn around, some analysts say. Reflecting those problems, the purchase price is $2 billion lower than a deal the two sides struck just last month, after Sharp disclosed the potential for costly problems \u2014 nearly $3 billion in potential liabilities \u2014 down the road.But Apple has been diversifying its supply chain, giving some production contracts to other assemblers and component makers. And Foxconn is grappling with China\u2019s rising labor costs and a slowdown in the global smartphone market.The deal highlights the huge pressure that the industry\u2019s shifting dynamics are placing on Foxconn.\u201cOn the one hand, you can see why Foxconn is trying to do it. It\u2019s not clear the economics make sense, but it\u2019s that they need to control more and more of the supply chain,\u201d said Willy C. Shih, a professor at Harvard Business School. He noted that Apple might soon switch to screens made by other producers.The deal is a return to form for Foxconn \u2014 formally known as Hon Hai Precision Industry \u2014 in its emphasis on scale. The company has been looking in recent years for ways to further cut costs, including investment in automation. It has also expanded into businesses potentially more lucrative than unskilled-work manufacturing, opening factories producing new technology like batteries for electric cars. It even created incubators to help hardware start-ups.Foxconn, most of whose factories are in China, is emblematic of the challenges facing the Chinese economy at large. Even while it tries to maintain the huge scale and efficiency of its production base, it is trying to climb the value chain to find new, more profitable streams of revenue.Near Beijing, Foxconn operates a hardware incubator called Innoconn, which helps start-ups with production management while looking for investment targets.Liu Haoyang, a founder of Noitom, a company that makes motion-capture sensors and hardware, said Foxconn had approached Noitom when it was seeking crowdfunding for a sample product in 2014. Ultimately, Foxconn gave Noitom advice, and it now helps Noitom produce, Mr. Liu said.\u201cThey make parts of high complexity for us,\u201d he said. \u201cAverage factories aren\u2019t able to make this type of thing, never mind in small batches.\u201dFoxconn, founded in Taiwan as a maker of television knobs in 1974 by Mr. Gou, became a company with more than $100 billion in annual revenue by making things for other companies. Starting in the 1990s, as orders poured in to make personal computers, Mr. Gou built new and larger factories in China, culminating in the city-size Longhua plant in Shenzhen, near Hong Kong.At the Longhua complex, Foxconn coordinates more than 100,000 workers assembling devices \u2014 including the iPhone \u2014 in daily and nightly shifts, and the feeding, clothing and planning for the turnover of workers are gargantuan challenges. The company developed recreation facilities for the campus and designed a kitchen able to churn out the huge amounts of food necessary to feed tens of thousands of workers each day.A marvel of modern manufacturing, the Longhua plant is the most extreme example of Foxconn\u2019s philosophy of maximizing efficiency through enormous scale, though in some ways the Longhua plant has proved too large. It was there in 2010 that a series of worker suicides drew international scrutiny from workers\u2019 rights groups and the news media. The company put nets on the sides of buildings to catch would-be jumpers. On many buildings the nets still sag today.Foxconn\u2019s sales growth has slowed to single-digit percentages in the last two years from the double-digit growth it posted in the past, although profit growth has picked up recently, thanks in part to consumers buying bigger, more expensive phones with bigger screens.While Foxconn\u2019s revenue has been padded by booming orders for less-expensive Chinese-branded smartphones, increased competition from China-based suppliers has been a concern highlighted by analysts. Also, Apple, as part of its efforts to diversify its supply chain, has given orders for iPhone assembly to Pegatron, another Taiwan-based contract manufacturer, which operates a huge factory near Shanghai.Foxconn\u2019s previous takeovers of screen makers have not played out well. In 2010, it took over a Taiwan screen maker, Chimei Innolux, for nearly $10 billion; analysts say the acquisition has failed to produce the efficiencies and profitability hoped for.In Sharp, Foxconn picks up screen-making operations that have long been unprofitable and costlier than those of its rivals in China. Alberto Moel, an analyst at Sanford C.

Yellen, the chairwoman of the Federal Reserve, Mr. Obama praised the Dodd-Frank reform law, the Volcker Rule that seeks to prevent proprietary trading and the creation of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, which is intended to make the world as safe from bad mortgages as it is from bad toasters.\u201cI want to emphasize this because it is popular in the media, in political discourse \u2014 both on the left and the right \u2014 to suggest that the crisis happened and nothing changed,\u201d he said sternly.\u201cThat is not true. Let me repeat that. In fact, we went at financial regulation very hard to guard against another era of \u2018too big to fail\u2019 and some of the systemic disruptions that occurred because of lax regulation. It has helped us crack down on irresponsible behavior.\u201dHe spoke about how the big banks had collectively raised $700 billion more capital, how there were now mechanisms for \u201corderly unwinding\u201d banks that get into financial trouble without having to bail them out and how financial derivatives were in the process of being more heavily regulated. He painted a pretty rosy picture of how extensively things have changed on Wall Street and in Washington to try to prevent the kind of financial meltdown we endured.The problem is that regulation alone will not change the bad behavior that occasionally breaks out into the open on Wall Street and often leads to disasters on Main Street.Wall Street is not like other industries. As repulsive as it is that executives at Volkswagen sought to evade United States\u2019 emission standards, that deceit is not likely to bring down the world\u2019s economy.But when things go wrong on Wall Street, the consequences can be devastating for the rest of us. On Wall Street, contagion is a real problem. That is why it is not enough to require banks to hold more capital or to have them reduce the amount of risky assets they have leveraged on their balance sheets or to prevent them from making the kinds of proprietary bets that sometimes go awry.Two things still need to change on Wall Street for there to be meaningful reform. First, the culture of what constitutes success inside a Wall Street firm \u2013 who gets promoted and put in charge and for what reasons \u2014 needs to change. Second, the compensation system needs a total revamp so that bankers, traders and executives are no longer rewarded for taking big risks with other people\u2019s money, putting themselves in a position to win big if their risk-taking pays off but not to be held accountable if things go wrong.The good news, if there is any, is that some lip service has been paid to trying to change Wall Street\u2019s culture. Twice in the last two years, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York has held closed-door meetings and seminars with many of the leaders of Wall Street companies to convey to them that Wall Street\u2019s behavior must change or change will be imposed upon it.Even less has changed about the compensation system on Wall Street. People are rewarded for closing deals, underwriting stocks and bonds, securitizing mortgages, car loans and credit-card receivables, and trading with counterparties. They are rewarded for putting together the people who have capital with the people who want capital. That is a hugely important function, assuming we like capitalism and want it to keep functioning properly.But too often on Wall Street, the enduring lust by bankers, traders and executives for big annual bonuses results in behavior that benefits them at our expense. Notwithstanding talk of clawbacks and lower overall pay, the compensation system on Wall Street remains untouched after the crisis. That means that the very system that regulates what people do every day on Wall Street remains the same.To his credit, President Obama recognized at the White House meeting on March 7 that the compensation system on Wall Street remains broken.\u201cWe still have work to do to complete regulations related to executive compensation to make sure that individuals who are working in these financial institutions are less incentivized to take big, reckless risks that could end up harming our financial sector over all,\u201d he said.He\u2019s right about that. And that\u2019s one of the reasons I lament his departure from the Oval Office next January: There\u2019s virtually no chance that either Donald Trump or Hillary Clinton will touch this subject.William D. Cohan is a former senior mergers and acquisitions banker who has written three books about Wall Street.

{"Headline": "Jamaica, Beyond the Beach", "Date": "2016-03-31", "News": "The nation is recasting itself as a glamour and eco-tourism destination, but its African-inflected culture is what lulls you.Supported byI was trying not to slip as I traipsed over the stone pavement in the drizzle at the old fort at Port Royal in Kingston, the \u201cwickedest city in Christendom,\u201d a warren of iniquity and plunder, a den of pirates and buccaneers and the core of British naval power in the Antilles for 200 years.As a retired coast guard captain who was born there and lived nowhere else in his 60 years led me around, conjuring up scenes of mayhem, killers, whores and smugglers, I scanned the remains of the fort, nearly deserted that morning, and saw nothing that remained of the glories past. Ruminating about the eerily quiet grounds, the captain sighed and recalled the historic turning point of the Port Royal story, the midday hour on June 7, 1692, when an earthquake toppled most of the city and 2,000 people into the sea, the day Port Royal became a ghost town.The British turned the island into a huge sugar plantation, its wealthiest colony in the Caribbean and the hub of slave trade in the Americas. Planters built magnificent houses high above their sugar cane fields, and lived lives of idleness, gorging on drink and wanton sex with slaves.But it seems something is changing. The government is stable after long periods of tumult, and it is pushing to rein in crimes against foreigners, gang-and-drugs shootings, and evangelist-reinforced homophobia. The economy is still wobbly but showing some signs of health, and tourism, the island\u2019s No. 1 industry, on which many Jamaicans depend for a living, has risen to at least 1.5 million visitors a year.16 PhotosJamaica has, of course, been a player in the Caribbean tourist game, but competition is stiffer and so are the stakes now that Cuba has opened up and inched ahead of Jamaica in the number of visitors in 2015. Jamaica already lags well behind the Dominican Republic and Puerto Rico, but it hopes that new mega-resorts and other investments will create badly needed jobs and energize the private sector.With a per-capita income estimated at $9,000 (it\u2019s $15,200 in Puerto Rico and $9,700 in the Dominican Republic) and an approximate 16 percent unemployment rate, Jamaica is grappling with the steady exodus of thousands of its 2.9 million people to New York, Miami and London.For all the three centuries that Britain ruled Jamaica, though, the island\u2019s deepest influence is not English. It is African. It is folk magic, spiritual and superstitious. It is musical, the poetry of the hills and the streets, the rhythms you hear in the way Jamaicans speak, the imploding pulse that runs from east to west, from the resort-strewn north coast to the rougher south, through bamboo-shaded foothills and cloud-covered peaks and the wind-driven tides that roll up on this island of old myths and spiritual power.Folk magic out of West Africa, not unlike Haiti\u2019s voodoo and Cuba\u2019s Santeria, feeds the Jamaican belief in superstition, witches and ghosts. Magic runs through a pervasive fundamentalist and evangelical Christian society that breeds revivalist cults that speak in tongues and believe in spirit possession. Rastafarians are something else. Born out of poor and black Jamaicans, they worship inner divinity, hold ganja smoking as a sacrament, and are as essentially Jamaican as reggae.\u201cReggae is synonymous with social consciousness,\u201d a young Jamaican woman told me. \u201cIt means black empowerment. It means Marcus Garvey (the father of the black power movement). It means Rastafarianism.\u201dThis was the Jamaica that I wanted to get to know better.So that night I avoided the mobbed dance hall parties like Weddy Weddy Wednesdays and went to Redbones Blues Cafe, the highly acclaimed venue for Bob Marley\u2019s musical heirs and a beehive of culture, art exhibitions, foreign films and poetry nights.I hit it on a poetry night. It was raining off and on. The stage was soaked, and managers were fussing around, clipboards in hand. The bar was buzzing. Next to me, a graying ponytailed foreigner in a white seersucker suit was whispering to his blond girlfriend. Dressy couples held up cocktails and clustered under the bar\u2019s roof. Eavesdropping while sipping a Jamaican-style caipirinha, I ran my eyes over bar walls papered with photos of jazz and blues greats, while, oddly enough, American lounge music played in the background.The next day, after a three-hour, stomach-churning ride through the mountains, Jamaica\u2019s limpid blue skies and gorgeous seashore came to view. The resort city of Ocho Rios and the smaller coastal towns were bustling. People mingled on sidewalks and plazas, storefronts and markets, food stalls and at the Juici Patties, the local fast-food joints. I wanted to walk around, have a bite, but time was short. I had to get to Montego Bay.MoBay was just 30 or 45 minutes away on the North Coast highway. Its fabled resorts are secluded behind high fortress walls, forests of trees and steel gates. Once behind those gates, Jamaica seemed to disappear. Well, not all Jamaica. The sea was there, and the hills, and bartenders, housekeepers and porters speaking English salted with patois, exclaiming, \u201cMilady, milady, welcome!\u201dI had imagined Montego Bay would glitter with opulent hotels and restaurants, clubs and shops \u2014 and it did, in the resorts \u2014 but the town\u2019s Hip Strip (Gloucester Avenue) was a letdown, lined with midrange hotels, bed-and-breakfasts, hostels, souvenir shops, jerk food stands, hustlers, and Jimmy Buffett\u2019s Margaritaville, maybe MoBay\u2019s most popular club. It was the version of Jamaica that its tourism folks wanted to rethink.I hit the city on the last Friday of the month, when folks get paid and go downtown to spend their money. St. James Street was a clogged artery of cars, trucks and buses, a revolving elbow-to-elbow mass of people going through food stalls, bars, clothing stores, haberdasheries, computer depots, supermarkets, carwashes and plazas reverberating with the earsplitting sounds of hawking vendors, chattering voices and full-volume music. I wanted to step down and join in, but I also wanted to get out of there.After fumes and crowds, I was hoping for a drink and fabulous food. Friends had talked up Scotchies, the island\u2019s best known jerk emporium. I had expected one of those smoky places with picnic tables and paper tablecloths. I found a quaint roadside joint with an open-air bar and a few outdoor tables for large groups. A dozen customers, foreigners mostly, were knocking back Red Stripe and digging into servings of jerk pork. I ordered the same. The beer was ice-cold, but the pork was tough and tasteless. I kept pouring a spicy goop over it but it didn\u2019t help.A day later, on my way to Negril\u2019s West End \u2014 after my debit card was \u201ceaten\u201d by a Scotiabank A.T.M. at a Kingston shopping mall and after putting up with unreliable land transport \u2014 I wasn\u2019t sure I would ever have a great day in Jamaica, or worse, that I would ever feel that inexplicable connection to the island that I had felt in Antigua and San Juan and Havana.Two hours down the Norman Manley Highway south to Negril, flashing by speeding bicyclists and motorcyclists, herds of baby goats, bold-paint wood-and-tin homes and the open sea, Jamaica began to work its charms on me.It was visually fabulous with flowers in bloom, bougainvillea vines and almond trees, and shaded winding paths that led to hexagonal thatched-roofed villas of timber and stone looking out to the sea. At a glance, Rockhouse lived up to its reputation, one of the loveliest boutique hotels in the Caribbean.But extreme contrasts are inevitable in Jamaica. Across the road from Rockhouse\u2019s fancy gift shop, several ramshackle souvenir shops sold typical tourist wares \u2014 T-shirts, flimsy dresses, scarfs, hats and trinkets \u2014 and a short ride from the eco-centric serenity of Rockhouse, hundreds of tourists flocked to Rick\u2019s Caf\u00e9, a boisterous bar-restaurant-music hangout with a cliff-diving show, super bars and sensational sunsets.I checked out the scene one afternoon, tried to get a bar stool but gave up fighting the crowd. A singer was dancing on the stage, and people swilling from paper cups clapped to the rhythm. Soon, rather suddenly, as it does in the tropics, the sun went down, and with that the party broke up. The crowd streamed out, pushing and shoving. Tour buses, vans and taxis packed with riders lumbered out of the parking lot. It was a crazy scene, as crazy as Negril\u2019s infamous boat parties and bar shuttles.That evening at the Rockhouse, I was having a drink and chatting with an American couple who came back every year, had married and honeymooned there. Even with its high occupancy rate, the hotel opens its restaurants to the public. Expats living in Negril make it their club, where you might meet old-time hippies in sandals like Janet, a blustery San Franciscan who married a local 27 years ago and is building a house with a swimming pool on a hill.At the bar of the main restaurant, which doubles as a community center with easy chairs and sofas, books and the only TV in the resort, a small group of women was cracking jokes about the risqu\u00e9 show at the Jungle nightclub on Ladies Night Out. They\u2019d come from Alberta, Canada, and were letting loose and splurging on cocktails, crispy fried snapper and cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e.Early morning, I was on a sleep cloud, tucked in on a pillowed four-poster bed, a slow ceiling fan ruffling a pinned-up muslin mosquito net. Jumping off the bed, I opened the shuttered doors to my private deck. The roiling sea melded with the distant blurry horizon, and I watched as a small boat with a single passenger, man or woman I couldn\u2019t tell, heaved and tossed in the rough sea. Waves leapt, crashed and spat foam maybe 50 feet high against the Rockhouse cliffs. From somewhere on the nearby road drifted the lilting music you hear everywhere you go in Jamaica, the soundtrack of the island.Later, only a 15-minute drive away, I was dipping my feet in the sea, strolling along the popular (and overbuilt) Seven-Mile Beach. The fluffy white-sand strip was crowded already. Tourists were ensconced in lounge chairs, their bodies laid out to toast. A rangy vendor with dreadlocks, hollow cheeks and bony legs followed me, dangling a bunch of bananas in one hand and clutching a plastic sack containing who knows what. Peddlers and hustlers are a plague all over Jamaica, but this guy didn\u2019t push it. When I said \u201cno\u201d politely, he backed off.Grateful, I picked up my walk on the lumpy wet sand. The sea sloshed around my feet, splashing my legs. Glass-bottom boats and fishing charters swayed in shallow waters, waiting to take divers and snorkelers to the coral reefs and grottoes that make this Jamaica\u2019s dreamiest coast.I had been in Jamaica five days, and finally I was steeping myself in the singsong and blithe spirit of the island.I had a few hours left, so I went out to the sun, ordered a gin and tonic at the beachside Cedar Bar, and found a lounge chair near a gaggle of young Brits, Virgin Atlantic crew members on a two-day layover. That evening they had a party and wanted me to go along. I had other plans. I had a predawn wake-up call to catch my flight out.After a wonderful dinner outdoors at the hotel, I took my time going through Seagrape Terrace, where guests had gathered for a musical nightcap with a Jamaican singer. I listened for a while and walked down the beach. In the distance I thought I heard the familiar words, \u201cOne love, one heart, let\u2019s get together and be all right.\u201dIF YOU GODaily rates, shown in U.S. dollars, may change seasonally and do not include taxes and fees.

{"Headline": "Transcript of Mitt Romney\u2019s Speech on Donald Trump", "Date": "2016-03-03", "News": "Supported byROMNEY: Thank you. Thank you.(APPLAUSE) Thank you, Jason, and thank you to the Hinckley Institute, Governor Herbert, Lieutenant Governor, President, it\u2019s good to be with you today.Thank you. All right.(APPLAUSE)Now, I\u2019m \u2014 I\u2019m not here to announce my candidacy for office. And I\u2019m not going to endorse a candidate today. Instead, I would like to offer my perspective on the nominating process of my party.Back in 1964, just days before the presidential election \u2014 which, incidentally, we lost \u2014 Ronald Reagan went on national television and challenged America, saying that it was a time for choosing. He saw two paths for America, one that embraced conservative principles, dedicated to lifting people out of poverty and helping create opportunity for all.And the other, an oppressive government that would lead America down a darker, less free path. I\u2019m no Ronald Reagan and this is a different moment in time, but I believe with all my heart and soul, that we face another time for choosing, one that will have profound consequences for the Republican Party, and more importantly, for our country.I say this, in part, because of my conviction that America is poised to lead the world for another century. Our technology engines, our innovation dynamic, the ambition and skill of our people are going to propel our economy and raise the standard of living of Americans.America will remain, as it is today, the envy of the world. You may have seen Warren Buffett. He said, and I think he\u2019s 100 percent right, that \u201cThe babies being born in America today are the luckiest crop in history.\u201dNow, that doesn\u2019t mean we don\u2019t have real problems and serious challenges. We do. At home, poverty persists. And wages are stagnant. The horrific massacres of Paris and San Bernardino. The nuclear ambitions of the Iranian mullahs. The aggressions of Putin. The growing assertiveness of China and the nuclear tests of North Korea confirm that we live in troubled and dangerous times.But if we make the right choices, America\u2019s future will be even better than our past and better than our present.On the other hand, if we make improvident choices, the bright horizon I\u2019ve described will not materialize. And let me put it very plainly. If we Republicans choose Donald Trump as our nominee, the prospects for a safe and prosperous future are greatly diminished.Let me explain why I say that. First on the economy. If Donald Trump\u2019s plans were ever implemented, the country would sink into prolonged recession. A few examples. His proposed 35 percent tariff-like penalties would instigate a trade war and that would raise prices for consumers, kill our export jobs and lead entrepreneurs and businesses of all stripes to flee America.His tax plan in combination with his refusal to reform entitlements and honestly address spending would balloon the deficit and the national debt. So even though Donald Trump has offered very few specific economic plans, what little he has said is enough to know that he would be very bad for American workers and for American families.But you say, wait, wait, wait, isn\u2019t he a huge business success? Doesn\u2019t he know what he\u2019s talking about? No, he isn\u2019t and no he doesn\u2019t.(APPLAUSE)Look, his bankruptcies have crushed small businesses and the men and women who work for them. He inherited his business, he didn\u2019t create it. And whatever happened to Trump Airlines? How about Trump University? And then there\u2019s Trump Magazine and Trump Vodka and Trump Steaks and Trump Mortgage. A business genius he is not.Now, not every policy that Donald Trump has floated is bad, of course. He wants to repeal and replace Obamacare. He wants to bring jobs home from China and Japan. But his prescriptions to do those things are flimsy at best. At the last debate, all he could remember about his health care plan was to remove insurance boundaries between states. Successfully bringing jobs home requires serious policy and reforms that make America the place businesses want to come, want to plant and want to grow. You can\u2019t punish business into doing what you want.Frankly, the only serious policy proposals that deal with a broad range of national challenges we confront today come from Ted Cruz, Marco Rubio and John Kasich. One of these men should be our nominee.(APPLAUSE) Now, I know that some people want this race to be over. They look at history and say a trend like Mr. Trump\u2019s isn\u2019t going to be stopped. Perhaps. But the rules of political history have pretty much all been shredded during this campaign.(LAUGHTER)If the other candidates can find some common ground, I believe we can nominate a person who can win the general election and who will represent the values and policies of conservatism. Given the current delegate selection process, that means that I\u2019d vote for Marco Rubio in Florida and for John Kasich in Ohio and for Ted Cruz or whichever one of the other two contenders has the best chance of beating Mr. Trump in a given state.Now let me turn to national security and the safety of our homes and loved ones. Mr. Trump\u2019s bombast is already alarming the allies and fueling the enmity of our enemies. Insulting all Muslims will keep many of them from fully engaging with us in the urgent fight against ISIS, and for what purpose? Muslim terrorists would only have to lie about their religion to enter the country.And then what he said about on \u201c60 Minutes\u201d. Did you hear this? It was about Syria and ISIS, and it has to go down as the most ridiculous and dangerous idea of the entire campaign season. Let ISIS take out Assad, he said, and then we can pick up the remnants.Now, think about that. Let the most dangerous terror organization the world has ever known take over an entire country? This recklessness is recklessness in the extreme. Now, Donald Trump tells us that he is very, very smart.(LAUGHTER)I\u2019m afraid that when it comes to foreign policy he is very, very not smart.(APPLAUSE)Now, I\u2019m far from the first to conclude that Donald Trump lacks the temperament to be president. After all, this is an individual who mocked a disabled reporter, who attributed a reporter\u2019s questions to her menstrual cycle, who mocked a brilliant rival who happened to be a woman due to her appearance, who bragged about his marital affairs, and who laces his public speeches with vulgarity.Donald Trump says he admires Vladimir Putin, at the same time he has called George W. Bush a liar. That is a twisted example of evil trumping good.(APPLAUSE)There is a dark irony in his boasts of his sexual exploits during the Vietnam War. While at the same time, John McCain, whom he has mocked, was imprisoned and tortured.Dishonesty is Donald Trump\u2019s hallmark. He claimed that he had spoken clearly and boldly against going into Iraq.Wrong. He spoke in favor of invading Iraq. He said he saw thousands of Muslims in New Jersey celebrating 9/11.Wrong. He saw no such thing. He imagined it. He\u2019s not of the temperament of the kind of stable, thoughtful person we need as a leader. His imagination must not be married to real power. The president of the United States has long been the leader of the free world.The president and, yes, even the nominees of the country\u2019s great parties helped define America to billions of people around the world. All of them bear the responsibility of being an example for our children and our grandchildren.Think of Donald Trump\u2019s personal qualities. The bullying, the greed, the showing off, the misogyny, the absurd third grade theatrics. You know, we have long referred to him as \u201cThe Donald.\u201d He\u2019s the only person in the entire country to whom we have added an article before his name, and it was not because he had attributes we admired.(LAUGHTER)Now, imagine your children and your grandchildren acting the way he does. Would you welcome that? Haven\u2019t we seen before what happens when people in prominent positions fail the basic responsibility of honorable conduct? We have. And it always injures our families and our country.Watch, by the way, how he responds to my speech today.(APPLAUSE)Will he talk about our policy differences? Or will he attack me with every imaginable low road insult? This may tell you what you need to know about his temperament, his stability and his suitability to be president.Now, Mr. Trump relishes any poll that reflects what he thinks of himself. But polls are also saying that he will lose to Hillary Clinton. Think about that. On Hillary Clinton\u2019s watch, the State Department, when she was guiding it and part of the Obama administration, that State Department watched as America\u2019s interests were diminished at every corner of the world.She compromised our national secrets. She dissembled to the families of the slain. And she jettisoned her most profound beliefs to gain presidential power. For the last three decades, the Clintons have lived at the intersection of money and politics, trading their political influence to enrich their personal finances.They embody the term, \u201ccrony capitalism.\u201d It disgusts the American people and causes them to lose faith in our political process. A person so untrustworthy and dishonest as Hillary Clinton must not become president.(APPLAUSE)Of course, a Trump nomination enables her victory. And the audio and video of the infamous Tapper-Trump exchange on the Ku Klux Klan will play 100,000 times on cable and who knows how many million times on social media. There are a number of people who claim that Mr. Trump is a con man, a fake \u2014 thank you.(LAUGHTER)(APPLAUSE)Let me say that again. There\u2019s plenty of evidence that Mr. Trump is a con man, a fake. Mr. Trump has changed his positions not just over the years, but over the course of the campaign. And on the Ku Klux Klan, daily for three days in a row.We will only really know if he\u2019s a real deal or a phony if he releases his tax returns and the tape of his interview with The New York Times. I predict that there are more bombshells in his tax returns. I predict that he doesn\u2019t give much, if anything, to the disabled and to our veterans. I predict that he told The New York Times that his immigration talk is just that \u2014 talk.And I predict that despite his promise to do so, first made over a year ago, that he will never ever release his tax returns. Never \u2014 not the returns under audit; not even the returns that are no longer being audited. He has too much to hide. Nor will he authorize the release of the tapes that he made with The New York Times.If I\u2019m right, you\u2019ll have all the proof you need to know that Donald Trump is indeed a phony. Attacking me as he surely will won\u2019t prove him any less of a phony. It\u2019s entirely in his hands to prove me wrong. All he has to do is release his back taxes like he promised he would and let us hear what he said behind closed doors to The New York Times.You know, Ronald Reagan used to quote a Scottish philosopher, who predicted that democracies and civilizations wouldn\u2019t last much longer than a couple hundred years. And John Adams wrote this, \u201cRemember, democracy never lasts long; it soon wastes, exhausts and murders itself. There never was a democracy yet that did not commit suicide.\u201d That\u2019s John Adams.I believe that America has proven these dire predictions wrong for two reasons. First, we\u2019ve been blessed with great presidents, with giants among us. Men of character, integrity and selflessness have led our nation from the very beginning. None were perfect. Each surely made mistakes. But in every case, they acted out of the desire to do what was right for America and for the cause of freedom.The second reason is because we\u2019re blessed with a great people \u2014 people who at every critical moment of choosing have put the interests of the country above their own. These two things are related. Our presidents time and again have called on us to rise to the occasion. John F. Kennedy asked us to consider what we could do for our country. Lincoln drew upon the better angels of our nature to save the union.I understand the anger Americans feel today. In the past, our presidents have channeled that anger and forged it into resolve, into endurance and high purpose, and into the will to defeat the enemies of freedom. Our anger was transformed into energy directed for good.Mr. Trump is directing our anger for less than noble purposes. He creates scapegoats of Muslims and Mexican immigrants. He calls for the use of torture. He calls for killing the innocent children and family members of terrorists. He cheers assaults on protesters. He applauds the prospect of twisting the Constitution to limit First Amendment freedom of the press.This is the very brand of anger that has led other nations into the abyss.Here\u2019s what I know. Donald Trump is a phony, a fraud. His promises are as worthless as a degree from Trump University.(APPLAUSE)He\u2019s playing the members of the American public for suckers. He gets a free ride to the White House and all we get is a lousy hat.(LAUGHTER)His domestic policies would lead to recession. His foreign policies would make America and the world less safe. He has neither the temperament nor the judgment to be president and his personal qualities would mean that America would cease to be a shining city on a hill.I\u2019m convinced America has greatness ahead. And this is a time for choosing. God bless us to choose a nominee who will make that vision a reality.Thank you and God bless you all.(APPLAUSE)Thank you.(APPLAUSE)Advertisement"}

But many within the European Union believe that more integration is necessary for the project to succeed. Britons in favor of leaving the union want more control of their laws, a sign of the fragile state of the British economy.

{"Headline": "A Red Carpet for Amazon in Fall River, Mass., and Hopes for More", "Date": "2016-03-29", "News": "Supported bySquare FeetFALL RIVER, Mass. \u2014 For this former mill town, the deal to secure a large Amazon distribution center means much more than the $3.78 million coming from the land sale and the successful culmination of three years\u2019 worth of negotiations.\u201cAny time you have a corporate giant making a commitment to a city, that speaks volumes,\u201d said Kenneth Fiola Jr., executive vice president of the Fall River Office of Economic Development, which worked closely with state officials and the broker NAI Hunneman to bring in the online retailer. \u201cIt gave us enhanced credibility.\u201dCredibility to attract other large companies, for one thing. And the deal for an over one-million-square-foot distribution center also gives Fall River, a southeastern Massachusetts city of about 89,000 people, cash to tackle a long list of improvements planned for its downtown business district. It is the latest step in a strategy that Mr. Fiola and other civic leaders are pursuing to encourage urban investment and redevelopment.Like other former mill towns throughout the Northeast, Fall River necessarily refocused its economic base after the textile industry began departing in the 1990s. The city negotiated with the state and federal government for tax incentives to lure biomedical manufacturers and others into the area.\u201cYou\u2019re seeing a city reinvent itself,\u201d said Robert A. Mellion, president and chief executive of the Fall River Area Chamber of Commerce. \u201cIt didn\u2019t happen by accident. It\u2019s an effort to design and implement an economy that\u2019s sustainable for the long haul.\u201dLocal businesses, many in the health care sector, have also been growing, which is good news for James J. Karam, president and chief executive of the property firm First Bristol, which owns three buildings downtown.\u201cI have two 50,000-square-foot buildings that are 100 percent occupied by local firms,\u201d Mr. Karam said. He bought his third building, which is 100,000 square feet, from Travelers Insurance, which reduced its footprint and now leases 40,000 square feet from First Bristol. \u201cWe\u2019re at 75 percent occupancy in the remaining space, up from 40 percent in just one year. It\u2019s been going quite well,\u201d he said.For its part, Amazon, which did not respond to requests for comment, is expected to hire 500 people when its $36 million warehouse opens this fall. The Trammell Crow Company is developing the project on 77 acres in the SouthCoast Life Science & Technology Park, one of three municipally owned industrial zones. It is a 10-minute drive north from Fall River\u2019s downtown. The city worked with the state to make the zones as attractive as possible: expediting development approvals, for instance, and improving site access by securing federal funds to build a new highway interchange off Route 24, which opened in 2012.\u201cThe only permits that Amazon had to get were building permits,\u201d said Michael DiGiano, an executive vice president with NAI Hunneman. Cathy Minnerly, another NAI executive vice president who is also a principal, added: \u201cThe fact it was shovel-ready was a very large point.\u201dShortly after the deal was announced in November, Fall River\u2019s redevelopment agency moved forward with rehabilitating Old Second Street, a 1960s-era pedestrian mall in the heart of downtown, by hiring an architectural firm based in Boston, Brown, Richardson & Rowe.The revival of this corridor fits neatly with the agenda of Fall River\u2019s newly elected mayor, Jasiel Correia II. Since taking office in January, Mr. Correia has reinitiated a matching grant program for downtown building owners who want to improve their facades. He also has hired the marketing firm Penrose Commercial, based in Boston and Providence, R.I., to plan a new strategy for selling vacant city-owned properties.Mr. Correia, who turned 24 shortly before taking office, aims to create a live-work-play environment downtown. His goal is to attract young professionals who might be priced out of Providence, another former mill city nearby that has successfully reinvented itself.\u201cI understand the challenges people my age are facing, the desires and opportunities that they have and want,\u201d he said. \u201cFall River, a community with a lot of growth potential, is really prime for someone to take it by the horns and really start to develop it.\u201dDevelopers are already doing just that. Construction began last fall on apartments within the mixed-use complex Commonwealth Landing. For the investors Anthony Cordeiro, Larry Couto and Alan Macomber, this $18 million project represents the third and final phase of redeveloping a 228,000-square-foot waterfront mill building originally occupied by Quaker Fabric.Mr. Cordeiro, Mr. Couto and Mr. Macomber bought the property at a bankruptcy sale in 2010. A combination of state and federal tax credits allowed them to construct offices, two restaurants and a training center for Bristol Community College within Commonwealth Landing\u2019s bottom two floors. The new 103 apartments within the building\u2019s top three stories will be the first exclusively market-rate multifamily housing built in Fall River for a generation.Mr. Cordeiro hopes that the units\u2019 high-end finishes like granite countertops and amenities like an adjacent river walkway will attract millennials and empty-nesters once the project is complete early next year.\u201cWe\u2019ll retain as much of the original flooring, ceiling and brick walls as possible,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to raise the standards and get people who want to live and play all in the same area.\u201dWork to remove an unsightly tangle of ramps that blocks downtown waterfront views should also finish in 2017. The $197 million project aims to reconstruct the interchange between Interstate 195 and State Route 79. The city also hopes to receive state approval this spring for $80 million for design and construction to reconfigure Route 79 just north of downtown, which would further improve harbor access and open 10 acres for mixed-use development.\u201cIf you lived in the city before, you always dreamed about it,\u201d Mr. Cordeiro said of this redevelopment activity and the potential for more, \u201cbut now we\u2019re living it.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "China Seeks to Avoid Mass Layoffs While Cutting Production", "Date": "2016-03-16", "News": "Supported by\u201cWe\u2019ve already chosen steel and coal as the two sectors for achieving initial breakthroughs in reducing production capacity,\u201d Mr. Li said at the end of the annual full meeting of the National People\u2019s Congress, the Communist Party-controlled legislature.\u201cAt the same time, we must avoid a wave of mass layoffs,\u201d Mr. Li continued. Using a well-known Chinese metaphor for a secure livelihood, he said, \u201cWe must proceed with reducing industrial capacity, but the great numbers of employees cannot lose their rice bowls, and we must strive to find them new rice bowls.\u201dPrime Minister Li Keqiang of China delivered his government's annual work report to the National People\u2019s Congress, the Communist Party-controlled legislature, on March 5. Here is a \u200bsearchable\u200b transcript of his speech.Since the demonstrations, in the city of Shuangyashan, officials have scrambled to placate workers there whose wage payments have fallen months behind. Longmay said in September that it wanted to eliminate 100,000 jobs by the end of 2015 in Shuangyashan and at other mines that have taken on far too many workers. But Mr. Lu indicated last week that the company was well short of that goal.Mr. Li did not mention the miners\u2019 protests on Wednesday. But he suggested that the government had enough funds to avoid a return to the early 2000s, when layoffs of tens of millions of employees from state industry fueled widespread unrest, especially across the rust belt provinces of the northeast.If new jobs cannot quickly be found for laid-off workers, \u201ccentral and local finances have the capacity to make suitable arrangements,\u201d Mr. Li said. The central government has set aside about $15 billion largely to help find work for displaced employees, and more could be allotted for the task, he said.More broadly, Mr. Li said he would free up private businesses, cut red tape and overhead and create new opportunities for investment and employment. That recipe, he said, would not demand any hard trade-offs between growth and adjustment.\u201cThey\u2019re saying the right words,\u201d Mr. Mao said. \u201cThe problem is that they\u2019re not willing to prescribe the right medicine to deal with the severe mismatch between supply and consumption and demand. There\u2019s a lack of market allocation.\u201dBut the wealth of plans, statistics and projections that Mr. Li and ministers offered during the meeting did not include detailed estimates of the number of workers most likely to be laid off. That is a politically fraught issue for the Communist Party leadership, which fears any sign of economic upheaval that could undermine its rule.Failure to enforce market overhauls could carry a different kind of risk. Days before the congress opened, Moody\u2019s Investors Service, a credit-rating agency, lowered its rating for China, citing worries that the government would fail to put into place its promised changes to the economy.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Airbnb Pits Neighbor Against Neighbor in Tourist-Friendly New Orleans", "Date": "2016-03-05", "News": "Supported byTalk to the locals in certain New Orleans neighborhoods \u2014 from the historic and genteel Garden District uptown to the dense and increasingly trendy Bywater downriver \u2014 and you can be pretty sure that one topic will come up eventually: Airbnb.With crime, potholes and the Saints, the home-sharing economy has become one of the city\u2019s default topics, bickered about in countless informal conversations, through snarky signs (\u201cWon\u2019t You B&B My Neighbor?\u201d) and increasingly in public forums where city officials, and the citizenry, argue over what to do about it.Everybody has an opinion. Some are distraught at revelers leaving \u201cfloors covered with vomit\u201d in residential buildings and \u201cshort-term strangers\u201d squeezing out long-term residents. But just as passionate are people who say renting rooms on Airbnb has brought them enough cash to rehabilitate properties or cover the mortgage after a layoff or after Hurricane Katrina. All of those arguments were made in September at a planning commission hearing on the subject \u2014 a meeting that lasted more than two hours despite a time limit on comments.Like some other cities, New Orleans has laws that make a lot of short-term rentals illegal. In most circumstances, renting property for less than 30 days is prohibited without a special permit that few individuals have obtained, and it is punishable by fine or possibly jail time. But city officials acknowledge that New Orleans simply does not have the resources to enforce this rule \u2014 given the 2,400 to 4,000 short-term rental listings on various services. Whether short-term rentals will be permitted in some form is not in question; the numbers have already settled that. It is up to the city to adjust accordingly, and figure out how they will be allowed.Representatives of the larger home-sharing companies have met with New Orleans officials, but they are seldom heard from in more public forums. Officials of Airbnb and VRBO (Vacation Rentals by Owner, a HomeAway brand that is popular in New Orleans) point out that they operate in so many places they cannot possibly get into the specifics of local policy; they are merely private businesses offering services to consumers. So it is up to New Orleans and other cities to devise their own regulations, and up to users to follow them. The upshot is a curious mix of ubiquity and absence: a public debate that seems to involve everyone except the parties who started it.For the time being, the platforms operate in \u201ca regulatory Wild West,\u201d wrote Jeffrey Goodman, a New Orleans design consultant and self-described \u201cplanning nerd,\u201d in the February issue of the American Planning Association magazine Planning. And while cities scramble to adjust, Mr. Goodman wrote, these companies \u201cmake money without proper oversight and without proper accountability.\u201dThe surprise is that, despite the bickering and contention, the various constituencies in New Orleans have a lot of common ground. Even the most ardent proponents of short-term rentals agree that the practice should be regulated: There ought to be mechanisms to collect taxes, restrict the density of short-term rentals in certain areas, and deal with absentee owners who offer property for rent and allow rowdy guests to become neighborhood nuisances.The trick is that the most efficient way of achieving those ends might require the services to change how they operate. A technological fix that would permit only licensed owners to list their properties online, for example, could satisfy many complaints. But the services have been unwilling to pursue those possibilities. So New Orleans will have to find another answer.Rob White lives in the French Quarter. Thick with 18th-century structures, the dense grid is the oldest neighborhood in New Orleans and its biggest tourist magnet. New hotels or bed-and-breakfasts have been tightly restricted or banned for many years, to preserve some degree of the residential character that is part of the attraction. Regulations for short-term rentals are even tighter here (nothing under 60 days, in theory), but the online services have provided an easy workaround to that rule, in Mr. White\u2019s view. He says it seems that he is the only full-time resident on his block. \u201cYou know who comes in and out of there?\u201d he said at a community meeting about a condominium building nearby. \u201cPeople with their luggage.\u201d The tourists roll in on Thursday or Friday and roll out a few days later. \u201cIt\u2019s a rogue hotel,\u201d he complained.Mr. White is a member of the Short-Term Rental Committee, not an official city entity, but a vocal coalition of preservationists, neighborhood activists, owners of traditional bed-and-breakfasts and residents of various historic New Orleans neighborhoods. Its criticism of short-term rentals predates the rise of home-sharing services, but it has become steadily louder since Airbnb\u2019s arrival in the city in 2009, and it has included bitter complaints about the city\u2019s failure to enforce the relevant code, which dates from the 1950s.Deputy Mayor Ryan Berni concedes that enforcement of the short-term rental law has been \u201clax and difficult.\u201d Listings on home-sharing platforms do not reveal specific names and addresses, and identifying and building cases against violators would involve considerable time and money, city officials say. In fairness, New Orleans, like most cities, has more urgent priorities \u2014 including an understaffed police force and road and infrastructure problems that would cost billions to fix. \u201cWe just didn\u2019t feel like we had the tools to do it,\u201d Mr. Berni said.Stopping scofflaws would be easier if the services identified those using their tools to break the law, an argument made by critics of short-term rentals. Representatives of Airbnb and VRBO counter that turning over such information would violate their users\u2019 privacy. A VRBO spokesman says that its users essentially pay to advertise a property, and the platform is not directly involved in resulting transactions. Mr. Rivers, of the planning commission, and a former lawyer for the city, says it is not even clear that the city has the legal standing to demand such information, and that ultimately it needs a solution involving its own data.In recent months, Airbnb has released limited information about use of its site. For instance, it says that 92 percent of New Orleans\u2019s hosts booked property for fewer than 180 days in the previous year, a statistic that suggests users are regular people occasionally supplementing their income. But this data release left out other important numbers \u2014 such as listings per host, which might have illuminated the multiple-property power users who may account for significant booking volume.Airbnb declined to comment in detail about specifics of the debate in New Orleans. But Max Pomeranc, an Airbnb public policy manager whose focus includes New Orleans, responded to criticism about compliance with local laws by saying that its service is available in 34,000 municipalities around the world, making deep local involvement everywhere impractical. Mr. Pomeranc also noted that anyone signing up to be a host in New Orleans encounters a \u201cResponsible Hosting\u201d page encouraging compliance with local laws and various links to official city sources.Even the alliance, a relatively sophisticated operation that is financed by dues and has its own lawyers, favors regulation. Mr. Galvin said the group expected that developing rules to legalize short-term rentals would take seven or eight months. \u201cJust tax it, and let\u2019s go about our day,\u201d he said. \u201cWhy is it dragging on?\u201dDespite the polarization around the issue, many, including lawyers for the Alliance for Neighborhood Prosperity, have endorsed a simple-sounding idea: require short-term rentals to obtain some sort of official license or permit number (for a fee) and enter it in a field on the web. Enter your license number, or you are not permitted to list. Mr. Goodman, the planning activist, agreed that the platform databases were \u201cthe choke point in the system,\u201d and tweaking them to function only with a municipal license would amount to a genuine partnership with cities. \u201cIt requires the city to keep a good database, and these listing companies to honor that database,\u201d he said.For the home-sharing services, however, this appears to be a nonstarter. According to Mr. Rivers, Airbnb and VRBO told his staff that it would be too onerous to adjust their software to accommodate every regulatory arrangement for thousands of municipalities around the world. Spokesmen for Airbnb and VRBO confirm that rewriting their platforms in this way is not practical.The planning commission seems to have accepted that argument, and its study recommends instead that license information, with the address of an advertised property, should be included in the \u201cnarrative\u201d section of a listing. To critics, that means people without licenses could still rent, and it would still be up to the city to ferret out those who do not follow the rules. In the few cities that have enacted analogous policies, compliance has been estimated at less than 15 percent.Mr. Berni, the deputy mayor, while emphasizing that the planning commission report is merely a starting point, says this recommended strategy has potential. Compliant users paying for licenses could generate revenue to begin funding enforcement. Going after a \u201cbad operator\u201d is a complaint-driven process, he says, and a listing that lacks a license number could give the city cleaner legal leverage.Perhaps that will work. Even Mr. Goodman expresses optimism. He notes that Airbnb in particular seems to be moving toward accepting that it is not just a responsibility-free enabler \u2014 adding more robust insurance options and, increasingly, tax-collection tools. So maybe all the local contention will lead to a productive resolution after all. \u201cI just want to have New Orleans win on this,\u201d Mr. Goodman says.An article last Sunday about sharply differing views in New Orleans regarding Airbnb and other short-term rental services misstated part of the name of a group that supports short-term rentals. It is the Alliance for Neighborhood Prosperity, not the Alliance for Neighborhood Progress. Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Mr. Trump\u2019s Dangerous Babble on Foreign Policy", "Date": "2016-03-28", "News": "Supported byEditorialHe was more measured in his comments to The Times on Friday, saying nuclear weapons are \u201cthe biggest problem the world has\u201d and he would use such weapons only as \u201can absolute last step.\u201d Even if Mr. Trump, the leading Republican presidential candidate, doesn\u2019t really believe that nuclear weapons should be used against a terrorist group, the fact that he has voiced it lends weight to this insane notion and could make it easier for other nuclear-armed states to think about that possibility.The consequences of using a nuclear weapon in terms of lives lost, physical destruction and cost to American moral standing would be devastating. The United States and Russia have significantly reduced their nuclear arsenals, and the threat that either would ever use the weapons has greatly receded, in part because advanced conventional weapons can destroy almost any military target. Equally bizarre was Mr. Trump\u2019s casual attitude in endorsing the idea of Japan and South Korea developing their own nuclear weapons, which would reverse America\u2019s longstanding efforts to prevent the number of nuclear-armed states from expanding.Mr. Trump also challenged decades of American policy by calling NATO \u201cobsolete.\u201d Since the Cold War, the alliance has undergone reforms and remains the primary organization that can deal with military threats. It is central to the stability of Europe, which is vulnerable to terrorist attacks, weak economies and the flood of refugees from the Syrian war. With Russia\u2019s aggressive movements in Ukraine and threats to the Baltics, this is no time to suggest that Washington is rethinking its strongest commitments to its allies. Although Mr. Trump said he doesn\u2019t want to pull America out of NATO, he said it has to be changed so the United States bears less of the cost.Mr. Trump is confronting most of these issues for the first time, and many of his thoughts are contradictory and shockingly ignorant. In speaking with The Times, for instance, he complained that one problem with the Iran nuclear deal is that American businesses are now losing out to Europe on lucrative deals with Iran. He did not know that that is because Congress has insisted on keeping American sanctions in place.Mr. Trump claims he is not an isolationist and wants to \u201cmake America great again.\u201d It is hard to see how he achieves that when he describes a completely unhinged view of international engagement that denigrates Muslims and other foreigners and international organizations, including the United Nations. Mostly, his vision of cooperation with allies depends largely on how much they would pay the United States for protection.In his interviews, Mr. Trump has said \u201cunpredictability\u201d is central to his thinking. He seems to have no inkling that operating in a dangerous world \u2014 one in which the United States is militarily involved in many conflict zones \u2014 requires some ability to communicate intelligently and forthrightly with both allies and enemies. It also seems to have escaped him that American voters deserve to know what a candidate is actually proposing.Advertisement"}

Trump\u2019s rallies, the Republican leaders pushing to stop him are desperately targeting voters in the five big states that vote on Tuesday.The weekend of disturbances at Mr. Trump\u2019s rallies injected more unease into the race, and the appeals of his rivals turned emotional and urgent. On Sunday, Senator Marco Rubio of Florida warned that a Trump White House would exploit hatred and stir violence. \u201cImagine what that means for the country,\u201d Mr. Rubio said. \u201cImagine the tone it sets for our culture.\u201dOhio has emerged as a critical contest, the one large state voting this week where Mr. Trump appears vulnerable. A victory here by Gov. John Kasich would complicate Mr. Trump\u2019s attempt to gather a majority of delegates needed for the nomination.On the Democratic side, Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont hoped for a repeat of his stunning upset over Hillary Clinton last week in Michigan, as he hopscotched the Midwest to push his central message that American workers have suffered too much under trade deals.Although the states that voted two weeks ago on \u201cSuper Tuesday\u201d received much attention, the contests this week are potentially even more important.A total of 424 delegates are up for grabs on the Republican side, and, for the first time, states can award all of their delegates to the winner of the popular vote.With two polls in recent days showing Mr. Kasich with an edge over Mr. Trump in Ohio, whose 66 delegates will be awarded winner-take-all on Tuesday, Mr. Trump made multiple stops in the state over the weekend and added a last-minute return visit on Monday, canceling an appearance in Florida, where he has a strong lead.Mr. Trump held two rallies on Sunday that were mainly free of protesters\u2019 disturbances.The unrest at Mr. Trump\u2019s rallies has made the race more tense. Mr. Trump blamed Mr. Sanders\u2019s supporters for shutting down a Trump rally on Friday in Chicago. But he has been sympathetic to his supporters who have become violent. On Sunday, Mr. Trump said he would consider paying the legal costs for a man who was charged last week with assaulting a protester being escorted from a rally in Fayetteville, N.C.In West Chester, Ohio, on Sunday, Mr. Trump spoke on a raised platform surrounded by a cordon of uniformed and plainclothes officers.If Mr. Kasich is defeated in Ohio, he has indicated he will exit the race. Mr. Rubio is likely to withdraw, too, if he loses his home state, Florida. That would leave Mr. Trump facing Senator Ted Cruz of Texas in a head-to-head competition, and polls show Mr. Trump is weaker in that matchup than in a multicandidate field.Mr. Cruz, who is well behind in the polls in Ohio and Florida, focused on the other three states voting on Tuesday: Missouri, North Carolina and Illinois, where he planned to hold five events on Monday.Mr. Cruz said he was \u201cneck and neck\u201d with Mr. Trump in the three states.In the Democratic campaign, aides to Mrs. Clinton predicted tight races in the Midwestern states, where economically struggling voters have gravitated to Mr. Sanders. They were optimistic about winning Florida and North Carolina, where black, Hispanic and older voters were expected to give Mrs. Clinton a healthy edge in the race for delegates.Mr. Sanders has linked Mrs. Clinton, in speeches and a television ad, to Rahm Emanuel, the mayor of Chicago, whose record on policing and fights with public-sector unions are unpopular with progressive voters.In Missouri on Sunday, Mr. Sanders told a crowd that he had, \u201cfrom Day 1, been a leader in opposition to these disastrous trade policies.\u201d He added, \u201cSecretary Clinton has supported virtually all of them.\u201dWith Mr. Sanders\u2019s ads attacking her support of global trade deals, Mrs. Clinton has emphasized her proposals to lift employment while criticizing the Vermont senator for being short on specific plans.Speaking at a factory in Youngstown, Ohio, over the weekend, Mrs. Clinton vowed to end steel-dumping practices by China and other nations that undermine the economy in the industrial Mahoning Valley. \u201cI have always been committed to bringing back manufacturing,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I\u2019m the only candidate, on either side, who actually has a plan to do that.\u201dWith Ohio a perennial swing state in presidential elections, and its racially and economically diverse voters fiercely fought over, it was no surprise that candidates converged here in the final hours.Mr. Trump attacked Mr. Kasich for his support of the Common Core education standards, for a private-sector job at Lehman Brothers, whose 2008 collapse Mr. Trump said \u201calmost destroyed the world,\u201d and for supporting trade deals that he blamed for harming the manufacturing sector.Mr. Kasich accused Mr. Trump of creating \u201ca toxic atmosphere\u201d and said Mr. Trump was on the verge of disqualifying himself to represent the party because of his divisive speech.The world\u2019s eyes were glued to the scenes of mayhem and discord Mr. Trump has created, Mr. Kasich said.\u201cOur enemies are going to take advantage of them,\u201d Mr. Kasich told voters near Cleveland. \u201cOur friends are scratching their heads saying, \u2018What the heck is happening in America?\u2019 \u201dMr. Kasich, who has boasted of bringing 400,000 jobs to Ohio and has visited businesses that opened under his watch, has marshaled nearly the entire elected Republican apparatus of Ohio.On Monday, Mitt Romney, the 2012 Republican nominee who has been an outspoken critic of Mr. Trump, will appear with Mr. Kasich at two Ohio rallies.Matt Borges, chairman of the state Republicans, warned that if Mr. Trump was the nominee, his divisiveness would cost Republicans the state in the general election. \u201cIf we don\u2019t carry Ohio in the fall, we don\u2019t elect a Republican to the White House,\u201d he said.Mr. Trump\u2019s rally here was in West Chester, the hometown of John Boehner, the former House speaker who resigned last year out of frustration with the no-compromise wing of House Republicans. In a rare public appearance, Mr. Boehner endorsed Mr. Kasich at a county Republican dinner in West Chester on Saturday. The Trump rally on Sunday, just a few miles away, was attended by many hundreds more people.\u201cKasich\u2019s done a great job with Ohio,\u201d said Doug Mason, a concrete laborer, but he still planned to vote for Mr. Trump. \u201cI think Trump will be John Kasich on steroids.\u201dThe town-hall-style event for Mr. Trump was most notable for his response to a man who said it was important \u201cfor a lot of veterans in Ohio\u201d that Mr. Trump clarify a comment, made last year, that former prisoners of war like Senator John McCain were not heroes.\u201cOh no, no, no,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cThey are real heroes.\u201dAn article on Monday about the importance of Ohio\u2019s primary contest in the presidential race misidentified, in some copies, the state Ted Cruz represents in the Senate.

What changed?For one thing, the economic populism of the presidential campaign has forced the recognition that expanded trade is a double-edged sword. The defense of globalization rests on viewing Americans primarily as consumers, not workers, based on the assumption that we care more about low prices than about low wages.No wonder the selling of trade deals has become such a challenge. If we\u2019re really at the end of the F.T.A. era, what does that mean for trade, policy and economics over the next few years?First and foremost, don\u2019t conflate trade with trade agreements. They\u2019re not at all synonymous. Over the last 50 years, our trade volume as a share of gross domestic product has climbed steadily, tripling to 30 percent from 10 percent, regardless of whether we were signing F.T.A.s.That said, the absence of new F.T.A.s is an opportunity to refocus our trade policy on workers and more balanced trade. Besides the loss of public trust, cramped F.T.A. negotiations have blocked us from taking necessary steps against currency manipulation and have diminished our focus on policies that could rebuild the manufacturing sector.At this point in the argument, chin-stroking pundits will tell you the \u201chard truth\u201d that those manufacturing jobs we lost are not coming back. They\u2019re right, but that\u2019s beside the point. The question is not whether we can go backward, but could there be a more vibrant manufacturing future here? Can we, for example, build supply chains such that we don\u2019t just design the new goods the world demands, but instead of outsourcing their production, produce them here?So we should welcome the end of the era of F.T.A.s, which had long devolved into handshakes between corporate and investor interests on both sides of the border, allowing little voice for working people. With such noise behind us, we might be ready to foster the next generation of advanced production and help our exporters fight back against currency manipulators. That would be more productive than fighting tooth and nail over the next big trade deal.Jared Bernstein, a senior fellow at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, was the economic adviser to Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. from 2009 to 2011. Advertisement"}

As a result, he wrote, agencies would be required to \u201cidentify significant new savings.\u201dMr. Fuleihan said in the email the budget office would work with agencies \u201cto find productivity and management improvements by restructuring the delivery of programs or services, using technology to produce efficiencies, improving revenue collection, reducing administrative and overhead costs, and funding underused programs at the appropriate levels.\u201dHe said the savings must not lead to cuts in services or layoffs.He also told the agencies that if they wanted to propose new programs or spending not contained in the preliminary budget, they would have to pay for them with cuts elsewhere. Mr. de Blasio last month proposed an $82.1 billion budget for the fiscal year that starts July 1.The savings being sought are in addition to cuts already included in the preliminary budget, which includes a reduction in debt service because of lower interest rates.This year\u2019s budget is slightly larger than last year\u2019s and in real terms the savings represent trims in existing expenses that would make way for new spending, and keep the budget from growing even further.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Hillary! Bernie! Debate!", "Date": "2016-03-09", "News": "Supported byLet\u2019s give a hand to Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders. After all we\u2019ve been through with the Republicans, it\u2019s nice to hear presidential candidates go at each other\u2019s throat while they\u2019re talking about where they stood on immigration issues in 2007.This was Wednesday\u2019s Democratic debate \u2014 the second one in a week, not counting the back-to-back town halls in between. People, do you remember when we used to complain that there weren\u2019t going to be enough debates? Ah yes, long ago. Dinosaurs roamed the earth and Marco Rubio was a hot ticket.Clinton held up well, given that her first three questions involved why she lost the Michigan primary, her emails and whether she\u2019d drop out if she was indicted. (\u201cOh, for goodness \u2014 that is not going to happen. I\u2019m not even answering that question.\u201d) It was a tough evening. Sanders accused Clinton of cruelty to Honduran children. She claimed he had sided with the Minutemen.Since the debate was on Univision, there was a strong emphasis on immigration, which provided a kind of mirror image of the Republican debates. Clinton and Sanders bickered long and hard about who had been less in favor of deportation, going back more than a decade. (\u201cMadam Secretary, I will match my record against yours any day of the week!\u201d)In truth, immigration is not an issue that actually separates these two people. The real gulf is between the grand vision and the practical plan. Sanders thinks he can provide free public college tuition and Medicare-like health coverage for all. \u201cMy dad used to say, If it sounds too good to be true, it probably is,\u201d Clinton rejoined.And then there\u2019s the auto industry bailout. One of the biggest moments in the Democrats\u2019 Week of Endless Debates came Sunday when Clinton caught Sanders off guard by accusing him \u2014 in Michigan! \u2014 of refusing to support Detroit during the economic crisis.\u201cHe voted against the money that ended up saving the auto industry,\u201d Clinton claimed while Sanders looked stunned.What followed was the most quoted moment of the encounter:Sanders: \u201cIf you are talking about the Wall Street bailout, where some of your friends destroyed this economy \u2014\u2014\u201dClinton: \u201cYou know \u2014\u2014\u201dSanders: \u201cExcuse me, I\u2019m talking.\u201dAudience: \u201cOooooh\u201dIt\u2019s certainly a tribute to the general decorum with which the Democrats have conducted themselves that this was enough to draw a gasp from the crowd. The bar is so high on the Republican side that to get a real response one of the candidates would have had to hit the other with a hammer.But let\u2019s look at the bailout issue for a minute. Sanders did vote for a bill to lend money to the auto industry. But it got blocked in the Senate. Then during the stupendously complex end-of-the-Bush-administration negotiations, the bailout got mooshed into a huge, messy bill that did indeed involve helping Wall Street. When the only choices were nothing or a big, unappetizing legislative stew, he refused to bite.That pretty much sums up his career in Congress. Sanders stood up for his principles, but he didn\u2019t play any real role. At one point he offered an amendment to raise taxes on high-income individuals, which was basically ignored. He was marvelous, but symbolically marvelous.He was in no way like Ted Cruz, who just tries to get attention by stopping things. Nobody hates Bernie Sanders. But he\u2019s a maverick legislator, a man without a party. That\u2019s a way, way different kind of life than being the person who has to run the country.\u201cYou have to make hard choices when you\u2019re in positions of responsibility,\u201d Clinton said.Clinton is a stupendous debater, and she\u2019s developed smooth and sensible-sounding answers to sticky matters like the State Department emails and Benghazi. But she still hasn\u2019t been able to handle Sanders\u2019s attacks on her $225,000 speeches to finance industry insiders. She shrugs and says she\u2019ll release the transcripts when \u201ceverybody else does,\u201d which generally involves mentioning that President Obama \u201ctook a lot of money from Wall Street.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t have any comment,\u201d she said when she was questioned earlier in the week about campaign donations. \u201cI don\u2019t know that. I don\u2019t believe that there is any reason to be concerned about it.\u201dThis is the stuff that makes Democrats want to send a message. Hillary Clinton is by far the best qualified candidate for president. But at this point in the campaign, you can understand why some people feel that voting for her against Bernie Sanders is like rewarding Washington for its worst behavior.In the end, Clinton is the one who knows how to make the system work. But she\u2019s just got to be clearer on how she can work against the system.Advertisement"}

Roosevelt and the Land of America,\u2019 by Douglas Brinkley", "Date": "2016-03-23", "News": "Supported byWhen you purchase an independently reviewed book through our site, we earn an affiliate commission.Franklin D. Roosevelt was many great things: our greatest economic president, pulling the United States out of the Depression; our greatest foreign policy president, leading the country to victory during World War II. But he was something else, too: our greatest environmental president, leaving a larger mark on the warp and weft of the American landscape, for good and ill, than any chief executive, before or since.Consider: Roosevelt created 140 national wildlife refuges; established 29 national forests and 29 national parks and monuments; and enrolled 3.4 million men in the Civilian Conservation Corps, which built 13,000 miles of trails, planted more than two billion trees and paved 125,000 miles of roads. Not all his achievements were so eco-friendly: He built dozens of \u00adhabitat-destroying hydroelectric dams and initiated what eventually became the national highway system, solidifying America\u2019s future as a suburban car culture.This was no incidental r\u00e9sum\u00e9, as the historian Douglas Brinkley makes clear in his enjoyably exhaustive new biography \u201cRightful Heritage: Franklin D. Roose\u00advelt and the Land of America.\u201d Roosevelt thought deeply about the environment, more so than perhaps any other president save his distant relative and namesake, Theodore Roosevelt \u2014 as Brinkley well knows, having published a similarly extensive biography of Teddy Roosevelt as an environmentalist, \u201cThe Wilderness Warrior,\u201d in 2009.The Roosevelt cousins make for a satisfying historical diptych. Both came from wealth, and as children were exposed to the best that the American outdoors had to offer. Relatively early in their careers, they came to believe that capitalism had been allowed to run roughshod over much of America\u2019s natural beauty, and that it was the government\u2019s duty to set things right.There were differences between them, starting with their personalities: Teddy, who as governor of New York had a boxing ring set up in his Albany mansion and was often accused of preserving land so he could have more animals to kill, versus Franklin, who preferred leisurely fishing to backcountry hunting and, in his free time, could often be found doting on the trees at his Hyde Park estate.And yet \u201cRightful Heritage\u201d is in several ways a more engrossing book than \u201cWilderness Warrior.\u201d Many of Teddy\u2019s environmental achievements remain in place today, but his perspective, for all its forward-looking rhetoric, was focused on pulling back from the excesses of the Gilded Age. And his accomplishments, impressive as they were, were possible only because the rest of the country had yet to catch up with him; one gets the sense that corporations, Congress and the public often simply watched in awe as his pen strokes created vast stretches of publicly protected wilderness.But that was the easy part. By the 1930s, Franklin understood, it was no longer enough to protect the natural resources America had left; after a century of industrialization, the landscape was as bankrupt as the economy. \u201cHeretofore our conservation policy has been merely to preserve as much as possible of the existing forests,\u201d he said in a 1931 radio address, while still governor of New York. \u201cOur new policy goes a step further. It will not only preserve the existing forests, but create new ones.\u201d That meant not just territorial set-asides, but complex, politically expensive measures like environmental regulations, farmer education and labor-intensive replanting and ecological research.And while Franklin was as great an orator as his cousin, he understood that florid speeches went only so far. In the vast federal government he was creating, mastery of the inner workings \u2014 the back rooms, the legislative line items \u2014 mattered much more. In \u201cWilderness Warrior,\u201d Brinkley\u2019s best set pieces involve bear-hunting trips and battles in Cuba; in \u201cRightful Heritage,\u201d they feature epic fights with Congress, and within Roose\u00advelt\u2019s own administration.In fact, one of the virtues of \u201cRightful Heritage\u201d is that it\u2019s not just about Roose\u00advelt. Central to the story are two (of many) supporting characters: Harold Ickes, the secretary of the interior from 1933 to 1946, and Henry Wallace, the secretary of agriculture who became vice president in 1941 (and who was booted from the ticket in 1944 in favor of Harry Truman).Like Dr. Seuss\u2019 Lorax, Ickes spoke for the trees \u2014 he believed that the government had an obligation to protect the environment, even to the detriment of American business, even in a depression. Wallace fought Ickes in the name of the timber industry and the large agribusinesses, which he believed were critical for putting the economy right (surprising, given that he was the most left-wing politician ever to hold a high federal office).In Brinkley\u2019s telling, Roosevelt\u2019s heart was with Ickes, but in practice he tried to split the difference between the two men \u2014 to plot \u201ca middle course between reckless exploitation and extreme environmentalism.\u201d In public, he argued that responsible environmental stewardship was critical to economic growth; that the country would never revive if it didn\u2019t rehabilitate its natural resources.This philosophy drove almost everything Roosevelt did. He sold the Civilian Conservation Corps to Congress as a jobs program. He laced the national parks with scenic drives and expansive infrastructure to promote tourism. His efforts to combat soil erosion in the Dust Bowl were also a way to save America\u2019s struggling farms.But for this same reason, Roosevelt often failed to appreciate the environmental consequences of his economic agenda. A fan of hydropower, he placed dams across the South and Far West, destroying spawning routes for fish and inundating tens of thousands of acres of wildlife habitat. \u201cA geographer would be hard-pressed to find a major western river that Roose\u00advelt didn\u2019t want to dam,\u201d Brinkley writes. Over time his farm subsidies became one of the largest corporate-welfare programs in the government, while doing little to prevent overfarming and pesticide use.The fact was, Ickes and Wallace were right: There was and remains a fundamental tension between economic growth and environmental stewardship. As Aldo Leopold, an ecologist at the University of Wisconsin and a critic of Roosevelt, said, the president failed to resolve the \u201cstandard paradox of the 20th century: Our tools are better than we are, and grow better faster than we do.\u201dWhich isn\u2019t to say Roosevelt was na\u00efve, or ignorant of the challenges. He saw where society was headed if it did not learn to respect nature. He fought for clean air and water regulations and for continuing to fund the C.C.C., as a way of instilling a sense of ecological responsibility. And he envisioned global environmental stewardship as a core mission of the United Nations he was putting in place at the time of his death \u2014 an amazingly prescient vision for an ailing president in the midst of a world war.In a 1940 speech in the Great Smoky Mountains National Park, Roosevelt implored: \u201cWe slashed our forests, we used our soils, we encouraged floods .\u2008.\u2008. all of this so greatly that we were brought rather suddenly to face the fact that unless we gave thought to the lives of our children and grandchildren, they would no longer be able to live and to improve upon our American way of life.\u201d Seventy-five years later, we are still living in the landscape Roosevelt shaped \u2014 and still struggling to heed his words.Clay Risen is an Op-Ed editor for The Times.

{"Headline": "Overlooked Tool to Fight Climate Change: A Tweak in Fuel Standards", "Date": "2016-03-28", "News": "Supported byOn the EnvironmentOne of the best new opportunities to reduce greenhouse gas emissions might be to tweak a bureaucratic regulation we\u2019ve had around for close to four decades.Changing vehicle fuel efficiency standards \u2014 if done properly \u2014 could not only reduce emissions from cars and trucks, but also set the nation on a path that textbook economics suggests is the most efficient: by placing a nearly economywide price on carbon pollution.But even this won\u2019t be enough to reach the levels promised in Paris. So where can other cuts \u2014 ideally, not too expensive and not requiring new laws \u2014 come from?Using corporate average fuel economy (CAFE) standards might seem counterintuitive. They are widely regarded as costly and inefficient because they rely on mandates for achieving emissions reductions, rather than letting market forces find the least expensive ones. But a big advantage is that CAFE standards have been required by law since the 1970s and so do not require new legislation.CAFE standards were last updated in 2011 and are now up for review by the E.P.A. These standards have grown more stringent over time but are still lax compared with those of other nations. America\u2019s vehicles get, on average, 21.6 miles per gallon; in Britain, where fuel taxes are also much higher, vehicles average 35.6.One way that we could think about fuel economy, but currently don\u2019t, is to take into account not just how many miles a car gets per gallon of gas, but how many miles it is likely to be driven over all. Automakers have plenty of data on the average number of miles driven by each kind of car over time. Not all cars are driven the same amount.Michael Greenstone, the Milton Friedman professor of economics at the University of Chicago, runs the Energy Policy Institute there.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "What We\u2019re Watching in Florida, Ohio and Other Primaries", "Date": "2016-03-15", "News": "Supported by13 PhotosThe Republican presidential campaign will not end next week, or even next month. But voters in the five states casting ballots on Tuesday will go a long way toward determining whether Donald J. Trump can win the 1,237 delegates necessary to claim the party\u2019s nomination.If Mr. Trump loses Ohio (possible) or Florida (less likely) and wins less-than-commanding victories in Illinois, Missouri and North Carolina, he would face the strong possibility of falling short of a delegate majority and entering a contested Republican convention this summer. But with victories in the home states of two of his rivals, he could end the campaigns of Gov. John R. Kasich of Ohio and Senator Marco Rubio of Florida, leaving Senator Ted Cruz of Texas as the only candidate still standing in his way.No two states loom larger on the general election map than Florida and Ohio, and the results there could offer clues to the mood of the bellwether voters going into the fall campaign.If Mr. Trump dispatches Ohio\u2019s two-term governor and Florida\u2019s young senator, it would suggest that he is close to wresting the Republican nomination. And that would quickly force other elected Republicans there to decide how tightly they want to embrace a candidate who, even with his victories in the primary, could prove repellent to the sort of up-for-grabs voters most coveted in these pre-eminent swing states. This calculation could also prove consequential in the Senate campaign, as both states have Republican-held seats at stake that could determine the balance of power in that chamber.Illinois and Missouri have a lot in common (besides being Midwestern states that share the Mississippi River). Both have been obscured by the action in Florida and Ohio, which are winner-take-all contests for Republicans and elimination races for Mr. Kasich and Mr. Rubio.But Illinois and Missouri, which allocate a handful of delegates to the statewide winner and the rest to the top vote-getter in each of their congressional districts, could be just as important. If Mr. Trump overwhelms his competition in each, capturing every congressional district, he could effectively turn them into winner-take-all states.But Mr. Kasich has aggressively campaigned in the Chicago area, and Mr. Cruz has stumped in nearly every corner of both the states. If together they can win a substantial number of the combined 26 congressional districts in both contests, it would limit Mr. Trump\u2019s haul and mitigate the impact of his winning Florida, Ohio or both.The biggest wild card may be the heavily black congressional districts in Chicago, St. Louis and Kansas City: They offer the same number of delegates as the most conservative Republican districts in the rural reaches of each state. Mr. Rubio has fared best in cities so far, but his collapse offers opportunities to the other Republican hopefuls.He trails Mr. Trump in every survey, and often by a wide margin, with the latest polls showing him down by nearly 20 percentage points.Florida\u2019s 99 delegates are enough to cover an eighth of those Mr. Trump needs to reach the majority count, but there is a silver lining for Mr. Trump\u2019s opponents: Mr. Rubio\u2019s decline, and the possibility that he could withdraw after Florida, is good news for them elsewhere.Mr. Cruz has picked up a lot of Mr. Rubio\u2019s former supporters in firmly red states like Louisiana and Mississippi. Mr. Cruz lost states like these by a wide margin on Super Tuesday, but he nearly won in states where Mr. Rubio\u2019s support was reduced to the single digits. The same phenomenon has given Mr. Cruz a chance to squeak out wins in Missouri and North Carolina.Farther north, Mr. Rubio\u2019s weakness helps Mr. Cruz and Mr. Kasich, but perhaps not by enough to allow either to overtake Mr. Trump. That seemed to happen in Michigan, where Mr. Trump won a much smaller share of the vote than he did in Louisiana or Mississippi but, because his opposition was more divided, still won by a larger margin.The same phenomenon might help Mr. Trump win Illinois.Mr. Sanders can prove his upset victory in Michigan last week was not a fluke.He has a real chance of winning in Ohio, Missouri and Illinois, where the polls show a much tighter race than they did before Michigan. Like Michigan, the three states might be particularly receptive to his message on trade, and they are less diverse than the nation.A few more wins in the Midwest would strengthen the case for Mr. Sanders to stay in the race and compete in the delegate-rich blue states that dominate the final two months of the primary season.But the challenge for Mr. Sanders is not simply to win in the region, it is to win big. Hillary Clinton could win Florida and North Carolina by more than 20 percentage points, making her likely to add to her big pledged delegate lead. Narrow victories by Mr. Sanders will not do much to cut into Mrs. Clinton\u2019s growing edge.One advantage for Mr. Sanders is that the Midwestern states hold open primaries, where voters of any political affiliation can cast their ballots.Mr. Sanders tends to fare best among independents, especially because younger voters are likely to identify that way. Exit polls in Michigan found that Mrs. Clinton won self-identified Democrats by 18 percentage points, but she lost the state nonetheless because of a 43-point disadvantage among independents.There is a flip side to open primaries: Democrats can vote in the Republican contest. That might help Mr. Sanders, too. It has been argued that Mrs. Clinton was hurt because some of her supporters voted to stop Mr. Trump in Michigan. Self-described Democrats represented 7 percent of the Michigan Republican primary electorate, according to the exit polls.Mr. Sanders will not always have this advantage, and he will not have it in Florida, the biggest delegate prize of the night, where only registered Democrats are allowed to participate.When the votes start coming in from Florida and North Carolina after 7 p.m., most of the results will be from early voters. They tend to be older than the voters who turn out on Primary Day, which might bode well for Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Trump.But if Mr. Trump does much worse among Primary Day voters than early voters, it might be a sign that recent controversies, like the protests and violence at his events, are taking a toll on his support.The early vote might also provide a clue about strategic voting. If Mr. Rubio closes strong in Florida at the expense of Mr. Cruz and Mr. Kasich, it might be a sign that voters are choosing to coalesce behind an \u201canti-Trump\u201d candidate, even if he is not their preferred one. That would be a bad sign for Mr. Trump\u2019s chances in a one-on-one race.Which states are voting and how many delegates are at stake.Advertisement"}

And in a democracy, victory has legitimacy to it. Voters are rarely wise but are usually sensible. They understand their own problems. And so deference is generally paid to the candidate who wins.The question is: Should deference be paid to this victor? Should we bow down to the judgment of these voters?Well, some respect is in order. Trump voters are a coalition of the dispossessed. They have suffered lost jobs, lost wages, lost dreams. The American system is not working for them, so naturally they are looking for something else.Moreover, many in the media, especially me, did not understand how they would express their alienation. We expected Trump to fizzle because we were not socially intermingled with his supporters and did not listen carefully enough. For me, it\u2019s a lesson that I have to change the way I do my job if I\u2019m going to report accurately on this country.And yet reality is reality.Donald Trump is epically unprepared to be president. He has no realistic policies, no advisers, no capacity to learn. His vast narcissism makes him a closed fortress. He doesn\u2019t know what he doesn\u2019t know and he\u2019s uninterested in finding out. He insults the office Abraham Lincoln once occupied by running for it with less preparation than most of us would undertake to buy a sofa.Trump is perhaps the most dishonest person to run for high office in our lifetimes. All politicians stretch the truth, but Trump has a steady obliviousness to accuracy.\u201cHis remarks represent an extraordinary mix of inaccurate claims about domestic and foreign policy and personal and professional boasts that rarely measure up when checked against primary sources,\u201d they wrote.In some rare cases, political victors do not deserve our respect. George Wallace won elections, but to endorse those outcomes would be a moral failure.And so it is with Trump.History is a long record of men like him temporarily rising, stretching back to biblical times. Psalm 73 describes them: \u201cTherefore pride is their necklace; they clothe themselves with violence. \u2026 They scoff, and speak with malice; with arrogance they threaten oppression. Their mouths lay claim to heaven, and their tongues take possession of the earth. Therefore their people turn to them and drink up waters in abundance.\u201dAnd yet their success is fragile: \u201cSurely you place them on slippery ground; you cast them down to ruin. How suddenly they are destroyed.\u201dThe psalmist reminds us that the proper thing to do in the face of demagogy is to go the other way \u2014 to make an extra effort to put on decency, graciousness, patience and humility, to seek a purity of heart that is stable and everlasting.Worse, there are certain standards more important than one year\u2019s election. There are certain codes that if you betray them, you suffer something much worse than a political defeat.Donald Trump is an affront to basic standards of honesty, virtue and citizenship. He pollutes the atmosphere in which our children are raised. He has already shredded the unspoken rules of political civility that make conversation possible. In his savage regime, public life is just a dog-eat-dog war of all against all.As the founders would have understood, he is a threat to the long and glorious experiment of American self-government. He is precisely the kind of scapegoating, promise-making, fear-driving and deceiving demagogue they feared.Trump\u2019s supporters deserve respect. They are left out of this economy.

But the industry is in crisis, with drivers leaving in droves because of low pay and poor working conditions.A big part of the problem is that when it comes to long-haul trucking, the government\u2019s focus has been almost entirely on road safety. That\u2019s not a misplaced concern; highway accidents involving semis kill about 5,000 people per year. But it overlooks a critical concern: the well-being of the drivers themselves.We have inside knowledge of the trucking industry and the kinds of working conditions that truckers endure every day. One of us \u2014 Professor Balay \u2014 is a former long-haul trucker who does ethnographic research on blue-collar workers. The other, Professor Shattell, is a researcher and registered nurse who has studied the mental, physical and sexual health of truckers.We know better than most why the allure of long-haul trucking is so strong: Behind the wheel of a semi, drivers feel connected to \u2014 almost one with \u2014 all that power. The job involves a high degree of skill and focus; floating the gears takes coordination and timing, maneuvering that bulk takes visual perceptiveness and courage, and surviving against the odds of weather, mountains, construction zones, cultural scorn and boredom takes a certain kind of toughness. Truckers take pride in their work, especially given that there are precious few other meaningful blue-collar jobs out there these days.And yet when it comes to the operation of those big machines, the federal government seems to have forgotten that there are actual people behind the wheel. Drivers are largely regulated by the Department of Transportation, through the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration, not the Department of Labor. That allows the government to address highway safety through things like maximum driving hours, mandatory rest times and annual physicals.Such steps are meant to keep our roads safe, and they indirectly help drivers. But it also leaves them exposed to inhumane and demeaning work conditions, including abusive amounts of surveillance and micromanaging. Truckers are told what route to take, where to buy gas and for how much, when and where to sleep. They work 14-hour days routinely and continuously, often without weekends, sick pay or holiday pay. They drive 11 of those hours, and perform other work for the remaining three: loading, vehicle maintenance and a lot of waiting.This mistreatment doesn\u2019t just harm the drivers. By forcing experienced workers to leave the industry, it leads employers to hire younger and less capable drivers. Under pressure from the industry, last month the Senate approved a pilot program that will allow 18-year-olds to drive semis across state lines, even though the 18- to 21-year-old demographic has one of the highest accident rates.It also undermines truck-safety rules themselves: As long as drivers aren\u2019t behind the wheel, the Department of Transportation lets employers do what they want with their drivers \u2014 which usually means they get back on the road unrested and irritated, hardly the person you want driving an 18-wheeler.None of this is a secret; drivers have been raising concerns for years. But rather than improving working conditions and increasing requirements for rest, or regulating the companies themselves, legislators typically respond to truck-accident rates by amping up surveillance of truck drivers. Often speed is \u201cgoverned,\u201d with the truck unable to go over a specific speed; in other cases a sensor measures the distance from the front of the truck to the vehicle ahead, automatically braking if the space is deemed insufficient. Some companies even have two-way cameras trained on truck drivers 24/7. (Meanwhile, a new rule limiting a trucker\u2019s workweek to 70 hours, down from 82, has been suspended since 2014.)It\u2019s not that Congress hasn\u2019t tried; it\u2019s that the few labor laws that do exist have been passed piecemeal, so they do more harm than good.Take a recent rule requiring that truckers with sleep apnea use a continuous positive airway pressure machine when they\u2019re asleep in their trucks. The machines are supposed to help truckers sleep better, which is great. But they also need power to run, more power than a truck battery can provide, so truckers have to run their engines. But many states forbid drivers to idle their trucks. So truckers often can\u2019t win \u2014 they must break one of these laws. No wonder they leave.The solution isn\u2019t easy, but it is straightforward. Congress needs to give the Department of Labor the power to regulate truck drivers\u2019 working conditions, and mandate that it coordinate its policies with the Department of Transportation. The upshot should be to extend the variety of workplace protections available to almost all American workers to the millions of men and women driving the nation\u2019s commercial trucking fleet.After all, the best way to protect the people driving alongside America\u2019s long-haul trucks is to protect the people behind the wheel of those trucks, too.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "An Ancient Caravan Town in China Is Reborn", "Date": "2016-03-27", "News": "Supported byShaxi JournalSHAXI, China \u2014 The woman shuffled around her shop in the village square, telling visitors how she came to be selling wooden swords and woven slippers to tourists rather than tending to her fields.He Yuqing, 60, wore a blue tunic and apron, common among older ethnic Bai women of this verdant valley in the Himalayan foothills. In the plaza outside, afternoon sunlight fell across cobblestones on which horse caravans once trod.She said she had been renting the shop from the local government for eight years. If an international architecture team had not restored the square\u2019s ramshackle wooden buildings, she said, she would be doing hard labor among her fields of corn, fruit and grains.\u201cBefore they restored this, it just wasn\u2019t as beautiful,\u201d she said. \u201cThey did a good job.\u201dIn a project little known outside China, a Swiss-led team worked for years to renovate the square of Sideng Village. The square was the site of the main market in Shaxi, a valley dotted with Bai villages in the Hengduan Mountains of southwest China. The restored buildings include a centuries-old Buddhist temple that had been converted to government offices after the Communists took over China in 1949. Facing the temple is a four-story theater with soaring eaves and an outdoor performance terrace for local orchestras. Every June, valley residents converge on the plaza to hold the Torch Festival, in which they erect and light on fire a towering pine trunk.\u201cWhen the Chinese do this, they think, \u2018How can I attract as many people as possible to this place?\u2019\u201d said Chris Barclay, the American owner of a boutique guesthouse, the Old Theatre Inn, in the countryside outside the Sideng square. \u201cNone of that has happened here, which is great.\u201dMr. Barclay said he had also been inspired by the marketplace work done in Sideng.\u201cIn this process, the main purpose was to understand the local tradition, the local knowledge, the local craftsmanship,\u201d Mr. Huang said. \u201cWe wanted to see how far we could go with the local knowledge.\u201dThe team restored low-slung wooden facades around the old marketplace and a 100-year-old caravansary. Most of the plaza\u2019s buildings are just a century old because they have been repeatedly rebuilt \u2014 bandits burned down the buildings in constant raids.When the project began, most of the buildings had been abandoned. In 2006, the buds of commerce appeared. A couple from faraway Shenzhen asked to rent one of the smaller buildings near the theater; they wanted to live there and turn it into a cafe.Mr. Huang said this went against his idea for the plaza \u2014 he had intended for the fronts to be shops and the interiors to be courtyards open to the public.\u201cI didn\u2019t agree to that,\u201d he said with a laugh as he sat in the square one recent morning, pointing to the Old Tree Cafe run by the couple. \u201cThe government wanted them to move in, so they started living there and running the business there.\u201dThe Xingjiao Temple took four years to refurbish. A fierce blue guardian deity and a red one flank the main entrance. The Bai here worship local gods and practice Esoteric Buddhism.\u201cHaving the temple and theater together facing each other is a local custom,\u201d Mr. Huang said. \u201cThe locals think the Buddha should enjoy the performances along with the people. I\u2019m working on another temple in Shaxi where there is a stage in the main temple area. You move a wooden god to face the stage.\u201dThat temple, Chenghuang, is part of the next phase of the renovation project, as envisioned by Mr. Huang: founding community centers across Shaxi to help residents tap into the tourist economy.Mr. Huang, who still lives in Shaxi even though his Swiss teammates have left, said the first such center would be at Chenghuang Temple. His plans call for the centers to have computers where villagers can go online; tourists following cycling and walking routes through the valley would mingle with the villagers at those centers.Thirteen villages would be part of this network, and residents might start homegrown industries like craft beer to appeal to the tourist crowds, he said.\u201cWe can have Internet-based education,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is a way to help people to understand more and get the capability to develop things on their own.\u201dGuesthouses and cafes have boomed in Sideng Village, but they are mostly run by outsider Chinese rather than locals.The Shaxi Horse Pen 46 Youth Hostel next to the central theater was opened in 2010 by Huo Wanfei, 36, who moved here from Sichuan Province after visiting as a backpacker. Now that the Swiss-led team is done with the plaza, these Chinese outsiders are the main force behind renovating buildings, mostly to start tourist businesses.Ms. Huo said she had employed local carpenters and completed the renovation after much trial and error.\u201cIt made me realize there\u2019s a way in nature that makes things work out,\u201d she said.The evolution of the village is beginning to mirror what happened in Lijiang. The locals are renting out their homes to outsiders and moving elsewhere. So visitors to Sideng increasingly meet Chinese outsiders and not Bai locals like Ms. He.\u201cThe market is driving Shaxi in this direction,\u201d Mr. Huang said. \u201cThis is not something in our control. That is why I\u2019m doing this new project to encourage a community economy.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Malaysia\u2019s Immigrant Worker Debate", "Date": "2016-03-28", "News": "Supported byKUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia \u2014 On a recent weekend excursion out of the city, I stopped for coffee at a cluster of roadside shops selling refreshments for travelers heading to the jungle-shrouded highlands that form the spine of Malaysia. A young man was sweeping the small yard outside the outbuilding that housed the restrooms; he was the janitor and handyman, he said, but he was wary when I tried to strike up a conversation.He was from Bangladesh, he told me, and had been in Malaysia for three years. He was called Yunus, but there was no way I could tell if that was his real name.During the rest of my weekend trip, I noticed how many immigrant workers there were in the countryside, as accustomed as I am to seeing them in the capital city. They\u2019re on construction sites, in factories and on huge palm oil plantations. But most Malaysians will encounter those who work in the lower ends of the service industry, waiting tables in cheap restaurants or, in Yunus\u2019s case, cleaning restrooms.These immigrants tend to be found in what the locals call \u201c3D jobs\u201d: dangerous, dirty and difficult. In short, jobs that few Malaysians nowadays are willing to do.Workers from Malaysia\u2019s lower-income neighbors \u2014 Indonesia, Vietnam, Nepal, Myanmar and, increasingly, Bangladesh \u2014 have become ubiquitous here, yet they remain largely disconnected from the rest of society and have generally been absent from any discussion of national identity. But a recent government communiqu\u00e9 has pushed them into the limelight and forced Malaysians to confront, with unusual frankness, the deep-seated prejudices that some hold against low-skilled workers from abroad.All this focus on migration and labor suggests that Malaysia is beginning to look harder at itself as the maturing, middle-class country it aspires to be \u2014 even if, for now, more liberal attitudes are in a minority. As I found in my rather stilted conversation with Yunus, a lack of trust and a huge gulf still divide foreign workers from Malaysians.Advertisement"}

David Cameron, Britain\u2019s prime minister, has set June 23 for a national referendum. He is convinced Britain should remain part of the bloc, but polls show that the establishment, as in the United States, may be out of touch and favor.Britain has remained one of the few members of the 28-country European Union that have not adopted the euro, nor the passport-free approach to borders within Europe. Fifty-five percent of Britain\u2019s laws, however, are governed by the European Union. The nation\u2019s financial institutions, most of which are based in London, want to remain in the European Union, and some have said that they might have to leave the country if Britain were to abandon the bloc.In the face of all the sturm und drang about a Brexit \u2014 that\u2019s the too-cute portmanteau for a British exit \u2013 I called perhaps the most influential member of Britain\u2019s financial establishment to find out the reality of whether the country will leave and what the implications could be.That person is Mervyn King, the former governor of the Bank of England who, unlike many of his colleagues, can actually speak his mind these days. Mr. King is the equivalent of our Ben Bernanke, having overseen Britain\u2019s central bank during the financial crisis. He has been out of office for a little over two years, which has given him some perspective and the freedom to criticize his establishment brethren.I reached Mr. King at his countryside home in Kent in southeast England. He just finished writing \u201cThe End of Alchemy: Money, Banking and the Future of the Global Economy,\u201d which is being released in the United States in about three weeks.Mr. King has been warning about the possibility of another financial crisis, which he has contended is a near certainty, and says that the European Union is set for an \u201ceconomic political crisis.\u201d In his book, he suggested that the monetary union had created a conflict between a centralized elite and democratic forces at the national level. \u201cThis is extraordinarily dangerous,\u201d Mr. King wrote.When he came to the phone, Mr. King was quick to say, \u201cI have no idea what will happen.\u201d But he then offered a sober view of what should happen.\u201cThe sensible position would be that all countries ought to be able to agree that there will be two types of member of the E.U. for the foreseeable future \u2014 those in the euro area and those outside,\u201d Mr. King wrote. \u201cAnd the degree of political integration can be quite different for those two categories of members.\u201dIf the two categories of E.U. countries were widely accepted, he says he believes that \u201ca lot of the tension underlying the concerns about what emanates from Brussels would disappear.\u201dThe problem with that seemingly reasonable view is that many in the European Union believe there needs to be an even larger and greater integration for this economic and political experiment to ultimately succeed. That\u2019s a point Mr. King is quick to acknowledge. \u201cBrussels would be very unhappy about it because they want to have control over every member country and have a single framework that they implement,\u201d he said.Britons in favor of leaving the union want more control over their laws, their economy and the flow of refugees into their country. \u201cI will be advocating Vote Leave \u2014 or whatever the team is called; I understand there are many of them \u2014 because I want a better deal for the people of this country, to save them money and take back control,\u201d London\u2019s mayor, Boris Johnson, said.Such a view reflects the fragile state of the British economy, but the sense of economic helplessness is global. Mr. King expressed worry over the endless amounts of money that central banks in the United States, Japan and other countries have printed to help goose the economy. He said that the move in some countries toward negative interest rates \u2014 in which depositors pay to hold money in bank accounts \u2014 was not the answer.\u201cCentral banks shouldn\u2019t suddenly withdraw the stimulus they\u2019re giving,\u201d Mr. King said. \u201cBut they can\u2019t do much more.\u201dWhatever the outcome on Brexit \u2014 the polls have a wide margin and have swung wildly in recent weeks \u2014 there is likely to be increasing uncertainty over Britain and the European Union not just in the next several months leading up to the vote, but also in the years ahead, according to Mr. King. He cited China\u2019s weakening economy as one of a number of concerns. \u201cI would be rather pessimistic,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Politicians Push Marriage, but That\u2019s Not What Would Help Children", "Date": "2016-03-22", "News": "Supported byEconomic SceneShould the government push poor people to marry?And yet, after all those efforts to strengthen the bonds between mothers and fathers, husbands and wives, it is hard to resist the conclusion that much of this is misdirected, a waste of resources and time.Births out of wedlock can be sharply reduced by providing young women with access to sex education and long-term contraception, so they might delay having children until they feel ready. And instead of trying hopelessly to reconstitute the conventional family of yore, why not devote resources to improving the welfare of the families as they are?And yet despite years of research to identify how changes in family structure hurt children, there is much less agreement on the \u201cwhy.\u201dChildren living with a single parent tend to do worse in life than those who grow up in a stable two-parent family. The United States has one of the highest percentage of children living without a father among advanced countries, as well as one of the highest shares of children living in poverty.Selection is clearly at work: Single mothers and the fathers of their children are generally less educated than married parents. They tend to have lesser-paying jobs and more mental health issues. They would have a tough time raising children in a healthy environment even if they stayed together.Then, of course, there is the issue of resources. Families headed by single mothers are poorer.But the strongest case against a policy to deliver strong marriages and stable families is that the government has no clue how to do that.There is good reason to believe that it was the demise of the solid blue-collar job \u2014 squeezed out by globalization and technological change \u2014 that played the principal role in putting an end to the stable working-class family. Perhaps men with poor job prospects feel unprepared to marry. Perhaps women will not marry men who cannot provide.Isabel Sawhill of the Brookings Institution suggests we accept that the government cannot bring the stable two-parent family back. What it can do is encourage more responsible parenthood.This sounds like a sensible approach. But there are other options to improve the lot of American families and children. We just have to look around.Marriage is increasingly unpopular around the industrialized world. Births out of wedlock have surged across the board. Yet somehow families in other rich countries have avoided the depth of dysfunction of their American peers. This is not a result of policies encouraging marriage. Rather, it is a result of policies aimed at increasing families\u2019 and children\u2019s well-being.Part of this might be because of cultural differences. Cohabitation out of wedlock is more stable in France. Even though fewer French children than American children live with two married parents, more live with their mothers and fathers.But culture cannot explain America\u2019s deficits away. It is critical to keep in mind the role of the French welfare state in fostering this stability.The point is, families at the bottom end of French society, and their children, did a better job of overcoming the economic transformations that shook the industrialized world over the last quarter-century because France\u2019s welfare state did not let them fall that far.If we are making policy for the sake of the children, it\u2019s not hard to figure out who made the better call.An earlier version of this column misstated the breadth of an evaluation by MDRC of the Healthy Marriage Initiative. It evaluated a program of marriage education for certain low-income married couples; it did not evaluate the entire initiative.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Hillary Clinton Wins 4 Races, Rebounding From Michigan Loss", "Date": "2016-03-15", "News": "Supported byHillary Clinton swept major primaries in Florida, North Carolina and Ohio on Tuesday, rebounding from her upset loss to Bernie Sanders in Michigan a week earlier and securing a political and psychological victory for her campaign.The results were a significant setback for Mr. Sanders, who was counting on his fiery arguments against free trade to help him prevail across the industrial Midwest. He spent heavily trying to win Ohio, as well as Tuesday\u2019s contests in Illinois and Missouri, but he came away with his presidential bid looking increasingly hopeless, since Mrs. Clinton is far ahead in amassing delegates needed to win the nomination.Early Wednesday, The Associated Press declared Mrs. Clinton the winner in Illinois, too. Votes were still being counted in Missouri.For Mrs. Clinton, Tuesday\u2019s double-digit victories netted her so many delegates that her lead over Mr. Sanders is now about three times what Barack Obama\u2019s was over her in 2008. On a personal level, too, she and her advisers were reassured that regardless of her Michigan defeat, her political arguments about jobs and the economy had potency in states that will be major battlegrounds in November.The top issue for Ohio Democratic primary voters was the economy, and most of them favored Mrs. Clinton. A majority of voters also said that trade with other nations takes away American jobs, and more than half of them supported Mrs. Clinton. In Michigan, Mr. Sanders captured this group by double digits.Mrs. Clinton was bullish and beaming at her victory party in West Palm Beach, Fla., after the first three states were called in her favor. \u201cWe are moving closer to securing the Democratic Party nomination and winning this election in November,\u201d she said to cheers from a rowdy crowd of 1,300 people.More than in any other primary night speech, Mrs. Clinton aimed her remarks in South Florida at the leading Republican candidate, Donald J. Trump, who boasted of his own victory just miles away.\u201cWhen we hear a candidate for president call for rounding up 12 million immigrants, banning all Muslims from entering the United States, when he embraces torture, that doesn\u2019t make him strong \u2014 it makes him wrong,\u201d Mrs. Clinton said, as she called on all Americans to fight against \u201cbluster and bigotry.\u201dMr. Sanders, speaking at a campaign event in Arizona, which holds its contest next week, stuck to his scathing assessment of the American economic system and promised to overhaul campaign finance rules. He criticized Walmart as not paying living wages, but also repeated his creed against global trade that has particularly hit the Midwestern industrial belt.\u201cI say to corporate America, you want us to buy your products, start manufacturing those products here in America, not in China,\u201d Mr. Sanders said.Mr. Sanders also used the evening to criticize Mrs. Clinton for having a \u201csuper PAC\u201d and relying on large donations. \u201cShe has received money from the drug companies and the fossil fuel industry,\u201d he said to loud hisses and boos from the crowd of 7,200 people. \u201cShe has given speeches on Wall Street for $225,000 a pop.\u201dOhio was the prize that Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Sanders coveted the most, a bellwether state in American politics that would bestow not only delegates but also a new political story line for the winner: a Clinton comeback or a Sanders surge, given that he was a long-shot there until recently.After her loss in Michigan \u2014 and Mr. Sanders\u2019s persistent criticism of her record on global trade \u2014 Mrs. Clinton\u2019s aides seemed exasperated that her detailed policy positions to bring jobs back to the hard-hit Midwestern states were a harder sell than what they said were the unrealistic promises offered by her opponent. They huddled to retool her economic pitch so that it resonated better in Midwestern states in hopes of competing more strongly with Mr. Sanders.\u201cAfter having lost Michigan, we came into, particularly, Ohio with a renovated plan,\u201d said her spokeswoman, Jennifer Palmieri.At a rally in Youngstown, Mrs. Clinton addressed union members packed onto a factory floor at M7 Technologies, reminding them of the work she had done as a senator from New York to bring jobs back to the depressed upstate areas.\u201cI stood up for our companies in New York,\u201d she said. \u201cI will stand up for our companies in Ohio and across America,\u201d Mrs. Clinton said. \u201cIt\u2019s exciting for me. I am really totally committed to bringing back manufacturing.\u201dThe Clinton campaign dispatched former President Bill Clinton to Akron and Toledo, two predominantly white working-class cities that Mr. Sanders also campaigned in. Mrs. Clinton also racked up delegates in heavily black areas of Ohio, including courting voters in Cleveland.Mrs. Clinton\u2019s victories in Florida and North Carolina were due in large part to minorities: black voters in both states, and Hispanics in Florida as well. The Sanders campaign had been expecting to lose Florida, given that only Democrats could participate in the primary and he tends to perform better when independents are in the mix. But Mrs. Clinton was also broadly popular in the state, which was reflected in exit polls by Edison Research.Mrs. Clinton drew support from about seven in 10 Hispanic voters and nearly eight in 10 black voters. She was backed by a slim majority of white voters, who accounted for about half of the electorate \u2014 down from two-thirds in 2008. She was favored by voters who put a high priority on experience or electability, and she was the solid choice when voters were asked who had the better chance of defeating Mr. Trump in November.In Ohio exit polls, Mrs. Clinton was far ahead among black voters, but she and Mr. Sanders ran closely among white voters. As in Michigan, Mr. Sanders was drawing huge support from independents and voters under age 30, while Mrs. Clinton was popular with Democrats and voters over 45.As Ohioans streamed to the polls on Tuesday, several voters described intense feelings for their favored candidates. At the Alliance Church in Reynoldsburg, a middle-class Columbus suburb, Sediena Barry, who installs office equipment, said she decided to vote for Bernie Sanders moments before facing the horseshoe of electronic voting machines.\u201cYoung people were told, get an education and work hard and you\u2019ll get ahead, and none of us are,\u201d said Ms. Barry, 34, who complained that she is taxed at a rate higher rate than bosses who make a half-million dollars a year.James Moore, a restaurant manager, said he voted for Mrs. Clinton \u201cfor my personal future and my family\u2019s future.\u201d He added: \u201cAll her ideals line up with what we want to happen.\u201dFor both candidates, Tuesday\u2019s primary results represented a major turning point in the race: Roughly half of the 4,765 Democratic pledged delegates have now been awarded. But their campaigns offered sharply different takes.Clinton advisers noted that Mr. Sanders had reached the halfway mark without showing any progress at narrowing her sizable lead in delegates, leaving him only one way forward \u2014 to win a series of landslides through the June primaries and pick up significantly more delegates than Mrs. Clinton.That situation is highly unlikely, and Clinton advisers made it clear on Tuesday that they were confident about holding the delegate lead and ready to focus toward the general election.\u201cWe think she will be the nominee, we\u2019d like for this process to obviously be resolved as quickly as it can, but that\u2019s ultimately not up to us and we\u2019re prepared for it to go on,\u201d Ms. Palmieri said as the voting was underway.Sanders advisers, while acknowledging they were far behind in the delegate count, said that the race was now shifting to their advantage and that they expected to win more delegates than Mrs. Clinton in the coming primaries and caucuses. They argued that Mrs. Clinton\u2019s best states were behind her \u2014 the primaries across the South and in Texas where her popularity among blacks and Hispanics resulted in troves of delegates.Looking ahead, Sanders advisers predicted success in states with large liberal populations, like Wisconsin and California, and those with caucuses, a format that rewards voter enthusiasm and turnout and has favored Mr. Sanders recently. Mr. Sanders has even talked about prevailing in New York, Mrs. Clinton\u2019s home state, given the high numbers of progressive voters and working-class Democrats who share his disgust with Wall Street.\u201cWe\u2019re now entering a period where we think we\u2019ll win most if not all of the contests before the April 19 primary in New York,\u201d said Tad Devine, a senior adviser to Mr. Sanders. \u201cRegardless of how much momentum we have after Tuesday, the calendar is shifting in our favor. Now we just have to win some major showdowns, like in New York and New Jersey, to raise questions about whether she can really win the presidency.\u201dMrs. Clinton prevailed in Ohio in 2008 against Mr. Obama and referred to that victory frequently during their campaign, arguing that the Democrats\u2019 best hope in any general election was the winner of that state\u2019s primary.\u201dIt\u2019s a state that knows how to pick a president,\u201d Mrs. Clinton said at her victory rally in Columbus in 2008. \u201cAnd no candidate in recent history, Democrat or Republican, has won the White House without winning the Ohio primary.\u201dMr. Obama, of course, did go on to win the general election \u2014 and Ohio \u2014 that November.

Chris Christie of New Jersey couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have been nicer to Donald J. Trump as they campaigned together in Ohio and North Carolina on the eve of Tuesday\u2019s primaries in both states.Mr. Trump, not so much.Targeting the Ohio governor, John Kasich, his chief rival in the state\u00e2\u0080\u0099s primary, Mr. Trump berated Mr. Kasich here on Monday evening for being an absentee for his time away from Ohio last fall and winter as he campaigned in New Hampshire. The only other sitting governor or senator who was in New Hampshire as much as Mr. Kasich was Mr. Christie, who has since dropped out and endorsed Mr. Trump. While most politicians would conveniently forget that fact, to spare Mr. Christie the humiliation, Mr. Trump actually highlighted it.\u00e2\u0080\u009cYour Governor Kasich, if you look at him, and I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m being totally impartial, he goes to New Hampshire, he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s living in New Hampshire,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cIs Chris around? He was there even more than Chris.\u00e2\u0080\u009dMr. Christie, fortunately, was offstage.The Ohio remarks were an extension of a theme that Mr. Trump started in North Carolina earlier in the day. In Hickory, Mr. Christie was the questioner at a makeshift town hall event, an often-fawning role that other supporters of Mr. Trump have filled at previous events.Mr. Trump told the crowd that he had excelled in every debate. If not, he said, he probably wouldn\u2019t have done so well in the campaign.\u201cI would have been like the other people \u2014 out!\u201d Mr. Trump said, as Mr. Christie scratched the back of his neck in the seat across from him.Mr. Trump wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t so much trying to embarrass Mr. Christie as tear down Mr. Kasich, whom he attacked repeatedly during his final rally before Tuesday\u2019s voting. Mr. Trump was not coy about the reason: He acknowledged that the Ohio contest looked like the closest of the day\u2019s five primaries. Mr. Kasich, who is popular among many Republicans in his home state, has a small lead over Mr. Trump in some Ohio polls.\u00e2\u0080\u009cKasich cannot make America great again, can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t do it, can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t do it,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Trump said, dismissing the state\u00e2\u0080\u0099s positive economic figures as a result of lucky oil strikes. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIf you didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t hit oil \u2014 that wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t because of him, believe me \u2014 you would have had a disaster.\u00e2\u0080\u009dMr. Trump argued that Mr. Kasich would destroy the auto industry in Ohio by negotiating more free trade deals that would lead American companies to shift jobs to other countries. That is a charge that resonates deeply with many Ohioans who blame the North American Free Trade Agreement for destroying the economy in once-thriving cities like nearby Youngstown. Mr. Trump drew boos as he noted that Mr. Kasich supports the Trans-Pacific Partnership, the 12-nation trade deal President Obama has negotiated.\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s going to take all of your car business out,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Trump warned about the trade deal. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe car business is going to be destroyed by TPP.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00e2\u0080\u009cYour governor is totally overrated, he hasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t done a thing,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Trump said, urging people to get a good night\u00e2\u0080\u0099s sleep and then wake up to help him beat their governor.\n\t\tFirst Draft provides fast-paced and comprehensive coverage of politics and elections by The New York Times.

{"Headline": "Abortion, Guns and Gay Rights Offer Risks, Rewards for State Republicans", "Date": "2016-03-31", "News": "Supported byATLANTA \u2014 Congressional Republicans in the Obama era have largely been defined by their insistence on standing in front of the administration and yelling stop. Democrats call them the party of \u201cno.\u201dBut in state legislatures, Republicans are finding rewards and peril in being a vigorous party of \u201cyes\u201d when it comes to promoting conservative social issues. This year, in many of the 30 state legislatures under full Republican control, lawmakers continued to pass a number of new expansions of gun rights and groundbreaking restrictions on abortion. Perhaps most controversially, they also approved bills that opponents say would allow for discrimination against gays, lesbians and transgender people.For social conservatives, the legislative wins are a bright spot in an otherwise troubling health report for the Republican Party.But the risks were also evident this week in North Carolina, as a furor erupted over a new law that prohibits local anti-discrimination protections for gay, bisexual and transgender people and restricts transgender bathroom use. More than 90 chief executives, including Timothy D. Cook of Apple and Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook, have objected to the new law.Democrats are hoping that such Republican stands on social issues, while politically helpful to state lawmakers in their heavily conservative districts, may underscore the Democratic contention that Republicans have veered too far to the right to win some statewide elections, keep their control of both houses of Congress and win back the presidency. The stakes are particularly high at a time when the Republican presidential primary brawl and Donald J. Trump\u2019s candidacy have the potential to turn off women, independents and others whom Republicans need to succeed nationally.\u201cThe national Republican Party is trying not to lose three presidential elections in a row,\u201d said William Boone, a political scientist at Clark Atlanta University. \u201cThe local guys are trying to maintain their right and sometimes far-right positions to be re-elected at the local level.\u201dNorth Carolina is an example of a legislative success that can come with big risks. Corporate opponents of the new law include Bank of America, the state\u2019s largest employer. Three governors and a number of big-city mayors have banned official state travel to North Carolina. Private business travelers have canceled plans to visit. The American Civil Liberties Union and other groups have brought a legal challenge in federal court.The Republican governor, Pat McCrory, a former Charlotte mayor who ran for office promising a practical-minded, pro-business administration, was forced into a defensive crouch this week. He accused critics of a \u201cvicious nationwide smear campaign\u201d against the state, while the campaign of Attorney General Roy Cooper, a Democrat who plans to run against Mr. McCrory this fall, started a \u201cShame on McCrory\u201d website.\u201cYour new discrimination law won\u2019t just hurt L.G.B.T. North Carolinians and their families \u2014 it will damage our economy and harm North Carolina\u2019s national reputation,\u201d the site says, addressing the governor. \u201cRepeal this shameful law now.\u201dChris LaCivita, a Republican strategist working for Mr. McCrory\u2019s campaign, said Tuesday that the law was a common-sense effort to protect the privacy of people in public restrooms. He said that it was likely to be welcomed by parents \u2014 and to be a political hit.\u201cThere\u2019s a basic expectation of privacy that everyone has,\u201d he said, adding, \u201cWe\u2019ll side with parents against Democrats and, quite frankly, against a lot of the out-of-state interests, any day of the week.\u201dA similar legislative drama, one with a different outcome, played out in neighboring Georgia, where a second-term Republican governor, Nathan Deal, who was under no re-election pressure but tremendous pressure from big businesses, announced Monday that he would veto legislation meant to protect opponents of same-sex marriage.\u201cI do not think that we have to discriminate against anyone to protect the faith-based community in Georgia,\u201d Mr. Deal said. But the move was also widely seen as a way to ward off the kind of economic threats being hurled at North Carolina.In the Mississippi Senate, Republicans argued that their bill would protect residents from being forced to act in violation of their religious beliefs, while Democrats, many of them black, likened the bill to shameful moments in the state\u2019s racist past. State Senator John Horhn, a Democrat, read passages from the Book of Ephesians and others that had been used by Christians to justify slavery.\u201cWe don\u2019t need to demonstrate to the rest of the world how backwards we are in our thinking,\u201d he said.The sweeping bill passed on a 32-to-17 vote. If signed, it will let government clerks decline to issue marriage certificates to same-sex couples as long as they have found another official to issue them. The Human Rights Campaign, a gay rights group, argues that the bill would let faith-based groups refuse to sell or rent a home to lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people.In Virginia, Gov. Terry McAuliffe, a Democrat, vetoed a bill on Wednesday passed by Republican legislators that was meant to protect opponents of same-sex marriage. In South Dakota, the Republican governor, Dennis Daugaard, recently vetoed a bill that would have forced transgender students in public schools to choose a bathroom based on their birth gender.In North Carolina, the blowback is already merging with a broader Democratic Party argument that the state\u2019s Republican leadership is out of touch with the mainstream. It is an argument Democrats are likely to deploy not just in the governor\u2019s race, but also in the presidential election, particularly if Republicans nominate Mr. Trump or his main rival, Senator Ted Cruz of Texas.Democrats are smelling similar opportunities to engage in culture-war arguments in other places where Republicans dominate state government, but a Democratic presidential candidate may have a shot against Mr. Cruz or Mr. Trump. These include Indiana, which, like North Carolina, President Obama won in 2008 but lost in 2012. Last week, the Republican governor of Indiana, Mike Pence, signed a law approved by the Republican-controlled Legislature that holds doctors liable if a woman has an abortion solely because of objections to the fetus\u2019s race, sex or a disability like Down syndrome.Mr. Pence\u2019s Democratic rival, John Gregg, lost to Mr. Pence by three percentage points in the 2012 election. Mr. Gregg, who calls himself \u201cpersonally pro-life,\u201d nonetheless denounced Mr. Pence\u2019s decision to sign the bill.In Florida, the second-term Republican governor, Rick Scott, is not facing re-election, but this, too, is seen by many in politics as a state up for grabs in the presidential contest. Florida Democrats were quick to pile on Mr. Scott\u2019s signing of a bill last Friday banning state funding for facilities that perform abortions.The incremental expansion of abortion limits and pro-gun legislation has a long history. Jennifer Baker, a spokeswoman for the National Rifle Association\u2019s lobbying arm, said 13 pro-gun bills had been enacted by states this year, with 11 more awaiting the signatures of governors. \u201cI think the overwhelming majority of Americans support law-abiding gun owners\u2019 ability to exercise their Second Amendment rights, and I think that\u2019s reflected in the fact that lawmakers in state legislatures across the country are passing pro-Second Amendment legislation,\u201d she said.Ms. Baker said that a new frontier in gun rights involved laws that let people older than 21 carry concealed weapons without permits. In West Virginia, Republican lawmakers passed such a law this month after overriding a veto from the Democratic governor, Earl Ray Tomblin. In Georgia, Republican legislators passed a bill allowing people over 21 to carry concealed weapons onto public college and university campuses. Mr. Deal has indicated that he has concerns about the bill but has not said definitively if he will veto it.In Utah, a new, first-of-its-kind abortion law requires doctors to give women anesthesia for an abortion at 20 weeks or later.The success of such measures is encouraging to social conservatives who are otherwise worried about the Republican Party.The difference between Washington and the statehouses, he added, was evident: \u201cQuite frankly, you can get stuff done at the state level that you can\u2019t get done here.\u201dAn earlier version of this article, relying on information from the Mississippi Senate\u2019s reading clerk, misstated the vote on a bill that would protect residents from being forced to act in violation of their religious beliefs. It was 32-17, not 31-17.Advertisement"}

Baer, assistant attorney general for the antitrust division. \u201cExecutives who abuse their positions as leaders of major corporations to organize criminal activity must be held accountable for their actions.\u201dThe indictment was filed on Tuesday in United States District Court for the Western District of Oklahoma. The department said this was the first case resulting from a continuing federal antitrust investigation into price fixing, bid rigging and other anticompetitive conduct in the oil and natural gas industry.It did not mention anyone else or any other company, nor did it say how many leases were involved.Mr. McClendon released a statement late Tuesday denying all charges, arguing that for 35 years he has worked to create jobs and help Oklahoma\u2019s economy while providing plentiful energy for the entire country.\u201cThe charge that has been filed against me today is wrong and unprecedented,\u201d Mr. McClendon said. \u201cI have been singled out as the only person in the oil and gas industry in over 110 years since the Sherman Act became law to have been accused of this crime in relation to joint bidding on leasehold.\u201dGordon Pennoyer, a spokesman for Chesapeake, said the company \u201chas been actively cooperating for some time\u201d with the antitrust investigation. He added, \u201cChesapeake does not expect to face criminal prosecution or fines relating to this matter.\u201dUnder Mr. McClendon\u2019s leadership, Chesapeake and a handful of other companies transformed the face of energy in the United States, turning the country from an energy importer to an exporter and pioneering hydraulic fracturing in newly explored shale fields with ample global financing.Chesapeake\u2019s stock price, which is now under $3 a share, has been sinking for most of the last five years, especially since it was revealed that Mr. McClendon had taken a personal stake in Chesapeake wells and then used those investments as collateral for up to $1.1 billion in loans used mostly to pay for his share of the cost of drilling those wells.Over the last two and a half years, the oil industry experienced its deepest downturn since at least the 1990s.He was once fined $250,000 by the National Basketball Association for bragging that he and his partners did not buy the Seattle SuperSonics to keep the team in Seattle \u2014 a statement that was at odds with the N.B.A. commissioner\u2019s intentions. The Sonics moved to Oklahoma City for the 2008-9 season, and they became the Thunder. They play in Chesapeake Energy Arena.The Sierra Club cut its ties to the natural gas industry as environmentalists raised concerns over pollution caused by fracking and the disposal of fracking fluids.Mr. McClendon is now the chairman of American Energy Partners, a private company that seeks investments in shale fields globally. It recently signed an agreement with YPF, the Argentine national oil company, to help develop a shale field in Patagonia.Advertisement"}

Mr. da Silva, who led Brazil from 2003 to 2010, has been dealing with charges of illicit self-enrichment since he left office. Close associates, including his former chief of staff, Jos\u00e9 Dirceu de Oliveira e Silva, and the former treasurer of the ruling Workers\u2019 Party, Jo\u00e3o Vaccari Neto, are in prison for corruption.Mr. da Silva, a leftist leader, says he is not guilty and is entitled to his day in court.

This latest move by the governing party sent protesters to the streets to demand Ms. Rousseff\u2019s resignation and to express their outrage at what amounts to blatant cronyism. If her latest blunder pushes the impeachment effort across the finish line, Ms. Rousseff will have only herself to blame.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Quonset Makes a New Name for Itself in Business", "Date": "2016-03-15", "News": "Supported bySquare Feet8 PhotosNORTH KINGSTOWN, R.I. \u2014 Decades after it was decommissioned as a Navy base, Quonset Point is having a rebirth, becoming a small city of its own.The sprawling Quonset Business Park recently reached a milestone, surpassing 10,000 employees at companies on the site. Its success is being cited as a model as Rhode Island tries to improve its economy.The 3,212-acre site about 20 miles south of Providence has its own port, airport and rail line. It will become home this spring to a nonprofit based in the state, Edesia, which will open a new 85,000-square-foot factory on the grounds.Edesia decided to build in Quonset after a yearlong search, said its founder and executive director, Navyn Salem. Edesia signed a 25-year lease for a 10-acre parcel, which gives it room to grow again if needed, Ms. Salem said.One reason Edesia chose Quonset was its site-readiness program, which provides pad-ready parcels with all the necessary permits and approvals essentially in place. \u201cShovels in the ground within 90 days\u201d is the promise. As a result, it can take less than a year to put up a building, as was the case with another recent arrival in the park, Greencore USA, a company based in Dublin that makes and distributes sandwiches and other fresh foods.After signing a lease in March 2014 with the Quonset Development Corporation, a quasi-state entity that manages the park, and breaking ground two months later, Greencore\u2019s $40 million, 107,000-square-foot plant opened last year.\u201cWe built in less than 12 months,\u201d said J. Rene Ouimet, a Greencore senior vice president.Quonset\u2019s ability to speed the process along was attractive to Greencore, which is expanding its business in the United States, Mr. Ouimet said. Another selling feature was its location between Boston and New York, which gives Greencore access to the huge Northeast market, he said.Quonset is finally becoming the economic engine many hoped it would be after Quonset Air Naval Station was decommissioned in 1973. After decades of costly environmental cleanup and infrastructure improvements, the business park houses 200 companies, now with 11,000 employees.\u201cQuonset is a great success,\u201d said the state\u2019s governor, Gina M. Raimondo.Not only do the companies there provide jobs, she said, but many of them are well-paying jobs, which Rhode Island needs.These businesses include large companies like Electric Boat, the nuclear submarine division of General Dynamics based in Connecticut. Others are smaller companies employing a dozen or so people.More than 1,000 acres at the business park have been leased or sold, and 38 parcels totaling 275 acres remain available. The remaining land at the site has been set aside for open space and recreation, including a golf course, and for infrastructure.The report\u2019s recommendation, Ms. Raimondo said, is \u201ccertainly something we\u2019re going to look at.\u201dDuring World War II, Quonset Point was a military city of some 20,000, many of whom lived and worked in the metal Quonset huts that were invented there. It was also home to the Seabees, the Navy\u2019s engineering and construction battalions, which were stationed at an adjacent base. That base was decommissioned in 1994.Senator Jack Reed, a Democrat who has represented the state in the House and Senate for 25 years, says he thinks longtime Rhode Islanders still think of Quonset in terms of its storied past. That is easy to do: Quonset Point is a peninsula set off from the main road that runs through North Kingstown and is easy to drive by without giving it much thought.But steadily, Quonset has become a new little city of varied companies. At a ceremony this month to hail the construction of a $5 million, 35,000-square-foot addition to Norad, a private company that imports and finishes cars, Ms. Raimondo and other elected officials credited the vision of early tenants of the park, like Norad and Electric Boat, who could see potential in the dust, dirt and vine-covered Quonset huts the Navy left.When Norad, or North Atlantic Distribution, arrived in Quonset in 1986, the port was a \u201clonely place,\u201d said Michael Miranda, the company\u2019s founder and president. In its first year, the company imported about 3,500 cars, which arrived at the Port of Davisville on 40 ships. Last year, 193 ships came to the port, and the company processed about 269,000 cars, making Norad one of the top 10 auto importers in North America.\u201cWe continue to grow, and we continue to employ more people,\u201d Mr. Miranda said, noting that the company now employs 400 people on a 150-acre waterfront parcel.He has invested $40 million in his business over the years, but said he would not have if the state and federal governments had not cleaned up the former base and improved its infrastructure. Those improvements have included a new $55 million rail line, a $186 million highway leading into and out of the former base, and $22 million in road and pier improvements.Private investment in Quonset since 1985 has topped $507 million, according to the development agency. In total, the state and federal governments have invested more than $600 million in redevelopment. The federal government spent more than $100 million on environmental cleanup alone, a job that included demolishing a majority of military structures on the old base.A few original military structures remain \u2014 one small company is in the former brig \u2014 but hundreds of others have come down in a substantial effort to make the site more visually appealing, said Steven J. King, the business park\u2019s manager.Trees and other plantings have been added to improve curb appeal, Mr. King said, and to interested parties he stresses Quonset\u2019s location and access to sea, rail and air. Other regions of the country might be less expensive to do business in, but companies in Quonset have access to a consumer market of 25 million within a three-hour drive, he noted.\u201cI can remember the trees growing through the windows of abandoned Quonset huts,\u201d Mr. Whitehouse said, \u201cso to see this level of activity is terrific.\u201dAn article on the Square Feet page on Wednesday about the transformation of the decommissioned Quonset Air Naval Station in Rhode Island into a thriving industrial park misstated the size of a $5 million addition for Norad, an early tenant that imports and finishes cars. It is 35,000 square feet, not 230,000 square feet.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Statistics From China Say Coal Consumption Continues to Drop", "Date": "2016-03-02", "News": "Supported byMuch of the world is watching China\u2019s actions on carbon emissions, since it is responsible for about half of the world\u2019s coal consumption. President Xi Jinping has said that China intends for its greenhouse gas emissions to stop growing around 2030. Some climate experts in China say the peak could come earlier, closer to 2025.In a new estimate of greenhouse gas emissions worldwide, a team of international researchers said China\u2019s carbon dioxide emissions had fallen 2.5 percent in 2015 compared with 2014. Emissions in the United States, the largest emitter after China, were down 3 percent, and carbon dioxide emissions globally appeared to have dropped 0.43 percent, according to Glen Peters, a member of the team, called the Global Carbon Project.Zeng Hao, a coal industry analyst in Shanxi, one of China\u2019s biggest coal-producing provinces, said the industry did worse than expected in 2015. Coal producers were hoping for a recovery in the third quarter, but it never materialized, he said.The surplus of plants is not expected to result in a big surge in coal use, since the slowing economy is the main reason consumption has fallen. But besides adding to the overcapacity problem, the glut is expected to make it harder for companies generating energy from renewable sources to earn revenue, since the coal-generated plants compete with them for contracts with the state-owned enterprises that run China\u2019s electricity grids. The coal-fired power plants have an advantage in securing contracts and time on the grid.\u201cWarnings about China\u2019s overcapacity crisis are coming in left, right and center, and yet the rate at which new coal power plants are being approved is increasing,\u201d said Lauri Myllyvirta, a senior global coal campaigner at Greenpeace and a main author of the report. \u201cThese plants do nothing but fuel the overcapacity crisis and add huge debt burdens. It is a trend which must be halted immediately.\u201dOn Wednesday, Todd D. Stern, the United States special envoy for climate change, who was in Beijing for talks, said that some Chinese officials had expressed concern about whether President Obama\u2019s successor would ensure that the United States was committed to the global climate accord reached in Paris in December.Mr. Stern said he had tried to reassure the officials. \u201cI think it would be highly surprising to me if anybody elected were to try to pull the United States out of that,\u201d he said at a news briefing.

The shootings in January led to the arrests of three teenage brothers, who are homeless themselves and now in jail.\u201cYou step in there, and it\u2019s like you\u2019re not even in the United States anymore,\u201d said Harold Scoggins, the chief of the Seattle Fire Department, who went into the Jungle after the shootings with a group of public health and safety officials for two days of study.To motorists who have long driven in traffic lanes above the Jungle every day without noticing the squalor below, and to many residents who barely knew of the camp\u2019s existence, a place that was out of mind has suddenly become the symbol of a city\u2019s failure, some residents say.Piles of garbage line parts of this barren, dirt-packed world. Expansion joints from the elevated highway clatter like nonstop drums overhead. Neatly tended and zipped tents are interspersed with squalor \u2014 shoes, sleeping bags and clothes strewn in chaos.\u201cWhat does that say about us as a society?\u201d asked Christopher Goodwin, 52, who lives on a boat in north Seattle and said he had spoken to many of the homeless people in his neighborhood, visiting the Jungle as well.Mr. Goodwin said he believed that some people did choose this lifestyle, and that drugs dashed other\u2019s lives into wreckage. But ultimately, he said, Seattle allowed the Jungle to become what it is. \u201cWe created their ability to live there,\u201d he said.In a report released last month about conditions in the Jungle, Chief Scoggins and his team said they had found blight, misery and filth beyond anything they had imagined. They described hearing tales from residents of heroin addiction and trafficking, depravity and sexual violence that never make it onto police blotters.\u201cThe human waste, the solid waste, the drugs, the tents \u2014 even when you have areas of poverty around the world, you don\u2019t see it all in one place,\u201d Chief Scoggins said.As in San Francisco, the boom in technology jobs is transforming Seattle and its economy, pushing up rents and home prices, drawing in newcomers and displacing low-income residents from once-affordable neighborhoods.At the Jungle, investigators and residents said they were struck by the mix: There were couples living together and people with jobs, but also many hard-core heroin addicts. The three teenagers arrested in January\u2019s shootings \u2014 two of whom could face life in prison, charged as adults though the oldest is only 17 \u2014 were bent on robbing a Jungle drug dealer of cash and heroin, the police said.Mr. Murray, the mayor, said in an interview that he thought it was a moral and public safety priority to clear out the Jungle \u2014 slowly and carefully \u2014 and relocate people. Fire concerns alone make the case for action, he said. Chief Scoggins\u2019s report cited vast amounts of cooking fuels like propane that could threaten the highway structure itself.But the city, Mr. Murray said, cannot do it alone \u2014 both for lack of money and because the Jungle is not on city property. Negotiations with the state, he said, which owns the land beneath the highway, are now underway.Beyond that, Mr. Murray said, the Jungle is really just a mirror of the larger world. Federal money to help build low-income housing has dried up over the years, as have state funds for mental health and addiction treatment. \u201cWe as a city have got to come together, so that we can build a movement with other cities and force this on the national agenda,\u201d the mayor said.Jungle residents like Donovan Cates, 43, said there were a lot of misconceptions about life under the highway. The Jungle, he said, is really not one camp but a series of them, divided by the interstate\u2019s concrete pillars and supports. His area, he said, with about 20 residents in an industrial zone south of downtown, is better than some.\u201cLike any neighborhood, people watch out for each other, or they don\u2019t,\u201d said Mr. Cates, who came to Seattle from Montana for a job in a bar in the late 1990s. The bar closed after being damaged in an earthquake, he said, and things went downhill from there. He said that he had no idea where he might go if the camp closed, and that he had \u201cno family to speak of.\u201dBut with the Jungle so much in the news since the shootings, he sensed a change in public attitudes every time he stepped out of the camp.\u201cI get funny looks,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}

Marvelous is a biochemist; Donald a partner in a law firm. The measure of their success can be easily gleaned from the traditional furnishings displayed on the handsome set by Clint Ramos. Their comfort with our native customs is indicated by the comfy armchair squarely facing the flat-screen television in the living room, into which Donald settles to watch a college football game.Marvelous, played with regal elegance by Ms. Tunie, has taken charge of the coming celebration, piling up platters of rich canap\u00e9s to treat family and friends before the rehearsal dinner. Donald and Marvelous\u2019s eldest daughter, also a lawyer, Tendi (a sterling Roslyn Ruff), will be marrying her boyfriend Chris (Joby Earle, endearingly goofy) on the morrow, and Marvelous is the kind of woman who wants to make sure no detail has been overlooked.Of course, a wedding without drama would hardly qualify as a wedding at all, and Ms. Gurira proves a plentiful caterer in this regard. Up first is the mild tension between Marvelous and her younger daughter, Nyasha (Ito Aghayere), who has just returned from a trip to her ancestral home, full of renewed pride in her heritage and questions about her parents\u2019 apparent lack of interest in maintaining ties to the culture they were born into.Nyasha, whom Ms. Aghayere portrays with appealing vibrancy, bubbles with enthusiasm over her trip, but she must also defend herself from her mother\u2019s cutting remarks about her somewhat formless career as an aspiring singer-songwriter who makes a modest living as a feng shui consultant.Also on the receiving end of Marvelous\u2019s imperious asides is her sister Margaret (a warm, slightly melancholy Melanie Nicholls-King), who has also become firmly assimilated into a new culture \u2014 Nyasha and her mother share a joke about her frequent \u201cweaves\u201d \u2014 albeit with less financial success. (To anesthetize herself against her sister\u2019s subtle broadsides in this regard, she continually nurses a glass of red wine.)But the bombshell comes with the arrival from Zimbabwe of Marvelous\u2019s older sister, Anne, played with a commanding air of dignity by the superb Myra Lucretia Taylor. This surprise, arranged by Tendi, does not sit well with Marvelous when she learns that Anne will perform a traditional Zimbabwean \u201cbride price\u201d ceremony.\u201cThat is a nonstarter!\u201d Marvelous announces upon learning the news.\u201cYou think you are white now?\u201d Anne counters. \u201cNow you want to judge me? I am here to bless our daughter,\u201d she adds, putting the emphasis on \u201cour,\u201d indicating the cultural tradition by which a young woman\u2019s aunts are also considered her \u201cmother.\u201dMs. Gurira weaves issues of cultural identity and displacement, generational frictions and other meaty matters into dialogue that flows utterly naturally. Her engaging characters are drawn with sympathy and, under the crisp direction of Rebecca Taichman, \u201cFamiliar\u201d stays firmly on course even as the complications pile up.And all the confrontations are considerably leavened by humor, particularly when Chris must rope in his brother, the laid-back Brad (a hilarious Joe Tippett) into representing him during the bride price ceremony, because it\u2019s improper for the groom himself to partake directly in negotiations.FamiliarBy Danai Gurira; directed by Rebecca Taichman; sets by Clint Ramos; costumes by Susan Hilferty; lighting by Tyler Micoleau; sound by Darron L West; hair and wig design by Cookie Jordan; production stage manager, Cole P.

{"Headline": "In Democratic Debate, Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders Clash on Immigration", "Date": "2016-03-09", "News": "Supported by_______Hillary Clinton and Senator Bernie Sanders clashed vividly over immigration reform, health care and Cuba during a contentious debate Wednesday as the two Democrats appealed to Hispanic voters and tried to outdo each other in assailing Donald J. Trump.Aiming her remarks at viewers watching on Univision, a Spanish-language sponsor of the debate, Mrs. Clinton threw his past support for Fidel Castro and President Daniel Ortega of Nicaragua in Mr. Sanders\u2019s face and repeatedly criticized him for opposing a 2007 bill that would have created a path to citizenship for millions of immigrants in the country illegally.\u201cWe had Republican support,\u201d Mrs. Clinton said. \u201cWe had a president willing to sign it. I voted for that bill. Senator Sanders voted against it.\u201dShe refused to let up when Mr. Sanders explained that he thought the guest worker provisions in the bill were \u201cakin to slavery.\u201d Mrs. Clinton argued that she, Senator Edward M. Kennedy and Hispanic groups would never have supported such a bill. Her broadsides finally became too much for Mr. Sanders when she accused him of supporting \u201cvigilantes known as Minutemen\u201d on the border.\u201cNo, I do not support vigilantes \u2014 that is a horrific statement, an unfair statement to make,\u201d Mr. Sanders said. \u201cMadam Secretary, I will match my record against yours any day of the week.\u201dIn their final debate before primaries in Florida, Ohio and other states on Tuesday, the two Democrats were a study in contrasts as they made stark appeals to the demographic groups they have come to prize.Mrs. Clinton repeatedly aligned herself with the needs and concerns of immigrant families and stuck to her promise to \u201cknock down barriers\u201d in employment and housing, hoping these priorities would inspire Hispanics and African-Americans and deliver her landslide victories in Florida and North Carolina.Mr. Sanders\u2019s rallying cries against the \u201crigged economy\u201d and \u201cestablishment politics\u201d were aimed at liberals, young people, working-class white voters and independents who could be decisive for him in Ohio, Illinois and Missouri, his top targets next week.He appeared confident to the point of cocky at times, claiming at one point that Mrs. Clinton had borrowed from his proposals to make public colleges free. \u201cThank you for copying a very good idea,\u201d he said. He chortled when Mrs. Clinton accused him of not supporting clean energy ideas, and he muttered, \u201cCome on,\u201d when Mrs. Clinton refused to stop speaking.He also showed he could throw a punch, such as when Mrs. Clinton questioned the cost of his Medicare-for-all plan, saying, \u201cIf it sounds too good to be true, it probably is.\u201d\u201cWhat Secretary Clinton is saying is that the United States should continue to be the only major country on earth that doesn\u2019t guarantee health care to all of our people,\u201d Mr. Sanders said, drawing a stern look from his opponent.\u201cI do believe in universal coverage,\u201d she fired back. \u201cRemember, I fought for it 25 years ago.\u201dMr. Sanders\u2019s success in Michigan seemed to energize him Wednesday in countering Mrs. Clinton\u2019s attacks on immigration.\u201cSecretary Clinton prevailed upon the governor of New York, Eliot Spitzer, who wanted to do the right thing and provide driver\u2019s licenses to those who were undocumented,\u201d Mr. Sanders said. \u201cShe said, \u2018Don\u2019t do it,\u2019 and New York State still does not do it.\u201d He also noted that he had supported allowing children from war-torn Central American countries to enter the United States and asserted that Mrs. Clinton\u2019s view was \u201csend them back.\u201d\u201cThat is something that is not fair about what I said,\u201d Mrs. Clinton said. \u201cI did say we needed to be very concerned about little children coming to this country on their own, very often, many of them not making it, and when they got here, they needed, as I have argued for, legal counsel, due process, to make a decision.\u201dBoth candidates, who consistently praise President Obama on most issues, vowed to end the mass deportations of his administration. They both flatly promised not to deport children.Mrs. Clinton projected steeliness throughout the debate and did not seem fazed by her loss in Michigan, taking comfort in her accumulation of more of the delegates needed to win the Democratic nomination. She has a steadily growing delegate lead over Mr. Sanders in spite of his successes, because her margins of victory have been greater.Yet she was careful to show that she was not taking the nomination for granted, even pushing back against a question about whether she had gotten ahead of herself in assuming she had all but beaten Mr. Sanders.\u201cI\u2019m continuing to work hard for every single vote across our country,\u201d Mrs. Clinton said. \u201cI was pleased that I got 100,000 more votes last night than my opponent, and more delegates.\u201dAccording to the Associated Press, Donald J. Trump and Hillary Clinton have each won enough delegates to claim their party\u2019s nomination for president.Each candidate sought to be perceived as the more formidable challenger to Mr. Trump, the Republican front-runner.Mrs. Clinton argued that Mr. Trump was promoting \u201cun-American views\u201d and promised to \u201ctake every opportunity to criticize\u201d him. Later, she mocked his centerpiece proposal to build \u201ca very tall wall, right, a beautiful, tall wall.\u201dMr. Sanders argued that he could convince Democratic Party leaders and elected officials that \u201cBernie Sanders is the strongest candidate to defeat Donald Trump.\u201dMr. Sanders said he was confident that Americans would not elect Mr. Trump, and pointed out that Mr. Trump had been a leading skeptic of whether Mr. Obama was born in the United States and eligible to be president. Mr. Sanders noted that no one had challenged him over the fact that his own father was born in Poland.\u201cNobody has ever asked me for my birth certificate,\u201d Mr. Sanders said. \u201cMaybe that has to do with the color of my skin.\u201dBoth Democrats saw the debate as an opportunity to reach Latino voters not only in Florida, but also in Arizona, California, Illinois and other states with large Hispanic populations.Asked whether he stood by his positive statements in the past about Mr. Castro and Mr. Ortega, Mr. Sanders sought to put the remarks in context but did not disavow them. Mrs. Clinton pounced.\u201cI just couldn\u2019t disagree more,\u201d she said. \u201cIf the values are that you oppress people, you disappear people, you imprison people, even kill people for expressing their opinions, for expressing freedom of speech, that is not the kind of revolution of values that I ever want to see anywhere.\u201dMrs. Clinton was introspective when asked why many Americans do not trust her. \u201cObviously, it\u2019s painful for me to hear that,\u201d she said. \u201cI am not a natural politician, in case you haven\u2019t noticed, like my husband or President Obama,\u201d she added. \u201cI just have to do the best I can\u201d and \u201chope that people see that I am fighting for them.\u201dMany of the questions to Mrs. Clinton were provocatively worded, especially those from Jorge Ramos of Univision. After playing a video in which the mother of an American killed in Benghazi, Libya, questioned whether Mrs. Clinton had told the truth about the attacks there, Mr. Ramos bluntly asked: \u201cDid you lie to them?\u201dMrs. Clinton was taken aback. \u201cShe\u2019s wrong. She\u2019s absolutely wrong,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen we had information we made it public, but then sometimes we had to go back and say, we have new information that contradicts it.\u201dMr. Ramos also pressed Mrs. Clinton on whether she would drop out of the race if she were indicted on charges related to her use of a private email server as secretary of state. At first she ignored the question, but when the moderators followed up, she dismissed it curtly.\u201cOh, for goodness \u2014 that is not going to happen,\u201d she said. \u201cI am not even answering that question.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Over the centuries, the three-story medieval barn, with a partial fourth story, was also used as a warehouse; it has a large wooden wheel in the attic used to convey items up and down.The nearly 3,000-square-foot home, which has four bedrooms and three and a half bathrooms, is part of a complex that includes two other buildings, also renovated in recent years but separately owned.The main entrance to the home is through a gate off cobblestone Troksnu Street, said Ilze Mazurenko, an agent and an owner of Baltic Sotheby\u2019s International Realty, who has the listing. The house was renovated \u201caccording to all the rules and regulations of the government,\u201d Ms. Mazurenko said, including restoring metal crosses and wooden arched shutters found on the facade.Potted plants surround a terrace leading to the traditional green arched front door, which opens to a foyer with a staircase and elevator. Beyond is a spacious open living and dining room with a working wood-burning fireplace with a marble surround. Exposed oak beams adorn the ceilings. Beyond the living room is a kitchen, with wood painted cabinets, granite countertops, breakfast bar and high-end appliances.Most floors are oak, while some rooms, including the kitchen, have brick floors. Furniture is included in the home\u2019s asking price.The second floor has a master-bedroom suite, with a living area, a chess room and a walk-in closet. Its bathroom has a bathtub, glass shower with rain shower head, bidet and Villeroy & Boch fixtures. There are also laundry facilities on the second floor.The two bedrooms on the third floor have slanted ceilings with exposed beams and dormer windows. Both have en-suite bathrooms with showers. A partial fourth floor is a loft with a built-in platform bed and a skylight. The antique wooden wheel is a feature of this room.The home has a central location near the Swedish Gate, built in 1698 during Swedish occupation and the only such structure left in Riga. Jacob\u2019s Barracks is a collection of 18th-century red-roofed buildings along Torna Street, just steps from the house, that has been restored several times and is home to a number of bars, restaurants and shops. Tourist attractions like Dome Square and St. Peter\u2019s Church are a short stroll away; other sites can be reached by public transportation, which includes bus, rail and trolley. Riga International Airport is about 15 minutes by car.MARKET OVERVIEW Though home prices fell in Latvia in the second part of 2007 by as much as 65 percent, and the economy was close to collapse, things have turned around since 2010, largely thanks to international aid and a government residency permit program, agents said.\u201cMore than any other sector, housing went through a shock in 2008 and 2009 that gave everyone a good lesson,\u201d said Aldis Riekstins, the head of customer services with Latio, a real estate company with offices in Latvia.A 2010 change to immigration policy enabled any non-European Union buyer of a home costing at least 143,000 euros, about $162,000, in a large city, or 72,000 euros, about $81,000, elsewhere, to apply for a five-year residency permit in Latvia. But in the fall of 2014, the minimum price for a property in the residency permit program was raised to 250,000 euros, about $283,000, in any part of the country.\u201cWhen the residency permit program threshold was increased in September 2014, the number of transactions declined by more than 50 percent in 2015,\u201d Ms. Mazurenko said. Prices in 2015 fell by about 10 percent, she said.Currently, average home prices are about 59 percent lower than they were at their height in July 2007, when an unrenovated standard-type apartment cost 1,620 euros per square meter, or $170 a square foot, said Aigars Smits, chairman of the board of directors of Arco Real Estate, with offices in Latvia.A single-family home in the Old Town of Riga is typically very hard to come by, with areas like Mezaparks or Baltezers being more likely places to find single-family homes, Ms. Mazurenko said. Foreign home buyers traditionally have been attracted to the Art Nouveau embassy district in Riga, called the \u201csilent center\u201d for its quiet, but generally they are seeking apartments, she said.Currently, the most expensive average prices in Riga are in the \u201csilent center,\u201d where homes start at around 1,300 to 1,900 euros per square meter, or about $135 to $200 a square foot, and range up to 4,000 euros per square meter, or about $420 a square foot, for apartments in renovated prewar buildings with impressive architecture, Mr. Smits said.Other areas that have been popular with foreign buyers are Kipsala (an island across the Daugava River), as well as the resort of Jurmala, about a 30-minute drive outside Riga. Prices in Jurmala, the most popular resort city in the Baltic States, Ms. Mazurenko said, tend to start at 800,000 euros, or about $900,000, and range up to 15 million euros, or about $17 million.WHO BUYS IN LATVIAMs. Mazurenko said that while there are a small number of buyers in Latvia from Sweden, the United States, Britain and Norway, the majority of buyers for the luxury market, which is predominantly in Jurmala, are Russians.BUYING BASICSForeigners cannot buy agricultural land or land near national borders, but there are otherwise few restrictions in Latvia, Mr. Smits said. In Jurmala, Mr. Riekstins said, foreign home buyers cannot buy land in the dune area along the coast.Notaries typically handle sales transactions, and generally charge 200 to 300 euros, or about $225 to $340, brokers said. The largest expense is the 2 percent stamp duty, and if a mortgage is to be registered, that costs an additional 0.1 percent of the loan, Mr. Riekstins said.The seller typically pays the real estate agent commission, which ranges from 2.5 percent to 5 percent. Ten- to 20-year mortgages are available for foreign home purchasers and typically require about 50 percent to 70 percent down, with interest rates of 3 percent to 5 percent, brokers said.

That lays the groundwork for more of its members to vote to impeach Ms. Rousseff. That will most likely happen next month.Several of Ms. Rousseff\u2019s ministers, who belong to the PMDB, were asked by their party leaders to step down.

The request comes just months before the start of the Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro.Increased government paralysis is seen as one consequence.After the PMDB decision, Ms. Rousseff canceled a trip to Washington, where she was supposed to participate in a nuclear security summit meeting this week.In Bras\u00edlia, Romero Juc\u00e1, a senator who led Tuesday\u2019s meeting, which lasted less than five minutes, said, \u201cNobody in the country is authorized to serve in any federal appointment in the name of the PMDB party.\u201dWhile the PMDB includes both longtime opponents and supporters of Ms. Rousseff, she cannot afford to lose any votes in Congress.After narrowly winning re-election in late 2014, Ms. Rousseff has struggled to show leadership as bad economic news worsened, and an unprecedented corruption scandal widened involving the state oil company, Petrobras.While Ms. Rousseff has denied that her campaigns received any illegal money, or that she had any knowledge of corruption at Petrobras, criticism of her grew this month after she named the former president, Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva, to her cabinet. That appointment was seen in some circles as a way to shield him from arrest by prosecutors who are investigating graft accusations against him.Subsequently, impeachment proceedings against Ms. Rousseff began in a committee in Brazil\u2019s lower house. That committee is expected to vote in April. The full house would then vote. If it voted to impeach, and then the Senate voted to open proceedings, Ms. Rousseff would be suspended for 180 days while she went on trial. Brazil\u2019s vice president, Michel Temer, who leads the PMDB, but did not attend Tuesday\u2019s meeting, would then temporarily take over, with the ability to appoint ministers and enact policy.Ms. Rousseff still has opportunities to thwart impeachment, or at least delay the proceedings. If the full lower house voted to impeach, she could appeal to the high court and the Senate would have to await a ruling before voting on whether it could commence its own impeachment deliberations.Moreover, at any time between now and then, Ms. Rousseff also has other legal remedies. \u201cShe can appeal at any moment she finds something legally questionable occurring in the process,\u201d said Bras\u00edlio Sallum Jr., a professor of sociology at the University of S\u00e3o Paulo and an expert in Brazil\u2019s political processes.Her legal strategy aside, many question how the removal of Ms. Rousseff, by itself, would help the country out of its predicaments.\u201cImpeachment alone may not be the solution to the crisis,\u201d said Jo\u00e3o Augusto de Castro Neves, the Latin America regional director of the Eurasia Group, a political risk consulting firm.That is largely because many other leaders, particularly in the PMDB, have been implicated in the Petrobras investigation. While Mr. Temer has not been implicated, he would be vulnerable to political fallout from problems faced by his colleagues.It is also unclear how much public support he has. His approval ratings are not much higher than Ms. Rousseff\u2019s.\u201cAll of these scenarios \u2014 one in which she survives, the other one in which Temer takes over, and the new elections scenario \u2014 they all point to very tough policy making in the next year or two,\u201d Mr. Castro Neves said.He foresaw \u201cgovernments that are relatively weak or won\u2019t have enough political capital to do everything that needs to be done to fix the economy.\u201dIt is unclear how much public support the PMDB will have. Following the vote on Tuesday, Marina Silva, a longtime critic of Ms. Rousseff, denounced the PMDB for its move, saying it was \u201cequally responsible\u201d for the country\u2019s political and economic crisis.The party is widely viewed as one that stands for no principles or ideology except staying in power. It does not field candidates in presidential elections but rather looks to play a decisive role in helping the winner.It has long been an irritant to both Ms. Rousseff and her predecessor, Mr. da Silva.State Department officials have taken note. In a 2004 cable, made available by WikiLeaks, American diplomats observed that \u201cthe PMDB has never pretended to be more than a high-maintenance ally-of-convenience whose constant sniping often exposes coalition fissures.\u201dWhether the PMDB leadership\u2019s decision to abandon Ms. Rousseff will prove politically expedient remains unclear. Some prominent members have sharply criticized it.On Tuesday, Brazil\u2019s minister of agriculture, K\u00e1tia Abreu, a PMDB member, defended Ms. Rousseff in an interview with Globo Rural.Ms. Abreu said that she thought what was happening to Ms. Rousseff was unmerited and that impeachment would be \u201ctraumatic\u201d for the country.Because of an editing error, an article on Wednesday about a party in Brazil\u2019s governing coalition that withdrew its support from the embattled president, Dilma Rousseff, misstated the status of some of Ms. Rousseff\u2019s cabinet ministers. Several ministers who belong to the Brazilian Democratic Movement Party have been asked by the party leadership to resign; they have not stepped down.Advertisement"}

The county\u2019s unemployment rate in December was 10.6 percent, the highest in Virginia and more than double the statewide rate of 3.9 percent. And since 1980, its population has fallen by about 40 percent. Dana O\u2019Quinn, a lifelong resident, has been a barber for close to 40 years. These days, fewer people are coming in to get their hair cut. Those who have remained are much poorer than people elsewhere in the state. Fewer than one in 10 adults have a bachelor\u2019s degree or higher. Ms. O\u2019Quinn, a Democrat, won\u2019t be voting for Mr. Trump. But she acknowledged his appeal, saying people in Buchanan County are looking for a change. As with other New England mill communities, those days are long gone. In December, the unemployment rate was 8 percent, among the highest in Massachusetts. Its median income is about half that of the state as a whole. Even its city motto lacks gusto: \u201cWe\u2019ll try.\u201d Bruno Teixeira, 68, voted for Mr. Trump on Tuesday. He used to work as a foreman at a factory that dyed and finished cloth. \u201cI was fortunate that I could say I retired,\u201d he said. \u201cI never thought I would, I thought it was going to be pulled out from under me, like it was for a lot of my colleagues.\u201d Mr. Teixeira\u2019s father came to the United States from Portugal, his mother from England. He said he liked Mr. Trump\u2019s views on immigration, as well as his straightforward talk. \u201cI think most people here realize this is a big opportunity to change the economy,\u201d he said. \u201cWho better to change the economy than a businessman?\u201d Atkinson County, in southern Georgia, is poorer and less educated than the state as a whole. Fewer than one in 10 adults has a bachelor\u2019s degree or higher. A sizable portion of the county is farmland, but hundreds of people also work in manufacturing. Its list of big employers last year included makers of prefabricated buildings, decorative moldings and bags for produce. Its share of residents who are Hispanic, about a quarter, is among the largest in Georgia. Most of them are of Mexican descent. (They were most likely not voting Republican; in Georgia, only 3 percent of voters in last Tuesday\u2019s Republican primary were Hispanic, according to exit polls.) Mr. Morris said his wife volunteered for the Trump campaign, getting the word out in Atkinson County. The interest in Mr. Trump, he said, was unmistakable. \u201cI\u2019ve been involved in party politics since \u201992,\u201d Mr. Morris said, \u201cand this is the most exciting thing I\u2019ve seen.\u201d Shelta Shrum, 59, spent two decades working at a boot factory, where she was a clerical worker.

Mr. Trudeau was greeted by cheering onlookers waving miniature American and Canadian flags, reflecting the same brand of rock-star adulation that characterized many of Mr. Obama\u2019s 2008 campaign appearances.The official visit unfolded against the backdrop of an increasingly intense campaign to succeed Mr. Obama. Mr. Trudeau, who has joked about welcoming Americans to his country if they are afraid of a Donald J. Trump presidency, diplomatically declined to criticize the Republican presidential front-runner during the news conference.\u201cI have tremendous confidence in the American people and look forward to working with whomever they choose to send to this White House later this year,\u201d Mr. Trudeau said, answering a question about the stakes for his country and its relationship with the United States should Mr. Trump or Senator Ted Cruz, Republican of Texas, win the White House.A somewhat amused Mr. Obama rejected the idea that his own tenure had helped to fuel Mr. Trump\u2019s rise, arguing that the \u201cRepublican political elites\u201d and news media were responsible for setting a divisive tone and elevating an us-versus-them mentality \u2014 including questions about the president\u2019s birthplace \u2014 that created an atmosphere in which Mr. Trump thrived.\u201cI have been blamed by Republicans for a lot of things, but being blamed for their primaries and who they\u2019re selecting for their party is,\u201d Mr. Obama said with a long pause and a grin, \u201cnovel.\u201d\u201cWhat I\u2019m not going to do is to validate some notion that the Republican crackup that\u2019s been taking place is a consequence of actions that I\u2019ve taken,\u201d he added.The Obama administration wants to cut methane emissions from the oil and gas sector by 40 percent to 45 percent from 2012 levels by 2025. The Interior Department has proposed a number of regulations on methane leaks, but it has yet to write a regulation governing such leaks from current oil and gas drilling on public land.Mr. Obama and Mr. Trudeau also pledged to cooperate in preserving the Arctic, and to move more quickly to carry out agreements made in climate talks in Paris last year.\u201cThe president and I agree on many things, including, of paramount importance, the direction we want to take our countries in to ensure a clean and prosperous future,\u201d Mr. Trudeau said, thanking the president, whom he addressed as Barack, for his leadership on climate change. \u201cCanada and the U.S. will stand side by side to confront the pressing needs that face not only our two countries, but the entire planet.\u201dThe official visit was to conclude with a state dinner in the East Room of the White House.The arrival of Mr. Trudeau and his wife, Sophie Gr\u00e9goire Trudeau \u2014 accompanied by their three young children \u2014 has prompted comparisons to a similar visit in 1977 by Pierre Trudeau, then the prime minister and the current leader\u2019s father. That visit made headlines when Margaret Trudeau, his wife, wore a short dress that fell just below the knee to the White House state dinner.The guest lists of White House state dinners are boldface ledgers showing the people whom presidents want to influence and reward.Mr. Obama\u2019s rejection of the pipeline severely strained relations with Mr. Harper, but Mr. Trudeau\u2019s election last year signaled a shift in policy that was welcomed by the White House. Mr. Trudeau did not criticize Mr. Obama\u2019s stance on the pipeline, and he has pledged to pursue an ambitious environmental agenda dovetailing with Mr. Obama\u2019s policies.In December, Canadian officials helped to push through a historic global climate agreement in Paris.In their Oval Office meeting on Thursday, the leaders also discussed military cooperation, efforts to combat terrorism, improvements in trade and environmental concerns.They agreed to push forward on an agreement allowing travelers from each country to be pre-cleared through immigration and customs, aiding tourism and commerce. The two leaders also struck a deal to share more information \u2014 including on no-fly lists and border crossings \u2014 in an effort to prevent foreign fighters from traveling freely between Canada and the United States.They parted with some issues unresolved, most prominently a decades-old dispute over softwood lumber. American officials say lumber from Canada is unfairly subsidized by the government there, an assertion that Canadian officials reject. Both leaders said they were optimistic about resolving their differences on the matter in the coming months.\u201cIt\u2019s been a longstanding bilateral irritant, but it hardly defines the nature of the U.S.-Canadian relationship,\u201d Mr. Obama said, adding that while each side would likely be dissatisfied with the outcome, officials would ultimately find a middle ground on the issue. \u201cPeople will complain and grumble,\u201d Mr. Obama said. \u201cBut it will be fine.\u201dAn earlier version of this article described Justin Trudeau\u2019s visit incorrectly. It is an official visit, not a state visit. (A state visit is reserved for heads of state; Mr. Trudeau is the head of government in Canada.) An earlier version also misstated the length of the dress worn by Margaret Trudeau, wife of Pierre Trudeau, who was Canada\u2019s prime minister, when he was honored at a state dinner at the White House in 1977. It was just below the knee, not above the knee.An article on Friday about a meeting between President Obama and Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of Canada misstated one of the elements of the formal arrival ceremony for Mr. Trudeau. It was a 19-gun salute, not a 21-gun salute. The article also rendered the name of his wife incorrectly. She is Sophie Gr\u00e9goire Trudeau \u2014 not Gr\u00e9goire-Trudeau.An earlier version of the caption for picture No. 9 in the accompanying slide show repeated the error about the dress Margaret Trudeau wore to a state dinner in 1977.Coral Davenport contributed reporting from Washington.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "In Saudi Arabia, a Kingdom to Myself", "Date": "2016-03-03", "News": "Untrammeled beaches, ancient sites and unfiltered local culture are all on offer in Saudi Arabia. Just don\u2019t expect an easy trip.Supported byI reached the port of Jizan in southwestern Saudi Arabia just in time to catch the speedboat. After buying my ticket and having my passport checked by a mustachioed police officer, I climbed into the small, closed cabin with a few other passengers, a box of vegetables, a green shag rug and a parakeet in a wire cage, and we set off for what I had been told was one of the most enchanting places in the kingdom.My destination lay 28 miles off the coast: Farasan Island, the largest of a cluster of sunbaked sand and coral outcroppings in the Red Sea that are festooned with pristine beaches, prime dive sites, mangrove forests and historic relics dating back centuries.The trip was my first lesson in what it means to travel in a country full of potential tourist sites that the government is ambivalent about letting foreigners see.Most people reach the island aboard passenger ferries bequeathed to residents by the previous Saudi king. But I had missed the last trip, so I had to endure an hourlong, bone-shattering trip across the waves on a wooden bench in the speedboat.After we landed, I rolled my bag to the parking lot to find scores of dust-covered pickup trucks but not a taxi in sight, because, as I was later informed, the island doesn\u2019t really have taxis. But before long, a student I had chatted with on the boat divined my predicament and delivered me to my hotel. His parakeet chirped the whole way.In a region where countries like Egypt, Jordan and the United Arab Emirates have invested to make tourism pillars of their economies, Saudi Arabia stands apart, and for good reason.The country\u2019s identity revolves around being the birthplace of Islam and home to its holiest sites. Part of that heritage is adherence to a strict creed by which shops close throughout the day for prayer, women wear head-to-toe black gowns and are barred from driving or from socializing with unrelated men, alcohol is illegal and drug dealers and other criminals are beheaded in public squares.That keeps the kingdom off the list of where most Westerners \u2014 and even many Saudis \u2014 want to spend spring break.Saudi officials say they are not against visitors; more than 10 million expats reside in the kingdom and millions more Muslims come every year for religious visits. And on a personal level, Saudis can be disarmingly friendly and hospitable.But as the world\u2019s largest oil exporter, Saudi Arabia has long lived without tourism income and has seen little need to attract tourists who might make out on beaches or hold hands at the mall. (Or who may be women traveling alone.)For now, the priority is encouraging Saudis to visit their own country. Tourist visas are not imminent, but for the intrepid tourist like me who gets in for other reasons (in my case a conference, as I report on the region) and follows the rules, there is the exhilaration of having awe-inspiring sites virtually to yourself.\u201cFor those who like history, culture and nature, there is lots to do,\u201d Salah Al-Bukhyyet, the commission\u2019s vice president, said in an interview. \u201cBut here in Saudi, you won\u2019t see people on the beach in bikinis.\u201dDespite their vast idyllic coastlines, the Farasan Islands have not a single beachfront restaurant. And despite extensive coral reefs, no one rents scuba gear, unless you book far enough in advance for it to be brought from the mainland.I wanted fish, so Mohammad Saigal, a local English teacher I had hired as a guide (1,000 riyals a day), drove me to the fish market, where we bought two fish as long as my forearm for 80 riyals and gave them to some men to grill. Back at the hotel there were no tables outside, so we walked to the end of a sandy pier, sat on the ground under the stars and ate with our hands. The fish were as tasty as I have ever had.After dinner, I confronted one reality of traveling alone in Saudi Arabia: When the sun goes down, there isn\u2019t much to do. Groups of men played loud rounds of cards in the lobby, and kids kicked a soccer ball on the grass outside. I went to bed early.I woke early, too, to the sounds of large Saudi families mobilizing for the beach. So I took a run along the coast and within 10 minutes was alone on a sandy track near clear, blue water, with no signs of other humans but the occasional remains of campfires.That afternoon, Mohammad and I hired a boat and a captain (250 riyals an hour) and looped around the back of the island, passing smaller coral isles along the way and spotting tall, stick-legged cranes fishing and gliding overhead. We later entered an inlet with mangrove forests on both sides. Skinny green fish skipped in front of the boat, and we watched dozens of large pelicans nesting in the branches and unfurling their wings to take flight. The captain killed the engine, and all was silent but the waves and the squawking of the birds.We docked on a sandy grove and hiked inland and uphill to see the mangroves from above, like canyons of green cut into the parched island. I asked Mohammad, a 37-year-old father of four, if residents wanted more tourists. He said what they really needed was better access to the outside. The ferries helped, but bringing goods and building materials was expensive, which limited development. There had been talk of a bridge, he said, and an airport, but for now the boats were the only lifeline.He also said he worried that no one was protecting the island, that the gazelles that used to be common had become rare, as had falcons and foxes.\u201cThere is too much neglect,\u201d he said.We headed out to sea, where our captain dropped anchor and passed out fishing lines on plastic spools. We baited our hooks and dropped them from the sides of the boat.\u201cAs soon as you feel the line jiggle, pull,\u201d Mohammad said.A moment later, I did, and reeled in a six-inch fish, pink with brown eyes. That was my sole catch, but in about 20 minutes, Mohammad and the captain caught three each, which they had grilled and gave me for dinner.The next morning, I met two single American women in T-shirts and capri pants sitting in the sun at the hotel and asked them about their experiences traveling as foreign women.They taught at an international school and said they had flown to Jizan and taken the ferry by themselves with no problems, although they had asked a male friend to drive them to the airport.Their advice: Be open-minded about the culture and don\u2019t judge, be prepared to cover up, respect gender rules and you will probably be surprised at how welcome you are.\u201cIt is definitely very segregated, but the Saudi people are lovely, hospitable and kind,\u201d one said.And if you are lucky, they said, you\u2019ll get invited to a party with Saudi women, with music, dancing, food and fashion, but no alcohol, tobacco or men.\u201cJust good clean fun,\u201d one said.Mohammad and I spent the day visiting sites around the island. At an old Ottoman fort, we found a group of out-of-work tour guides eating beans and fried dough on the steps. The site had been refurbished, but there was no information on its history, its windows had been shattered, and trash was everywhere.But the highlight \u2014 which was also a downer \u2014 was wandering through a number of communities that had been abandoned decades before and were slowly decaying. We walked through what had clearly been entire neighborhoods of fine homes with stone walls, palm-trunk rafters and intricate geometric designs in stucco around their entryways. Many of their roofs have now collapsed, and trees and vines had sprouted from their floors and courtyards. Many were full of trash. One held a flock of sheep.\u201cTotal neglect,\u201d Mohammad said.But it was still fun to scramble over the ruins sinking back in the date palms, with no sounds but the distant pounding of a resident building a new cinder block home.I wanted to treat myself to a nice lunch before I returned to the mainland. As Mohammad had heard that another hotel had a new cook, we dropped by. We were told that you have to order two hours in advance. So instead, I had tasty rice and chicken at a local joint full of laborers and bachelors (married men eat at home) where I was the only one using a spoon rather than my hands.I took the ferry from the island and passed the much smoother trip dozing and watching children play tag in the aisles. As in much public space in Saudi Arabia, including Hardee\u2019s and Starbucks, the passengers were divided, with single men on the left and families and single women on the right. But before I figured that out, I had sat in the ambiguous middle. No one seemed to care.My next stop was a site seen by many as the showpiece of Saudi archaeology: Mada\u2019in Saleh, or al-Hijr in Arabic, an ancient settlement of the Nabatean Empire that left its biggest traces about 2,000 years ago.Visiting it should be easier than visiting Farasan, given the new airport nearby. There are currently four flights in and four out each week, so when I got a ticket, I assumed I was fine. But I soon discovered that the airplane holds more people than the town\u2019s main hotel (the other one burned down a few years ago), which was fully booked, leaving me no place to stay. (I was later told about a tent camp out in the desert.)Visitors need permission to visit Mada\u2019in Saleh, something the hotel handled with a copy of my passport, along with finding me a guide named Tamir (800 riyals a day).When we reached the site the next morning, it was completely empty. Large sandstone formations rose from the rolling expanse of sand. About 2,000 years ago, the Nabateans had lived nearby and carved massive, elegant tombs into the rocks, adorning their entryways with statues of birds and images of flowers, faces and serpents.Their doors lead to large rooms, some with separate tombs inside, others with long shelves carved into the rock. And while the facades are perfectly flat, the inside walls bear the marks of thousands of chisel blows. My wrists got sore just thinking about it.I spent the morning happily wandering from tomb to tomb, snapping photos, marveling at the workmanship and wondering what the rest of the civilization had looked like. My guide was no help.\u201cI don\u2019t know the history,\u201d he said. \u201cI just know where stuff is.\u201dThe tombs are empty, mostly cleaned out by grave robbers long ago, and the plaques around the site lacked detail on the wider culture. Compared with sites in Egypt, it was pleasant to be left alone. There were no touts, no hawkers, no Bedouins offering camel rides, not even rangers to protect the sites. But some of the tombs had bullet holes in their facades and many were covered with graffiti.The inscription above the door to one tomb seemed to foresee that eventuality, warning that anyone who wrote on the tomb had to pay 3,000 harithis to someone named Thi al-Shira and the same amount to \u201cour lord the king.\u201dOn the facade, two recent visitors had spray-painted their names and written \u201cMemories of Wednesday, 3/11/2011.\u201dAfter a few hours at the site, tomb fatigue set in.\u201cThey all look the same after a while,\u201d my guide said.Then, as we approached another necropolis, I spotted a man in a burgundy cardigan, khakis and running shoes wielding a camera and scrambling excitedly from tomb to tomb. Another tourist!He introduced himself as Tag Elkhazin, a 76-year-old semiretired mechanical engineer and a Canadian of Sudanese descent. A professed archaeology buff, he had been dreaming of seeing Saudi Arabia\u2019s sites for years but had never been able to get in.That is, until he realized that as a Muslim he could get a visa for umrah, a pilgrimage with a flexible schedule, and use his extra time for tourism.\u201cI did my tribute to God and then decided to do my tribute to learning and knowledge,\u201d he said with a grin.He called the site \u201cmajestic\u201d but said he was frustrated that Saudi Arabia had shown little interest in its pre-Islamic heritage.\u201cThis is part of the history of the kingdom,\u201d he said. \u201cSaudi history did not start with Islam, with all due respect.\u201dI visited a few more tombs, but soon felt I had seen enough and decided to see what I could learn at the complex of small museums near the entrance.Not much, apparently. The visitors\u2019 center, the multimedia building, the Hejaz Railway Museum, the Syrian Pilgrim Road Museum and the Islamic fortress were all closed, even though, according to the hours posted by their doors, they should have been open.\u201cThey are supposed to be open, but no one came to work today,\u201d a guard said with a shrug.The tourism commission may have a hard time persuading Saudis to visit such sites instead of going to the United Arab Emirates or Bahrain, neighboring countries with more relaxed social codes and attractions lacking in the kingdom, like movie theaters and bars.And my Saudi friends were more interested in picnics in the desert, where young men like to cruise the dunes in their S.U.V.s.The tourism commission supports more than two dozen similar festivals across the kingdom, but they are hard to find out about if you don\u2019t speak Arabic. Your best bet is to ask the locals, who will tell you what is happening nearby and maybe take you for a visit. Which is what happened to me.We reached the fairgrounds midafternoon, and there were already hundreds of people there: men in long white robes, women in black gowns with only their eyes showing through face veils, and children wearing whatever they wanted.The festival was a series of exhibits celebrating the area\u2019s history. There were traditional markets where men made ropes from plant fibers and women sold embroidered clothing and wove rugs on traditional looms.\u201cThis is what they fight with in Palestine,\u201d one woman said, trying to sell me a woven sling.Young Saudis are social media crazy, and the kingdom has some of the world\u2019s highest usage rates of Twitter and YouTube. At one point, I stopped to snap a photo of some women baking honey-filled cookies in a big black oven and turned to see three Saudi girls aiming their camera phones at me and snapping away.\u201cHey!\u201d I said, and they giggled and scurried off, typing captions with their thumbs before sending my image into cyberspace. I decided to respond in kind and kept my phone at the ready to take pictures of anyone I caught taking pictures of me. I caught quite a few.There were tents set aside for prayer, bonfires where we stopped for coffee and tea, and a kids\u2019 area with games and music (voice only; no instruments). We even saw an itinerant clown, who sat in the back of a truck and made up a song about me for a small tip.We visited an exhibit on traditional medicine showing bone setters, local diseases that had largely been eradicated and a mannequin giving birth standing up with a midwife on the ground in front of her.Elsewhere, a family wearing traditional garb acted out scenes in front of an adobe house. A woman shook milk in a suspended metal container to churn butter, and a group of men chanted while digging a well. Nearby, a gas-powered water pump chugged away, one of the first machines to reach the area powered by the same oil that had distanced most Saudis from the very life the festival sought to recall.On a patch of sand, a teacher and a group of children with wooden pallets recreated a traditional Koranic school. As the sun set, they marched through the festival, chanting \u201cHafiz! Hafiz!\u201d to celebrate a student who had memorized the Quran.As they passed, a young boy ran up to me, smiled and asked, \u201cHow are you?\u201dBen Hubbard is a New York Times correspondent based in Beirut.Advertisement"}

Johnson, is declaring war on his employees\u2019 retirement savings while he takes home the highest compensation of any federal employee in the country ($6.4 million, according to your article).The T.V.A. is a publicly funded institution, doling out multimillion-dollar paychecks to its executives and putting hardworking people\u2019s pensions at risk. The T.V.A. should be focused on providing efficient public services while taking care of all of its employees.Perhaps most upsetting is the fact that while pension benefits to rank-and-file members will be slashed under Mr. Johnson\u2019s proposal, the Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan that allows him to rake in thousands of extra dollars per year won\u2019t be touched.A strong public pension system offers greater security for workers by pooling assets and risks between the employer and the employee. This ensures that workers will receive their promised benefits.

{"Headline": "Ireland Waits to See if 2 Parties Can Reach Pact After Indecisive Vote", "Date": "2016-03-09", "News": "Supported byDUBLIN \u2014 Nearly two weeks after an inconclusive general election, Ireland\u2019s chances of forming a stable coalition government revolve around a single question: Can the two center-right parties that have long dominated Irish politics put aside nearly a century of enmity and find a way to run the country together?The current prime minister, Enda Kenny, is still expected to be nominally in charge of the country when he visits the White House next week for the annual St. Patrick\u2019s Day shamrock presentation. But his center-right Fine Gael party\u2019s big losses and the decimation of his junior coalition partner, the center-left Labour Party, have left him with few options for forming a new government.After years of cutbacks that turned Ireland into the poster child for austerity in Europe, a furious electorate chose to overlook substantial job creation and economic growth, preferring instead to vent its anger at the Fine Gael-led government over the issues like record homelessness and long waits for hospital treatments.Fine Gael remains the biggest party after the Feb. 26 general election, with 50 seats in the 158-seat assembly, despite having lost 27 seats. Its center-right rival, Fianna Fail, has 44 seats; left-leaning Sinn Fein has 23; and Labour has seven. The remaining seats are filled by a rainbow of smaller parties and independent candidates of every political hue.Either Fine Gael or Fianna Fail has usually led the country, typically by relying not on the other but on a minority coalition partner or independents to give it a majority in Parliament.This time out it is different: For the first time, neither of the big two has the numbers to form a government without the support of the other. But despite their ideological similarities, they have been split over differences evolving from the Irish Civil War and the signing of the Anglo-Irish Treaty in 1921.Fine Gael prides itself on fiscal responsibility, contrasting this with what it described as Fianna Fail\u2019s free-spending policies that contributed to the last economic crash. In turn, in the prelude to an election that hinged to a large degree on a debate over budgetary austerity, Fianna Fail described Fine Gael\u2019s claim to have righted the economy as \u201cself-congratulatory bluster.\u201dSince the election, the main two parties have been busy seeking support from the smaller parties and independent candidates but have studiously avoided public acknowledgment of contact with each other. Few political analysts believe an alliance between the pair would be a recipe for stable government.\u201cIt would be like Republicans and Democrats going into government together \u2014 to us in Ireland there doesn\u2019t seem to be much difference between one American president and another, but we know that\u2019s not the case,\u201d said Johnny Fallon, a political analyst based in Dublin. \u201cThey simply don\u2019t trust each other, and trust is the basis of any government.\u201dMr. Fallon said he believed the pair would most likely be forced together in the short-term. But he predicted that the eventual outcome would be another election as the two parties jockey to undermine each other for longer-term advantage.Although it would constitute an enormous gamble for either party, an immediate election remains an option. During the campaign, both parties ruled out any form of coalition and are now warning they will not go into power at any cost.Charlie Flanagan, a member of Fine Gael and minister for foreign affairs, said in a statement on Friday that the country was still grappling with the aftermath of the economic crash, but he failed to answer the question directly as to whether Fine Gael would be open to forging a new beginning with Fianna Fail.\u201cWe will work in a progressive manner toward the formation of a new government, but not at any cost,\u201d Mr. Flanagan said. \u201cIt is critical that any government formed is a lasting one. Stability is key at this point in the country\u2019s recovery. Forming an unstable government is not in the people\u2019s interest.\u201dThe skirmishing will begin in earnest when the new Parliament convenes on Thursday, but few expect much progress as an extended vacation period is on the horizon and Ireland is already becoming consumed with a series of public events to commemorate the centenary of the 1916 Easter Rising, a seminal event in the state\u2019s eventual independence from Britain.Sinn Fein, the party founded as the political wing of the Irish Republican Army, has repeatedly ruled itself out as a minority partner in government, citing ideological incompatibility with either of the larger parties. Analysts say Fianna Fail in particular is wary that Sinn Fein could make further gains in the next election and become a potential governing party.Sinn Fein\u2019s leader, Gerry Adams, who had tried to rebrand his party as an anti-austerity voice of the left, appears keen to keep up the pressure on the larger parties and their inability to begin addressing the country\u2019s problems.\u201cThe health and housing crises cannot be put on hold,\u201d Mr. Adams said last week. \u201cThere are still people on hospital trolleys, some 425 across the state yesterday. There are still children being brought up in hotels, and this morning men and women woke up in the snow on the streets.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Playing Pass the Parcel With Fukushima", "Date": "2016-03-07", "News": "Supported byOp-Ed ContributorOXFORD, England \u2014 In the five years since the earthquake, tsunami and nuclear meltdowns that devastated Fukushima Prefecture, the Japanese government has undertaken mammoth efforts to decontaminate irradiated communities.Thousands of workers have removed millions of tons of radioactive debris from backyards and fields, roadsides and school grounds. They have scraped away acres and acres of tainted soil, collected surface vegetal matter, wiped down entire buildings and hosed and scrubbed streets and sidewalks.The cleanup effort is staggering in scale, and unprecedented. Japan\u2019s leaders hope to restore for human habitation more than 100 cities, towns and villages scattered over hundreds of square miles. The government has allocated more than $15 billion for this work.The Japanese authorities call these efforts josen (decontamination), but the word is misleading and the activity largely a fallacy. What\u2019s happening is more like transcontamination: Once the radioactive debris is collected and bagged, it is transferred from one part of Fukushima to another, and then another.The waste is placed in bags, which are periodically collected and brought to provisional storage areas (kari-kari-okiba), before being moved to more secure, though still temporary, storage depots (kari-okiba). Officials at the Ministry of the Environment have said up to 30 million tons of radioactive waste will eventually be moved to yet another, third-level interim storage facility near the crippled Fukushima Daiichi plant. But no significant construction has begun. In fact, the authorities haven\u2019t even managed to convince all the relevant absentee landowners in the area to sell the necessary plots.So for now the radioactive waste is either lying around or being moved around. Throughout Fukushima, there are large cylindrical plastic sacks \u2014 each roughly the size of a hot tub and weighing about a ton when full \u2014 stacked in desultory heaps by the side of roads, near driveways or in abandoned lots. In the town of Tomioka in mid-October, I saw three dozen bags piled along the edges of a small cemetery, overtaken by weeds.12 PhotosThe bags deteriorate after three years, meaning that the waste has to be repackaged regularly. Sacks are sometimes moved from one facility to another, based on their levels of radioactivity, which vary and can shift over time. By last fall, there were more than 9 million one-ton bags of radioactive waste. Standard trucks carry fewer than 10 bags at a time \u2014 meaning that radioactive material is regularly rotating around Fukushima in a slow-motion version of pass the nuclear parcel.There is no practical, much less economical, way to completely neutralize radiation. It can only be removed and isolated to allow natural decay, which, in the case of much of the low-level waste at Fukushima, may take decades or a few centuries.That basically leaves two viable options for dealing with radioactivity. Either turn over contaminated areas to natural decay, as the Soviet authorities did with some 1,000 square miles irradiated by the 1986 Chernobyl disaster. Or securely store the waste.Japan is too densely populated to abandon such a vast swath of land as Fukushima. But it has yet to build any permanent or semipermanent storage facility for any kind of nuclear waste: No one wants radioactive material in their backyard, perhaps especially not the Japanese, after their experiences of the bombings at Hiroshima and Nagasaki, and then the Fukushima meltdowns.Partly as a result, Japanese policymakers have only come up with stop-gap solutions \u2014 when they have come up with any solution at all. Keeping radioactive waste in motion between provisional storage sites isn\u2019t a coherent nuclear policy; it\u2019s an elaborate dodge and a play for time.Japan\u2019s \u201cdecontamination\u201d plan for Fukushima is so fiendishly complicated that its goals cannot possibly be met within the promised 30 years. And that\u2019s only to talk about the waste that has been collected.The twisted, irradiated wreckage of Fukushima Daiichi itself will have to be dismantled and properly disposed of. Yet its final destination also remains unspecified. Given how much more toxic some of that waste is \u2014 it includes residual fuel \u2014 it would need to be put away in an even more secure facility than the interim kind Japan has not managed to build.These problems are emblematic of the broader failures of the Japan government\u2019s nuclear policy.The authorities still don\u2019t have a workable plan for disposing of the 47 metric tons of plutonium and the thousands of tons of uranium Japan has accumulated over years of producing energy at nuclear plants. Both are extremely radioactive and require storage in highly secure permanent facilities \u2014 such as underground granite chambers, as exist in Finland, or subterranean salt formations, as in the United States.Even if Japan were to decommission all of its 56 reactors, as some people are advocating, doing so would generate about 500,000 cubic meters of lower-level radioactive waste, and that also has nowhere to go.It\u2019s time the Japanese government tackles the issues head-on. Either it takes the exceedingly unpopular step of imposing a more secure facility on one or more unwilling communities, or it must acknowledge the obvious, which is that the core of Fukushima\u2019s exclusion zone will become a gigantic de facto nuclear waste dump indefinitely.As for higher-level waste, the government should fund its shipping and storing in permanent repositories abroad: Japan is too prone to earthquakes to host any such facility. The Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry is currently studying the feasibility of a plan to permanently store spent fuel under the seabed 10 to 15 kilometers from Japan\u2019s shores. In such a seismically unstable area, the very idea is preposterous.Admitting these hard truths might scuttle the Abe administration\u2019s plan to restart more of the nuclear reactors that were put offline after the Fukushima disaster. But the Japanese public deserves no less, especially given the costs and the stakes of the government\u2019s current policy.The defilement of Fukushima wasn\u2019t just the result of a natural catastrophe. It was also the aftermath of a manmade disaster caused by a slapdash approach to nuclear safety. Five years on, the Japanese government isn\u2019t handling these issues any more responsibly.Peter Wynn Kirby is a nuclear and environmental specialist at the University of Oxford and the author of \u201cTroubled Natures: Waste, Environment, Japan.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Unsettling Acquisitiveness of Anbang, a Chinese Insurer, in the U.S.", "Date": "2016-03-22", "News": "Supported byDeal ProfessorA buying spree by a Chinese insurance company that has emerged seemingly overnight is flashing a warning sign.An alliance led by the Chinese company, the Anbang Insurance Group, has for the moment been outbid for Starwood Hotels & Resorts, the owner of the Sheraton and Westin brands, by Marriott International. But that Anbang is even in the running \u2014 and may yet win out \u2014 is an indication of deal-making gone awry.Typically in a takeover battle, a strategic bidder should always triumph over a financial bidder like a private equity firm or Anbang, which has teamed up with two investment firms.The reason is simple. A strategic buyer is an operating company and almost always can pay more for a target. The strategic buyer can expect to earn more from the target through cost savings. There would be no need for two general counsels, for example.A strategic buyer should also be able to reap operating efficiencies or other benefits from putting two assets together \u2014 what deal makers call \u201csynergies.\u201d Think of the Walt Disney Company buying Marvel Entertainment to put the Marvel characters in Disney\u2019s movies and theme parks. This sort of strategic rationale is what is driving Marriott\u2019s bid.Anbang also announced deals for the Waldorf Astoria in October 2014 for $1.95 billion, 717 Fifth Avenue in February 2015 for an estimated $500 million and Strategic Hotels & Resorts for $6.5 billion from Blackstone only two weeks ago. Blackstone bought the company for $500 million less only three months ago. It\u2019s a nice deal for Blackstone, but one wonders why Anbang would pay so much more only a few months later.So what gives with all the hotel acquisitions?Anbang, which was founded in 2004, appears to be trying to build itself into a financial conglomerate along the lines of Warren E. Buffett\u2019s Berkshire Hathaway. Like Berkshire, Anbang is using insurance reserves to buy assets in a variety of businesses such as banking and real estate. It also spent over $2 billion on insurers in Belgium and South Korea in 2015.If this type of company existed in the United States, there would be an outcry. It may be reasonable for an Internet company to appear out of nowhere and be a giant after 10 years, but an insurance company? And one that is buying noncore assets abundantly? We\u2019ve seen this story many times before, and it typically doesn\u2019t end well.But a huge hunger for growth doesn\u2019t quite explain Anbang\u2019s attempt to buy more than $20 billion worth of hotel properties in the space of a year or so. There are the political connections, of course. Anbang\u2019s deal-maker chairman, Wu Xiaohui, is said to enjoy warm relations with the Beijing government. His wife is the granddaughter of Deng Xiaoping, the former leader of China.The company\u2019s explanation is that it is diversifying. It appears to view global real estate as a high-yielding asset that will allow the company to diversify its assets out of China at a time when China\u2019s economy is slowing. This is particularly important for a life insurer, since China\u2019s population is aging rapidly, so higher returns are a must.It is easy to compare the shopping spree by Anbang and other Chinese companies to the shopping by Japanese companies in the 1980s. Back then, the emerging giants of Japan sought out trophy properties in the United States, including Rockefeller Center. The Japanese mostly bought at the top and then suffered through the downturn in the early 1990s. Given the price of commercial real estate these days, as well as the price Anbang paid for the Waldorf Astoria \u2014 a record for a hotel in New York \u2014 one has to think that this might be the case again.But acquiring Starwood is even a step further afield. In the case of the Waldorf, Anbang entered into a 100-year contract with Hilton to manage the property.But who would manage Starwood? Anbang has partnered with the private equity firm J. C. Flowers & Company and the Primavera Capital Group. J. C. Flowers specializes in acquisitions in the financial services industry. Primavera is a Chinese private equity firm. Neither appears to have much hotel experience.Given the state of the hotel industry \u2014 with Airbnb shaking up the world \u2014 it is hard to see where Anbang would get the necessary experience. One supposes the life insurer could keep on the Starwood team, but Anbang has already had trouble managing its new non-Chinese subsidiaries.In the case of Anbang\u2019s Belgian acquisition, the management team left after a few months amid complaints of Anbang\u2019s management style.None of this justifies outbidding Marriott, which has more experience and can reap more savings from Starwood.Instead, this is probably just a grand currency play. Anbang is willing to overpay because it is converting Chinese currency. As the world knows, there are expectations that there will be a further devaluation of the Chinese currency, the renminbi. By moving its money out of China, Anbang can hedge against such a downturn.Anbang also buys further protection from interference by Beijing authorities. So even though there is a slow-motion flight of dollars leaving China that Beijing is trying to halt, Anbang is probably trying to get more dollars out. After all, if there is a devaluation, this will benefit everyone in China, at least.Should Anbang persevere and come out the winner in the bidding for Starwood, there will certainly be talk about national security and the review process by the Council on Foreign Investment in the United States. This will be akin to the review over Smithfields when it was bought by Shuanghui International Holdings. There will be some hand-wringing about a Chinese buyer, but ultimately there will be no issues except perhaps some forced sales of hotels near strategic areas, like Starwood\u2019s hotel near the White House.But national security is not the real issue.The important question is this: If a 10-year-old opaque American financial conglomerate with no hotel experience were to buy Starwood, funding the transaction in part with the sale of high-yield investment products to retail investors, wouldn\u2019t that give us pause?Not only that, wouldn\u2019t we wonder about the future of Starwood?One answer is that we wouldn\u2019t. Starwood should be sold to the highest bidder, no matter the circumstance. But lost in all of this are the employees and operation of Starwood, and whether Anbang can even capably run this company. Shareholders, meanwhile, including its two largest shareholders that are activist funds, would probably just take the money.Perhaps the more prudent answer, one our current financial system doesn\u2019t address, is that there is too much risk here. The acquisition raises all sorts of issues about takeovers and the responsibility to look out for the company itself.It seems to be a conversation worth having.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "$15-an-Hour Minimum Wage in California? Plan Has Some Worried", "Date": "2016-03-28", "News": "Supported byNews AnalysisCalifornia is on the verge of making itself a guinea pig in a bold economics experiment.By moving toward a plan to raise the statewide minimum wage to $15 an hour by 2022, the state could raise living standards for millions of workers. But it could also increase unemployment among some of the very same economically marginal workers the wage increase is intended to help.Many economists, even some on the left, worry that a potential loss of jobs in a number of cities where wages are comparatively low could largely offset, and perhaps even more than offset, the boon of higher incomes at the bottom of the wage scale.San Francisco and San Jose, both high-wage cities that have benefited from the tech boom, are likely to weather the increase without so much as a ripple. The negative consequences of the minimum wage increase in Los Angeles and San Diego \u2014 large cities where wages are lower \u2014 are likely to be more pronounced, though they could remain modest on balance.But in lower-wage, inland cities like Bakersfield and Fresno, the effects could play out in much less predictable ways. That\u2019s because the rise of the minimum wage to $15 over the next six years would push the wage floor much closer to the expected pay for a worker in the middle of the wage scale, affecting a much higher proportion of employees and employers there than in high-wage cities.\u201cThis is a big experiment,\u201d said Arindrajit Dube, an economics professor at the University of Massachusetts at Amherst whose work has shown that modest minimum wage increases typically have limited effects on employment. \u201cIn areas like Fresno, a majority of workers are likely to be directly or indirectly affected.\u201dGov. Jerry Brown, announcing details of the proposed legislation at a news conference on Monday, acknowledged the potential hardships of giving California the highest minimum wage of any state in the country.\u201cIf you took the wages down and cut them in half, it would make it easier for certain businesses,\u201d he said. \u201cBut you can\u2019t function that way, because we\u2019re a community.\u201dMr. Brown, who worked out the deal with top legislators and labor leaders, said the risks were worth it. \u201cIt\u2019s a matter of economic justice,\u201d he said, \u201cand it makes sense.\u201dThe legislation would delay by one year the schedule of wage increases for businesses with 25 workers or fewer, and would allow the governor to pause an increase for one year if the economy weakened or the state\u2019s budget deteriorated.Craig Scharton, the owner of a farm-to-table restaurant called Peeve\u2019s Public House in downtown Fresno, said he was still smarting from a recent increase in the minimum wage from $9 to $10 an hour. He said the increase had forced him to close on Mondays and Tuesdays and played a role in reducing his staffing to a dozen today from 18 two and a half years ago.Mr. Scharton was at a loss to explain how he would absorb the new increase. \u201cWe\u2019re trying our best to revitalize downtown,\u201d he said. \u201cThis just kind of kicks our legs out from under us.\u201dThe Fresno example illustrates the challenge of raising the minimum wage to the same level across cities that, in economic terms, have little in common beyond the same state government. Cities with high real estate prices are typically better able to withstand minimum wage increases than cities with low prices, because wages represent a smaller fraction of a business\u2019s overall cost in those cities and therefore have a smaller effect on the bottom line.But in Fresno, real estate is cheap and wages are by far the biggest cost for the typical service sector business. Mr. Scharton estimates that labor is about 40 percent of his costs, versus about 6 percent for real estate.Likewise, businesses in cities with large tourist industries often find it easier to pass along higher costs to customers, as tourists tend to be less price-sensitive than locals. But Fresno, unlike Los Angeles or San Francisco, is not a tourist hub.\u201cI don\u2019t think we have anything over $14 for an entree,\u201d he said. \u201cWe can\u2019t do $32 an entree like some high-end fancy New York restaurant.\u201dThe adverse effects from a sharp increase in the minimum wage may not be as severe as some opponents fear, however. Michael Reich, an economics professor at the University of California, Berkeley \u2014 whose work policy makers in Los Angeles and New York State have relied on to analyze their recent efforts to raise the minimum wage \u2014 said that, in his models, the overall economic effect of a $15 minimum wage was roughly neutral, even when it amounted to 60 percent of the median wage.The reason, he said, is that the negative economic consequences of a higher wage \u2014 namely, lower employment, partly because of greater automation, and declining sales because of price increases \u2014 were offset by greater purchasing power on the part of workers, which would lift economic activity in an area.As for low-cost cities where the impact could be even larger, Mr. Reich said low-wage workers in places like Fresno were not so differently paid from low-wage workers in higher-cost cities \u2014 despite the fact that typical wages in those cities are far apart.\u201cEven if the average wage differential between Fresno and the rest of the state is about 25 percent,\u201d Mr. Reich said, \u201cjust within retail and restaurants you find that the wage differential is more like 5 percent.\u201dMoreover, the benefits of the higher wage may be more than purely economic.Dave Regan is president of SEIU-United Healthcare Workers West, which represents more than 85,000 hospital workers in California and deployed more than 2,500 members to collect hundreds of thousands of signatures to qualify a minimum wage ballot initiative. He said that even if there were potential economic downsides, the effect of empowering workers to influence their own fates could be transformative politically.\u201cThere\u2019s so much cynicism, anger,\u201d Mr. Regan said. \u201cTo have the governor and legislature responding in a positive and constructive way to our members is really important. It shows, \u2018Wow, what we do really does matter.\u2019\u201dCities in other states, like Seattle and Chicago, recently enacted significant wage increases, and Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo of New York is pressing a plan to increase the minimum wage to $15 in New York City by 2019 and statewide by 2021.Skeptics argue that the California policy is reckless, given that there were already a variety of localized experiments underway that would have given insight into the effects of a substantial minimum wage increase before thrusting the country\u2019s most populous state into unknown territory.\u201cWe just passed minimum wage laws in some cities: San Francisco is a high-wage one, Los Angeles is not such a high-wage one,\u201d said David Neumark, an economics professor at the University of California, Irvine, who has done work suggesting that even relatively moderate minimum wage increases can lead to a more than trivial rise in unemployment. \u201cGiven that there\u2019s some risk of adverse effects, possibly bad effects, let\u2019s do a little study and see what happens.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Now, he and many others feel, it has become something much narrower: a haven for the wealthy.Sentiment is difficult to gauge on a citywide scale. The demonstrations against the shuttles got widespread attention, but quickly petered out. Mr. Tynan-Connolly noted that the long history of activism in San Francisco was driven by young people, and now the young people often work for the tech companies.Some tech folks think things are out of kilter.\u201cThere are valid concerns that San Francisco is becoming a plutocracy,\u201d said Donna Burke, an entrepreneur and investor. \u201cSilicon Valley traditionally valued changing the world over money. We need to get back to that ethos.\u201dNone of the San Franciscans interviewed for this article said they wished any harm to tech workers, but they lamented what they saw as a high degree of cluelessness.Many young dreamers have flocked to the area with the hope of starting a successful start-up or striking it rich by joining the right company at the right time. This is what they look like.\u201cI have a lot of friends who work in those companies, and they literally encourage me every week to quit my job and do what they\u2019re doing,\u201d said Helana Corda, who teaches sixth graders at a public middle school, is a part-time bartender and works at a program for disadvantaged children. \u201cThey think they\u2019re trying to help, but I feel slightly offended.\u201dTech people regularly issue electronic broadsides that irk San Franciscans. The latest came in late February from a start-up founder, Justin Keller, who complained about the homeless and \u201criffraff.\u201dEven those who have benefited from the tech workers and their free-spending ways say something is amiss.Good times do not mean things automatically get better for institutions that were here first. \u201cWe feel the competition,\u201d Mr. Stoll said. \u201cWe didn\u2019t really feel it in the past. There are a lot more restaurants now.\u201dThe issue of the shuttles, the first flash point between San Franciscans and the tech community, was never resolved. The city started charging the companies a small fee. Politicians and the companies are trying to work out a permanent fix, possibly involving the use of hubs to pick up passengers.For Jilanne Hoffmann, like many Synergy parents, every morning flirts with disaster: It seems only a matter of time before a child is hit. A petition has been submitted to the city in an effort to get the stop moved.\u201cIt scares me to want to damage the economy of the Bay Area in any way \u2014 you\u2019ve got to be careful what you wish for, right?\u201d But I think we need a moratorium on the things that benefit the few,\u201d Ms. Hoffmann said. \u201cIf only there were some way to prevent the haves from having it all.\u201dAdvertisement"}

For entrepreneurs, online marketplaces like TaskRabbit, Thumbtack or Etsy have become another avenue to generate leads for their own businesses. Then, there\u2019s the chance for everyone to become a hotelier.\u201cWhile more Americans are turning to this kind of gig economy, they do face new and more complicated tax requirements,\u201d said Kathy Pickering, executive director of the Tax Institute at H&R Block.Where to begin? Here are several requirements the self-employed need to think about, particularly during tax season:People running multiple businesses \u2014 say, selling photo prints on Etsy while driving for Uber \u2014 would need to keep track of all income and expenses separately, using dedicated Schedule C\u2019s for each. There may be state and local tax forms as well.\u201cOne of the most common errors that gets made is people forget or miss reporting all of their income,\u201d Ms. Pickering said. Independent contractors, she said, should track all income on their own, since some may be reported via 1099s and other portions may not. Many on-demand companies send annual earnings reports, too.\u201cIf you are doing things like Uber or a rides program, you can take your gas, your carwash, your vehicle licenses,\u201d Ms. Pickering said. \u201cThat may not be obvious for someone getting into this for the first time.\u201dIndividuals who use their vehicles more than half the time for business may be eligible to deduct up to $25,000 of the cost, as long the vehicle meets certain specifications. \u201cThat is a great one for Uber and Lyft drivers, but it also goes for anyone with their own business,\u201d said Lisa Greene-Lewis, a certified public accountant at TurboTax.There\u2019s quite a bit that can be deducted, items as varied as advertising and cleaning bills, property insurance, repairs and fees paid to agencies like Airbnb.How much you can claim depends on how many days your home was rented, versus the time it was used personally. If, say, a beach cottage was available for rent all year, even thought it wasn\u2019t rented the entire time, all allowable expenses are deductible. But if it was rented for 85 days and you used it for 15 days, you can typically deduct 85 percent of expenses, according to EY, which wrote a guide on rental property income for Airbnb.If you\u2019re renting one room in an apartment, one of two methods can be used to calculate how to divide up the expenses: Base the percentage either on the number of rooms in your home or on square footage.Mrs. Scherer, however, uses an old-fashioned spreadsheet, which helps her categorize expenses. It\u2019s all easy to track, since she uses a dedicated credit card and checking account.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Janet Yellen Says Fed Still Plans to Raise Interest Rates but Carefully", "Date": "2016-03-29", "News": "Supported byJanet L. Yellen, the Federal Reserve chairwoman, said on Tuesday that the United States economy remained on track despite a rough start to the year because the drag from weak growth in other countries was being offset by lower borrowing costs.The cautious tone of her remarks, however, suggested no rate increase was likely at the Fed\u2019s next meeting, in April, shifting the eyes of Fed watchers to its subsequent meeting in June.\u201cI consider it appropriate for the committee to proceed cautiously in adjusting policy,\u201d Ms. Yellen said.Stocks jumped and bond yields fell in the moments after the publication of Ms. Yellen\u2019s remarks, part of a now-familiar pattern in which markets celebrate signs of economic softness and Fed restraint because that means interest rates will stay lower for longer.\u201cThe Fed chair is clearly in no hurry to undertake the next rate hike, in spite of the generally firmer tone of U.S. domestic data in recent weeks,\u201d Krishna Guha, head of the global policy and central bank strategy team at Evercore ISI, wrote in a note to clients. He said the remarks underscored that Ms. Yellen would rather move too slowly to raise interest rates and rein in the economy than too quickly.The Fed, which raised its benchmark rate in December for the first time since the financial crisis, continues to debate the timing of a second increase.That was half as much as the Fed had predicted at the beginning of the year.Ms. Yellen attributed the deceleration on Tuesday to a judgment by Fed officials that somewhat lower rates were necessary to maintain steady growth.\u201cThe committee in March did rethink to some extent the policy path that is appropriate to achieve an essentially unchanged outlook,\u201d Ms. Yellen said.She described a dynamic in which slower growth in other nations, which tends to drag on domestic growth, had been offset by a loosening of financial conditions.That is the way monetary policy is supposed to work \u2014 markets anticipated the Fed\u2019s reaction to a weaker economic outlook, providing a jolt of stimulus before the Fed even had a chance to speak. The Fed then confirmed the market\u2019s expectations by announcing after its March policy meeting that it expected to raise its benchmark interest rate more slowly.Ms. Yellen said the reaction showed that markets have internalized the Fed\u2019s mantra that its management of interest rates is \u201cdata dependent,\u201d meaning the Fed\u2019s predictions about the likely path of interest rates are contingent on the economy\u2019s actual performance.\u201cThis mechanism serves as an important \u2018automatic stabilizer\u2019 for the economy,\u201d she said.While the Fed\u2019s assessment of the economy\u2019s anticipated performance remains unchanged, Ms. Yellen said officials now saw more risks to that outlook.Alongside the direct effects of slower global growth, she said she remained concerned about sluggish inflation and about the deterioration of inflation expectations.The Fed\u2019s preferred measure of inflation rose by 1.7 percent through the 12 months that ended in January, a stronger pace than it managed the previous year. But Ms. Yellen said it was \u201ctoo early to tell if this recent faster pace will prove durable.\u201dIndeed, Fed officials predicted in March that inflation would subside somewhat in the coming months, attributing the higher readings in the latest inflation survey to unusual jumps in the price of some kinds of goods, most notably clothing.The Fed regards the stability of inflation expectations as a mainstay of effective monetary policy. It wants inflation to be 2 percent a year and it wants people to believe inflation will be 2 percent a year, because expectations help to determine actual inflation.Market-based measures of inflation expectations, however, are running well below 2 percent, while some survey-based measures also have drifted lower.Ms. Yellen acknowledged these trends, a change from last year when Fed officials were largely dismissive. But she said the significance was \u201cfar from conclusive.\u201dFed officials continue to regard the decline in market-based measures as a result of pressures unrelated to expectations about inflation. And Ms. Yellen said that survey-based measures historically had fallen hand-in-hand with oil prices.\u201cTaken together, these results suggest that my baseline assumption of stable expectations is still justified,\u201d she said.\u201cNevertheless, the decline in some indicators has heightened the risk that this judgment could be wrong,\u201d she added. \u201cIf so, the return to 2 percent inflation could take longer than expected and might require a more accommodative stance of monetary policy.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Lew Defends Sanctions, but Cautions on Overuse", "Date": "2016-03-29", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 With an eye to President Obama\u2019s legacy and his own, Treasury Secretary Jacob J. Lew on Wednesday will hail the success of economic sanctions against Iran and other global offenders, but warn that their overuse could threaten the primacy of the United States and the dollar in the world economy.In his prepared remarks and in an interview, Mr. Lew also answered criticism from Congress and the Republican presidential candidates who oppose the Iran deal and the lifting of international sanctions that was part of it. He warned that if the United States had failed to respond as the agreement called for after Iran dismantled its weapons infrastructure, it would have lost credibility in threatening sanctions in the future against other bad actors to change their behavior.\u201cIf you were sitting in Tehran now, it wouldn\u2019t necessarily feel like you\u2019d gotten very much relief,\u201d Mr. Lew said in the interview this week. \u201cWe have to be very attentive to keeping our part of the bargain if we want others to do the things that we\u2019re trying to use sanctions to create the pressure for them to do.\u201dBoth in his speech at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace and in the interview, Mr. Lew acknowledged the difficulty of relieving Iranians of nuclear-related sanctions given their other offenses \u2014 support for terrorism and human rights violations \u2014 that have provoked separate sanctions by both the United States and its allies.The nuclear sanctions were included in four United Nations resolutions during the George W. Bush and Obama administrations, and supplemented by separate American financial sanctions.\u201cEconomic sanctions have become a powerful force in service of clear and coordinated foreign policy objectives \u2014 smart power for situations where diplomacy alone is insufficient, but military force is not the right response,\u201d Mr. Lew says in his prepared remarks.But their effectiveness has spurred demands for more sanctions, including from Congress, outside groups and other nations, and he warned, according to the speech text, \u201cWe must be conscious of the risk that overuse of sanctions could undermine our leadership position within the global economy, and the effectiveness of the sanctions themselves.\u201cIf they make the business environment too complicated or unpredictable, or if they excessively interfere with the flow of funds worldwide, financial transactions may begin to move outside of the United States entirely, which could threaten the central role of the U.S. financial system globally, not to mention the effectiveness of our sanctions in the future.\u201dWhile Mr. Lew does not refer specifically to China, its rise has spawned speculation that it could someday displace the United States as the pre-eminent financial power, and its renminbi could replace the dollar as the world\u2019s reserve currency, though few see that as likely anytime soon.Mr. Lew said the most important lesson to be drawn from the past use of sanctions was the desirability of acting in concert with allies: \u201cThe more international support there is for sanctions and their underlying objective, the more effective they will be.\u201dAs examples, he cited the sanctions on Iran and those imposed on Russia because of its intervention in Ukraine, as well as a recent international agreement on expanded sanctions against North Korea that includes China, its longtime ally.Sanctions, he added, should be viewed not as \u201cpunishment for past actions\u201d but as pressure to change future actions, by holding out the promise of sanctions relief. And, Mr. Lew said, the United States must continue to invest money in a sanctions infrastructure \u2014 investigators, analysts, monitors and lawyers \u2014 together with businesses, banks and foreign governments and institutions.Ahead of Mr. Lew\u2019s speech, experts from recent administrations echoed his message on the danger of overreliance on sanctions, as effective as they can be.\u201cHe\u2019s reacting to some real pressures,\u201d said Juan C. Zarate, a former counterterrorism adviser to President George W. Bush and the author of a 2013 book, \u201cTreasury\u2019s War,\u201d on financial weapons developed since Sept. 11, 2001.\u201cOne is the desire to continuously use these measures for each and every crisis in a maximalist way,\u201d by Congress, foreign governments and interest groups, Mr. Zarate said. \u201cBut he\u2019s also seen that there is pressure from the private sector\u201d for prudence.Nicholas Burns, a career diplomat who served in the Clinton and George W. Bush administrations and drafted the first sanctions against Iran under Mr. Bush, said sanctions \u201chave been used much more intensively in the last 10 to 15 years than they had been before. And I\u2019m a proponent because it does give you an option other than military.\u201dMr. Burns added: \u201cBut you do have to ask the question, Can they be overused? And you have to be careful when you exact sanctions that they actually work. Because if they don\u2019t work, then you\u2019re not credible.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Plan in Case Robots Take the Jobs: Give Everyone a Paycheck", "Date": "2016-03-02", "News": "Supported byState of the ArtBut for the sake of argument, imagine that within two or three decades we\u2019ll have morphed into the Robotic States of America.How will society function after humanity has been made redundant? Technologists and economists have been grappling with this fear for decades, but in the last few years, one idea has gained widespread interest \u2014 including from some of the very technologists who are now building the bot-ruled future.Their plan is known as \u201cuniversal basic income,\u201d or U.B.I., and it goes like this: As the jobs dry up because of the spread of artificial intelligence, why not just give everyone a paycheck?Imagine the government sending each adult about $1,000 a month, about enough to cover housing, food, health care and other basic needs for many Americans. U.B.I. would be aimed at easing the dislocation caused by technological progress, but it would also be bigger than that.Rather than a job-killing catastrophe, tech supporters of U.B.I. consider machine intelligence to be something like a natural bounty for society: The country has struck oil, and now it can hand out checks to each of its citizens.These supporters argue machine intelligence will produce so much economic surplus that we could collectively afford to liberate much of humanity from both labor and suffering.\u201cWe\u2019re talking about divorcing your basic needs from the need to work,\u201d said Albert Wenger, a venture capitalist at Union Square Ventures, a proponent who is working on a book about U.B.I. \u201cFor a couple hundred years, we\u2019ve constructed our entire world around the need to work. Now we\u2019re talking about more than just a tweak to the economy \u2014 it\u2019s as foundational a departure as when we went from an agrarian society to an industrial one.\u201dMr. Altman said these questions range from the most practical \u2014 how much U.B.I. would cost the country, and whether we could afford it \u2014 to deeper issues concerning people\u2019s motivation and purpose in what you might call a \u201cpostwork\u201d age.When you give everyone free money, what do people do with their time? Do they goof off, or do they try to pursue more meaningful pursuits? Do they become more entrepreneurial? How would U.B.I. affect economic inequality? How would it alter people\u2019s psychology and mood? Do we, as a species, need to be employed to feel fulfilled, or is that merely a legacy of postindustrial capitalism?There is an urgency to the techies\u2019 interest in U.B.I. They argue that machine intelligence reached an inflection point in the last couple of years, and that technological progress now looks destined to change how most of the world works.\u201cPeople have been predicting that jobs would go away for a long time, and usually what happens is they just change,\u201d Mr. Altman said. But even so, \u201cduring those periods of change, things can be quite disruptive,\u201d and at the very least, U.B.I. may be able to smooth out the transition period.\u201cAll of a sudden people are looking at these trends and realizing these questions about the future of work are more real and immediate than they guessed,\u201d said Roy Bahat, the head of Bloomberg Beta, the venture capital firm funded by Bloomberg L.P.A cynic might see the interest of venture capitalists in U.B.I. as a way for them to atone for their complicity in the tech that might lead to permanent changes in the global economy. After all, here are rich people who both actively fund and benefit from creating highly profitable companies that employ very few people.But my conversations with techies interested in U.B.I. revealed a sincerity and sophistication about the idea. They aren\u2019t ashamed or afraid of automation, and they don\u2019t see U.B.I. merely as a defense of the current social order. Instead they see automation and U.B.I. as the most optimistic path toward wider social progress.\u201cI think it\u2019s a bad use of a human to spend 20 years of their life driving a truck back and forth across the United States,\u201d Mr. Wenger said. \u201cThat\u2019s not what we aspire to do as humans \u2014 it\u2019s a bad use of a human brain \u2014 and automation and basic income is a development that will free us to do lots of incredible things that are more aligned with what it means to be human.\u201dProponents say these questions will be answered by research, which in turn will prompt political change. For now, they argue the proposal is affordable if we alter tax and welfare policies to pay for it, and if we account for the ways technological progress in health care and energy will reduce the amount necessary to provide a basic cost of living.They also note that increasing economic urgency will push widespread political acceptance of the idea. \u201cThere\u2019s a sense that growing inequality is intractable, and that we need to do something about it,\u201d said Natalie Foster, the co-founder of Peers, an organization that supports sharing-economy workers.Andrew L. Stern, a former president of the Service Employees International Union, who is working on a book about U.B.I., compared the feeling of the current anxiety around jobs to a time of war. \u201cI grew up during the Vietnam War, and my parents were antiwar for one reason: I could be drafted,\u201d he said.Today, as people across all income levels become increasingly worried about how they and their children will survive in tech-infatuated America, \u201cwe are back to the Vietnam War when it comes to jobs,\u201d Mr. Stern said. \u201cWe\u2019re entering a universal, white-collar, middle-class anxiety, which drives political change faster than poor people tend to drive change.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Last year, the People\u2019s Liberation Army\u2019s official budget grew 10 percent to about $136 billion, and in 2014 it grew 12.2 percent. From 2005 to 2014, China\u2019s official military budget grew an average of 9.5 percent annually, after adjusting for inflation, according to a Pentagon estimate.\u201cThe whole economy is slowing, the pace of G.D.P. growth is slower than before, and military spending, the defense budget, should be in step with the pace of G.D.P.,\u201d said Xu Guangyu, a retired People\u2019s Liberation Army major general who is now a senior counselor with the state-run China Arms Control and Disarmament Association.Dennis J. Blasko, a retired United States Army lieutenant colonel and the author of \u201cThe Chinese Army Today,\u201d said that China\u2019s annual military expenditure was generally kept in line with gross domestic product plus inflation and that a single-digit increase for 2016 was in keeping with that formula.\u201cThis is consistent with the way the economy has been going, and that\u2019s the way the military budget has been determined for the last 20 years,\u201d Mr. Blasko said. \u201cThe whole point is not to overburden the economy with military expenditures.\u201dChina has been feverishly piling sand onto reefs in the South China Sea, creating seven new islets in the region and straining already taut geopolitical tensions.He said Chinese leaders were also aware that throwing large amounts of money at the military, as the Soviet Union did, is not the way to modernize it. \u201cThey look at the example of the Soviet Union, which flushed billions down the drain on the military, and that was the reason for its collapse,\u201d Mr. Blasko said.Mr. Xu, the retired general, said that the lower defense outlays for this year also probably reflected a temporary slowdown in the tempo of equipment modernization and that the pace would pick up again in the coming years.\u201cThere\u2019s a certain cycle in developing and producing weapons and equipment,\u201d Mr. Xu said. \u201cIt fluctuates. It isn\u2019t in a straight line.\u201d\u201cAmerican actions and statements now leave people feeling that it\u2019s provoking tense emotions, and it makes people put a big question mark over American motives,\u201d Ms. Fu said.Jin Canrong, a professor of international relations at Renmin University in Beijing, said the relatively modest increase in military spending was partly a gesture to mollify China\u2019s neighbors about its intentions in the South China Sea \u2014 specifically, the 10 members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations. \u201cThey are the pillars of China\u2019s diplomacy in the region,\u201d Mr. Jin said.But Mr. Jin said the slowdown in military spending was also prompted by domestic concerns. He said Beijing was living up to a promise to spend more on social welfare programs to support the poor during China\u2019s economic slowdown. \u201cNow is not the correct time to dramatically increase the military budget,\u201d he said.Mr. Jin said it was \u201cvery possible\u201d that the People\u2019s Liberation Army would be disappointed in the single-digit spending increase, but he noted that the military would continue to see benefits from significant expenditures announced in recent years. \u201cIn the coming two or three years China will get a lot of new equipment,\u201d he said. \u201cThe impact of this slowdown will be five years ahead.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Watch Brands Looking for New in Era of 'Smart'", "Date": "2016-03-17", "News": "Supported byWhether or not the Swiss watch industry is in the midst of a crisis depends on whom you ask.The pessimists point to Swiss watch exports, which fell 3.3 percent in 2015 to $22.1 billion, the industry\u2019s first full-year decline since 2009. Many believe that 2016 will not be any better: Total exports in January dropped 7.9 percent from the previous year, while exports to Hong Kong and the United States, the Swiss watch industry\u2019s leading markets, plummeted 33.1 percent and 13.7 percent, respectively.As the trade gathers in Switzerland this week for the Baselworld watch fair, the industry has been further rattled by reports of as many as 350 job cuts coming at Compagnie Financi\u00e8re Richemont \u2014 the Geneva-based luxury group that owns eight prestige watchmakers, including Cartier, IWC and Panerai. While the company refuses to say which of its brands will be affected, most, if not all, of the cuts are reported to be coming in Geneva, where the bulk of its watch brands are based.The optimists, however, believe that growth is within reach for watchmakers who are willing to embrace new ideas, even those the industry tends to reject out of hand: smartwatches, for example.\u201cIt\u2019s all about continuing to drive newness,\u201d said Efraim Grinberg, chief executive of the Movado Group, which unveiled a new collection last year, Movado Edge, designed by the San Francisco-based industrial designer Yves B\u00e9har, and introduced its first two smartwatches, Movado Motion and Movado Bold Motion.\u201cI think Apple has brought interest to the category,\u201d he said.For proof, just look to the numbers. \u201cLast year was very challenging,\u201d said Fred Levin, president of NPD Luxury Practice, a company that tracks high-end watch sales in the United States. Timepiece sales in 2015 did drop by 2 percent, compared with 2014. \u201cBut if you include estimates for the Apple Watch \u2014 the number sold is somewhere between three million and six million in the States \u2014 even at that low number, our industry didn\u2019t decline. It actually increased by over 30 percent.\u201dMultiple related challenges A commitment to connected watches notwithstanding, everyone agrees on one thing: The Swiss watch business is facing a constellation of issues, none of which would be overwhelming on its own but which in combination have created the most difficult environment for luxury watch sales since the global financial crisis of 2007-9.\u201cThe big difference between now and then was that the 2009 crisis was quite limited to more or less one problem, even though the whole world was concerned,\u201d said Karl-Friedrich Scheufele, co-president of the Chopard Group.From the soaring Swiss franc \u2014 which has troubled the industry since January 2015, when the Swiss National Bank abruptly removed the artificial cap that kept the franc pegged to the euro for three years \u2014 to falling oil prices, which have crippled the Russian economy and taken the steam out of the Middle East market, many issues are \u201csomewhat interconnected,\u201d Mr. Scheufele said.The outlook for 2016 seems especially bad when compared with the double-digit growth of years past, before China\u2019s economy softened and its government instituted strict anticorruption measures that curtailed high-end watch buying.\u201cOver time, we have become a little bit greedy, because \u2014 having growth of 15 to 17 percent every year for three, four, five years \u2014 it becomes a habit,\u201d said Daniel Riedo, chief executive of the Swiss watchmaker Jaeger-LeCoultre. \u201cSo I prefer to say we\u2019re not coming back to a crisis but to a new normal.\u201dValue Is a New Battle CryDisconcerting to many people in the industry is the inventory glut that now passes for normal among retailers around the world, and especially in the United States, where scores of Swiss watches are finding their way into the hands of unauthorized dealers. As a result, rampant discounting has become an acute problem.A December study by San Francisco-based Blueshift Research found that luxury timepieces sold through unauthorized channels were subject to markdowns of as much as 50 percent.\u201cThe dumping of goods is creating a lot of pressure on everyone,\u201d said Pierre Halimi Lacharlotte, general manager of the brand F.P. Journe. \u201cEven the gray market is suffering.\u201dWatchmakers have responded by reassessing prices. During the boom years, many brands aggressively increased prices, even for models aimed at entry-level buyers.In January 2015, when the currency issues began, the TAG Heuer chief executive, Jean-Claude Biver, reduced the company\u2019s prices by roughly 12 percent worldwide \u201cto get back to our core business,\u201d he said recently.At Baselworld, the brand will introduce the TAG Heuer Carrera 02T, a chronograph featuring a tourbillon that will retail for $15,950. The company is touting the model as the most affordable Swiss-made tourbillon on the market.\u201cTAG Heuer must be the reference for accessible luxury,\u201d Mr. Biver said. \u201cSo if we do a $3,000 watch, it must look like a $9,000 watch.\u201cWhen we do a $15,000 tourbillon, the perceived value must be $45,000,\u201d he continued. \u201cWe must always be sure that the perceived value and quality is three times higher than the price.\u201dEven brands at the top of the watchmaking pyramid have acknowledged the need to introduce more affordable watches.In January, for example, the prestige watchmaker Greubel Forsey rolled out its first steel watch for about $170,000 \u2014 a third of the cost of most of its timepieces.In Basel, buyers also can expect to see more streamlined product offerings, as watchmakers place greater emphasis on proven sellers.\u201cNew products will still be very important for the brands, but the novelties will be absolutely in line with the brand and its collections,\u201d said Alexander Linz, founder of Watch-Insider.com. \u201cWe will see even more replicas of icons in the near future.\u201dRetail revisitedIn addition, more brands are expected to embrace Internet sales in an effort to fight the gray market.Demand for e-commerce in the watch space \u201cclearly exists,\u201d Mr. Levin said, \u201cand by doing that, they take some of the wind out of all the players who are trying to reach that consumer in an unauthorized fashion.\u201dMeanwhile, a parallel revolution in brick-and-mortar retailing is reshaping the way high-end watchmakers court and, ultimately, win over their best clients. Take Material Good, a watch retailer in Manhattan\u2019s SoHo neighborhood that could be mistaken for an haute bachelor pad. A wall display of timepieces from Richard Mille, Audemars Piguet and Bamford Watch Department seems like a stylish backdrop to the main event: a loft space decorated with contemporary art and furnished with a Vladimir Kagen Serpentine sofa, a black walnut dining table that seats 14 and a fully equipped kitchen.\u201cThe whole concept is unforced luxury,\u201d said Rob Ronen, a former Audemars Piguet wholesale manager who opened the upstairs retail space last September with his business partner, the diamond merchant Michael Herman.\u201cIt\u2019s supposed to be organic, like a home. Clients roam around, they hang out.\u201dWhether they buy is another question.Even in the best of times, the ranks of serious watch buyers are thin. Gary Getz, a collector who is chief executive of a management consulting firm based in Portola Valley, Calif., and a frequent contributor to the watch blog Quill & Pad, shared an illustrative anecdote.In 2007, he visited the independent watchmaker Kari Voutilainen at his Swiss workshop.\u201cHe pulled out a tray with tissues,\u201d Mr. Getz recalled. \u201cEach tissue hid a movement, and on top of each packet was somebody\u2019s first name: Alex, Terry, Alan, Alberto, Roberto. I knew 75 percent of these people by their first names only.\u201dMr. Getz elaborated on his point: \u201cThe tendency when you get attacked from below by smartwatches is to keep going upmarket, and what happens is that the market gets so thin up there that you can basically overperform your way out of business.\u201dSo what\u2019s a growth-minded watchmaker to do?Mr. Biver is convinced the only way to thrive during a downturn is to focus on winning market share.\u201cWhen the market is easy, even the weak are successful,\u201d he said. \u201cA market that is difficult is welcome for strong people, because it\u2019s the only way for the strong to get stronger.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Divide Grows in Southeast Over Offshore Drilling Plan", "Date": "2016-03-03", "News": "Supported byThat afternoon, 140 miles inland in Raleigh, the state capital, Obama administration officials and oil company representatives had outlined plans to move forward with the drilling before a very different crowd, and state lawmakers liked what they heard. \u201cYou\u2019re talking about creating over 100,000 jobs,\u201d said Michael Hager, the House Republican leader. \u201cYou\u2019re doggone right this is good for the state.\u201dWithin weeks, the Obama administration is expected to release a proposal to open up vast tracts of federal waters in the southern Atlantic to oil and gas drilling for the first time, and a divide is growing between the Southeast\u2019s coast and its landlocked capitals. The plan, written by the Interior Department, is expected to delineate the waters that would eventually be auctioned and leased to energy companies, which in turn would bring the drilling industry to the banks of Georgia, Virginia and North and South Carolina, along with thousands of oil rigs well over the horizon from the beach.\u201cI grew up on Virginia\u2019s Eastern Shore and have worked just about every job one might have on the Chesapeake Bay,\u201d he wrote.\u201cFor an uneducated guy who needs a job, it\u2019s a good opportunity,\u201d allowed John Hicks, a retired tool and die worker, fishing off the pier in Kure Beach. \u201cBut I also think about what it means for my 11-year-old daughter. An accident that messes up the coast could destroy her future. And I guess I care more about her future.\u201dEven if the rigs are out of sight, some opponents fear the transformation of the quiet Outer Banks into bustling oil towns.\u201cOur area has a billion-dollar tourist industry,\u201d said Monica Thibodeau, a member of the Town Council in Duck, N.C. \u201cThe risk of drilling isn\u2019t worth losing that.\u201dThe split is more regional than partisan. Coastal Republicans fear the destruction of their tourist industries as much as seaside Democrats, while landlocked members of both parties envision new revenue for schools and highways.Representative Mark Sanford, a former South Carolina governor and a conservative Republican from Charleston, is fiercely critical of his state\u2019s current Republican governor, Nikki R. Haley, for her support of the drilling. \u201cIt\u2019s a lesson to how to be tone deaf to the American public,\u201d he said. \u201cHearings were held in this congressional district and communities up and down the coast, and the response was overwhelming \u2014 they came out with resolutions against the drilling. There is an amazing disconnect between what people are saying in the statehouses and in the areas that would be most impacted.\u201dIn Raleigh, State Representative Rodney Moore, Democrat of Charlotte, saw things the way Ms. Haley does: \u201cIt\u2019s a good thing if it can generate revenue for our state, if it can be done safely.\u201dThe fight is playing out as a global oil glut has driven down prices to more than 10-year lows and depressed domestic exploration and extraction. But the industry sees the Atlantic drilling, which would not start for at least five years, as a long-term investment in a future in which oil prices rebound and supplies remain volatile.\u201cIf there\u2019s one thing for sure in the oil and gas industry, it\u2019s change,\u201d said Andrew Radford, a policy adviser for the American Petroleum Institute, the oil and gas industry lobby. \u201cHaving new exploration opportunities is really important for the industry to replace the resources we\u2019re producing now.\u201dThe Atlantic Coast States\u2019 interest in pursuing drilling off their shores is relatively recent, as is the legal authority to do that work. While offshore drilling has been an integral part of the coastal economy of the Gulf of Mexico since the 1940s, lawmakers from both parties in the Atlantic Coast States resisted the push by oil companies to explore Atlantic waters, supporting a longstanding legal moratorium on Pacific and Atlantic coastal drilling. That calculus changed after a 2006 law, written by former Senator Mary L. Landrieu, Democrat of Louisiana, which for the first time required oil companies to pay a portion of offshore drilling royalties directly to nearby Gulf Coast states.Until passage of that law, oil companies drilling in federal waters were required to pay royalties only to the United States Treasury. Since passage, Louisiana alone has taken in more than $10 billion in new royalty revenue.Coastal lawmakers persuaded Congress to lift the offshore drilling ban in 2008, hoping the Landrieu legislation could be expanded to include their states, and they have since pressed Mr. Obama to lease the coastal waters for drilling.The Interior Department estimates there are 3.3 billion barrels of recoverable oil on the Atlantic\u2019s outer continental shelf and 31.3 trillion cubic feet of natural gas. Energy industry experts say the true reserves may be far greater.Environmentalists are furious with Mr. Obama.But Obama administration officials say they are listening to the elected officials in the Southeastern states. The administration has not advanced plans to drill off the northeast Atlantic or Pacific coastlines, where governors are still opposed to it.\u201cAlmost every decision we make is about balancing the economic potential and the environmental consequences,\u201d said Abigail Ross Hopper, who directs the Interior Department\u2019s Bureau of Ocean Energy Management.The administration also points to its efforts to improve drilling safety ahead of expanding offshore oil exploration. The Interior Department is expected in the coming weeks to complete new safety regulations on offshore drilling equipment, intended specifically to prevent the failures that led to the Deepwater Horizon explosion.The forthcoming Interior Department proposal will not be the last word. The administration will continue to take public comment on the proposal until it finishes the drilling plan later this year. In response, the oil and gas industry and environmental groups are ramping up advocacy campaigns. Environmental groups are a constant presence at coastal town hall meetings and are planning advertising and telephone campaigns to urge more voters to speak out.The American Petroleum Institute has become a regular fixture in Southeastern statehouses and town hall meetings and is paying to host events coordinated with local schools to highlight job opportunities in science, technology, engineering and mathematics.Oil industry officials have also sought to allay fears that oil drilling would hurt tourist towns. \u201cThe development will not be in small communities; it will be in ports and industrial areas,\u201d Mr. Radford told the Raleigh meeting.So far, the pro-drilling faction is winning. But the fight has begun to reshape local politics. In Kure Beach, Ms. Swearingen\u2019s predecessor as mayor, Dean Lambeth, supported drilling, had won three terms and hoped to win a fourth. Last year, Ms. Swearingen ran against him with an anti-drilling stance \u2014 and won.Advertisement"}

She also questioned the political motivations for leaking details of plea agreements, contending that doing so was illegal.\u201cWe rigorously comply with the Constitution,\u201d she added.While the efforts to impeach Ms. Rousseff seemed to flag in recent weeks after political rivals found themselves entangled in their own scandals, the pressure is rising again as her campaign funding is scrutinized and her political mentor, Mr. da Silva, faces an array of legal challenges.\u201cPresident Dilma, have the humility to say you cannot remain at the helm of the country,\u201d said Betinho Gomes, an opposition congressman who was among those on Thursday calling for her to resign.Beyond the turmoil in Bras\u00edlia, Brazil\u2019s financial markets surged Thursday amid speculation that an impeachment could lead to a retreat from policies that have mired the economy in recession.\u201cA succession of familiar errors provoked the tumble,\u201d said M\u00edriam Leit\u00e3o, one of Brazil\u2019s most prominent economic commentators. \u201cThe warnings were there, but the government still pursued the wrong policies.\u201dThe tension around Mr. da Silva, the former president, who handpicked Ms. Rousseff as his successor and remains a towering figure in the Workers\u2019 Party, is also causing problems for her.Before the Isto \u00c9 report, prosecutors said this week that they were investigating Mr. da Silva on suspicions that construction companies paid for renovations of a country estate and beachfront apartment, potentially tying him to the Petrobras scandal.The accusations brought angry rebukes from Mr. da Silva and his supporters. \u201cLula never participated, directly or indirectly, in any illegal act during or after his government,\u201d a spokesman for his institute said in a statement.Advertisement"}

He will meet with entrepreneurs and dissidents, Cubans who have found ways to challenge the status quo in a country undergoing vast change.But Mr. Obama does not plan to use his visit to issue an ultimatum to Mr. Castro on human rights, nor does he go bearing pledges to end United States democracy programs in Cuba that aim to undercut the communist government there.The president is also not expected to announce that he is giving up the United States\u2019 naval base at Guant\u00e1namo Bay, and is not in a position to lift the trade embargo that still looms as an impediment to the normalization he sees as a pivotal piece of his foreign policy legacy \u2014 only Congress can do that. Mr. Obama\u2019s trip, rich with symbolic significance, represents the start of a new era of engagement between the United States and Cuba that could open the floodgates of travel and commerce, and that has already unlocked diplomatic channels long slammed shut. But it also underscores the deep disagreements that persist between two countries separated by only 90 miles but a wide ideological divide.Photographs from a land of endless waiting and palpable erosion \u2014 but also, an uncanny openness among everyday people.Hillary Clinton, the Democratic presidential front-runner, has endorsed repealing the embargo. Donald J. Trump, who is leading the Republican field, has been muted in his criticism of Mr. Obama\u2019s Cuba policy, and has merely said Mr. Obama \u201cshould have made a better deal\u201d before moving toward normal relations.Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, another Republican presidential contender, whose father was born in Cuba, has been sharply critical of Mr. Obama\u2019s approach, and said last month that the president was traveling there \u201cto essentially act as an apologist.\u201dOther critics, including some in Mr. Obama\u2019s own party, have dismissed the president\u2019s approach as na\u00efve and dangerous, arguing that Mr. Obama has embraced a brutal regime and citing the recent increase in Cuba of detentions of antigovernment activists.\u201cI understand the desire to make this his legacy issue, but there is still a fundamental issue of freedom and democracy at stake,\u201d Senator Robert Menendez of New Jersey, a Democrat and son of Cuban immigrants, said in a 30-minute speech last week from the Senate floor. He mentioned a young dissident, Carlos Amel Oliva, who met in Miami this month with Benjamin J. Rhodes, Mr. Obama\u2019s deputy national security adviser. Mr. Oliva was detained upon his return to Cuba for what the government called \u201cantisocial behavior.\u201d\u201cUnless the Castros are compelled to change their dictatorship \u2014 the way they govern the island and the way they exploit its people \u2014 the answer to this won\u2019t be different than the last 50-some-odd years,\u201d Mr. Menendez said.Mr. Rhodes said the president would address human rights head-on in his private talks with Mr. Castro, 84, as well as in his speech, which is expected to be broadcast in both Cuba and the United States.\u201cThe difference here is that in the past, because of certain U.S. policies, the message that was delivered in that regard either overtly or implicitly suggested that the U.S. was seeking to pursue regime change, that the U.S. was seeking to essentially overturn the government in Cuba or that the U.S. thought that we could dictate the political direction of Cuba,\u201d Mr. Rhodes said.This time, he added, Mr. Obama \u201cwill make very clear that that\u2019s up to the Cuban people.\u201dThere are limits to the new spirit of openness. The president will not meet with Fidel Castro, 89, who embodies the rancorous history between the United States and Cuba. And as of Friday, there were no plans for Mr. Obama and the younger Mr. Castro to take questions from the news media after their meeting, a standard element of the president\u2019s schedule when he meets with foreign leaders overseas.At the heart of Mr. Obama\u2019s policy is a gamble that the thaw will eventually force changes on Cuba\u2019s communist government by nurturing the hopes of its citizens, particularly a younger generation more interested in Internet access and business opportunities than in Cuba\u2019s grievances against the United States.\u201cObama would like to be remembered as the president who ended the Cold War in Latin America and normalized relations with Cuba, so he needs to do as much as he can to make it difficult for the next president to reverse this,\u201d said Geoff Thale, a Cuba specialist at the Washington Office on Latin America.On Thursday, Bruno Rodr\u00edguez Parrilla, the foreign minister, publicly took issue with White House officials who said the new policy was designed to \u201cempower\u201d the Cuban people. \u201cThe Cuban people empowered themselves decades ago,\u201d he told reporters in Havana.Mr. Obama will hold meetings with Cuba\u2019s government on Monday, sitting down with Mr. Castro and dining with him at a state dinner, but he has also loaded his schedule with events that pose challenges to Cuba\u2019s government, directly or indirectly.On Monday, Mr. Obama is to meet with a group of entrepreneurs pursuing business opportunities outside the mostly state-run economy. On Tuesday, much to the consternation of Mr. Castro, Mr. Obama will sit down with antigovernment dissidents and civil society leaders.\u201cThe changes to the embargo are clearly a long-term bet for human rights improvement on the island, but the president is arriving, barring any significant breakthrough, with no concrete human rights advances,\u201d said Christopher Sabatini, a Columbia University professor of international relations who runs a Brooklyn-based research organization, Global Americans.Mr. Obama is planning a speech on Tuesday on the future of relations with Cuba, and will also attend an exhibition baseball game between Cuba\u2019s national team and the Tampa Bay Rays.Carlos M. Gutierrez, a Havana-born Republican who as secretary of commerce under President George W. Bush drafted a lengthy report in 2006 calling for an end to the \u201cCastro-led axis\u201d and the tightening of American sanctions against Cuba, said he now believed that Mr. Obama\u2019s alternative had a better chance of bringing about change.Mr. Gutierrez, chairman of the Albright Stonebridge Group and the U.S.-Cuba Business Council, will accompany Mr. Obama on the trip, along with several dozen members of Congress pressing for an end to the embargo and business leaders aiming to close deals in Cuba in the meantime.\u201cThe Cubans aren\u2019t sure what the U.S. intentions are \u2014 whether this is being done because it is a Trojan horse or a hidden regime-change policy,\u201d Mr. Gutierrez said in an interview. \u201cThe president\u2019s big challenge will be to make progress in chipping away at the tremendous distrust that remains between our two countries.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Is Voting Out of Self-Interest Wrong?", "Date": "2016-03-31", "News": "It is a staple of American politics to criticize those who vote simply out of their own self-interest.

Here we might distinguish between modest luxuries \u00e2\u0080\u0094 those that might generally be considered rewards for work or business success \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and excessive luxuries, which exceed any sensible standard of what we somehow deserve.

Suppose you vote for government funding of a museum of contemporary art simply because you would enjoy visiting it. Is this ethically wrong? Once again, you might claim that the museum would in fact benefit the community as a whole, since more and more people would come to enjoy art they\u00e2\u0080\u0099d previously had no exposure to, or found repugnant.But suppose in fact people would not come to enjoy the art, and on the whole there would be a higher level of unhappiness because of the museum.

{"Headline": "Trade, Labor, and Politics", "Date": "2016-03-28", "News": "Supported byThere are a lot of things about the 2016 election that nobody saw coming, and one of them is that international trade policy is likely to be a major issue in the presidential campaign. What\u2019s more, the positions of the parties will be the reverse of what you might have expected: Republicans, who claim to stand for free markets, are likely to nominate a crude protectionist, leaving Democrats, with their skepticism about untrammeled markets, as the de facto defenders of relatively open trade.But this isn\u2019t as peculiar a development as it seems. Rhetorical claims aside, Republicans have long tended in practice to be more protectionist than Democrats. And there\u2019s a reason for that difference. It\u2019s true that globalization puts downward pressure on the wages of many workers \u2014 but progressives can offer a variety of responses to that pressure, whereas on the right, protectionism is all they\u2019ve got.Actually, the latter episode should be an object lesson for anyone talking tough about trade. The Bush administration suffered from a bad case of superpower delusion, a belief that America could dictate events throughout the world. The falseness of that belief was most spectacularly demonstrated by the debacle in Iraq. But the reckoning came even sooner on trade, an area where other players, Europe in particular, have just as much power as we do.Nor is the threat of retaliation the only factor that should deter any hard protectionist turn. There\u2019s also the collateral damage such a turn would inflict on poor countries. It\u2019s probably bad politics to talk right now about what a trade war would do to, say, Bangladesh. But any responsible future president would have to think hard about such matters.Then again, we might be talking about President Trump.But back to the broader issue of how to help workers pressured by the global economy.Serious economic analysis has never supported the Panglossian view of trade as win-win for everyone that is popular in elite circles: growing trade can indeed hurt many people, and for the past few decades globalization has probably been, on net, a depressing force for the majority of U.S. workers.But protectionism isn\u2019t the only way to fight that downward pressure. In fact, many of the bad things we associate with globalization in America were political choices, not necessary consequences \u2014 and they didn\u2019t happen in other advanced countries, even though those countries faced the same global forces we did.And the rest of the answer is that Denmark (and, to a lesser extent, Canada) has a much stronger social safety net than we do. In America, we\u2019re constantly told that global competition means that we can\u2019t even afford even the safety net we have; strange to say, other rich countries don\u2019t seem to have that problem.What all this means, as I said, is that the Democratic nominee won\u2019t have to engage in saber-rattling over trade.

{"Headline": "Minimizing Risks of Renting Your Home", "Date": "2016-03-04", "News": "Supported bySpecial SectionTry as one might to vet tenants, the sharing economy involves risks. You should ask tenants why they will be renting, who will live in your home, whether they have pets and what they do for a living. Here are some of the lessons for homeowners based on our experiences as landlords and tenants.Give them space. Declutter, remove personal items and create shelf, drawer and hanging areas for tenants\u2019 belongings. Store your valuables in locked closets or off the premises. Provide a comfortable bed and fresh, high-quality linens \u2013 preferably white, which can be bleached.Protect upholstery. Double up on mattress pads. If buying a new sofa, choose something durable \u2013 like leather \u2013 or consider slipcovers that can be laundered between rentals. These heavily used items are especially susceptible to stains and spills that can be costly, if not impossible, to remove.Have boots on the ground. This might be a cleaning lady who comes weekly (at your tenant\u2019s expense) or a handyman whom you pay to handle maintenance and repairs in your absence. You or that person should do an initial walk-through with your renters and show them how everything works.Send redundant messages. A lengthy house manual will get less attention than a single page with the Wi-Fi code and other key information. Put Post-it notes in spots that require special care \u2013 for instance, a reminder like the one Ms. Chambon left us, not to leave wet bathmats on the wooden floor.Cover contingencies. Notify your homeowner\u2019s insurance company that your house will be rented, said Laura Clark, senior underwriting manager at the Chubb Group of Insurance Companies. Most will continue covering the dwelling and your personal liability \u2014 say, if my tenant\u2019s child fell down the basement stairs and was injured, she said. But some exclude your possessions while the house is rented and they typically won\u2019t cover your tenants\u2019 belongings. (Make this clear in a lease.) Ask your tenants for the declarations page of their homeowner\u2019s or renter\u2019s policy and make sure their liability limit is at least $500,000, Ms. Clark said. Homeowners who rent through Airbnb automatically get supplemental property insurance through the company\u2019s Host Guarantee and, in a growing list of countries including the United States, personal liability coverage under its Host Protection Insurance.Require a security deposit. With extended stays, it makes sense to charge about half the weekly rent, said Jon Gray, chief revenue officer at HomeAway; others recommend 10 percent of the total tab. Hold it long enough after your tenant leaves to discover any damaged or missing items \u2014 one month is acceptable, Ms. Baum said. Here Airbnb gives you much less control. It doesn\u2019t allow you to collect a security deposit upfront and you must file claims within 48 hours of checkout. If you and your tenant can\u2019t agree on a settlement, Airbnb, which disburses the funds, has the last word.DEBORAH L. JACOBSAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Car-Pooling Helps Uber Go the Extra Mile", "Date": "2016-03-30", "News": "Supported byState of the ArtOne day not long ago, an Uber driver picked up a passenger in San Francisco\u2019s gritty Tenderloin district. Let\u2019s call our passenger Abby, because her real name has been lost to database anonymization, an effort to keep her identity private.Abby needed to go to Noe Valley, a 25-minute drive that might ordinarily have cost about $15. But she had chosen UberPool, the ride-hailing company\u2019s 18-month-old car-pooling program. In the process she had unwittingly initiated one of the service\u2019s more epic recent trips.Unlike a standard Uber ride, in which a single rider starts a one-time trip, UberPool works like a party line for cars. Travis Kalanick, Uber\u2019s co-founder and chief executive, describes it as the future of his company \u2014 and thus the future of transportation in America.Call up the app, specify your destination, and in exchange for a significant discount, UberPool matches you with other riders going the same way. The service might create a ride just for you, but just as often, it puts you in a ride that began long ago \u2014 one that has spanned several drop-offs and pickups, a kind of instant bus line created from collective urban demand.The trip Abby started would last nearly an hour and meander over 10 miles across San Francisco, stopping nine times to pick up and drop off passengers. After Abby got in, the driver collected his second passenger \u2014 let\u2019s call him Ben \u2014 a few blocks away. Ben got out after about a mile. A couple of blocks later, Carrie got in. By this time Abby might have been getting annoyed; fortunately, about six minutes later, the car reached Noe Valley. Abby got out, but Carrie was still in the car, so the trip went on. Danny got in after about a mile, then Carrie got out, then Edward got in, then Danny got out. Finally, after about 55 minutes of driving, the car reached Edward\u2019s destination, and the trip was done.In total, Uber collected about $48 for the ride, of which the driver kept $35. The company had collapsed five separate rides into a single trip, saving about six miles of travel and removing several cars from the road. For riders, the discounts amounted to savings of at least half of a standard Uber trip. For the driver, an hourlong trip with no idle time resulted in steady earnings (Uber drivers make money only when riders are in the car). And though Uber made less from the single ride than it would have from multiple rides, the company benefited by installing itself as a fixture in people\u2019s lives.\u201cWhen rides get cheaper, it means that for more people in more cities, Uber is cheaper than owning a car,\u201d Mr. Kalanick said in a recent interview. \u201cAnd when Uber is cheaper than owning a car, we can become a mainstay of transportation in that city.\u201dHere\u2019s another way to put it: UberPool may push us to re-evaluate how we think about Uber and its impact on the world.UberPool raises the stakes. Because it reduces price and increases volume, it suggests that if Uber ultimately succeeds, the company could have a much bigger impact on urban mobility, labor, the environment, local economies and the national transportation infrastructure than we\u2019ve all supposed \u2014 and its effects could confound the expectations of its harshest critics.Like most initiatives at Uber, Pool began as an experiment. Now 100 million pooled trips have been taken since the program began, and tens of millions more are occurring each month. The company once spurred demand for Pool with heavy discounts, but the service has grown beyond that \u2014 today, in many of the 29 cities where it operates, UberPool is profitable, Mr. Kalanick said.\u201cWe had to lose millions of dollars in individual cities to make it work,\u201d he said. \u201cBut at this point it\u2019s no longer a bet in terms of financial investment \u2014 the only question is how much more efficient we can make it.\u201dIn many cities, UberPool now accounts for more than half of Uber trips taken. In Los Angeles, New York, Chicago and San Francisco, more than 100,000 people take UberPool every week. In China, Uber is running 20 million UberPool trips a month.Mr. Kalanick said it was likely that soon, in big cities and even in many suburbs, most Uber rides will be pooled, meaning each Uber car will be serving more than one rider most of the time.Transportation scholars are now looking into whether car-pooling by ride companies could reverse these dismal numbers. Susan Shaheen, co-director of the Transportation Sustainability Research Center at the University of California, Berkeley, has begun a study with the Natural Resources Defense Council to determine the environmental impact of Uber and Lyft\u2019s car-pooling systems.Ms. Shaheen said her study, the results of which are due this year, will seek to answer several questions: How many cars are pooled services getting off the roads? Are people using UberPool and Lyft Line instead of public transportation, or are people supplementing public transit instead \u2014 for instance, using cars when buses and trains aren\u2019t running? Do cheap Uber rides push people to consider abandoning their own cars? Or if Uber rides are so cheap, are people now more likely to travel when otherwise they might have stayed home?While that study is in progress, the early data suggests that by getting \u201cmore butts in seats\u201d \u2014 a phrase that has become a mantra at Uber\u2019s San Francisco headquarters \u2014 car-pooled services may already be reducing traffic, gas use and automobile emissions.Uber has calculated the environmental impact of UberPool rides. In the first three months of 2016, the service has eliminated 21 million automobile miles; that\u2019s about 400,000 gallons of gas and 3,800 metric tons of carbon dioxide emissions, it says. The company says that by reducing prices, the program has also expanded access to Uber.\u201cThe more likely someone is to use Uber and Lyft, the more likely they are to take public transportation, and for our industry that is very heartening,\u201d said Darnell Grisby, the group\u2019s director of policy development and research. People who use these services tend to own fewer cars, Mr. Grisby said. As a result, they become more interested in all forms of transportation \u2014 trains, buses, taxis, bikes \u2014 and see Uber and Lyft as a complement to other transit, not a replacement for it.Uber\u2019s data bears this out. In Los Angeles, 14 percent of UberPool trips start or end near a Metro station. In San Francisco during the morning commute, 10 percent of UberPool trips are to or from the Bay Area Rapid Transit train.Mr. Kalanick said these experiments would continue, because reducing traffic was part of Uber\u2019s mission.\u201cI grew up in L.A., and I spent almost 30 years of my life there, and I spent years of my life stuck behind the wheel, thinking about how to make this better,\u201d he said. \u201cSo there\u2019s going to be a big smile on my face if Uber can have any impact on reducing traffic on freeways. It would feel like a big deal.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated the use of UberPool in Los Angeles, New York, Chicago and San Francisco. The number 100,000 represents people who take UberPool every week, not the number of UberPool trips taken every week.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Bygone Time Captured Through the Lens of Walker Evans", "Date": "2016-03-15", "News": "Supported by10 PhotosThe most comprehensive show of work by the photographer Walker Evans since the Metropolitan Museum of Art\u2019s retrospective in 2000 will open at the High Museum of Art in Atlanta in June. While the photographer\u2019s work has been exhibited widely and often, the South has not \u201cbeen exposed to an Evans show of this scope and caliber,\u201d said Brett Abbott, the High\u2019s curator of photography. The High will be the show\u2019s only stop in the United States \u2014 something of a coup for a regional museum.A sizable number of photographs that Evans took in the 1930s in the South on assignment for the Farm Security Administration will be shown, along with his well-known photographs of tenant farmers and their families in Hale County, Ala., published in the 1941 book \u201cLet Us Now Praise Famous Men,\u201d which Evans wrote with James Agee.The curators wanted to place the Farm Security Administration material in the context of Evans\u2019s career, assembling, as well, work he made on the streets of New York and Cuba in the 1930s, his work for Fortune magazine in the \u201940s and \u201950s, and his color images from late in life. Included, too, are rarely seen portraits of his accomplished friends and colleagues, such as Lincoln Kirstein and Berenice Abbott, as well as his self-portraits. Evans claimed Eug\u00e8ne Atget and August Sander as his major influences, and examples of their photographs from the High\u2019s permanent collection will be in the show.Asked why this show has relevance, Mr. Abbott laughed. \u201cThere\u2019s probably no question that Evans is one of the great artists of the 20th century,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s always a good enough reason for me.\u201dThroughout the 20th century, photography as proof, or documentation, of the physical world was a defining principle of the medium\u2019s art-making practice. Evans\u2019s simple, forthright approach, his clean compositional geometry, and the optical clarity of his pictures underscore the camera\u2019s potential to record and describe the world with a starkness that is, at times, astonishing. As Garry Winogrand famously said, \u201cThere is nothing as mysterious as a fact clearly described.\u201dTod Papageorge, a former dean of the graduate program in photography at Yale, claimed that Evans could find beauty in anything, whether a chair, a building facade or a hand-painted commercial sign. \u201cOur dominant sense of his work,\u201d Mr. Papageorge once wrote, \u201cis not that it is simply beautiful, but that, in the act of so precisely naming the world, the photographer has divested it of its usual, customary values, and granted it a new meaning \u2014 that of having-been-truly-seen.\u201dEvans\u2019s pictures of a bygone era offer an edifying measure of our own cultural progress. The distance in years from the style of dress, the shape of cars and the hand-painted commercial signs and billboards in his photographs renders the time in which he worked with a striking innocence, in contrast to the electronically infused matrix of our 21st-century world.Yet Evans gives us a view of life in the earlier 20th century with an artist\u2019s foresight about what future generations might find significant about that time. He considered photography the \u201cmost literary\u201d of the visual arts, writing that the traits he wanted to infuse in his photographs were \u201celoquence, wit, grace, and economy; style, of course; structure and coherence; paradox and play and oxymoron.\u201dIn one picture, workers load a display sign spelling \u201cdamaged\u201d in capital letters onto a truck. While the sign\u2019s intended use is still uncertain \u2014 one scholar suggested it was made to promote the 1930 film, \u201cNot Damaged\u201d \u2014 the picture plays with visual onomatopoeia, as if \u201cdamaged\u201d applies to the sign itself: the attached letters create an oversized object almost twice the length of the truck\u2019s cargo bed, and the angle of the picture echoes the uphill task of lifting the sign into the truck.\u201cFrom a very early date, Evans demonstrated a deep interest in signs both as objects to physically collect and as subjects for his camera and word-subject juxtapositions,\u201d Mr. Abbott said, adding that Evans frequently photographed torn posters, display windows and other traces of contemporary popular culture. Evans once even wryly suggested that he created \u2014 or anticipated \u2014 the Pop Art movement. \u201cThis fascination with everyday artifacts, and his insistence that art could be an act of taking, collecting, isolating and assembling in new contexts,\u201d Abbott added, \u201cis a pursuit that has much to do with Rauschenberg, Warhol and others.\u201dMr. Hill, a vigilant guardian of Evans\u2019s legacy, referred to this show as \u201cthe best case I have made for Evans as the seminal artist.\u201d The prints are on loan from personal collections and private institutions, \u201cwith the generosity of, mainly, MoMA and the Yale Art Gallery,\u201d he said, adding that the Metropolitan Museum also lent prints from its collection.The High Museum\u2019s photography collection includes more than 6,000 images, most of them social documentary, from vintage prints of the Civil War to the most comprehensive collection of pictures chronicling the Civil Rights movement.Since 1996, the museum has commissioned 13 internationally recognized photographers, among them Dawoud Bey, Emmet Gowin, Sally Mann, Richard Misrach, Martin Parr and Alec Soth, to work in the South. The commissions come with \u201cno strings attached,\u201d according to Mr. Abbott. \u201cThe only parameter,\u201d he said, \u201cis that it must be done here in the South.\u201d Each body of work results in a museum exhibition and a catalog \u2014 an advantageous way for the High to generate a dialogue between its regional home and the art world at large.Mr. Abbott feels a responsibility to attract residents of Atlanta and the region to the museum, where they can be introduced to the best examples of the history of photography. \u201cFor me,\u201d Mr. Abbott said, \u201csimply showing a great artist\u2019s work to a public that has likely not experienced his vision is really an important thing to do.\u201dOne Evans photograph, \u201cHouses and Billboards in Atlanta, 1936,\u201d shows two identical wood-frame houses standing side by side behind a fence on which movie posters are lined up (like a news crawl in today\u2019s television lingo); they advertise Anne Shirley in \u201cChatterbox\u201d and Carole Lombard in \u201cLove Before Breakfast.\u201d The picture is a microcosm of the period in Atlanta \u2014 and in America \u2014 in 1936, one that puts the city today, with its gleaming towers, superhighways and electronic road signs, in dizzying relief.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Exposure: Chernobyl", "Date": "2016-03-21", "News": "I am on a sleeper train, traveling from Moscow to Anapa, a town in Southern Russia, on the shore of the Black Sea. It is April 26, 1986, a week before my sixth birthday. We have been en route for nearly two days and the provisions we brought from home are running down. The train has stopped at the station in Rostov-on-Don, 700 miles away from our home on the outskirts of Moscow.From my upper-level bed I can see out the window to the platform, where a lively scene is unfolding: the typical hustle and bustle of a major station, older women selling hot meat and potato pies, fried chicken and pickles, people rushing in and out of the train. No one has any idea about what is going on 500 miles northwest in Chernobyl.Radioactive fallout clouds from the reactor and official information about the incident have not reached us yet, and they will not do so for some days. But the event is afoot. It will catch up with us, before we have a chance to catch up with it, if at all. In the meantime, life will continue to wind through its \u00e2\u0080\u009cnormal\u00e2\u0080\u009d course. And I am observing its ebbs and flows on the Rostov-on-Don platform from inside the train compartment in which I am traveling.\u00e2\u0080\u00a2But the impression that one can flee from the calamity that is our civilization is no less immature than the sunny ideology of progress itself. There are no escape valves. By train, I was speeding toward another, still greater catastrophe spawned by the same total system \u00e2\u0080\u0094not Soviet \u00e2\u0080\u009ctotalitarianism\u00e2\u0080\u009d but a pernicious handling of nature that undercuts life and prevails both in capitalist and socialist economic systems.That was the logic of seduction I was subject to. For more than six weeks \u00e2\u0080\u0094 from the end of April until mid-June 1986 \u00e2\u0080\u0094 I was exposed to huge quantities of radiation in Anapa. Most of that time was spent outdoors: at the beach, in parks or promenades. Until not so long ago I was not aware of this \u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00c2\u00a0perhaps because of having undergone the uncanny non-experience at a young age or due to mistakenly believing later that the plumes of radioactive materials travelled exclusively north, through Belorussia and the Baltic countries to Sweden and Norway, blazing new European cartographies.\u00e2\u0080\u00a2It is difficult to talk and write about Chernobyl. The very structure of witnessing breaks down once the event, with all its extraordinary and death-bearing potential, practically merges with everyday life thanks to its imperceptibility. What is there to say about an exposure to radiation that cannot be seen or smelled or heard or touched or tasted? Those of us who have been in its eerie precinct are like objects, onto which certain effects have been inflicted, rather than subjects in control and aware of what is going on.An anthology of essays from The Times\u2019s philosophy series, published by Liveright.Plants, too, live through occurrences without formulating them in speech. Their articulations are wholly material; the patterns observable on their extensions, from tree rings to the position of branches, are bodily witnesses to a history of growth and to its environment. If it so difficult to talk about Chernobyl, then why not delegate the act of testimony to plants, living beings that do not speak, at least not in human voices and languages. Were we to do so, we would perhaps allow exposure to become expression, and vulnerability \u00e2\u0080\u0094 a way of bearing witness.Rooted in the ground, plants are unable to escape radiation\u00e2\u0080\u0099s harmful effects. Visitors to the \u00e2\u0080\u009cred forest\u00e2\u0080\u009d near Chernobyl\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ground zero will see pine trees turned reddish, their fallen trunks accumulating on the ground over the last 30 years. They are not decaying or being digested into the earth as compost as they should. But some plants are adaptable: soybeans experimentally grown in Chernobyl\u00e2\u0080\u0099s radioactive environment have displayed drastic changes in their protein makeup, enabling them to strengthen their resistance to heavy metals and to modify their carbon metabolism. Their exposure to the world is of one piece with learning from the world and giving plenty of things back to it. Only our, human, exposure suggests vulnerability, passivity and helplessness.\u00e2\u0080\u00a2We live in the shadow of an ever-present threat that our insatiable desire for energy would consume the entire world, without sparing us either. This threat is not an amorphous prospect. It attained reality in April 1986, and before and after, with varying degrees of intensity at Three Mile Island and Fukushima. Still, our addiction to what is economically convenient persists \u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00c2\u00a0it is stronger than fear. Economy overrides ecology. Heedless to the alarms that have been ringing for some time now, we have not yet woken up from our energy nightmares.Thirty years after Chernobyl, the risks of using atomic energy are no longer a matter of the future; they are already actualized. The greatest risk is that we carry on as though Chernobyl never happened. As though our consciousness has not exploded together with the power plant\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Unit 4 reactor. As though the world and our picture of it were still intact. As though the self-regenerative capacities of the body and of the environment were endless. As though finitude were infinitely resilient, ready to be reborn from the ashes each time anew, like the phoenix we mistake it for.More From Fixes \u00bbMore From Private Lives \u00bbMore From Couch \u00bbMore From The Stone \u00bbMore From Moviegoers \u00bbMore From The End \u00bbMore From Draft \u00bbMore From Anxiety \u00bbMore From Menagerie \u00bbMore From Disunion \u00bbMore From Bedside \u00bbMore From The Conversation \u00bbMore From The Great Divide \u00bbMore From Errol Morris \u00bbFollowAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "In Hail of Bullets and Fire, North Korea Killed Official Who Wanted Reform", "Date": "2016-03-12", "News": "Supported byHundreds of officials were gathered there to witness the execution of Mr. Jang\u2019s two trusted deputies in the administrative department of the ruling Workers\u2019 Party.The two men, Ri Ryong-ha and Jang Su-gil, were torn apart by antiaircraft machine guns, according to South Korea\u2019s National Intelligence Service. The executioners then incinerated their bodies with flamethrowers.Jang Song-thaek, widely considered the second-most powerful figure in the North, fainted during the ordeal, according to a new book published in South Korea that offers a rare glimpse into the secretive Pyongyang regime.\u201cSon-in-Law of a Theocracy,\u201d by Ra Jong-yil, a former deputy director of the National Intelligence Service, is a rich biography of Mr. Jang, the most prominent victim of the purges his young nephew has conducted since assuming power in 2011.Mr. Ra, who is also a professor of political science and a former South Korean ambassador to Japan and Britain, mined existing publications but also interviewed sources in South Korea, Japan and China, including high-ranking defectors from the North who spoke on the condition of anonymity.Mr. Jang met one of the daughters of North Korea\u2019s founder, Kim Il-sung, while both attended Kim Il-sung University in the mid-1960s. The daughter, Kim Kyong-hee, developed a crush on Mr. Jang, who was tall and humorous \u2014 and sang and played the accordion.Her father transferred the young man to a provincial college to keep the two apart. But Ms. Kim hopped in her Soviet Volga sedan to see Mr. Jang each weekend.Once they married in 1972, Mr. Jang\u2019s career took off under the patronage of Kim Jong-il, his brother-in-law and the designated successor of the regime.Mr. Jang also mobilized North Korean diplomats abroad to import Danish dairy products, Black Sea caviar, French cognac and Japanese electronics \u2014 gifts Mr. Kim handed out during his parties to keep his elites loyal.But North Korean diplomats who have defected to South Korea also said that during his frequent trips overseas to shop for Mr. Kim, Mr. Jang would drink heavily and speak dejectedly about people dying of hunger back home.Few benefited more than Mr. Jang from the regime he loyally served. But he was never fully embraced by the Kim family because he was not blood kin. This \u201climinal existence\u201d enabled him to see the absurdities of the regime more clearly than any other figure within it, Mr. Ra wrote.Mr. Ra said Hwang Jang-yop, a North Korean party secretary who defected to Seoul in 1997 and lived here until his death in 2010, shared a conversation he once had with Mr. Jang. When told that the North\u2019s economy was cratering, Mr. Jang responded sarcastically: \u201cHow can an economy already at the bottom go further down?\u201dMr. Jang\u2019s frequent partying with the \u201cpleasure squad\u201d strained his marriage. Senior defectors from the North said it was an open secret among the Pyongyang elite that the couple both had extramarital affairs.Their only child, Jang Kum-song, killed herself in Paris in 2006. She overdosed on sleeping pills after the Pyongyang government caught wind of her dating a Frenchman and summoned her home.Still, the marriage endured. When Kim Jong-il banished Mr. Jang three times for overstepping his authority, his wife intervened on his behalf.Mr. Jang\u2019s campaign for more influence was apparently aimed at pushing for the kind of economic overhaul that China has introduced, Mr. Ra wrote. But he underestimated how unpalatable the idea was to Kim Jong-un, whose totalitarian rule would be undermined by such reform.Mr. Ra said it was impossible to establish the exact sequence of events that led to Mr. Jang\u2019s downfall. But it was clear his hubris played a role. At the height of his power, photographs in the North Korean media showed Mr. Jang leaning on an armrest, looking almost bored, while his nephew spoke.Announcing his execution, North Korea said Mr. Jang, \u201chuman scum worse than a dog,\u201d had betrayed the Kim family by plotting to overthrow the younger Mr. Kim, using economic collapse as a pretext, and to rule the country himself as premier and \u201creformer.\u201dHe was accused of planting his followers in key posts and profiteering from minerals exports. His indictment pointedly noted that Mr. Jang had stood up and clapped only \u201chalfheartedly\u201d when Mr. Kim was being upheld as supreme leader.In 2013, Mr. Kim, after hearing complaints about Mr. Jang\u2019s expansion of power, ordered his department to relinquish the management of a fishing farm and a condensed milk factory. But officials loyal to their \u201cComrade No. 1,\u201d Mr. Jang, blocked those who arrived to carry out Mr. Kim\u2019s orders from entering their premises.It was probably the last straw for Mr. Kim, still unsure about himself and extremely sensitive about any challenge to his supposedly monolithic leadership. Meanwhile, Mr. Jang\u2019s enemies in the secret police were eager to go after him.\u201cThere was no indication that he had a lawyer or was allowed to speak for himself during his trial,\u201d Mr. Ra said. \u201cIt was not a trial but a murder.\u201dMr. Jang\u2019s name has been expurgated from all official records in the North. Hundreds of his associates were purged. His wife is alive but sickly, according to the South Korean intelligence agency.But some people in Pyongyang still remember his role in the tall apartment buildings, water parks and other showpiece projects he once zealously promoted to glorify his nephew\u2019s nascent leadership.Advertisement"}

Charlotte\u2019s decision to allow transgender people to use the public restroom that comports with their gender identity was the catalyst for the state bill that took away that protection and many more, from lesbians, gays and bisexuals as well as trans people.In other words, Colorado wanted to stop local anti-discrimination efforts much like the one in Charlotte that North Carolina just stopped. \u201cWe probably haven\u2019t seen something as sweeping as the Colorado amendment until now,\u201d says Sarah Preston, acting executive director of the North Carolina office of the A.C.L.U.Colorado justified its amendment by arguing that landlords who found homosexuality morally offensive had a right to evict gay tenants. But Justice Anthony Kennedy, writing for a six-justice majority, said that Colorado\u2019s amendment was \u201cborn of animosity\u201d and \u201cseems inexplicable by anything but animus toward the class it affects.\u201d Kennedy also said Colorado was disqualifying gay people from \u201cthe right to seek specific protection from the law\u201d \u2014 a right that everyone else enjoyed.Emily Bazelon is a staff writer for the magazine and the Truman Capote fellow at Yale Law School.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Marriott-Starwood Deal Is Interrupted by a Chinese Suitor", "Date": "2016-03-14", "News": "Supported byNow, the Chinese insurer hopes to expand its hotel empire with an unsolicited bid to acquire Starwood Hotels & Resorts Worldwide, the operator of the hotel brands Westin, W and Sheraton, for $76 a share in cash, or $12.8 billion in total.A consortium of investors, led by Anbang, is hoping to derail Starwood\u2019s $10.8 billion cash-and-stock merger with Marriott International that is set to be considered by shareholders of both hotel operators this month.The other bidders in the competing consortium, according to a person with knowledge of the discussions, include J. Christopher Flowers\u2019 buyout firm, J.C. Flowers & Company, and the Primavera Capital Group, whose chairman, Fred Hu, is the former chairman of Goldman Sachs for China.The cash offer by Anbang and its investment partners is the latest in a wave of overseas deal-making by Chinese companies. So far this year, Chinese companies have announced $81.9 billion worth of foreign deals, compared with just $10.55 billion in the same period a year ago, according to Thomson Reuters data.Strategic Hotels owns the Four Seasons hotels and resorts in Silicon Valley, Washington and Jackson Hole, Wyo., the Fairmont and Intercontinental hotels in Chicago and the JW Marriott Essex House hotel in Manhattan.Anbang, led by its chairman, Wu Xiaohui, has been an aggressive deal maker in recent years. Mr. Wu is married to the granddaughter of Deng Xiaoping, China\u2019s former top leader who oversaw the opening of the Chinese economy to capitalism and investment from foreign companies.In addition to its deal for Waldorf Astoria, Anbang, which is based in Beijing, has also bought an American insurer, Fidelity & Guaranty Life Insurance, for nearly $1.6 billion, and a controlling stake in a South Korean life insurer. Last year, it also unsuccessfully offered to buy a Portuguese lender.Anbang got its start as a car insurer supported in part by the SAIC Motor Corporation, China\u2019s largest automaker. A decade ago, it was a small operator compared with China\u2019s big state-owned insurance companies.But the company broadened its operations to sell investment products and other services and has increasingly made aggressive bets. It was helped by the Chinese government\u2019s move in recent years to give Chinese insurers greater freedom to invest their money, making them major players in real estate and other areas in China.The consortium\u2019s cash offer, which was made on March 10 and announced publicly by Starwood on Monday, represents a significant premium to Marriott\u2019s deal, which has been affected by a decline in the hotel operator\u2019s stock price since it was announced in November.Starwood said on Monday that its board had not changed its recommendation in support of the Marriott deal, but that it would carefully consider the outcome of its discussions with the consortium led by Anbang to determine the course of action that is in the \u201cbest interest of Starwood and its stockholders.\u201dStarwood said that it had received a waiver from Marriott to allow it to engage in discussions and due diligence with the consortium. The waiver expires on Thursday.Marriott described the rival takeover approach to Starwood as \u201chighly conditional and nonbinding.\u201dShareholders of Starwood and Marriott are set to vote on whether to approve the merger on March 28. Marriott would receive a termination fee of $400 million if Starwood were to back out of the deal.The deal with Marriott would create the world\u2019s largest hotel company, with more than 5,500 owned or franchised hotels, for a total of 1.1 million rooms around the world.Based on the 20-day volume weighted average of Marriott\u2019s stock, the merger would be valued at $63.74 a Starwood share, including a cash consideration of $2 a share, Starwood said on Monday.Starwood shareholders would also receive $5.50 a share from the spinoff of its time-share business, Vistana Signature Experiences, and the business\u2019s merger with a subsidiary of the Interval Leisure Group.Anbang is widely seen as benefiting from good relations with leaders in Beijing.Late last year, it also struck an alliance with China Vanke, a Chinese property developer in the middle of a rare corporate takeover battle. The deal, which Vanke said it welcomed, was widely seen as a friendly effort that allowed Vanke management to remain at the helm of the company, China\u2019s largest property developer.It is not just Anbang that is increasingly looking abroad.China\u2019s slowing economy has led companies and individuals to take money out of the country and invest it elsewhere. This turnabout from the days when China soaked up much of the world\u2019s money flows has led investors to believe that China\u2019s currency \u2014 already weakened in recent months after two sets of devaluations \u2014 could fall further. Foreign deals allow Chinese companies to move money abroad with the blessing of Chinese officials while avoiding potentially painful devaluations.Still, major deals continue to be struck. In the biggest potential Chinese deal for a foreign company, the Swiss agribusiness Syngenta has agreed to be acquired by a state-owned Chinese chemical company, known as ChemChina, for $43 billion.Advertisement"}

It harks back to the Smoot-Hawley tariffs of the 1930s, which pushed the world into a tit-for-tat trade war in which everybody raised their barriers against everybody else\u2019s imports, entrenching the Depression.But the raw anxiety of his supporters remains unaddressed.It is not obvious how to restore the America Mr. Trump\u2019s legions pine for. The nation\u2019s diversity would not go into reverse regardless of how high he built his wall along the nation\u2019s southern border.Their economic discontent \u2014 born of the mismatch between expectations based on an earlier America, where plenty of blue-collar jobs offered a decent standard of living, and the more cutthroat reality they face today \u2014 can seem intractable, too.\u201cIt\u2019s not clear what public policy can do for someone who was expecting his income to grow from $50,000 to $80,000 but instead saw it stagnate at $50,000,\u201d said Lawrence Katz, a Harvard economist.Stumped by the economy\u2019s inability to deliver more decent jobs, policy makers are struggling to come up with solutions.The routine promise that economic growth will automatically spread prosperity has proved empty, belied by the long slide in the real earnings of all but the best-paid workers.Any long-term strategy to improve workers\u2019 lot, of course, must include improving their skills. But just kicking the challenge down the road under the fuzzy prescription that all America needs is better education and training \u2014 a favorite of policy makers and their economic advisers \u2014 is no longer acceptable for workers who have suffered multiple rounds of dislocation over several decades.But before we enter the world of science fiction, it\u2019s worth looking at some policies that could improve jobs for most American workers, in the here and now.Instead of enhancing these trends, as it now does, government policy could push back. As Professor Katz noted, over the last few decades, about 13 percent of the nation\u2019s gross domestic product was redistributed to the top 1 percent from the rest of the population. \u201cIt is not crazy to suggest,\u201d he said, \u201cthat some percentage of that could be shared with a broader group.\u201dThe earned-income tax credit \u2014 a wage subsidy for low-income workers that has become the nation\u2019s most powerful antipoverty tool \u2014 could be expanded to include more workers and phase out at higher incomes. Combined with a higher minimum wage, it could be calibrated to ensure that workers\u2019 earnings totaled, say, at least $15 an hour.The White House also supports increasing the earned-income tax credit for adults without children; so does Speaker Paul Ryan, the Republican leader in the House of Representatives.These proposals represent only a start. They are far from full solutions for the struggling working class.Yet modest though they may be, they are still highly controversial. Indeed, the most critical question is whether politicians divided by an ideological gulf could agree on any effective labor market strategy.Many citizens of red states and members of the struggling working class \u2014 supporters of Mr. Trump, not to mention Senators Ted Cruz of Texas and Marco Rubio of Florida \u2014 oppose programs to benefit \u201cpoor people.\u201d Even if the \u201cpoor people\u201d these programs would help is them.Advertisement"}

Not setting the bar terribly high, is it? So the more cynical might say. All the same, an array of scientists and futurists are convinced that the advent of devices with superhuman intelligence looms in the not-distant future. The prospect fills some of our planet\u2019s brainiest specimens with dread.While not discounting that doomsayers may prove someday to be right, Retro Report offers more reassuring views from computer specialists who sense that the end is not nigh \u2014 if only, they say, because machines are not nearly as clever, or necessarily as pernicious, as the fretters believe.Arguably, there is no reason to lose sleep over those souped-up gadgets. Sure, Watson and its brethren are good at games and other sorts of data processing. But contemplating a takeover of the world\u2019s nuclear arsenals? Not a chance. Nonetheless, some experts foresee a time, not far off, when artificial intelligence, A.I., will match and then exceed human intelligence, at ever-accelerating and frightening speeds.\u201cWe humans steer the future not because we\u2019re the strongest beings on the planet, or the fastest, but because we are the smartest,\u201d Mr. Barrat has said. \u201cSo when there is something smarter than us on the planet, it will rule over us on the planet.\u201dHorrific scenarios abound. Superintelligent computers will cause global financial systems to collapse. They will wage war on humans with killer robots far more lethal than today\u2019s drones. They will control nuclear weaponry \u2014 think Skynet in the \u201cTerminator\u201d series \u2014 to dominate humankind or, worse, wipe it out.In these grim predictions, the machines always seem to be anthropomorphic: Their instincts are essentially the same as those of humans at their worst; just as people have run roughshod over lower life forms, artificial intelligence networks will abuse their supremacy. Possibilities for them to do good \u2014 figuring out how to regenerate human cells, for instance, or creating immunities against disease, or gobbling up carbon dioxide in the atmosphere \u2014 tend to get short shrift.Economic issues are unavoidable as well. Lawrence H. Summers, president emeritus at Harvard University and a former Treasury secretary, noted that unemployment is disproportionately higher among those whose duties \u201cin various ways have been mechanized.\u201d There are \u201cimportant consequences for the way the economy is organized and for how fair the economy is,\u201d Mr. Summers said in an interview with Retro Report.There is, too, a question of how smart robots truly are and whether they can develop superintelligence at the blinding speed envisioned by the more pessimistic forecasters. \u201cThings that are easy for humans are hard for computers,\u201d Guruduth S. Banavar, the director of cognitive computing research at IBM, told Retro Report, \u201cand things that are easy for computers are hard for humans.\u201d Yes, a computer can multiply two numbers of 1,000 digits each in a matter of seconds. But it cannot hold a candle to a toddler when it comes to recognizing faces or performing a task as simple as climbing steps.But it is too soon for hyperventilating, Fei-Fei Li, a professor of computer science at Stanford University, told Retro Report.

{"Headline": "The Assets of the Ultrarich Come Closer to Earth", "Date": "2016-03-10", "News": "Supported byCommon SenseFor the ultrawealthy, 2015 was an embarrassment of riches.But after years of dizzying appreciation, the values of luxury assets are plateauing and in some cases plunging. Volumes have shrunk, prices are being cut and some auction lots are going unsold.\u201cWe\u2019ve just come through a boom unlike anything I\u2019ve experienced in 30 years in the business,\u201d Jonathan J. Miller, chief executive of Miller Samuel, a real estate appraisal and consulting firm, said of the market for high-end sales. \u201cThe hard asset buyers have all cooled at the same time.\u201dThe sharp decline in demand is caused by many of the same factors creating broad financial weakness across the globe: collapsing oil and commodity prices; a slowing Chinese economy; and the prospect of higher interest rates in the United States. Rather suddenly, it seems, the voracious spending appetites of newly minted billionaires from Russia, Brazil and China have cooled off.In Manhattan, some sellers of luxury real estate have slashed prices. The asking price for a Park Avenue townhouse dropped $18.5 million, to just under $30 million; a seller cut the price for a Central Park South apartment by $7 million late last year, to below $18 million, and has since taken off another $2 million. Neither property has sold.The billionaire hedge fund manager William A. Ackman, who was part of an investor group that paid $91.5 million for an apartment at One57, the tower on what is now known as Billionaire\u2019s Row in Manhattan, may already have missed the market peak if he hopes to flip it at a profit. An apartment there purchased last April for $20.3 million sold again this year at a $2.5 million loss.Such prices are still in the unattainable stratosphere for almost everyone but the ultrawealthy. Still, the impact is significant: 12 percent fewer Manhattan apartments (189) were sold last year for more than $10 million than in 2014, with most of the decline coming in the second half of the year, according to CityRealty, which tracks co-op and condo sales.In London, the trend is even more pronounced. Prices for central London luxury properties over all dropped in 2015, with the steepest declines in two of the city\u2019s wealthiest neighborhoods, Belgravia and Knightsbridge. The number of high-end sales dropped 40 percent in December, according to Property Vision, an English property advisory concern. It recently reported that sellers were cutting prices, and \u201cwe are negotiating deals today that would have been impossible even in the late autumn.\u201dArt collectors are anxiously waiting for the results of the big spring auctions in New York. The art market\u2019s first test of the year, the February auctions in London, were not the disaster some had feared, but results were tepid, with total sales declining 35 percent at Christie\u2019s and 50 percent at Sotheby\u2019s.Shares in Sotheby\u2019s have mirrored the auction results: After peaking last June at over $47, they have declined about 45 percent.\u201cWe\u2019re seeing more restraint by mega-buyers, both individuals and institutions,\u201d said Evan Beard, national art executive for U.S. Trust, who has advised many high-net-worth clients. \u201cMany would-be consignors have looked at all the uncertainty and decided they\u2019re sitting out this season.\u201dThe market chill is especially pronounced for classic cars, the luxury asset class that had the highest run-up in prices over the last 10 years (490 percent), according to the recently released 2016 Knight-Frank wealth report. The big classic car auctions held every January in Scottsdale, Ariz., were a disappointment, with total sales falling 15 percent from last year, the first decline since 2010.\u201cPrices are dropping relative to last year,\u201d said Eric Minoff, a car specialist at Bonhams who was in Florida this week for the Amelia Island car auctions. \u201cYou can\u2019t have 20 percent appreciation every year. But if you bought in 2008, you\u2019re still far ahead.\u201dHagerty, which insures and appraises vintage autos, said its North American index of the collector car market had its biggest month-over-month drop in February since the depths of the financial crisis in 2009.Even worse is the once-thriving market for high-end antiques. Prices have dropped for 10 consecutive years, a result of changing tastes and a shift toward midcentury modern and contemporary furniture.It appears the ultrarich are as vulnerable to the laws of supply and demand as everyone else. Despite auction catalog copy that stresses adjectives like \u201crare,\u201d \u201cunique\u201d and \u201cirreplaceable,\u201d the supply of luxury assets for sale has surged as prices have climbed into the stratosphere, driving down prices.On or near 57th Street, where developers are vying to build the world\u2019s tallest residential apartment building, five major towers are in various stages of construction. \u201cNow that all these towers are visible, and not just holes in the ground, people are realizing that there\u2019s a lot of this kind of product coming on the market,\u201d Mr. Miller said.As prices surged for late-model Ferraris, fleets of them flooded onto the market. At the Bonhams February sale at the Grand Palais in Paris, six nearly identical Ferraris from the late 1980s to mid-1990s were offered; three failed to sell.\u201cThe sight of six Ferrari Testarossas, all red, lined up at one auction waiting optimistically for buyers probably summed up much of what\u2019s wrong with the recent bull market,\u201d noted Simon Kidston, founder of an advisory firm for car collectors.It also hasn\u2019t helped the psychology of luxury markets that Wall Street bonuses for 2015 dropped nearly 10 percent from the year before.Because the number of ultrawealthy buyers is so small, even a modest drop in demand can produce outsize declines. \u201cIt\u2019s generally been the case that at the extremely high end of the art market, demand is driven by about 50 to 60 people,\u201d Mr. Beard said.After five years of surging prices and buying sprees, some ultrarich people may simply be tapped out. \u201cThere are only so many billionaires out there,\u201d Mr. Miller said. \u201cEven though they rotate from place to place around the globe, at some point you have to wonder if they have enough.\u201dIt sold on Thursday for $9.375 million.Advertisement"}

The camp is on Juba\u2019s outskirts and many camp dwellers have homes less than two miles away. They fled at the outbreak of the civil war, and even now they say they will be killed if they try to return.But even after billions of aid dollars, many roads remain dirt, covered by a thin, crunchy layer of crushed plastic water bottles. Boys on motorbikes putter past smoking piles of garbage. Pickup trucks packed with soldiers careen recklessly into traffic, the young men in back angrily shaking their machine guns at anyone unfortunate enough to cross their paths.At night, shots ring out and people are killed.The government chalks up Juba\u2019s continuing violence to what it calls \u201cunknown gunmen,\u201d but there is little investigation. Most people believe the culprits are government soldiers, anyway. They just can\u2019t say that too loudly for fear that they will be next.The United Nations recorded gruesome accounts from civilians, including of women and children being hanged from trees, burned alive or shot and hacked to pieces with machetes. Churches, mosques and hospitals have come under attack, the United Nations said.Much of the bloodshed is caused by the bitter, ethnically tinged rivalry between the government, led by members of the Dinka ethnic group, and Mr. Machar\u2019s rebel alliance, made up of mostly Nuer. But some of the worst violence, such as the fighting last year that left chopped up body parts scattered across the swamps, was Nuer versus Nuer, grisly evidence of a society splintering deeper and deeper.Before the civil war broke out in December 2013, South Sudan\u2019s economy had one thing going for it: oil. But the oil fields soon became battle zones, and then the world oil price plummeted. On top of that, the oil deal South Sudan triumphantly signed with Sudan after splitting off from it in 2011 is not looking so great anymore.When it comes to oil production, the two Sudans are hopelessly linked. The south is home to the biggest reserves; the north has the pipelines to export it.Instead of splitting profits, South Sudan agreed to pay Sudan a flat fee for every barrel pumped through the northern pipeline. That transit fee, along with some other debt South Sudan has to repay to Sudan, amounts to around $25 a barrel. But with the global oil price hovering around $40 a barrel, South Sudan is now steadily draining its most precious resource for very little in return.But it has few options. Nearly all of the government\u2019s revenue is generated by oil, and at a time like this, the government can\u2019t afford not to pay its soldiers.Before South Sudan became independent, Sudan\u2019s leaders tried everything in their power to prevent the south from breaking off. Oppression. Neglect. A vicious civil war, characterized by scorched villages and slave raids. When it became clear by the early 2000s that it could not win, Khartoum, Sudan\u2019s capital, appealed to the court of world opinion, trying to persuade Western powers that the south was too poor, too uneducated and too divided to govern itself.Sadly, many observers say, the chaos that has broken out in South Sudan since independence is very similar to what the northerners had been warning about all along. More than half a dozen cease-fires have been shattered. Though Mr. Machar has agreed to return as vice president, he has yet to do so, citing security concerns. Many people believe he is just stalling.At the same time, South Sudan\u2019s president, Salva Kiir, seems to be losing control.Dressed in dark suits with his signature black cowboy hat (a gift from President George W. Bush), he is known as a decent and religious man but also as a bit of an enigma.\u201cIt\u2019s very difficult to pin down the personality of Kiir,\u201d said James Solomon Padiet, a professor at Juba University. \u201cMost of his decisions depend on who influences him at the moment he makes it.\u201dHe said that Mr. Kiir had urged his generals to respect human rights but that when government troops committed atrocities, as they have over and over again, Mr. Kiir did not punish anyone.\u201cHe says: \u2018It\u2019s on you. God will punish you,\u2019\u00a0\u201d Mr. Padiet said.Mr. Kiir also needs each and every one of those generals to stay in power, the professor added.On a recent day, the waiting rooms outside Mr. Kiir\u2019s office were crammed with high-ranking officials and other people hoping to meet with him, but he did not show up to work.Juba is incredibly uncomfortable these days, with temperatures soaring into the triple digits and the air thick and sticky. People along the road hide under mango trees or in the shallow shadows cast by parked trucks, desperate for shade.These are the last days of dizzying heat before the spring rains hit and shut down many roads. Aid organizations are racing to position emergency food for the nearly three million South Sudanese edging toward starvation.\u201cThere\u2019s massive access constraints, roadblocks everywhere, widespread extortion,\u201d said Jonathan Veitch, head of Unicef\u2019s South Sudan office. He said aid trucks had to run a gantlet of 56 armed checkpoints to deliver food to Bentiu, a conflict-hit area.\u201cIt costs $2,000 in bribes,\u201d he said. \u201cPer truck!\u201dAid organizations are begging for more money, but donors seem to be getting tired.The well-worn narrative of helpless, starving South Sudanese \u201cwildly oversimplifies\u201d the reality, he said.\u201cThe real story,\u201d he said, \u201cis one of a falling out among kleptocratic thieves, whose self-enrichment free-for-all before and after independence led competing factions to use ethnicity as a mobilizer, which is the equivalent of aiming a flamethrower at an oil rig.\u201dIn Juba\u2019s displaced persons camp, people have little to do except mourn their losses \u2014 the loss of family, the loss of homes, the loss of freedom, the loss of hope.Mr. Tut recently graduated from a business program. His books \u2014 \u201cPublic Administration,\u201d an English grammar book and the Chinua Achebe novel \u201cNo Longer at Ease\u201d \u2014 lie in a dusty stack on the dirt floor.He said his best friend at university was a Dinka.\u201cWe still talk on the phone sometimes,\u201d he said, his voice trailing off. \u201cBut I haven\u2019t seen him for months.\u201dNick Cumming-Bruce contributed reporting from Geneva.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Saudi Arabia Cuts Billions in Aid to Lebanon, Opening Door for Iran", "Date": "2016-03-02", "News": "Supported byBEIRUT, Lebanon \u2014 Even as Iran and Saudi Arabia supported opposite sides in a bitter and bloody proxy war in Syria, the two adversaries managed to preserve a tense calm just over the border in Lebanon, where they have long competed for influence.Now, suddenly, it looks as if Saudi Arabia is walking away \u2014 leaving Lebanon perhaps more firmly than ever in the grip of Hezbollah and its patron, Iran.Suddenly, this sliver of a nation, long beloved by Saudis for its night life, beaches and mountains, is once again thrust into the middle of the battle for regional dominance between Shiite Iran and Sunni Saudi Arabia. The consequences could be enormous for a nation that barely survived its own civil war, borders Israel, hosts well over a million Syrian refugees and relies on a shaky power-sharing arrangement between sects for its own stability.So it was surprising that in Lebanon, rather than once again taking the fight to Iran, the kingdom has taken a step back \u2014 a move that risks increasing Iran\u2019s influence and fragmenting its Sunni rivals. It is a tactic that virtually no one here thinks has any chance of actually coercing Lebanon to constrain Hezbollah, a Shiite group.\u201cThey just went crazy,\u201d he said.The move by Riyadh threatens not only to reshape the politics of the region, but to undermine this tiny nation\u2019s fitful economy and delicate political balance. Already, the tensions have boiled over in small ways: After a television station broadcast a spoof ridiculing Hassan Nasrallah, Hezbollah\u2019s leader, the group\u2019s supporters blocked roads and burned tires on Saturday night, setting off brief confrontations in the streets with rival groups.Diplomats and analysts have spent several weeks trying to understand why the Saudis would precipitously start penalizing Lebanon \u2014 and perhaps their own Lebanese allies \u2014 over the powerful influence of Hezbollah, which is nothing new.Even politicians in the Saudi camp say that the kingdom\u2019s moves have put Lebanon in an impossible position. The Shiite group\u2019s forces are more powerful than the Lebanese military and act autonomously, most notably carrying out a major ground operation in Syria that has helped keep Mr. Assad in power.Political figures on all sides point out that what Saudi Arabia has demanded from Lebanon \u2014 condemning Iran and Hezbollah, for example \u2014 is unrealistic.\u201cIf some think that Hezbollah will pull out from Syria due to some Arab stances,\u201d Walid Jumblatt, the Druse leader who lately has been allied with the pro-Saudi Future Movement, told Orient TV, a Syrian opposition news outlet, \u201cwell, they won\u2019t withdraw.\u201dNot even the Future Movement, the Lebanese party closest to Saudi Arabia, could bring itself to call Hezbollah a terrorist group \u2014 rather declaring on Wednesday that Hezbollah was involved in \u201cterrorist activities.\u201dTensions between Saudi Arabia and Iran, and their allies in Lebanon and throughout the region, have been increasing since the start of the conflict in Syria, which is in its fifth year. Those tensions have risen further since King Salman rose to the Saudi throne last year and pursued a more assertive foreign policy, including the war in Yemen.In January, at meetings of the Arab League and the Organization of Islamic Cooperation, Saudi Arabia sought formal condemnations not only of the embassy attacks but also of Iran\u2019s and Hezbollah\u2019s roles in the region. Lebanon did not sign on.The country\u2019s foreign minister, Gebran Bassil \u2014 who leads the Free Patriotic Movement, a Christian party aligned with Hezbollah \u2014 declared that Lebanon stood \u201cin solidarity\u201d with Saudi Arabia over the embassy attacks. But signing on to the statement, he said, would violate Lebanon\u2019s policy of disassociation, or official neutrality, on the Syrian conflict.Saudi Arabia\u2019s main Sunni ally in Lebanon, the Future Movement led by Saad Hariri, criticized Mr. Bassil, saying that his stance did not represent Lebanon.Finger-pointing ensued among Lebanon\u2019s political factions, whose stalemate over Syria and conflicts on other issues has kept the country without a president for more than a year.Next, Riyadh declared it was canceling $4 billion in aid pledged to Lebanon, $3 billion of which was earmarked for the Lebanese Army. The aid had been offered in a bid to bolster the army and make it more able to hold its own and operate independently from Hezbollah.The kingdom and its allies suggested that the decision was based on what it saw as undue influence from Hezbollah in foreign policy, as well as security concerns after several Arab governments in the Persian Gulf said they had uncovered Hezbollah cells in their countries.Ghattas Khoury, a Lebanese former Parliament member speaking for Mr. Hariri\u2019s camp, said the kingdom\u2019s Lebanese allies understood its position but would lobby the Saudis to change their minds.\u201cThe Lebanese Army is essential for us,\u201d he said.Last week, Saudi Arabia \u2014 and four of its five allies in the Gulf Cooperation Council \u2014 declared Lebanon unsafe for their citizens, although there has been no discernible shift in the security situation.Those moves may have little concrete effect: The $3 billion in arms had yet to be delivered and Saudi and other tourists have already largely abandoned Lebanon during the Syrian war.But Saudi Arabia and its gulf allies have other leverage: They could also throw out the half-million Lebanese who work in the gulf, a major economic lifeline for the country.Employees of his party\u2019s news media say their pay has become irregular. And the party is short of cash ahead of municipal elections this spring, when they could lose ground to Hezbollah and other rivals without funds to mobilize voters.Asked to explain the decline in Saudi support, several diplomats and analysts said that Lebanon was taking a back seat to Yemen, Syria and other conflicts.\u201cIt\u2019s just not a priority anymore,\u201d one diplomat said.Hwaida Saad contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Xi Jinping\u2019s Remedy for China\u2019s Economic Gloom Has Echoes of Reaganomics", "Date": "2016-03-03", "News": "Supported byThe new slogan, expected to receive top billing when China\u2019s legislature convenes Saturday, represents an effort to rejuvenate Mr. Xi\u2019s faltering plans to overhaul the Chinese economy. But he still faces widespread skepticism that he is committed to thorough restructuring, which would require reducing bloated state enterprises, along with millions of jobs.The supply side Mr. Xi is referring to would, like Reaganomics, include lowering taxes and reducing the government burden on investors. Yet its main goal appears to be shutting or paring down mines and factories that produce far more coal, steel, cement and other industrial products than the market demands and reining in the credit and subsidies that feed that glut.Some economists say the supply-side rubric is at least a step toward painful measures that could lead to healthier growth.Mr. Xi has reorganized China\u2019s military and orchestrated a scorching campaign against corruption. But breakthroughs in the economy have eluded him, which many economists say have sapped business confidence.On Wednesday, Moody\u2019s Investors Service, the credit ratings agency, lowered its outlook for China from stable to negative, citing \u201cuncertainty about the authorities\u2019 capacity to implement reforms.\u201dSkeptics attribute the problem partly to the repeated clash of Mr. Xi\u2019s economic goals with his political objectives. While he has shown great enterprise in centralizing power, they say, he has been reluctant to restrain the reach of the state, especially to curtail state companies\u2019 privileged, often monopolistic, access to loans, resources and customers.Several economists said Mr. Xi\u2019s supply-side initiative may turn out to be cosmetic \u2014 promising market liberalization yet magnifying state control.China\u2019s economy is faltering, prompting concerns that are now shaking global stock markets.Many liberal economists remain unconvinced that for all the tough talk, the Chinese government would willingly reduce its own power and risk a backlash from displaced workers. Recalibrating state-supported industries to true market levels would mean cutting millions of jobs.Mr. Xi first laid out a sweeping blueprint for economic rejuvenation, including vows to revamp the state sector and nurture market forces, in 2013. But the halting progress reflected his reluctance to cede state control, several economists said.The mixed signals have paralyzed state officials, who are unsure how far to impose cuts while preserving stability.How far Mr. Xi is willing to go, given the economic warning sirens, may become clearer after the Communist Party leadership presents its economic plans to the legislature, the National People\u2019s Congress.It could also be difficult if they do.But if the slowing of the economy is forcing Mr. Xi to act, it has also increased the costs of doing so.During the first wave of closings of state-owned factories, starting in 1997, more than 30 million jobs were eliminated in less than a decade. But the Chinese economy boomed, especially after China joined the World Trade Organization in 2001, creating jobs that absorbed many of the excess workers.The job losses envisioned today, while smaller, may be more contentious when the economy is slowing. They threaten to erode the stability Mr. Xi prizes.Since the financial crisis of 2008, the government has spent heavily to stimulate the economy, increasing the debt. Chinese supply-siders say such splurging has reached unsustainable levels.Beyond correcting such distortions, debate remains over what specific policies fall under the supply-side banner. Officials and economists have called for tax cuts for private businesses and giving private investors bigger stakes in more state-owned companies, while ruling out full privatization.But the concept is vague enough that it has also been used to argue for a greater government role to promote exports and prop up faltering state firms.\u201cIf there\u2019s no sign of a solution, this year could be especially dangerous,\u201d he said. \u201cWithout reforms, there\u2019ll be big problems.\u201dAnd supply-side structural reform would be just another slogan.Because of an editing error, an earlier version of a picture caption with this article misstated the name of a Chinese city that is home to a coal-fired power plant. It is Shanxi, not Shaxi.An article on March 4 about President Xi Jinping\u2019s remedy for China\u2019s economic gloom, which has echoes of Reaganomics, misstated part of the name of an American credit-rating agency that lowered its outlook for China from stable to negative earlier that week. It is Moody\u2019s Investors Service (not Investor). Although the error was corrected online shortly after publication, editors failed to follow through with this print correction.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Plan to Rescue Puerto Rico Advances, Led by House Republicans", "Date": "2016-03-24", "News": "Supported byPoliticians in Washington are coalescing around a financial plan to rescue Puerto Rico, just weeks before an expected major default on bond payments that would spread more turmoil through the island\u2019s shaky economy.The plan, being drafted as legislation by House Republicans, would not grant Puerto Rico\u2019s most fervent request: permission to restructure its entire $72 billion debt in bankruptcy. It would, however, give the island certain crucial tools that bankruptcy proceedings can offer \u2014 but only if it first comes under close federal oversight and meets other conditions.The oversight would be provided by a five-member voting board, selected by the president of the United States from candidates with expertise in finance, law or other relevant fields; at least two would have their primary residence in Puerto Rico. The secretary of the Treasury and the governor of Puerto Rico would also serve on the board, but would not have a vote.The board would have offices both in Washington and San Juan, and would have the power to subpoena documents from both governments. It would audit Puerto Rico\u2019s government, improve operations, find savings and ultimately determine how much of the $72 billion debt really has to be restructured, if any. The creation of such a board has been highly controversial on the island, where some residents and officials have called it an act of \u201ccolonialism,\u201d and expressed some concern about outsiders making financial decisions \u2014 like budget cuts \u2014 that could adversely affect island residents.The rescue package is primarily the work of House Republicans under the direction of Paul Ryan, the House speaker, in consultation with the Treasury Department and Democratic leaders, including Representative Nancy Pelosi, the minority leader.Like Puerto Rico, the Treasury Department has been calling for all of the island\u2019s debts to be eligible for restructuring, no matter which part of the government issued them.But while the House Republicans drafting the rescue package have worked closely with Treasury, they remain skeptical of Puerto Rico\u2019s financial disclosures and want the oversight board to first audit each unit of government, allowing restructurings only \u201cin certain areas\u201d and \u201cwhere necessary,\u201d according to a legislative summary reviewed by The New York Times.The plan would also require Puerto Rico to provide fair-value measurements of all pension assets and liabilities, instead of the numbers now provided by actuaries, which tend to understate the amounts promised. Puerto Rico currently reports a pension shortfall of around $43 billion, but at fair value the shortfall could be twice that amount or even more. Telling the truth about the cost of its pension plan would make it harder for Puerto Rico to mismanage the plan in the future.The Treasury had recommended that Puerto Rico give pension payments to retired government workers priority over payments to bondholders, but lawmakers rejected that approach.Rearranging the existing payment priorities \u201cwould have serious consequences on the broader municipal bond market and existing creditor-to-debtor relationships,\u201d the summary said.Before any restructuring of its debt, most it in the form of municipal bonds, the government would first be required to seek a consensual settlement in mediation. It would also have to issue up-to-date audited financial statements and balance its budget; Puerto Rico\u2019s debt grew to its current crushing size because for years it took out new long-term debt just to get enough cash to get through the year.If Puerto Rican officials are unable to make the budget balance with existing resources, the oversight board would have the power to do it for them \u2014 which could mean cuts in services.On the other hand, House Republicans agreed with the Treasury that any restructuring would best take place outside of bankruptcy. Giving Puerto Rico access to the bankruptcy courts threatened to become a constitutional minefield. Instead of working through the bankruptcy code, the lawmakers devised a restructuring framework under the Territorial Clause of the United States Constitution, which gives Congress broad authority to write \u201call needful rules and regulations\u201d for territories.The legislative summary states that giving Puerto Rico access to Chapter 9 \u201cis ill conceived and would undermine the rule of law.\u201dMuch of the rescue package has been drafted in the House Natural Resources Committee under its chairman, Rob Bishop of Utah. It jumped into action after Mr. Ryan set the March deadline back in December, instructing the committees with jurisdiction \u201cto come up with a responsible solution\u201d by then.If the lawmakers stay on schedule \u2014 a \u201cdiscussion draft\u201d is to be made public Tuesday \u2014 the rescue package could be the first substantial piece of legislation to get traction in the House since Mr. Ryan was elected speaker in October, promising to rejuvenate the legislative process by giving the committees the lead in drafting all major bills.\u201cOpen the process,\u201d Mr. Ryan said at the time. \u201cLet people participate, and they might change their tune. A neglected minority will gum up the works. A respected minority will work in good faith.\u201dAlthough the Natural Resources Committee might seem an odd place to resolve an offshore financial collapse, the committee has jurisdiction over America\u2019s territories, which include Puerto Rico.The top-ranked Democrat on the committee, Raul Grijalva of Arizona, yielded his position in hearings to Puerto Rico\u2019s nonvoting member of Congress, Pedro Pierluisi, also a Democrat, to give someone from the island a central role.A number of representatives, all Democrats, who are not members of the committee also took part because they have close ties to Puerto Rico. Several of them have said they thought the Republicans were negotiating in good faith, although they had not yet seen the draft of the bill.A court-supervised restructuring would offer Puerto Rico some of the legal tools that bankruptcy makes available. The plan, for example, would hold off creditor lawsuits while the restructuring is underway, a central feature of bankruptcy court.Chapter 9 is the part of the bankruptcy code for insolvent governments. Currently, the code specifically bars Puerto Rico from seeking any relief under Chapter 9, and the governor and other officials have been calling for an amendment to change that.On Tuesday, Puerto Rico went before the Supreme Court seeking the right to enact its own version of a bankruptcy law. Justices were aggressive in their questioning but seemed perplexed about why Congress \u2014 in 1984 \u2014 denied the island bankruptcy protection.The Natural Resources committee also has taken an interest in Puerto Rico\u2019s big electric power authority, which is responsible for about $9 billion of the island\u2019s total debt. It appears to be insolvent and is embroiled in a scandal over improprieties in its purchases of fuel oil, its biggest expense.A summary of the rescue plan cites power costs as one reason people and businesses have been leaving Puerto Rico.An earlier version of this article misidentified the state represented by Rob Bishop, chairman of the House Natural Resources Committee. It is Utah, not Colorado.An article on Friday about a congressional plan to address Puerto Rico\u2019s financial crisis misstated, in some copies, when the island made its case to the Supreme Court. It was on Tuesday, not last week.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "John Kasich Boasts of Ohio Recovery, but Reality Is More Nuanced", "Date": "2016-03-13", "News": "Supported byFive years later, he says he has turned Ohio around. That story is a cornerstone of his bid for president, as he tells voters he can bring his Ohio success story to the rest of the country. \u201cLet\u2019s take some Ohio to Washington to help the entire United States of America,\u201d Mr. Kasich said at a cavernous auto glass plant near Dayton on Friday.Ohio has indeed gained several hundred thousand jobs since Mr. Kasich took office, and he turned an imposing budget gap into a surplus while also cutting income taxes, all accomplishments that back up his boasts.Mr. Kasich, a former congressman, took office in January 2011, on the heels of the Great Recession. The state had lost about 350,000 private-sector jobs during the administration of the Democrat whom he defeated, Ted Strickland. \u201cWhen I wake up every morning,\u201d Mr. Kasich said in his inaugural address, \u201cI\u2019ll say my prayers, I\u2019ll hug my family, and I will focus on Ohio\u2019s economy.\u201dMr. Kasich\u2019s campaign emphasizes his experience dealing with fiscal issues, including his time as the chairman of the House Budget Committee, and his town-hall-style meetings often feature a debt clock as a prop.As he campaigns, he likes to talk about taking an $8 billion shortfall in Ohio and turning it into a $2 billion surplus. The surplus he refers to is Ohio\u2019s rainy day fund, which held all of 89 cents when Mr. Kasich came into office. After deposits made during Mr. Kasich\u2019s time as governor, the fund now has just over $2 billion. \u201cOhio, at a certain part in the downturn, effectively had no reserves,\u201d said Nick Samuels, a vice president at Moody\u2019s Investors Service. \u201cNow they\u2019ve rebuilt them to quite strong levels. That takes some action by state leaders to actually do.\u201dAccording to the Associated Press, Donald J. Trump and Hillary Clinton have each won enough delegates to claim their party\u2019s nomination for president.But Mr. Kasich\u2019s budgeting decisions were not without consequences, with his cutbacks in aid to local governments forcing spending cuts and tax increases in communities..Parma, a Cleveland suburb of 80,000, has lost more than $3.7 million, according to the analysis. To make its budget work, Parma closed swimming pools, held off buying police cars and instituted a $12-per-month garbage fee, said its mayor, Timothy J. DeGeeter, a Democrat. Lorain, which has 64,000 residents and was found by the analysis to have lost more than $2.9 million, raised its income tax and has left positions unfilled.\u201cThere are buzzwords that people like to hear: \u2018I balanced the budget,\u2019 \u2018I cut state income taxes,\u2019 \u201c its mayor, Chase Ritenauer, a Democrat, said. \u201cIt all sounds good until you get into the communities and you see how much they\u2019re suffering.\u201d He said the cuts to local communities were unnecessarily steep, especially given the sum of money that is now in the state\u2019s rainy day fund. \u201cYou have a broken arm,\u201d he said. \u201cHow do you fix the broken arm? You put it in a cast. Instead of putting it in the cast, the governor got the machete out and cut the arm off.\u201dTimothy S. Keen, Mr. Kasich\u2019s budget director, said that when Mr. Kasich drew up his spending plan, \u201cA lot of hard choices had to be made.\u201d He added that for most local governments, the reduction in state aid amounted to only a small portion of their budget, and that the cuts were \u201csomething that they should be able to manage.\u201dBut Mr. Hederman, from the right-leaning Buckeye Institute, said Mr. Kasich had made considerable progress given Ohio\u2019s challenges as a state that relied heavily on manufacturing.\u201cBy Ohio standards, Governor Kasich has a good economic record,\u201d he said. \u201cThe key phrase is \u2018by Ohio standards.\u2019 \u201dAdvertisement"}

Her family lived in public housing here for several years and sometimes relied on assistance from Catholic Charities. She has spent the past 33 years working for the Hillsborough County School District.Yet Mrs. Linsky is also quick to acknowledge a long list of racial fears and resentments that she says help explain why she is drawn to Mr. Trump: She is furious at undocumented workers who \u201ccome basically to see what they can get.\u201d She is wary of Muslim Americans imposing their religion on communities in the United States. She is fearful of more American jobs being outsourced to China, India or Mexico. She even suspects President Obama \u201chas a dislike for white folks.\u201d\u201cWe\u2019re not taking care of our own,\u201d she said.But here in Tampa, in the week before the pivotal Florida primary, conversations with more than 20 volunteers showing up to make campaign calls or otherwise help out at a small Trump campaign office in an old cigar factory yielded some surprises on the subjects of race, ethnicity and bigotry.For a campaign frequently depicted as offering a rallying point for the white working class, the people volunteering to help Mr. Trump here are noteworthy for their ethnic diversity. They include a young woman who recently arrived from Peru; an immigrant from the Philippines; a 70-year-old Lakota Indian; a teenage son of Russian immigrants; a Mexican-American.Yet like Mrs. Linsky, many spoke openly about how fears centered on race and ethnicity were at the heart of their support for Mr. Trump. To a large extent, they traced those fears to the scars they still bear from the Great Recession \u2014 lost jobs, drained 401(k)\u2019s, home foreclosures, rising debt, the feeling that the country is broken.According to the Associated Press, Donald J. Trump and Hillary Clinton have each won enough delegates to claim their party\u2019s nomination for president.More than anything, several Trump volunteers here said, the Great Recession exposed a corrupt, out-of-touch ruling class in Washington that allows big corporations to outsource jobs at will while doing nothing to address millions of illegal immigrants who compete for jobs and drain government coffers. In Mr. Trump, they say, they see a potential antidote to all of this. A man too wealthy to be bought or co-opted. A man with the blunt-force clarity to declare that he is ready to Make America Great Again.\u201cI think we\u2019ve come to the conclusion that our country is falling apart, and we have to take care of it,\u201d Mrs. Linsky said.It would be hard to imagine more politically unfriendly turf for a Trump campaign office than the old Garcia and Vega cigar factory on Armenia Avenue. The factory looms over West Tampa, a Democratic stronghold long dominated by Latinos, especially Cuban-Americans. Today, the factory has been converted into space for start-ups. The campaign rents a small room on the second floor and uses a common area for its phone banks.Early on Wednesday afternoon, Bob Peele, 62, pulled up to the back of the cigar factory in a pickup truck overflowing with Trump campaign signs. Mr. Peele, burly and bearded, wearing a Harley-Davidson hat and a T-shirt depicting a bald eagle, began unloading signs.Just then, Annette Lux, 62, and Sharon Wollen, 70, pulled up in a small Chevy. They had driven nearly 20 miles from their senior community in Valrico in hopes of getting a sign, a T-shirt, a bumper sticker \u2014 anything to show support for Mr. Trump. Through the car window, Mrs. Lux, a lifelong Democrat, launched into a tirade against Hillary Clinton, accusing her of always pandering to African-American or Hispanic voters. \u201cWhen do you ever say you need the white person\u2019s vote?\u201d she called out to Mr. Peele. She quickly added, \u201cI\u2019m not racist or anything.\u201dThe women got out of the car and headed to the Trump campaign office. Mrs. Lux, walking with a cane, and Mrs. Wollen, tiny and frail, explained that everywhere they looked, they saw evidence of a diminished nation, one so hobbled it cannot give decent health care to many veterans. \u201cThey even got rid of our space program,\u201d Mrs. Lux said.Their circumstances have been diminished, too. Mrs. Lux ekes out a living at a check-cashing store; Mrs. Wollen lost her state job working for Florida\u2019s toll system. \u201cNow I\u2019m working retail, and I\u2019m starving,\u201d she said.In Mr. Trump, they see someone at last willing to acknowledge the needs of the white working class. \u201cI feel that we\u2019re getting left out,\u201d Mrs. Lux said. \u201cThere\u2019s more than Black Lives Matter. What about us?\u201dMr. Peele was still unloading signs when Marcos Quevedo pulled up. He, too, wanted a Trump sign. Mr. Quevedo, 45, is the president of Sleepdreams Diagnostics, which also has office space in the cigar factory. The aftermath of the Great Recession cost Mr. Quevedo his managerial position with a sleep diagnosis company and contributed to the collapse of his marriage. \u201cCorporate America got a little ruthless,\u201d is how he puts it.Mr. Quevedo, a registered Democrat who was raised in West Tampa by parents who fled Cuba, says he is troubled by what he sees as thuggishness and racially charged language at Trump campaign rallies. But such is his frustration with both parties, and his desperation to shake up Washington, that he is willing to overlook the ugliness. \u201cI\u2019m turning my cheek to the David Duke comments,\u201d he said.That evening, Trump volunteers began arriving for several hours of phone banking.Deloris Owens, 49, is one of the first to arrive. This is the first time she has volunteered for a political campaign. After 2008 she was laid off by Verizon, where she had worked as a call center supervisor. Then she and her husband lost their home in Brandon to foreclosure, as did many of their neighbors. Mrs. Owens, who describes herself as \u201cin the middle\u201d politically, said she voted for Mr. Obama in 2012.Emma Aquino, 51, arrives moments later with her own tale of 2008 woe. Her home in Utah, she said, lost 50 percent of its value, and when an accident left her unable to work, she risked losing the house altogether. The most her bank would do was reduce her interest rate, but only at the cost of extending her mortgage to 40 years from 20.To her, the mortgage meltdown perfectly encapsulates what she views as the corrupt bargain that rules the nation\u2019s capital \u2014 politicians from both parties getting in bed with big corporations and their lobbyists to rig the game against average Americans. \u201cThe banks,\u201d she says, her voice rising with indignation. \u201cThe government supported the banks.\u201dAs Mrs. Aquino talks about what she loves about Mr. Trump \u2014 how \u201che\u2019s against lobbyists\u201d and how he\u2019s \u201cnot influenced by big corporations\u201d \u2014 at first it sounds as if she might be talking about Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont. But then she begins talking about a scourge of illegal immigrants. Mrs. Aquino stresses that when she arrived from the Philippines, she followed every rule, paid every fee. \u201cI went through the process,\u201d she said. She learned English, became a citizen and worked to \u201ccreate my own American dream.\u201dHours later, with the evening\u2019s phone banking session over, the Trumpites trickle off into the warm Tampa evening. Among the last to leave are Andrew and Juliana Cherry, both 35, who together operate a small real estate firm in Clearwater Beach. Mrs. Cherry, who came to the United States a few years ago from Peru, still struggles with English, though she spends hours each day defending Mr. Trump on Twitter. Mr. Cherry describes himself as a political pragmatist who will vote for Mrs. Clinton if the Republican establishment denies Mr. Trump the nomination.Before 2008, Mr. Cherry made his living flipping property in Florida, in part using lessons he learned by taking a course from Trump University. The Great Recession wiped Mr. Cherry out. \u201cI ended up owing more than $1 million,\u201d he said. He wound up homeless, sleeping on his office couch for six months.The Cherrys, though quick to condemn all forms of racism, say Mr. Trump is fundamentally correct when he promises to refocus the federal government\u2019s priorities on Americans\u2019 needs.\u201cIf Trump doesn\u2019t make the economy better,\u201d Mr. Cherry said, \u201cwe\u2019ll fire him in four years.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Ex-Professor Upsets Ukraine Politics, and Russia Peace Accord", "Date": "2016-03-18", "News": "Supported byThe Saturday ProfileKIEV, Ukraine \u2014 WHEN she moved into her office as deputy speaker of Parliament a little over a year ago, Oksana I. Syroyid hung a large oil painting called \u201cThe Edge of the Sky Is Glowing.\u201d It shows a man turning his back on the viewer while flames burn on the horizon.A 39-year-old native of the Lviv region in the country\u2019s nationalist west, Ms. Syroyid talks boldly about Ukraine acting in its own interests, not those of outside powers. \u201cWe need to stop thinking of how to counter Putin, or how to please all our partners,\u201d she said in a recent interview.The question many here ask is whether Ms. Syroyid, a relative newcomer, can somehow master the byzantine structure of Ukrainian politics and emerge as the one to lead the country out of the morass of corruption and government dysfunction that threatens its future. Or, is she just another in a line of ambitious upstarts causing Western governments their latest headache in Ukraine and, possibly, taking the country down with her?One thing is certain: She is not afraid to take a stand.Last month, she pulled the Self-Reliance party out of the ruling coalition, inviting new parliamentary elections despite strong feelings in Brussels and Washington that Ukraine is too unstable to go through another round of voting.\u201cWe have to be ourselves,\u201d she said in a recent interview. \u201cAnd only if we are good at that will we have partners and friends.\u201dA BOOKISH, bespectacled expert on the Ukrainian Constitution, Ms. Syroyid put away her professorial turtlenecks when she entered politics and now dresses to the nines, saying she is taking a cue from Ms. Tymoshenko, the braided, crusading pioneer of female politicians in this patriarchal country.\u201cShe definitely is the brightest person in Ukrainian politics, and not only among women,\u201d said Ms. Syroyid, who earned a law degree in Canada. \u201cShe is very stylish, and has a very feminine look. At the same time she is known for her tough decisions.\u201dNone have been tougher than Parliament\u2019s de facto rejection of Minsk II, which takes its name from the capital of Belarus where President Petro O. Poroshenko and Russia\u2019s president, Vladimir V. Putin, signed it, with French and German mediation.Ms. Syroyid, who entered Parliament in 2014, has emerged as the face of this rejection, unabashedly rallying her fellow members of Parliament to stand fast against Western pressure. While politicians in Russia and Ukraine have taken turns blaming one another for stalling the implementation of Minsk II, Ms. Syroyid has proudly taken credit.After visiting Ms. Syroyid last month, and again hearing she would not budge, Germany\u2019s foreign minister, Frank-Walter Steinmeier, said this week that the credibility of the Minsk process was threatened. \u201cBoth sides need to perform,\u201d he said.Under paragraph 11 of the accord, Ukraine was supposed to adopt the constitutional amendment by the end of last year, but did not, as Ms. Syroyid worked tirelessly to dissuade her colleagues from voting for it.The change, Ms. Syroyid said, would allow the Kremlin to regain a foothold in Ukrainian politics by requiring the central government to recognize, and integrate, the Russian-backed leadership in the east. It would, for example, allow the rebel leadership, with a track record of holding sham elections, to fill 14 vacant parliamentary seats in Kiev. Until Russian soldiers leave the Donbas region, she says, Ukraine should refuse any integration and call it an occupied territory.\u201cRussia wants to destabilize Ukraine,\u201d she said. \u201cThis paragraph 11 of the Minsk agreement is an instrument just like the war. This is not for the sake of resolution of the conflict; it is for the sake of destabilizing Ukraine.\u201dPassage of the amendment requires a supermajority of 300 of Parliament\u2019s 450 members, an all-but-impossible vote now that Ms. Syroyid has unified the country\u2019s nationalist parties against the measure.To her critics, the obstinacy of Ms. Syroyid and her like-minded supporters in Parliament is mind-bogglingly irresponsible, the tantrum at the children\u2019s table after the adults of European statesmanship had prepared a healthy settlement.\u201cThis position stems from pure populism,\u201d Oleh Voloshyn, a consultant for the Opposition Bloc political party, said of her tactics.He said Ukraine had to face the reality that it was in the weakest possible position, having lost the war to Russia and surviving on a financial lifeline from the International Monetary Fund. \u201cThere are two options: You win the war, or you lose the war. And when you lose the war, you have to negotiate. That is the problem. You don\u2019t have any other alternative.\u201dSUPPORTERS say Ms. Syroyid has the backing of Ukrainian voters, whose anger at Mr. Putin is often evident. Any rejection of his demands is likely to win the voters\u2019 favor. Besides, they say, Mr. Putin needs a peace agreement now more than ever, to get the West to lift economic sanctions that are hurting his energy-dependent economy.\u201cIt\u2019s a difficult process not because of Syroyid per se, but because the Ukrainian public doesn\u2019t accept it,\u201d said Tymofiy S. Mylovanov, the president of the Kiev School of Economics. \u201cThe price is too high.\u201dMr. Poroshenko agreed to the terms as Russian Army units and Russian-backed rebels were closing in on a Ukrainian force of about 5,000 soldiers cut off from resupply in Debaltseve, a town in eastern Ukraine.In the talks mediated by Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany and President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande of France, the soldiers\u2019 lives were weighed against the cost of longer-term political concessions, some of which required passage in Parliament.The government has said 179 soldiers died in the battle, 81 went missing and 110 were captured, and Ms. Syroyid says Ukraine is on the moral high ground today in stalling on the political demands.Ms. Syroyid advocates abandoning the Minsk deal and declaring rebel zones occupied territory, for Russia to finance and feed, without a chance for integration until the Russian Army leaves.\u201cThis is not a victory; it is just common sense,\u201d she said.It was not easy, she said, finding a voice as a woman in Europe\u2019s gravest military crisis in a decade. The ambassadors of the United States, Germany and France all pleaded for her to carry out the accord, lest war begin again.\u201cMen by definition are treated as the appropriate specialists, but a woman has to prove herself as a super-specialist, just to be treated as a normal specialist,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I knew all that before I came to Parliament.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Obama\u2019s Long Game for Cubans\u2019 Rights", "Date": "2016-03-02", "News": "Supported byOp-Ed ContributorWASHINGTON \u2014 President Obama\u2019s announcement that he will visit Cuba this month has prompted a new round of criticism from opponents of normalizing relations. Their complaint: that the administration\u2019s opening to Cuba has yet to yield any tangible progress on human rights.Election year hyperbole aside, this argument sounds compelling because it appeals to core American values of democracy and human rights. But the critics have it backward: Mr. Obama has not given up on human rights in order to pursue normalization; he is pursuing normalization as a path to improving human rights. Nor is this a particularly new or exotic strategy; it\u2019s been American policy toward China since President Richard Nixon\u2019s trip to Beijing in 1972.As President Obama said when he announced the opening to Cuba on Dec. 17, 2014, he chose engagement because the old policy of trying to coerce concessions from Havana had failed. If anything, it made things worse by giving the Cuban government a convenient enemy to blame for its problems and a ready excuse to suppress dissent.Mr. Obama\u2019s visit is an opportunity to strengthen diplomatic and commercial ties, and to directly raise the issue of human rights both publicly and privately. He plans to meet with a broad range of civil society leaders and with a group of dissidents, as Secretary of State John Kerry did on a visit last August. In his public address, President Obama will undoubtedly speak with eloquence about the virtues of democracy and human rights, as former President Jimmy Carter did on his 2002 trip.In short, human rights has never been off the agenda of Mr. Obama\u2019s Cuba policy, but experience has taught him that making imperious demands and issuing ultimatums did nothing to advance the cause. Instead, he is playing a long game, knowing that his strategy of engagement and persistent persuasion will not produce dramatic change overnight. Still, the president is gambling that his formula will create the conditions that draw Cuba inexorably toward a more open body politic and economy.All gambles are uncertain, of course. But the president is on to something: Engagement has a better chance than the policy of hostility, which has been a losing bet for more than half a century.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Argentina Reaches Deal With Hedge Funds Over Debt", "Date": "2016-02-29", "News": "Supported byArgentina has agreed to pay $4.65 billion to four hedge funds in a deal that could put an end to more than a decade of mudslinging and legal attacks that had cut the country off from global financial markets.The agreement, announced on Monday, opens the door for Argentina to attract foreign investment needed to revive its stalling economy.\u201cThis is the equivalent of a giant albatross being lifted from Argentina\u2019s neck,\u201d said Brett Diment, the head of emerging market debt at Aberdeen Asset Management. \u201cThe litigation and lack of access to international capital has had a sclerotic effect on the country for years but it was facing a real financial squeeze this year,\u201d he said.The four hedge funds, which include the billionaire Paul E. Singer\u2019s NML Capital, were the last major hedge fund investors among a group that declared legal war on Argentina in the United States courts 12 years ago.And they went to great lengths to compel Argentina to pay \u2014 at one point persuading authorities in Ghana to seize an Argentine navy ship as collateral, with a crew of about 300 on board. They also moved to impound other government assets, including a satellite.Their ultimate victory illustrates the outsize influence hedge funds can have in the countries where they bet their money. And their legal tactics are likely to be used again by other investors contesting the debt obligations of sovereign powers.The four holdout firms, including Aurelius, a hedge fund run by Mark Brodsky, a former trader at Mr. Singer\u2019s Elliott Management; Davidson Kempner; and Bracebridge Capital, have agreed not to try to prevent Argentina from raising new money, which it will need to do in order to pay the settlements it has made.The deal will also depend on whether Argentina\u2019s legislature will repeal domestic laws that prevent the government from paying holdouts. The parties agreed on a deadline of April 14 to pay the settlement.The settlement will be extremely profitable for the hedge funds. Martin M. Guzman, a postdoctoral research scholar at Columbia Business School, has estimated that NML paid $48 million for some bonds it bought in 2008 and with the deal it will receive approximately $620 million for those bonds \u2014 an annual return of about 38 percent over eight years.For Mr. Singer, who has supported Republican candidates and gay marriage, principle was as important, if not more, than profit, in pursuing a nearly 15-year fight.\u201cBy being a country that scoffs at the rule of law, they sacrifice so much,\u201d Mr. Singer said in a recent interview. NML\u2019s investments in Argentine debt and other sovereign debt represented less than 2 percent of the $26 billion in assets that his hedge fund company, Elliott Management, manages over all, he noted.A spokesman for Elliott said on Monday that the firm was \u201cpleased to have reached an agreement.\u201dPressure had been growing on the holdouts to settle with Argentina after its newly elected president, Mauricio Macri, moved quickly to settle with other bondholders. His government struck a $1.35 billion settlement with a group of Italian investors and offered to pay $6.5 billion to the group of six hedge fund holdouts in February. Two of those firms, Montreux Partners and Dart Management, accepted the proposal.\u201cThis is a giant step forward in this long-running litigation,\u201d Daniel A. Pollack, the court-appointed mediator, said on Monday, adding that Argentina\u2019s decision to settle was \u201cnothing short of heroic\u201dThe $4.65 billion represents 75 percent of the full judgments for the four hedge funds and includes principal, interest and a payment to settle the claims outside of the court, as well as \u201ccertain legal fees and expenses incurred.\u201dAxel Kicillof, the former economy minister, even sought to question the impartiality of the mediator, Mr. Pollack, saying a year ago: \u201cIf he takes off his jacket you can see his feathers,\u201d referring to the vultures.\u201cFor the first time in 15 years, we can say that Argentina has really started to exit default,\u201d Alfonso Prat-Gay, Argentina\u2019s new economy minister, told reporters in Buenos Aires on Monday, adding that the situation had \u201cdrowned\u201d the economy.He attacked the Kirchner administration for refusing to settle the issue, adding that by letting the dispute fester, interest had accumulated and investors had lost confidence.These lost investments and central bank reserves used to service tens of billion of dollars of debt in recent years could have been poured into the economy, creating up to two million jobs, Mr. Prat-Gay said.Argentina would sell up to $15 billion in bonds from April to finance the payment, he added.\u201cArgentina is joining the world in an intelligent way,\u201d Mr. Prat-Gay said.That nation\u2019s legislature could take most of March to debate whether to revoke the law, and a decision should be expected by the end of the month, according to Sergio Berensztein, an Argentine political analyst.Despite the accord, Argentina\u2019s bonds were little changed on Monday, showing that investors had already priced in a deal.The reverberations from the legal battle with Argentina may be felt for years to come.In 2012, the holdout hedge funds achieved a stunning breakthrough when Judge Griesa ruled that whenever Argentina wanted to pay any of its creditors, it would have to also pay the holdouts. The move and its fallout led Argentina to default on its debt again in 2014.That move will have far-reaching implications, many analysts say. With his ruling, the judge has laid the foundations for future investors to contest the debt obligations of other countries.Anna Gelpern, a law professor at Georgetown University, said that the ruling created a new tool for investors.\u201cThe tool is a kind of financial boycott\u201d that would allow creditors to enforce equal payment in other instances, she added.Mr. Guzman went further, saying that the settlement created \u201ca problem of moral hazard in which this settlement incentivizes this type of behavior because it is profitable.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Medicaid Joins Minimum Wage as Complication in Budget Talks", "Date": "2016-03-29", "News": "Supported byALBANY \u2014 Of this, everyone in the State Capitol seems certain: New York will eventually have a budget. The question is when.With time running short before the state\u2019s fiscal year ends on Thursday, leaders here were still dissecting and debating the details of what is expected to be a spending plan topping $150 billion.Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo seemed confident that the Legislature would pass a budget by midnight Thursday, saying that there was \u201cconceptual agreement\u201d on two knotty issues: raising the state\u2019s minimum wage and establishing paid family leave. The governor has sought to increase the minimum wage to $15, but he stopped short of assuring that the agreement would necessarily go into effect statewide, saying only \u201cthat\u2019s my plan.\u201dWhile a deal appeared close, there was still noticeable aggravation in Democratic ranks over a plan that Mr. Cuomo unveiled in January: finding some $250 million in Medicaid savings, much of which would come from New York City, which accounts for a large chunk of Medicaid spending statewide.Under a program instituted by the governor, the state has been paying for the cost of annual increases in Medicaid expenses. On Tuesday, Mr. Cuomo, a Democrat, characterized his plan as a way of encouraging the city to find efficiencies.\u201cIt\u2019s human nature, but when you no longer have any economic stake, are you still as judicious?\u201d Mr. Cuomo said, in an impromptu news conference in his office on Tuesday afternoon. \u201cBecause now you\u2019re basically writing checks on the state\u2019s account.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve been clear with the governor, I\u2019ve been clear since Day 1,\u201d Mr. Heastie said. \u201cUntil Medicaid is resolved it is very difficult for us to come to a budget resolution.\u201dMr. Heastie added that he and other Democrats, many of whom hail from the city and dominate the Assembly, were upset with the notion of \u201cthe city, in a punitive way, having to cover $250 million.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a big, big concern in the conference,\u201d he said.Mr. de Blasio\u2019s office, for its part, said it would work with the state to find efficiencies in Medicaid spending but a spokeswoman seemed uncertain about what Mr. Cuomo\u2019s plan would ultimately mean for the city.\u201cWe asked for guidance on how to do that and got none, but at the end of the day, we are holding the governor to his word that it will not cost the city a penny,\u201d Karen Hinton, the spokeswoman, said. \u201cSo if what he\u2019s proposing ends up costing us additional budget dollars, it is not as we discussed.\u201d\u201cI needed the districts to acknowledge that we needed to work together to find the savings,\u201d he said. \u201cThat has happened. New York City is approximately 70 percent of the program, so obviously we\u2019ll find the lion\u2019s share of the savings in New York City.\u201dAs for his minimum wage plan, Mr. Cuomo still faces resistance from the Republican-controlled State Senate. On Monday, the Senate\u2019s deputy majority leader, John DeFrancisco, described the Republican caucus as sharply divided. \u201cWe\u2019re all over the place,\u201d said Mr. DeFrancisco, who has opposed the $15 wage as a \u201cpolitical number\u201d that would have a deleterious effect on the upstate economy. \u201cAll over the park.\u201dThe proposal proffered by Mr. Cuomo would phase in the $15 hourly wage in New York City by Dec. 31, 2018, with a $15 rate reached statewide in July 2021. Negotiations have also touched on the possibility of different wages, at different times in different parts of the state. The governor said talks were focusing on \u201chow much and by when and where.\u201dThe budget would also contain a mix of other perks and promises, the governor said, including tax cuts and infrastructure funds, in part for a replacement for Penn Station, which the governor called a priority on Tuesday. There would also be a record increase in aid to schools, said Mr. Flanagan.\u201cUntil it\u2019s all done,\u201d he said, \u201cnone of it\u2019s done.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Rule to Require Employers to Disclose Use of Anti-Union Consultants", "Date": "2016-03-23", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The Labor Department on Wednesday released the final version of a rule requiring employers to disclose relationships with the consultants they hire to help persuade workers not to form a union or support a union\u2019s collective bargaining position.The department said the rule, which will be published on Thursday and apply to agreements made after July 1, is necessary because workers are frequently in the dark about who is trying to sway them when they exercise their labor rights.\u201cIn many organizing campaigns, decisions that workers make about whether to choose to stand together are often influenced by paid consultants, or persuaders, who are hired by employers to craft the management message being delivered to workers,\u201d Labor Secretary Thomas Perez said in a call with reporters. \u201cAbout 75 percent of employers hire such persuaders, and too often, workers do not know.\u201dThe 1959 law on which the regulations are based already required employers to disclose the hiring of such consultants. But the Labor Department argued that previous administrations had allowed an enormous loophole that effectively exempted consultants who coached supervisors on how to influence employees so long as the consultants didn\u2019t interact with the employees directly.The use of consultants has proliferated since the 1970s, and the techniques they deploy to discourage workers from forming unions have become progressively more sophisticated \u2014 more akin to modern political campaigns than workplace discussions.There are consultants \u201cscripting what managers and supervisors say to workers,\u201d Mr. Perez said.The new rule will require employers to disclose in government filings any consultant they hire to develop plans or policies for supervisors involved in attempting to persuade workers, who create materials that will be distributed through the workplace for this reason, and who lead seminars on how to discourage workers from forming unions or bargaining collectively.In addition to disclosing the hiring of a consultant, the employers will have to disclose the fees involved. The consultants will also have to disclose the relationships and fees in filings of their own.Opponents of the rule said it was a clear effort by the Labor Department to intervene on behalf of unions. \u201cIt is intended to aid organizing by tying one hand behind the back of the employer,\u201d said Marshall Babson, counsel at the law firm Seyfarth Shaw and a former National Labor Relations Board member who works with management on labor issues.Mr. Babson argued that the fee disclosure requirement would discourage law firms from providing advice to clients, much of which, he said, involves discouraging them from making unlawful threats or promises to workers during organizing campaigns, or unlawfully interrogating them.\u201cIt\u2019s something that tends to chill the seeking of legal advice,\u201d he said. \u201cHow is that in anyone\u2019s interest?\u201dBut Mr. Perez and his aides said that lawyers would only have to make the relevant disclosures if they provide advice about how to discourage the formation of a union or collective bargaining. He said that advice on pure legal matters would remain uncovered by the rule. Moreover, the specific content of lawyers\u2019 discussions would be protected by attorney-client privilege and not subject to disclosure.More broadly, they said, the rule was about restoring a measure of balance between labor and management. Department officials point out that under the original 1959 law, labor unions must disclose spending related to workplace organizing campaigns.Paul Secunda, a professor of labor law at Marquette University Law School who recently proposed that employers who address workers during organizing campaigns be required to give union organizers a similar opportunity, said that the consultants tend to be extremely effective at creating an environment in which many workers fear for their job if they opt to form a union.Employees should \u201cunderstand that the employer is not just speaking generically in their best interest,\u201d Mr. Secunda said. \u201cThey wouldn\u2019t spend so much on persuaders if it wasn\u2019t important to keep unions out of the workplace.\u201dAdvertisement"}

From my seat I could visualize a great shot: There was the blue spot backlighting Dylan\u2019s hair. I bluffed the security guards to allow me backstage for a few seconds, telling them I was shooting for Life magazine. This wasn\u2019t exactly true, but inasmuch as I was a freelancer working for them quite a bit, I had enough confidence to say so. I made a few frames using a Nikon F and a 300mm lens, with High Speed Ektachrome.Days later, I took the resulting images to John Berg at Columbia Records. I placed the meager stack of slides on his desk. John picked up the first one and said, \u2018That\u2019s the next cover.\u2019 It all happened in less time than it takes to tell this story. It was used as the album cover for \u2018Bob Dylan\u2019s Greatest Hits.\u2019 A few months later, John telegraphed to say we had won a Grammy Award for 1967\u2019s best album cover. I am so proud that our iconic image graces the cover of this seminal album.\u201d\u2014 Rowland Scherman, Orleans, Mass.\u201cMy wife has a postcard. On one side is printed \u2018I\u2019m drunk, what\u2019s your excuse?\u2019 On the other are the autographs of Dylan and Joan Baez. She got this gem at a concert in Connecticut around 1964, when Bob came up to her and some friends as they were walking to the venue and asked for a bite of her hamburger.\u201d\u2014 Trent Jones, New York City\u201cAs a teenager, I acquired the habit of reading the NYT on Sunday ... religiously! On this particular Sunday \u2014 October 18, 1964 \u2014 I tore out an advertisement (from Columbia Records) for the newest Dylan album, \u2018Another Side of Bob Dylan.\u2019 I still have the full-page picture of Dylan (with the thumb-sized print of the album cover) and the quote (never directly attributed to Dylan through his writings): \u201cYes it is I who is knocking at your door, if it is you inside who hears the noise.\u201dA little faded and somewhat tattered, this piece (preserved only in a clear plastic box frame) has followed me from the NY Island to California and back again.\u201d\u2014 Peggy DeStefano, Enfield, N.H.\u201cOn my office wall I have framed two images of Dylan that I took from the balcony of the Hartford Atheneum on Oct. 30, 1965. At the time I was a student in a minute boarding school in Connecticut, and my fellow seniors and I had persuaded the administration to let us arrange for a bus, order tickets, and make a pilgrimage across the state to hear Dylan. Shortly after I took the photos, they ran in the four-page student newspaper, of which I was an editor, and that was the end of them. But about 10 years ago, an envelope arrived in the mail from a high school classmate, containing two tiny prints of photos he had taken of the photos that ran in the newspaper. I scanned them, worked them in Photoshop and now they live on my office wall. And on the mat, under the images, I have the quote, \u2018He not busy being born is busy dying.\u2019 Words to live by at 70, or any other age for that matter.\u201d\u2014 B. D. Cohen, Cambridge, Mass.\u201cAll I have is his mother\u2019s autograph written on stationery from the store where she worked in Hibbing, Minn., in 1967. When I was 18, on a dare, I hitchhiked to Hibbing from Marquette, Mich. I got to Hibbing, went to a phone booth, and looked up Abe Zimmerman to get the address. Then I walked over to the Zimmerman home, knocked on the door and was crushed to realize nobody was home. Looking in the window of the door, I could see Bob and his brother David\u2019s high school graduation photos on a piano. I went next door and asked if that was the home of the parents of \u2018Bob Dylan, the folk singer.\u2019 A patient woman said yes, and that they were at work. She then said she\u2019d drive me downtown to where Mrs. Zimmerman worked. I walked into the store and a charming woman, obviously Dylan\u2019s mom, asked if she could help me. I explained who I was and why I was there. She and I spoke for about 45 minutes. I remember she always talked about Bob and David, his brother, equally.Also, like anybody\u2019s mother, she defended him. \u2018Bobby has that song, \u201cAll I Want To Do Is Be Friends\u201d or something like that. And it\u2019s true! He just wants to be friends with people!\u2019 At one point she said, \u2018Does your mother know you\u2019re here?\u2019 I said no, and she frowned. \u2018You should call your mother once you and I are done talking. Bobby always called me wherever he was.\u2019 I said I would. We talked about how Bob was doing, the fact that he was still having headaches from his motorcycle accident a year before. I asked for his address and she smiled, \u2018I\u2019m sorry, but Bobby doesn\u2019t have an address.\u2019 We both laughed. At one point she said she should give me her autograph. \u2018Nobody is going to believe you did this.\u2019 So I now have that autograph, and a memory of a charming woman who had the patience to talk to a kid who stuck his thumb out on a road one Saturday morning.\u201d\u201cAt the age of 16 I spent three weeks in Chicago on a summer study program, and at an \u2019underground\u2019 record store I purchased a copy of the first Dylan bootleg, known at the \u2018Great White Wonder.\u2019 While there were no liner notes or descriptions, I was able to figure out that a number of cuts were with the Band, in what would later be known as \u2018The Basement Tapes.\u2019 The idea that I had a noncommercial, secret stash of wisdom was quite powerful. I still have that album to this day.\u201d\u2014 Flip Brown, Burlington, Vt.\u201cIn 1985, my wife and I were flying back to New York from a trip to Minneapolis. Mr. Dylan and his son [were] seated in the row in front of us and a half-curtain divided our seats in economy and his in the last row of first-class. All during the flight Mr. Dylan wrote in a small notebook. It felt to us that everyone on the plane was curious to read what was on his mind. At one point, he got up and went to the restroom in the back of the plane. He took the notebook with him.\u201d\u2014 Jim Anderson, Brooklyn, N.Y.\u201cMy first recording of Bob Dylan was a 45 r.p.m. record of \u2018Like a Rolling Stone,\u2019 with a flip side of \u2018The Gates of Eden.' I was a kid in growing up on a farm in Rupert, Idaho, and I listened to that music over and over until I knew every word and every turn of melody. I was already taking piano and organ lessons at the time, and Dylan\u2019s music most certainly contributed to my own choice of living a life of music.\u201d\u2014 Lynette Westendorf, Winthrop, Wash.\u201cAmong some good stuff, I have the media kit from Bob Dylan\u2019s Kennedy Center honors. I was working for a news agency at the time. After a ceremony at the White House before the show, I happened to notice him leaving through the North Portico. I asked him if he had ever been to the White House before. In the somewhat goofy, borscht belt humor mode he\u2019s been known for over the last few decades, he replied, pointing: \u2018There it is, right there.\u2019\u201d\u2014 Pedro, Washington, D.C.\u201cA lovely little anthology of Bulgarian translations of Dylan songs, published in Plovdiv, Bulgaria, 1984.

{"Headline": "House Hunting on ... Grand Cayman Island", "Date": "2016-03-09", "News": "Supported byInternational Real Estate19 PhotosA FIVE-BEDROOM VILLA ON A CANAL$4.695 MILLIONThis four-year-old house on Grand Cayman Island, in the 52-acre gated development of Vista del Mar, is on a canal leading into the North Sound. It is about a 15-minute walk from crescent-shaped Seven Mile Beach and adjacent to the Cayman Islands Yacht Club, said Malin Ratcliffe, the owner-broker of West Indies Brokers Real Estate, which has the listing. The two-story white concrete home, about 9,000 square feet on a 0.58-acre lot, has a Caribbean-style limestone finish halfway up the lower level and a red tile roof. There are five bedrooms and five and a half baths, and furnishings are included in the asking price.A grand staircase with a limestone facade leads up from the front lawn and turns at a landing toward a covered porch and a 12-foot-high arched mahogany front door.With the main living areas on the second floor, the house enjoys canal and North Sound views, year-round breezes and \u201cvery advantageous additional protection\u201d during hurricane season, Ms. Ratcliffe said.A small foyer opens onto a grand hall with a coffered ceiling. This room and the dining room to its left have white Egyptian stone floors inlaid with hardwood. The rest of the house also has Egyptian stone floors. Beyond the dining room is the kitchen, a breakfast nook with a love seat and a 48-inch round mahogany table, a family room and two bedrooms with en-suite baths. A white wood bar is to one side of the grand hall.The kitchen has twin center islands topped with Carrara marble, two Viking refrigerators with freezer drawers, a Viking gas range, a pot filler, an electric oven, a warming drawer, a microwave, a dishwasher and a ceramic double sink.Open to the kitchen, the family room has a coffered ceiling, turquoise walls and accordion glass doors leading to a covered porch overlooking an inground pool, a large gazebo that serves as an outdoor living room and cocktail lounge, the canal and North Sound.\u201cYou can really take the inside out and the outside in when you open those doors,\u201d Ms. Ratcliffe said.A study, a guest bath and the master suite are to the right of the grand hall. The master bedroom has a four-poster bed and a coffered ceiling. A door leads to the porch.The master bath is tiled with Carrara marble and has a whirlpool tub and a separate walk-in shower. A double vanity has a Carrara marble countertop.Downstairs, a three-car garage leads to the first-floor foyer, an elevator, a powder room, a laundry room and a staircase with a wrought iron railing to the second floor. The open layout downstairs incorporates a media room, a playroom, a billiards room and a game room opening to a covered patio with a heated whirlpool tub.Two downstairs bedrooms share a bath. All the bedrooms have ceiling fans; the house has five air-conditioning zones.Mature redwood, almond, mango and royal palm trees dot the lawn.Behind the gazebo, a slip on the canal accommodates a 20-foot boat.A dedicated slip for a 65-foot boat is at the Vista del Mar marina next door. There is also a tennis court in the development, which has about 27 homes. Restaurants, beach bars, shopping, resorts, hotels and spas are within walking distance on the nearby Seven Mile Beach corridor. Golf courses are also nearby. Owen Roberts International Airport is a 20-minute drive.MARKET OVERVIEW With about 58,000 residents, Grand Cayman, at 76 square miles, is the biggest of the three Cayman Islands, which are a British Overseas Territory in the western Caribbean.The island\u2019s economy lags two to three years behind that of the United States, said Sheena Conolly, the broker-owner of Cayman Island Sotheby\u2019s. Accordingly, 2011 and 2012 were \u201ctough years for the Cayman Islands.\u201dThe turnaround began in 2013. During the last nine months, the market has been \u201cextremely buoyant,\u201d Ms. Ratcliffe said. \u201cWe are seeing a definite uptick.\u201d With inventory falling, the buyer\u2019s market of the last few years is giving way to a seller\u2019s market.Rentals and tourism are also up. \u201cThe volume of transactions has gone up 90 percent in the last 12 months,\u201d Ms. Conolly said. \u201cPrice points are shifting up.\u201dThe biggest increase was on Seven Mile Beach, where prices for condominiums range from $500,000 to \u201cmany millions,\u201d Ms. Conolly said. In other beachfront areas, prices start at $350,000. Prices for canalfront, beachfront or oceanfront single-family homes begin at around $2 million, she said.Along Seven Mile Beach, condominiums in buildings ranging from three to 10 stories are often bought for investment and rented out. Canalfront single-family homes are typically primary residences for executives from nearby George Town\u2019s financial center, or vacation homes for buyers with a penchant for deep-sea fishing or sailing.WHO BUYS ON GRAND CAYMAN\u201cPeople from 130 countries live and work here,\u201d Ms. Conolly said. \u201cIt\u2019s very diverse and dynamic.\u201dAt least 75 percent of buyers come from the United States and Canada, Ms. Ratcliffe said, in addition to a smaller number from Europe and South America. Snowbirds living near cities in the United States with direct flights are prevalent among home buyers.BUYING BASICSForeigners are welcome to buy real estate in the Cayman Islands, as long as they \u201cprovide satisfactory due-diligence paperwork to comply with our money laundering legislation,\u201d said Ian Jamieson, a lawyer based on Grand Cayman. Potential buyers need to supply proof of identity along with references from a bank or similar financial institution plus references from a professional like a lawyer or an accountant.Financing of up to 90 percent of the purchase price is available to qualified buyers.\u201cThere is no title insurance here in Cayman, so it is advisable to have an attorney represent a buyer in a transaction from the outset, not just at closing,\u201d Mr. Jamieson said. Lawyers review and investigate the title, handle the closing and register the transaction and buyer information with the government\u2019s Lands and Survey Department.WEBSITES LANGUAGE AND CURRENCYEnglish; Cayman Islands dollar (1 dollar = $1.22)TAXES AND FEESQuarterly dues for the Vista del Mar homeowners association are $950.There are no property taxes in the Cayman Islands.There is a stamp duty of 7.5 percent of the property\u2019s value on real estate purchases, and an additional 1 percent to 1.5 percent on the amount being financed. Legal fees range from 0.5 percent to 1 percent of the purchase price, Mr. Jamieson said.Real estate commission, paid by the seller, varies from 5 percent to 7 percent, depending on the sales price. The commission on sales of more than $1 million is 5 percent; on sales from about half a million to a million dollars, the commission is 6 percent.CONTACTAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Obama Reverses Course on Drilling Off Southeast Coast", "Date": "2016-03-14", "News": "Supported byThe announcement by the Interior Department, which is seen as surprising, could come as soon as Tuesday, according to a person familiar with the decision who was not authorized to speak on the record because the plan had not been publicly disclosed.The decision represents a reversal of President Obama\u2019s previous offshore drilling plans, and comes as he is trying to build an ambitious environmental legacy. It could also inject the issue into the 2016 presidential campaigns, as Republican candidates vow to expand drilling.The proposal came after governors, state legislators and senators from Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina and Georgia all expressed support for the drilling. Lawmakers in the state capitals saw new drilling as creating jobs and bolstering state revenue. But the offshore drilling proposal, which was still in draft form and was not to be finalized until later this year, provoked a backlash from coastal communities including Norfolk, Va., which supports the world\u2019s largest naval base; Charleston, S.C.; and tiny tourist towns around Myrtle Beach, S.C., and on the Outer Banks of North Carolina. Over 106 of those coastal cities and towns signed resolutions asking Mr. Obama to shut down plans for new drilling.In addition, more than 80 East Coast state legislators and the owners of about 1,000 coastal businesses have signed letters to Mr. Obama opposing the drilling.Both environmental groups and the oil industry have spent the last several months lobbying in town halls and statehouses throughout the Southeast.Environmental groups and many coastal residents fear that opening the Atlantic to drilling could lead to a repeat of the 2010 Deepwater Horizon explosion in the Gulf of Mexico, which killed 11 people and sent millions of gallons of oil to the shores of nearby coastal states.\u201cIf this is true, it\u2019s a great day for the Atlantic coast, our beaches and the coastal economy that depends on it,\u201d said Rachel Richardson, program director for the drilling program at Environment America. \u201cThis moment has come because Atlantic coast communities, businesses and citizens have all spoken up to protect their beaches, treasured marine life and President Obama listened.\u201dThe oil and gas industry saw the drilling as a potential bonanza for new oil supply and pledged that the exploration would be done safely, mindful of the lessons from the 2010 disaster.\u201cIf the Atlantic is taken out, that means there\u2019s less of an opportunity to invest in the U.S., and those dollars will flow overseas, and we\u2019ll hear more and more of that in the presidential election,\u201d said Randall Luthi, president of the National Ocean Industries Association.The Interior Department estimates there are 3.3 billion barrels of recoverable oil on the Atlantic\u2019s outer continental shelf and 31.3 trillion cubic feet of natural gas. Energy industry experts say the reserves may be far greater.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Putin\u2019s Syria Surprise", "Date": "2016-03-15", "News": "Supported byEditorialRussia has operated a naval facility at Tartus off the Syrian coast since the days of the Soviet Union. That base, Mr. Putin said, will remain open. His order seemed to affect warplanes operating from a new air base in Latakia. Since September, planes from Latakia have been bombing rebels fighting to overthrow President Bashar al-Assad and have tipped the balance in Syria\u2019s five-year-old war in Mr. Assad\u2019s favor, allowing him to reclaim territory lost to the rebels.Russia\u2019s intervention has also enabled Mr. Putin to show off its military might and forced the United States to treat it as an equal in securing stability in Syria.One hopeful interpretation of Mr. Putin\u2019s decision is that it reflected a growing weariness with protracted engagement. Senior officials in the Obama administration have argued that Moscow\u2019s intervention could have the unintended consequence of drawing Russia into a quagmire and alienating Sunni Muslims across the region, a price Mr. Putin may not be willing or able to pay.Mr. Assad\u2019s hold on the country, which is also under attack by the Islamic State and other militants, is still shaky. Russia\u2019s economy, battered by the slump in oil prices, is expected to shrink by 1 percent this year and faces long-term stagnation. Sanctions imposed by the European Union because of Russia\u2019s aggression in Ukraine are also a drag.Mr. Putin\u2019s announcement coincided with the resumption in Geneva of United Nations-brokered peace talks, so the timing could be significant. In addition to ordering stepped-up diplomatic efforts, Mr. Putin may have been telling Mr. Assad that the time had come to drop his resistance to a peace settlement.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Stalling on Fuel Efficiency", "Date": "2016-03-10", "News": "Supported byOp-Ed ContributorsTHE Obama administration\u2019s stringent fuel efficiency standards are intended to reduce auto pollution and drive up gas mileage. They are the biggest single step any nation has taken to fight global warming. The rules worked well, at first. They no longer do. They can be fixed.The repairs are all the more important since the Supreme Court last month put a hold on the administration\u2019s plan to limit pollution from coal-fired power plants.The fuel-economy standards are designed to deliver a new-car fleet averaging 54.5 m.p.g. in 2025. But this goal is in jeopardy as automakers increase the production of gas-guzzling light trucks, minivans and most S.U.V.s, which are subject to less stringent standards than other cars. These vehicles are driving up oil consumption and pollution and putting at risk American compliance with the Paris climate accord.Two recent government reports provide ample evidence that to cut carbon dioxide emissions, the administration must strengthen the fuel-efficiency standards for those vehicles. It should also close loopholes that allow automakers to thwart the intent of the fuel standards while following the letter of the regulations.Under the rules, fuel efficiency rose five miles per gallon from 2007 to 2013. But reports from the Environmental Protection Agency show no overall improvement in 2014 models, the most recent year for which data is available. And with the production of S.U.V.s, pickups and minivans continuing to rise, fuel efficiency and emissions for 2015 vehicles most likely grew worse, though we won\u2019t be able to confirm that until December.This news comes as the government begins an evaluation of the rules that could result in changes for 2021 through 2025. Our concern is that the auto industry will use the review, which it sought when the standards were first set, to delay or weaken the rules.The fuel efficiency standards do not set overall pollution or mileage targets. Instead, they provide a sliding scale that allows for weaker mileage and emissions rules for company fleets as the automakers increase their truck production.As a result, although the fuel economy for light trucks increased by .6 miles per gallon in 2014, the increased production of these vehicles, which rose by 5 percent, offset the overall, fleetwide benefit of other, more efficient vehicles.In the end, the 2014 fleet of cars and trucks averaged 30.7 m.p.g., just as it did in 2013. By stalling improvements in efficiency, the auto industry continues to put the climate at risk. From well to wheels, burning a gallon of gasoline spews 25 pounds of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere.Of all the major automakers, American companies delivered the worst fleetwide mileage. Ford\u2019s fuel efficiency was 9.2 m.p.g. worse than the industry leader, Mazda, which achieved 37.9 m.p.g. G.M. and Fiat Chrysler were worse than Ford. Only Honda and Hyundai were in full compliance with the standards without resorting to loopholes. One of these loopholes allows automakers to get credit for higher fuel efficiency for flexible fuel vehicles, even though those vehicles generally don\u2019t achieve that improved efficiency.This is auto mechanics, not rocket science. To make more efficient vehicles, carmakers can deploy existing technologies, including better engines and transmissions, and improved aerodynamics and materials. High-strength, lightweight metals have shaved 150 pounds from the average vehicle. Automakers can cut at least twice that with no impact on safety, says Clarence M. Ditlow III, executive director of the Center for Auto Safety. (Our organization is affiliated with his group.)Although automakers increased their use of fuel efficiency technology in 2014, they deployed it in only a few models, while outfitting their S.U.V.s and other light trucks with cheaper, outdated equipment. More than three-quarters of Subarus and Nissans use highly efficient continuously variable transmissions, but Ford, G.M. and Chrysler use them in only a small fraction of their fleet. BMW, Volkswagen and Mercedes-Benz use turbochargers, which maximize engine efficiency, in a majority of their vehicles. Ford employs turbochargers in nearly 50 percent of its fleet, but G.M. and Chrysler have left them largely on the shelf.And for every piece of efficient technology they ignore, automakers install another cup holder or electronic gizmo, jack up the price and increase profits by saddling buyers with a 20th-century product in 21st-century wrapping.The Obama administration\u2019s mileage-and-emissions program can do more than any current measure to keep greenhouse gas pollution out of the atmosphere.One way to fix the problems that have slowed progress would be to establish a so-called backstop during the midterm review, which is just getting underway. Under it, automakers would be required to produce a fleet that cuts carbon dioxide emissions by six billion tons, achieving the administration\u2019s original antipollution target.The auto industry owes taxpayers that much, after the $85 billion government bailout that saved General Motors and Chrysler from bankruptcy.If the rules achieve their goal, they will cut our payments at the pump, saving consumers as much as $8,000 even after they pay for the technology that delivers better mileage; ease our oil addiction; and keep six billion tons of carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere. We can\u2019t afford to let automakers stop this progress.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Mario Draghi Throws the Kitchen Sink at Europe\u2019s Economic Distress. Again.", "Date": "2016-03-10", "News": "Supported byEconomic TrendsOne hopes that at the very least, Mario Draghi, the president of the European Central Bank, is able to buy kitchen sinks in bulk at a discount from some plumbing supply shop in Frankfurt.Because on Thursday, for the umpteenth time in his five years in that job, he has thrown his and everything else at Europe\u2019s continuing economic malaise. This time, the E.C.B. managed a quadruple whammy: cutting its short-term interest rates even further below zero; pumping more money into the eurozone economy through quantitative easing \u2014 by 20 billion euros a month (with purchases currently planned to continue through March 2017); expanding the Q.E. program to include corporate bonds to make more credit available to businesses; and encouraging more borrowing by creating a new bank lending program.This would seem on its face to be a really aggressive intervention to try to jolt Europe out of its deflationary muddle. Indeed, when it was initially announced, the euro fell 1.1 percent against the dollar, bond yields fell and European stocks rose, all suggesting that financial types saw it that way. But as Mr. Draghi began addressing the news media Thursday morning about the actions, he played down the likelihood of further rate cuts, and those market shifts reversed.It was Mr. Draghi\u2019s answer to the pessimism that has taken over global financial markets in the last few months, a malaise rooted in part by a sense of the impotence of global central banks. For years, new rounds of Q.E. and other moves have been the inevitable response to periods of market tumult and economic weakness. Now markets fear that the central banks just have nothing left to combat global deflationary forces that have seemed more powerful with every tick down in the price of oil.Not so, according to Mr. Draghi. \u201cI think the best answer to this has been given by our decisions today,\u201d he said in his news conference after the policy announcement. \u201cWe have shown that we are not short of ammunition.\u201dThey may be right, of course; the last seven years have upended what we thought we knew about how central banks can and should operate. If you told some time travelers who\u2019d just arrived from 2007 that the E.C.B. had an official bank lending rate of negative 0.4 percent and was buying 80 billion euros of bonds each month, you would blow their minds.But monetary policy works through different channels, and their relative importance shifts with time. For years, Q.E. seemed to have its greatest impact by pumping up prices of stocks and other financial assets. That both made consumers wealthier and lowered the cost of capital for businesses, helping restore confidence and encourage economic activity.That has worked well enough that global financial assets look relatively richly priced relative to historical fundamentals, despite some recent turbulence. It\u2019s not clear that asset prices are as powerful a channel for central bank activism to stimulate the economy as they were in earlier years when they were undervalued. It is also not clear if further large increases in financial markets\u2019 values would provide anything other than an unwelcome bubble.That being the case, attention has shifted in the last year or so toward currencies. With good reason: When a central bank eases monetary policy, the price of its currency tends to decline relative to others, encouraging inflation and giving an advantage to domestic exporters.Negative rates like those in place in Europe may encourage more lending and economic activity, but if they go deeper into negative territory and persist for a long time, they could also cause people to withdraw money from banks and throw the business models of banks into chaos. Going too far into negative rates would be essentially telling banks: We want you to make loans and expand credit, but we\u2019re also taking policy action that could obliterate your business.In other words, Mr. Draghi may still be able to procure a few more kitchen sinks to throw at Europe\u2019s economic problems. But each additional one may start to get a little more expensive, and a lot harder to throw.Advertisement"}

It wasn\u2019t Beijing. It wasn\u2019t even Washington, as bad as Washington can be.Less well-off white voters have only themselves to blame, Williamson continues:It wasn\u2019t immigrants from Mexico, excessive and problematic as our current immigration levels are. It wasn\u2019t any of that. Nothing happened to them. There wasn\u2019t some awful disaster. There wasn\u2019t a war or a famine or a plague or a foreign occupation. Even the economic changes of the past few decades do very little to explain the dysfunction and negligence \u2014 and the incomprehensible malice \u2014 of poor white America.Not satisfied to stop there, Williamson adds:The truth about these dysfunctional, downscale communities is that they deserve to die. Economically, they are negative assets. Morally, they are indefensible. Forget all your cheap theatrical Bruce Springsteen crap.

Simply put, Americans are killing themselves and destroying their families at an alarming rate. No one is making them do it. The economy isn\u2019t putting a bottle in their hand. Immigrants aren\u2019t making them cheat on their wives or snort OxyContin. Obama isn\u2019t walking them into the lawyer\u2019s office to force them to file a bogus disability claim.GOOD NEWS! Buchanan Says If Ted Cruz Wins, An \u201cAwful Lot\u201d of Trump Supporters Will \u201cJust Go Home\u201dThe \u201cnew Trump voters,\u201d Howe writes,aren\u2019t motivated by what makes the Republican Party the Republican Party. They aren\u2019t in this to limit the size and scope of government. They aren\u2019t coming out to Trump rallies because he\u2019s talking about reducing the debt.If Trump is not nominated and his supporters stay home on Election Day, Howe believes that \u201cthere\u2019s really only one response: Bye.\u201dWe\u2019re not living our Christian faith because no Christian, no real Christian \u2014 I don\u2019t mean a judgmental Christian, I mean somebody who\u2019s living their faith \u2014 no Christian says, \u201cI want that guy, that guy is the guy for me.\u201dAmerica\u2019s self-appointed best and brightest uniformly view the passions unleashed by Trump as the modern-day equivalent of a medieval peasants\u2019 revolt. And, like their medieval forebears, they mean to crush it. That effort is both a fool\u2019s errand for the country and a poisoned chalice for conservatives and Republicans.In Olsen\u2019s view, disparaging Trump\u2019s lower-income white supporters \u201cwill simply intensify the masses\u2019 rage and ensure that their political spokesmen become more intransigent and radical.\u201d Even worse,keeping blue-collar white Americans out of political power will result in exactly what Washington elites have wanted for years: a series of grand bargains that keep the status quo largely intact and the Democratic party in power.Only now are major party leaders and contributors beginning to recognize the full depth of this intraparty conflict.The history, Confessore wrote, isone of a party elite that abandoned its most faithful voters, blue-collar white Americans, who faced economic pain and uncertainty over the past decade as the party\u2019s donors, lawmakers and lobbyists prospered. From mobile home parks in Florida and factory towns in Michigan, to Virginia\u2019s coal country, where as many as one in five adults live on Social Security disability payments, disenchanted Republican voters lost faith in the agenda of their party\u2019s leaders.While white voters with a high school degree or less have steadily declined as a share of the electorate \u2014 from 82 percent of adults 25 and older in 1940 to 29 percent in 2007 \u2014 they have repeatedly played a crucial role in determining the outcome of elections.These two elections marked the establishment of a conservative majority that produced Republican presidential victories in 1980, 1984 and 1988 \u2014 the only exception being 1976 when Watergate briefly stalled the ascendance of the right.The challenges facing the white working class are indeed severe. According to Teixeira and Abramowitz:Between 1979 and 2005, the average real hourly wage for those with a college degree went up 22 percent and for those with advanced degrees, 28 percent. In contrast, average wages for those with only some college went up a mere 3 percent, actually fell 2 percent for those with a high school diploma, and for high school dropouts, declined a stunning 18 percent.The accompanying chart, based on an analysis by the Republican firm Public Opinion Strategies, illustrates aggregated exit poll data from the Republican primaries held through March 21. It shows the demographic groups that have provided Trump with relatively high and relatively low levels of support.The comparatively low levels of support for Trump among college-educated Republicans, women, young voters and those with incomes above $100,000 suggest that these voters are most likely to sit out the election or to vote Democratic if Trump is the nominee. Conversely, groups that gave him higher than average support in the primaries \u2014 the less well educated, those with incomes below the median, men and rural voters \u2014 are likely to deliver his best margins in the general election.If there are two key themes in the election so far, one is Trump\u2019s ability to enrage; the other is his ability to exceed expectations. The disregard of liberal and conservative elites for working and middle class voters has manifested itself in a consistent underestimation of the anger, resentment and pessimism of these voters \u2014 and hence of their electoral power.The primaries have demonstrated the importance of the primary process in making unheard voices audible.In the former,millions of people have the milk of prosperity and the honey of equality flowing before them. This America is the habitat of millions of people who have food and material necessities for their bodies, culture and education for their minds, freedom and human dignity for their spirits.The latter, the \u201cother America,\u201d hasa daily ugliness about it that transforms the buoyancy of hope into the fatigue of despair. In this other America, thousands and thousands of people, men in particular walk the streets in search for jobs that do not exist.It is an irony of history, then, that King\u2019s language perfectly describes the conflict today between the privileged establishment and the hard pressed rank and file of the overwhelmingly white Republican Party \u2014 a conflict between haves and have-nots that is taking the Republican Party to a place it has never been.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Luxury Auto World of Wood Trim and Grey Poupon Bows to the S.U.V.", "Date": "2016-03-24", "News": "Supported byWheelsTHE storied automotive names of Bentley, Maserati, Rolls-Royce, Jaguar and Lamborghini conjure images of upper-crust style, luxury and, yes, tradition.That tradition is being exploded as though a truck stop were opening at Buckingham Palace: All five brands are preparing to introduce sport utility vehicles.Wealthy purists may wring their manicured hands, but the market has spoken, and not only in America. Even at the highest end of the market, buyers are preferring roomier S.U.V.s to sedans, coupes and sports cars.And with even ultraexclusive automakers under pressure to sustain profits and keep fickle customers in the fold, the lure of S.U.V.s is proving impossible to resist.Harald Wester, head of the Maserati and Alfa Romeo brands at Fiat Chrysler, makes an analogy with high fashion, which changes with the seasons but maintains signature brand cues.\u201cSo where do I have the arrogance or ignorance to determine what luxury suit our customers want to wear?\u201d Mr. Wester said. \u201cWhy can\u2019t a vehicle be bigger and more functional, but with the same feel and smell and characteristics as the other one?\u201dRolls-Royce is preparing an S.U.V. for 2017 under the Project Cullinan code name. Rolls-Royce says the model, which the company calls a high-bodied all-terrain vehicle and is named after a famed diamond, is built on a new aluminum architecture and will deliver its signature lush ride on- or off-road.Between the F-Pace and a small sedan, the XE, Jaguar is expected to nearly triple its American sales to 47,500 by 2020, from barely 16,000 in 2015, according to Stephanie Brinley, senior analyst for IHS Automotive.\u201cIf a Jaguar buyer wants an S.U.V. and Jaguar doesn\u2019t offer it, that buyer will leave the brand,\u201d Ms. Brinley said.For any luxury brand, she added, S.U.V.s are the biggest opportunity for sales growth. Sales of compact luxury crossovers like the Jaguar surged more than 50 percent last year. Sales of all luxury crossovers should increase another 40 percent over four years, to 1.2 million.While Land Rover helped pioneer the luxury off-road S.U.V., Porsche helped create today\u2019s template for S.U.V.s that focus more on performance on pavement. In 2003, its Cayenne initially struck many fans of the famed sports-car brand as the ultimate heresy.But instead of being a disaster, the Cayenne proved a sales triumph. Its worldwide popularity and profits helped sustain Porsche and backstopped investment in its traditional sports cars. The Cayenne and the smaller Macan S.U.V., introduced last year, now deliver just over half of all Porsche sales in America.It\u2019s the same story for Mercedes, BMW, Audi and Cadillac: The luxury S.U.V. has become their two-ton golden goose. BMW is virtually running out of numbers for its proliferating S.U.V. lineup, which now includes the X1, X3, X4, X5 and X6, with a three-row X7 likely in the works.16 PhotosThe Bentayga actually shares its basic structure with the Cayenne and Audi Q7, with all three brands \u2014 and four counting Lamborghini \u2014 shouldering luxury duties within the VW Group empire.One holdout is Aston Martin, known for the knee-weakening beauty of its British cars. Its chief executive, Andy Palmer, has declared that S.U.V.s are by definition boxy and therefore cannot be beautiful. That, he says, disqualifies an S.U.V. from wearing an Aston Martin badge.Finbar McFall, product marketing manager for Jaguar Land Rover, disputes that stylistic assessment.\u201cThe conversation has moved on,\u201d Mr. McFall said. \u201cOur rallying cry is to create the ultimate practical sports car.\u201dCritics have indeed praised the Jaguar F-Pace for its shapely lines, which echo those of its two-seat F-Type sports car. But as they did with Porsche before it, some critics continue to suggest that brands like Jaguar and Bentley are sullying their exclusive image by building S.U.V.s.Ms. Brinley isn\u2019t buying it.\u201cPorsche and other premium brands have proven it\u2019s possible to offer a successful S.U.V. and fantastic sports car in the same showroom,\u201d she said. \u201cWhether or not they\u2019re beautiful is in the eye of the beholder.\u201dEven Lamborghini will test that theory with the Urus, from a brand known for fanciful supercars that cost from roughly $250,000 to more than $1 million. Lamborghini is doubling the size of its manufacturing footprint in Italy\u2019s Emilia-Romagna region to satisfy expected demand for the Urus, set to arrive in 2017.Unlike most new entrants, Lamborghini built one previous S.U.V.: The LM002 was a 1980s forerunner of the Hummer, a dune-surfing civilian version of a military vehicle that Lamborghini built for Middle Eastern countries. But the pint-size Urus demonstrates how the modern luxury S.U.V. has little in common with its trucklike predecessors.In some cases, that includes fuel economy. Jaguar will offer the F-Pace with a small 4-cylinder diesel engine that should deliver well over 30 miles per gallon on the highway. Maserati\u2019s Levante will eventually offer a plug-in hybrid system adapted from the new Chrysler Pacifica minivan.For more traditional, mainstream S.U.V.s and pickup trucks, booming sales are being aided by the phenomenon of $2-a-gallon unleaded. But as the adage in the auto industry goes, people who can afford a $250,000 Bentayga don\u2019t base buying decisions on the price of fuel. And executives at luxury brands aren\u2019t overly concerned with an inevitable spike in fuel prices. The modern, more-efficient crossover, they say they believe, is here to stay.\u201cThis is not a pickup truck or a mega S.U.V.,\u201d Mr. Wester of Maserati said of the Levante. \u201cI can tell you, nobody will walk away from these cars for gas prices.\u201dAdvertisement"}

He was perhaps too young and idealistic to appreciate the nascent monster in the tactics laid out by the G.O.P. political strategist Lee Atwater, or the Machiavellian goals cloaked in Newt Gingrich\u2019s Contract for America. But where was his voice when Sarah Palin was milking the very undercurrent of violence he now attributes to the Donald Trump campaign, or when the media fomented hatred across the airwaves until even our own members of Congress believed the misinformation (Joe Wilson\u2019s shout of \u201cyou lie!\u201d during Mr. Obama\u2019s speech to Congress), or when the Senate G.O.P. leader vowed to put party ahead of country to make President Obama a \u201cone-term\u201d president?Mr. Trump\u2019s candidacy has been more than 30 years in the making, abetted by commentators like Mr. Brooks, who appear to regret only that the monster got away from them.GEORGIANNE ARNOLDPittsburghTo the Editor: I agree with David Brooks\u2019s column, but he misses a key point. The younger generations are accustomed to the \u201csuperhero\u201d ideal, the election of presidents based on image, branding and personality more than substance and character. The problem, for which Donald Trump can be considered both symptom and cause, is rooted in a paradigm that goes back not 30 years, but more than 50 years.Shortly before the fateful Kennedy-Nixon contest, President Dwight D. Eisenhower said that TV should help foster an alert and knowledgeable citizenry worthy of a modern republic. Alas, the opposite has transpired. We live in a world of sound bites, and we prefer quick fixes and four-word solutions proposed by telegenic candidates. The tragicomic irony: We are confronted with complex challenges, but the zeitgeist does not encourage candidates or voters to respond in kind.Happily, the same tools that have cultivated the cancerous zeitgeist can also reverse it. With access to a variety of information unmatched in scope, this generation of Americans should consume it in a way that promotes an open mind and a citizen\u2019s spirit.J. D.

{"Headline": "Britain Needs Europe", "Date": "2016-03-03", "News": "Supported byLONDON \u2014 In the Year of the Hair, Boris Johnson of the blonde mop trails Donald Trump, but not by much. The London mayor\u2019s decision, which he has described as \u201cagonizingly difficult,\u201d to come out in favor of a British exit from the European Union in a June referendum has sent British politics into a tailspin.The mayor, whose second four-year term ends this year, likes to wax metaphoric. In an interview with The Times, he compared himself to James Bond up against the \u201cevil baddie who is hell-bent on subverting democracy around the world through a supranational organization.\u201d Britain trapped in Europe was like \u201ca slowly boiling frog,\u201d he suggested.The range of his metaphors is matched only by the extent of his ambition. Boris on Europe is also Boris on Boris. He wants to be the next prime minister of Britain \u2014 or whatever is left of it in 2020, the date of the next election.David Cameron, the conservative prime minister, has said he will not stand again. Under Conservative Party rules, the conclusive vote to replace him will be between two candidates. One of them will be the pro-European chancellor of the Exchequer, George Osborne. By claiming the anti-Europe mantle in a party where Brussels bashing is a popular sport, Johnson has set himself up to be the other contender.Of course, Boris is not just about Boris. He\u2019s been a successful mayor. London works better than New York. His agonizing appears to have been genuine. Theories about what tipped the balance abound.The exit argument \u2014 when it\u2019s not just bloviating little-England inanity dosed with anti-immigrant bigotry \u2014 is that membership hitches Britain to a stagnant Continent whose most powerful countries are locked in a dysfunctional single-currency system that must lead to ever greater European federalism. It is that the Union is short on democracy and long on bureaucracy. It is that leaving the Union will allow Britain, like Norway, to continue to benefit from a single market of more than a half-billion people while freeing it from intrusive regulation. The \u201cOut\u201d mantra is \u201cTake Back Control.\u201dIn fact, a \u201cBrexit\u201d would be an act of folly, slashing Britain\u2019s \u201ccontrol\u2019 at a critical time, inflicting a \u201cprofound economic shock,\u201d in Osborne\u2019s words, and possibly leading to the breakup of Britain.The European Union, together with the trans-Atlantic alliance, ushered Europe to stability and prosperity from the collective suicide of the first half of the 20th century. It remains the world\u2019s most boring, important miracle. A British departure, at a time when President Vladimir Putin is trying by all means to undermine a fragile union, would be a geopolitical disaster. Further European unraveling would become likely. No wonder President Obama is expected in London next month to reiterate his conviction that a Britain in Europe is a stronger, more influential ally.Britain can \u2014 and must \u2014 make the E.U. more transparent, democratic and dynamic. That can only be achieved from within. The country derives immense benefits from being part of an $18.5 trillion economy. To imagine that a Britain outside the Union can continue to enjoy the benefits of membership is pure illusion, as many industry leaders have made clear. The economy as a whole, and the City in particular, would suffer. British insularity would become a byword.Or rather English insularity, for Britain would likely cease to be. Scotland is strongly pro-European. An E.U. exit would give the governing Scottish National Party an overwhelming case for another referendum on independence. Its outcome would surely be the end of the union established in 1707.The June 23 vote will be close, closer now that Johnson has gambled. His choice, so perverse for the mayor of this city of countless tongues, risks pushing his beloved country \u201cremorselessly and expensively in the wrong direction.\u201d Seldom has the need for British good sense, continuity and prudence been more acute.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Delegates Endorse China\u2019s 5-Year Plan but Resist Saying Much Else", "Date": "2016-03-16", "News": "Supported bySinosphereBEIJING \u2014 Not long after 8 a.m. on Wednesday, a line of buses roared onto cordoned-off Tiananmen Square in the heart of Beijing to drop off hundreds of delegates to the National People\u2019s Congress. They walked quickly to the granite-pillared Great Hall of the People on the west side of the square for the final meeting of this year\u2019s session.The votes included:The 13th Five-Year-Plan, the first formulated under Mr. Xi. The result: 2,778 for, 53 against, 25 abstentions.The annual government budget: 2,467 for, 299 against, 90 abstentions.The Supreme People\u2019s Court report: 2,600 for, 208 against, 46 abstentions.A law regulating charitable organizations and fund-raising: 2,636 for, 131 against, 83 abstentions.\u201cPretty much what I expected. Kind of the same as last year,\u201d said Cao Jingxing, a commentator for Phoenix TV, based in Hong Kong, after the votes on a total of nine motions were counted.Mr. Cao, a longtime attendee of the meeting, pulled up past statistics on his smartphone to prove his point. The \u201cyes\u201d votes for crucial reports on Wednesday were similar to or higher than in recent years. In 2013, for instance, 605 delegates had voted against the court report, indicating relative dissatisfaction, he said.But there was one mini-surprise, Mr. Cao said: the robust support for Mr. Xi\u2019s Five-Year Plan, which will provide a framework for the country\u2019s development until 2021. These are years when leaders hope to move China\u2019s economy up the skills, productivity, technology and consumption ladder.Although Mr. Cao did not expect the plan to be rejected \u2014 that has never happened at the session \u2014 he had thought it might encounter a bit more opposition, because the process of economic restructuring in China was challenging key sectors. These include energy, coal, iron and steel.\u201cI had expected it to be lower, as people representing various vested interests might vote against it,\u201d Mr. Cao said.The high support, he said, could be because delegates felt the economy was doing better than many outsiders believed and because they feared change less than some had predicted.\u201cTo me, that means that the economy is, in fact, not as bad as people are saying,\u201d Mr. Cao said.But casual conversation with delegates and their employees on the sidelines of the closing session on Wednesday was difficult.Before the voting, dozens of men in black suits and maroon ties milled inside the Great Hall of the People, their badges identifying them as support staff for the Supreme People\u2019s Court delegates.One man who was seated, asked whether he was with the court, said, \u201cI\u2019m a working person.\u201d Pressed, he said, \u201cYes.\u201d Then he stood up and walked away.In front of a grand piano in the foyer, Liu Lei, 31, a primary schoolteacher and member of the Hezhen, or Nanai, ethnic group from Heilongjiang Province, posed for photographs in a bright costume. Antlers and little deer ears protruded from a cap on her head.Such colorfully dressed delegates, members of China\u2019s dozens of officially recognized ethnic minorities, are a regular feature of the National People\u2019s Congress, symbols of the state policy of ethnic integration.Asked whether her headgear was traditional, Ms. Liu said, \u201cWell, the costume has changed over the years.\u201d What was the most traditional dress for the Nanai? \u201cFish skin,\u201d she said, turning away.Two other female delegates hesitated when asked for an interview. Just then, a bell rang to alert the delegates to the 9 a.m. start.\u201cWe have to go,\u201d they said, visibly relieved, adding in English, \u201cSorry,\u201d before rushing off and before a reporter could identify them.Asked about the security situation in the oasis town \u2014 the government says Xinjiang faces terrorist threats from Islamic extremists and separatists \u2014 Ms. Reziwanguli, an agricultural specialist, said there were no problems in or around Turpan between ethnic Han, who make up most of China\u2019s population, and the mostly Muslim Uighurs and Hui.\u201cWe are very harmonious,\u201d she said.Then: \u201cMy bus!\u201d she exclaimed, hurrying away.Vanessa Piao contributed research.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Major League Baseball Wants to Let Cuban Players Sign Directly With Teams", "Date": "2016-03-02", "News": "Supported byMajor League Baseball has submitted a proposal to the Treasury Department that outlines a new pathway for baseball players from Cuba to sign directly with big league teams in the United States. If approved, it could represent a sea change in relations between the two countries and drastically reshape how Cuban players find their way to the major leagues.For decades, Cubans have had to play for minuscule wages \u2014 now $40 to $200 per month \u2014 or defect from their island homeland to pursue baseball careers in America. A Cold War-era embargo that only Congress can remove is still in place and largely prohibits American companies and citizens from doing business in Cuba.Under the proposed plan, according to M.L.B.\u2019s top lawyer, Dan Halem, an entity made up of Cuban entrepreneurs and officials from baseball and its players\u2019 union would be created. A percentage of salaries paid to Cuban players would go to the new body, which would function like a nonprofit organization and support youth baseball, education and the improvement of sports facilities in Cuba.The proposed body could satisfy the terms of the embargo, M.L.B. contends, because no money would go directly to the Cuban government.M.L.B. said it had yet to receive a response from the Office of Foreign Assets Control, which enforces the embargo. Officials there declined to comment, citing the confidentiality of the license application process.It is also not clear where the Cuban government stands, although Halem confirmed that the idea had been discussed informally with Cuban officials.Cuba could still insist that a portion of the salaries for the Cuban players be directed to the country\u2019s sports agency, which typically administers foreign contracts for players.That may be difficult for the United States government to approve, but recent changes by the Cuban government to promote private business could offer clues as to how baseball could structure an arrangement.The White House has been in behind-the-scenes talks with Major League Baseball for months on how best to navigate the complex web of legal and regulatory hurdles that govern business between the two countries and to create a new system that would allow American teams to acquire Cuban players directly.Senior White House officials believe that resolution of the issue would represent an important symbolic moment in the thaw between the two nations, highlighting the potential for Americans and Cubans to bond over a common cultural obsession even as their governments remain divided over politics and policy.Cuban officials have also expressed interest in finding a safer path to the major leagues for their players.\u201cTo play in that type of baseball \u2014 in the United States \u2014 where the majority of the greatest players in the world want to be, you need to give up something big here, your dignity of being Cuban,\u201d Higinio Velez, the president of the Cuban Baseball Federation, said in December. \u201cWe hope that, in the future, Cuban players can go anywhere in the world and play, representing their federation, and that there are not intermediaries that take advantage of them.\u201dWhile the decision on drafting players from Cuba is pending, there is urgency for such an accord.Waves of Cuban ballplayers are leaving the island: According to OnCuba, a Miami-based magazine, 150 players left Cuba last year. Many are still seeking contracts with big league organizations. Often they travel in the hands of smugglers and under other dangerous circumstances.Bart Hernandez, a sports agent, was indicted last month on charges of human trafficking related to bringing Cuban players to the United States. Another agent recently cut ties with a player who defected; the agent said he had received a death threat from the player\u2019s trainer in the Dominican Republic.Because of complex immigration and free-agency rules, Cuban players must establish residency in a third country to enter the market for American teams and cash in on a lucrative contract, as stars like Yasiel Puig of the Los Angeles Dodgers and Aroldis Chapman of the Yankees have done in recent years.In recent months, as lurid stories of human trafficking have become public, M.L.B. has considered issuing a moratorium on signing Cuban defectors, but it is concerned that that would cut off an outlet for Cubans seeking professional careers.Such a policy could also be subject to a legal challenge. The Justice Department investigated the Baltimore Orioles for discriminatory hiring practices in 2000 when the team\u2019s owner, Peter G. Angelos, was accused by Senator Jesse Helms, Republican of North Carolina, of not signing Cuban defectors. The Orioles were eventually cleared.A working relationship with the Cuban Baseball Federation may be the best way forward.Baseball\u2019s players\u2019 union and the Cubans would have to sign off on the proposal, but it could settle the question of what is legal under United States law, opening the way for more substantive talks between the union and the Cubans on issues such as which players could be signed, how much of their salaries would be earmarked for M.L.B.\u2019s proposed organization and how players might continue to compete in international tournaments for Cuba.\u201cWe\u2019re trying to devise a better player acquisition process,\u201d Halem said during an M.L.B. good-will tour of Cuba in December.Discussions, which he called \u201cvery preliminary,\u201d began last summer.\u201cThis is like in the infancy, and we\u2019re still trying to get a better read from our government,\u201d Halem said.Changes in Cuba in recent years have given citizens more freedom in the private sector and given indications of how baseball might proceed. The Cuban government has allowed more citizens to engage in cuentapropismo, or self-employment, in ventures like opening restaurants and food stands, working as clowns at birthday parties and driving taxis. Baseball players could be granted special licenses to follow a similar model, with the government taxing their American salaries.Worker cooperatives are another possibility. Ballplayers could form a group, as farmers and restaurant workers have done, and negotiate directly with major league teams.\u201cIt would be wise to look at the Cuban economy, where reforms have already been undertaken,\u201d said Matthew Aho, a special adviser on Cuba at the New York office of the Akerman law firm. \u201cIn recent years, we\u2019ve seen an increasing tendency to allow Cubans to participate in private economic activity. Cubans see the exodus of their players leaving, so there is an incentive to cooperate in a solution.\u201dAs if to underscore that belief, the Cuban government allowed several defectors \u2014 Puig and the Chicago White Sox\u2019 Jose Abreu among them \u2014 to return to Cuba as part of the good-will tour and to visit with family members they had not seen since leaving Cuba.Still, when the brothers Lourdes Gourriel Jr. and Yulieski Gourriel deserted a Cuban club after the Caribbean Series several weeks ago, the government issued a sharp statement, saying the Gourriels had abandoned their team in \u201can open attitude of surrender to merchants of professional baseball for profit.\u201dAmid the continuing conversations, the indictment of Hernandez, the sports agent, shows why an accord is badly needed.Leonys Martin, an outfielder with the Seattle Mariners, left Cuba in 2010. In legal filings, he claimed that he was held hostage by armed smugglers in Mexico and that his family was held captive in Miami while Hernandez and his agency, Praver Shapiro Sports Management, negotiated a contract so Martin could pay a ransom for their release. (In a statement, a lawyer for Hernandez said he was innocent of the charges.)\u201cNobody can deny that our stock of Cuban baseball players, for the most part, involve smuggling, kidnapping, extortion and extreme danger,\u201d said Martin\u2019s lawyer, Paul H. Minoff. \u201cWe want to make sure Cuban players can still reach the major leagues, but as a society we can\u2019t turn our backs on what that often means for these players.\u201dAn earlier version of this article referred imprecisely to the Akerman law firm. Although it has an office in New York, its main office is in Miami; it is not the \u201cNew York law firm Akerman.\u201dJulie Hirschfield Davis contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Donald Trump Is Not Paul Ryan\u2019s Only Roadblock", "Date": "2016-03-24", "News": "Supported byLetter From AmericaLike his onetime mentor, Jack Kemp, Representative Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin leads the \u201chappy warrior\u201d wing of Republican conservatism. As House speaker, he wields more power than Mr. Kemp, a former lawmaker and vice-presidential nominee, ever did.Yet an interview with Mr. Ryan suggests he\u2019ll have trouble finding the decisive victories he craves anytime soon. The transformed landscape of 2016 keeps placing more obstacles in his path.More than most politicians, Mr. Ryan holds fast to his political philosophy. It starts with lower tax rates and expanded trade to spur economic growth, revamped entitlement programs to curb government spending, and a streamlined safety net to increase incentives to work.To achieve his vision, he argues, Americans must end the vexing period of divided government in which a Democratic White House clashes endlessly with a Republican Congress.\u201cWhat we need is a clarifying election,\u201d Mr. Ryan said. \u201cWe ask the country to break this impasse.\u201dDemocrats thought they won a clarifying election in 2012, when Mr. Obama overcame a robust challenge from Mitt Romney and his running mate \u2014 Mr. Ryan. But as he seeks another try at clarity, Mr. Ryan faces major challenges within his party.Donald J. Trump, the leading Republican presidential candidate, has not embraced Mr. Ryan\u2019s vision. While Mr. Trump proposes deep tax cuts, his economic agenda reflects his opposition to recent international trade agreements.\u201cWe\u2019re in a global economy whether we like it or not,\u201d Mr. Ryan said. He held out the possibility of bridging their differences by noting Mr. Trump\u2019s stated desire for \u201cgood trade deals.\u201dTheir differences on Social Security and Medicare pose bigger challenges. Mr. Trump flatly rejects changes in benefits that Mr. Ryan considers vital to curbing deficits and debt.\u201cLook, not all Republicans agree on everything,\u201d Mr. Ryan said. But this is no ordinary disagreement. White House leadership represents an indispensable ingredient for revamping vast benefit programs. A President Trump could place Mr. Ryan\u2019s objective out of reach.Mr. Trump hasn\u2019t yet vanquished Stop Trump efforts by mainstream Republicans who loathe his coarseness, divisive rhetoric and cloudy electoral prospects.Mr. Ryan\u2019s predecessor, John A. Boehner, talks of tapping the current speaker for the nomination should Mr. Trump fail to secure a first-ballot victory at the Republican convention this summer.But blocking Mr. Trump by pushing through someone else \u2014 \u201cI\u2019m not running for president,\u201d Mr. Ryan insisted \u2014 would create its own problem. Blue-collar Republicans are flocking to Mr. Trump\u2019s candidacy out of frustration with the political system\u2019s failure to improve their economic prospects.Even if they don\u2019t start \u201criots\u201d over a rival\u2019s elevation, as Mr. Trump has suggested, there\u2019s little reason to expect them to rally behind Mr. Ryan\u2019s economic agenda. On taxes as well as trade and entitlements, many simply don\u2019t support it.In the interview, Mr. Ryan dismissed the \u201cridiculous notion\u201d of assessing tax-overhaul proposals according to their effects on Americans of different income levels. \u201cPeople don\u2019t think like that,\u201d he explained.Divides like that \u2014 over dry policy doctrine or gut-level appeal, or both \u2014 make the satisfying clarification Mr. Ryan yearns for ever more distant. They increase the chance that a Democrat will win the presidency in November for the fifth time in the past seven elections, even if Republicans hold one or both houses of Congress.And that would represent the outcome of Mr. Ryan\u2019s nightmares. Mr. Boehner abandoned the speaker\u2019s gavel in part because he could not balance governing with a liberal Democratic president while leading a conservative caucus. Mr. Ryan, who accepted the job reluctantly, said he feels \u201cvery frayed\u201d nerves even now.\u201cWhat we\u2019re worried about is having more of the same,\u201d Mr. Ryan concluded. He has good reason.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Puerto Rico Braces for Its Own Zika Epidemic", "Date": "2016-03-19", "News": "Intensive efforts to stop the virus have begun on the island, where a quarter of the population will get it within a year, the C.D.C. predicts.Supported bySAN JUAN, P.R. \u2014 On an inexorable march across the hemisphere, the Zika virus has begun spreading through Puerto Rico, now the United States\u2019 front line in a looming epidemic.The outbreak is expected to be worse here than anywhere else in the country. The island, a warm, wet paradise veined with gritty poverty, is the ideal environment for the mosquitoes carrying the virus. The landscape is littered with abandoned houses and discarded tires that are perfect breeding grounds for the insects. Some homes and schools lack window screens and air-conditioning, exposing residents to almost constant bites.\u201cI\u2019m very concerned,\u201d Dr. Thomas R. Frieden, the C.D.C. director, said in an interview after a recent three-day visit to Puerto Rico. \u201cThere could be thousands of infections of pregnant women this year.\u201dThe epidemic is unfolding in one of the country\u2019s most popular vacation destinations, where planes and cruise ships disembark thousands of tourists daily. Anyone could carry the virus back home, seeding a mosquito-borne outbreak or transmitting it sexually.Health officials here have begun intensive efforts to stop the virus, which has been linked to abnormally small heads and brain damage in babies born to infected mothers, and to paralysis in adults.Trucks are rumbling through communities, shrouding them in insecticide. Schools are being outfitted with screens to protect children, and hundreds of thousands of old tires have been retrieved and disposed of. Officials have warned scores of island towns that they must clean up the detritus in which standing water collects, incubating new mosquitoes. And the C.D.C. is preparing to spend tens of millions of dollars to blunt the spread of the virus.Still, officials are not optimistic that they will succeed.\u201cI\u2019m not going to oversell this,\u201d said Dr. Johnny Rull\u00e1n, a former Puerto Rico secretary of health who has come out of retirement to advise the governor. \u201cIt\u2019s not a perfect world. We\u2019ll do as much as we can.\u201dIn desperation, officials are focusing much of their effort on protecting one group in particular, pregnant women, instead of trying to shield the entire population.The epidemic arrived earlier than predicted. The territory\u2019s first Zika case was confirmed in December, and the governor declared a health emergency on Feb. 5.Even though there are just 249 confirmed cases \u2014 24 of them in pregnant women \u2014 doctors assume many more are going unreported.In the next six months, the environment will get hotter, wetter and buggier, and the number of infections will rise.At the moment, the island is where northeast Brazil was in late 2014, when cases of a \u201cmystery disease\u201d with a rash, low fever and red eyes began appearing. By spring 2015, cases of Zika infection began overwhelming hospital emergency rooms.In Puerto Rico, there has thus far been only one case of Guillain-Barr\u00e9 paralysis linked to Zika infection. If microcephaly appears here, it will probably not be until fall, Dr. Rull\u00e1n said.In some respects, Puerto Rico is lucky. Virtually every doctor and nurse here has been alerted and knows what to look for.The island\u2019s emergency response and health care systems are flawed but well organized. Teams usually on call for hurricanes are now being trained to visit homes, empty standing water and spray for mosquitoes.Why scientists are worried about the growing epidemic and its effects on pregnant women, and how to avoid the infection.Perhaps most important, the government operates dozens of mother-and-child nutrition clinics, which are used by more than 90 percent of pregnant women here. Clinic staff members are calling pregnant clients, inviting them to attend 20-minute lectures about the Zika virus. About 5,000 women have already attended.\u201cWe all should smell like this.\u201dHer seven listeners reacted with varying degrees of concern. Everywhere on the island there are women so tired of scary messages about mosquitoes, and so used to being bitten, that some do not take the warnings seriously.Monica Rivera, 30, who is in her third trimester of pregnancy, said she used citronella candles at home to ward off mosquitoes. She arrived wearing a small pink top and shorts.\u201cI know I should cover up more,\u201d she said, \u201cbut it\u2019s hot.\u201dFamily and friends were pitching in to protect her, she said. Her father had cleared her rain gutters, and a neighbor who owned a \u201cflea machine\u201d had fumigated her house for free.Ashley Vega, 21, who is 10 weeks pregnant, said she was scared. She wore an ankle-length dress and repellent on her sandal-shod feet.\u201cI take baths in the stuff,\u201d she joked. \u201cI put it on in the morning and in the afternoon, and again when I sleep. And my mother is crazy with the bug spray.\u201dOutside class, Ms. Morales, the teacher, who wore a striped minidress, was asked if she was wearing repellent to set an example.\u201cOh, not today,\u201d she said. \u201cIt smells. I usually wear pants.\u201dEach attendee was supposed to get a kit containing insect repellent, a mosquito net and, because new research shows the virus may be spread by sexual contact, condoms. But Ms. Morales said she had received only 30 kits.\u201cThey ran out the first day,\u201d she said.The mosquito can reproduce in as little as a bottle cap\u2019s worth of water, \u201cand you just can\u2019t remove all the standing water in Puerto Rico,\u201d Dr. Frieden said.The governor\u2019s office recently announced detailed plans to attack mosquito hot spots: cemeteries, abandoned houses, auto junkyards, unsealed septic tanks and piles of old tires.Each of the island\u2019s 78 municipalities has until April 1 \u201cto clean up their acts,\u201d Dr. Rull\u00e1n said.As of Friday, 900,000 of an estimated one million discarded tires had been picked up and moved to depots far from residential areas.Much of the work was done by convicted drug abusers living in a network of halfway houses who can earn early release through public service, Dr. Rull\u00e1n said.Many of the island\u2019s hundreds of schools have no screens or air-conditioning. Since high school girls account for about 20 percent of all pregnancies here, officials plan to screen the windows to keep out mosquitoes.That alone is a big job. \u201cThat means measuring each window,\u201d Dr. Rull\u00e1n said. \u201cAnd what are you going to do about doors if you have 50 kids running in and out?\u201dAs a first step, the public school dress code has been changed so girls can wear pants, and teachers are supposed to give mosquito repellent to all girls.In the island\u2019s 109 cemeteries and its many auto junkyards and public dumps, mosquito-control teams have begun spraying pesticides that kill the insect\u2019s larvae. But the work is never-ending because rain washes the pesticides away.Moreover, the island is dotted with hundreds of abandoned homes with water-collecting birdbaths and pools. Puerto Rico has 500,000 septic tanks, each of which can produce up to 1,500 mosquitoes a day if left unsealed.Teams cannot enter an abandoned property or screen a septic tank when the owner is absent, \u201cso we\u2019re asking for a new law letting us enter,\u201d Dr. Rull\u00e1n said.Here is a look at the most prominent rumors and theories about Zika virus, along with responses from scientists.The ideal, he said, would be to spray every property within 150 yards \u2014 the distance a mosquito normally travels \u2014 of every pregnant woman\u2019s home.The island\u2019s birthrate is about 10 per 1,000 women, and nearly 100 women a day become pregnant here. Just finding them all would be a gargantuan task.Other mosquito-control efforts are even less effective.Tests at several sites have found that its ability to kill mosquitoes has significantly faded, so the island will have to choose a new pesticide and retrain workers to use it.Even with the right chemical, the impact of fogging is dubious. Aedes mosquitoes typically hatch in gardens and slip into houses to hide in closets and under beds. When the spray trucks go by, many people close their windows, locking themselves in with the enemy.Aedes mosquitoes are \u201csip feeders\u201d and bite several times for each blood meal. The number required to make an infection likely for one member of a household is as few as three mosquitoes, experts have found.Puerto Rico still has a nine-month supply, Dr. Lenhart said, and the E.P.A. may issue an emergency use permit for more.Mosquitoes are not the only mode of Zika transmission, however. Health authorities here have also been forced to grapple with an unexpected twist: the discovery that sex spreads the virus.The government has frozen the price of condoms, threatening stores with fines of up to $10,000 if they raise the cost. (It did the same for repellent and window screens.)At nutrition clinics, teachers like Ms. Morales have struggled to explain, as they hand out condoms, why the partners even of pregnant women should wear them.In a radio interview in January, Puerto Rico\u2019s health secretary, Dr. Ana R\u00edus, advised women to delay pregnancy altogether, if possible, until the epidemic is over.But local radio commentators accused her of alarmism, and Roberto Gonz\u00e1lez, archbishop of the Catholic Church, publicly criticized the government\u2019s condom distribution plans. Instead, he counseled people to \u201cpractice self-discipline, which we believe is the only rational attitude and faith.\u201dIt will be many months before officials know whether their efforts have slowed the advance of the Zika virus.\u201cCome October, when the babies start being born,\u201d Dr. Rull\u00e1n said, \u201cI\u2019ll know if we acted in time or not.\u201dAn article last Sunday about the Zika virus in Puerto Rico misstated the role that Dr. Johnny Rull\u00e1n has played in public health the last 31 years. Dr. Rull\u00e1n has held several high-ranking public health roles in Puerto Rico and elsewhere, including two stints as the territory\u2019s secretary of health, but he was not Puerto Rico\u2019s secretary of health for 31 years.Omaya Sosa Pascual contributed reporting.Like the Science Times page on Facebook.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Market for Chinese Art Is Increasingly in China", "Date": "2016-03-25", "News": "Supported byThe art market is feeling under pressure from the outside world.But there is one area of collecting that is still capable of setting exceptional prices, seemingly regardless of where it is being sold or what is happening in the world: historic Chinese art.In France on March 12, a trio of Ming dynasty gilt-bronze statues of seated Buddhas sold for 6.3 million euros with fees, about $7 million, at the Bordeaux auctioneers Briscadieu to one of 20 Asian bidders in the sales room. The 15th-century statues were estimated at \u20ac400,000 to \u20ac600,000. The statues, thought to be from an original set of five \u201cGreat Buddhas of Wisdom\u201d from a provincial temple in China, were part of a collection formed by an military doctor in Asia in the early 20th century.\u201cIt was an incredible price,\u201d the auctioneer, Antoine Briscadieu, said of the result, the highest price ever achieved at this family auction house. \u201cUnknown pieces that have stayed in the same family for 100 years are very attractive to Chinese collectors. They know the pieces are very authentic. Confidence is very important to them.\u201dAnd yet Chinese decorative art and antiques was one of the few auction sectors that grew in 2015, according to the Netherlands-based European Fine Art Foundation, or Tefaf, whose annual art market report was published on March 9. Auctions of Chinese porcelain, jades, furniture and other antiques fractionally increased year-on-year from $2.1 billion in 2014 to $2.2 billion. Though this is still far below the heights of the $3.4 billion generated in 2011, the sector nonetheless \u201cperformed significantly better in terms of annual growth than fine art in China and many other countries,\u201d the report says.The strengths and weaknesses of the market for historic Chinese art were evident this month at the annual Asia Week New York promotion, which ran from March 10 to 19.The event, whose eighth edition featured 45 galleries and five auction houses, achieved a total of $130 million in sales, the organizers said. Last year, Asia Week raised $360 million, thanks to a $131.7 million boost from Christie\u2019s blockbuster sale of the collection of the dealer Robert Hatfield Ellsworth. Perhaps more significantly, this year\u2019s total was also well down from the $200 million the event achieved in 2014.\u201cMainland Chinese are in a more cautious and selective mood now,\u201d said James Lally, a participating New York dealer, whose exhibition of ancient Chinese jades nonetheless found buyers for 62 out of its 75 pieces, ranging in price from $5,000 to $500,000. \u201cYet China is creating new collectors every day, and when a mainland Chinese begins collecting, he always collects Chinese art.\u201d He added that about 40 percent of the sales at his show went to buyers from greater China.The centerpiece of Mr. Lally\u2019s exhibition was a group of half a dozen jades from the early 20th-century collection of the American investment banker Eugene Meyer and his wife, Agnes, who donated many works to the Freer Gallery of Art in Washington. The Freer bought another Meyer piece, a circa 3,300-2,250 B.C. Neolithic jade \u201ccong\u201d ritual object for about $500,000.Back in the 20th century, such historic Chinese pieces formed part of the diversified \u201cclassic\u201d taste of many wealthy American and European collectors.As many dealers point out, this kind of historically aware collecting has fallen out of fashion, at least in the West. Today\u2019s investment-conscious taste favors contemporary art.\u201cI don\u2019t see who is stepping in to replace the American and European buyers we used to have,\u201d said John Berwald, a London dealer in Chinese antiques who exhibited at Asia Week New York. \u201cContemporary has taken a lot of money out of the art world. The Chinese are fantastically keen, but they are predominantly auction buyers.\u201dThe Tefaf report calculates that 82 percent of the value of last year\u2019s auction sales of Chinese decorative arts and antiques took place in China. That percentage is set to rise in 2016 as Western sellers increasingly choose to offer their finest pieces in Hong Kong rather than New York or London. Descendants of the mid-20th century British collector Roger Pilkington, for example, have chosen to sell all 100 lots of his Chinese ceramics on April 6 at Sotheby\u2019s Hong Kong. The auction is estimated to raise at least $29 million.Wealthy Westerners, if they do buy Chinese art, now tend to buy the art of today. Many are banking on it being a lucrative investment once China produces its hoped-for boom in contemporary art collecting.The world\u2019s museums continue, by and large, to regard the best Chinese Neolithic jades, Tang dynasty pottery figures and Ming dynasty bronzes as among the timeless achievements of human civilization.And the new wealth of China still values this heritage and is prepared to pay for it.\u201cThe future of the market for Chinese art is exceptionally strong,\u201d said Mr. Berwald, the London antiques dealer. \u201cBut that future is in China.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "How Wage Insurance Could Ease Economic Inequality", "Date": "2016-03-11", "News": "Supported byEconomic ViewWage insurance may not be on your radar, but it should be. It helps people who have lost their jobs and cannot find new ones that pay as well. That assistance can reduce economic inequality while providing incentives for unemployed people to go back to work quickly.What\u2019s more, wage insurance has bipartisan support, at least in its current limited form. We ought to expand it, both through government and in the private sector.There is a catch, though. The Bush-Obama insurance is limited to people who have lost their jobs to foreign workers. If a computer is now doing the work you used to do, this insurance won\u2019t help you.The current insurance has other limits, too. It is restricted to American workers over the age of 50 who have been earning wages up to $50,000 a year, were employed full time and had to take a different, lower-paying job. For people in such circumstances, the insurance provides an amount equal to half the difference in pay, for two years, capped at a total of $10,000.But it remains insurance, and in a vibrant capitalist economy, expanding it makes sense on theoretical grounds. Insurance is a type of risk management. Rational people would want to pay for this benefit so that they could take promising but risky employment opportunities. It could help spur innovation in the economy.With a potentially expensive program, financing is critical. Like Social Security, an expanded wage insurance system might best be financed by a payroll tax. To be fair, people with wages just below the $50,000 limit \u2014 who might receive more money from the program than lower-income workers \u2014 should pay higher premiums. True insurance needs to be priced appropriately.There is another objection to wage insurance. It can create a moral hazard \u2014 an incentive to take a lower-paying, and perhaps less demanding, job than the one the person lost. Most people will agree that people who want to work harder and at unpleasant jobs to earn more income should not be discouraged from doing so. There is a safeguard against this in the current plan, which limits benefits to two years. That reduces moral hazard, but at the expense of providing benefits with a longer horizon. There are always trade-offs.The role of government is important in this case because for social insurance, governments have a significant advantage in putting into place big ideas that are difficult to market. That was true for federal Old-Age, Survivors and Disability Insurance in the Social Security system starting in 1935, which was followed by an explosion of additional private pension, life insurance and disability plans. Government is needed again now.But ultimately, there should be two insurance systems, a government one that is limited to assisting lower-income workers and a private one that allows everyone \u2014 including those with higher incomes \u2014 to buy insurance against wage loss.Appropriate pricing for livelihood insurance would also avoid selection bias \u2014 people with exceptionally insecure jobs signing up in disproportionately large numbers \u2014 a problem that government wage insurance can avoid by being offered to everyone.If the private sector offered livelihood insurance, people in riskier careers would be charged higher insurance premiums. At the same time, by reducing wage risk, the insurance would encourage people to be more adventuresome and entrepreneurial. Risk management and insurance costs might then become essential elements of career planning. Employers in risky industries might buy livelihood insurance for their employees as a benefit.If these concepts seem unfamiliar, that is partly because privately issued livelihood insurance is not common today, if it exists at all. But that could change quickly. Expanding government wage insurance now might clear the way for the private sector. At a time of rising economic inequality and job dislocation, wage insurance makes a great deal of sense.Robert J. Shiller is Sterling Professor of Economics at Yale.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How America Can Put Thailand Back on Track", "Date": "2016-03-22", "News": "Supported byOp-Ed ContributorsBANGKOK \u2014 When generals led by Prayuth Chan-ocha ousted an elected civilian government here in 2014, they vowed to restore order and eradicate corruption. But since seizing power, the junta has become increasingly erratic, incompetent and repressive.The economy is stagnating. The threat of social unrest is rising. The Prayuth government has recently completed a draft constitution that would ensure real power remains in the hands of the military even after a formal return to electoral democracy.How to set Thailand back on track is a matter largely for Thais. But America, which has been the dominant foreign player in Thai politics since World War II, can help rein in the junta\u2019s increasingly dictatorial ways by isolating it from its support base among traditional Bangkok-based elites.During the early years of the Cold War, the United States government threw its weight behind the Thai military and the monarchy, treating them as essential allies in its own effort to turn Thailand into a rampart against communism. American assistance started flowing in the early 1950s, with military aid growing as the Communists gained ground in Vietnam.By 1966, there were more than 25,000 American soldiers stationed in Thailand. Most American bombing missions were flown out of here, and the annual cost of the bombs dropped over North Vietnam and Laos exceeded the size of the Thai economy at the time.Meanwhile, Washington turned a blind eye to abuses and corruption. The Thai military exaggerated the Communist threat at home to curb dissent, sometimes resorting to political killings and summary executions. Gen. Sarit Thanarat, a staunch American ally who ruled from 1957 until his death in 1963, is said to have amassed over $100 million. Senior generals were involved in the trafficking of drugs grown in northern Thailand and bordering regions.America\u2019s patronage diminished with the end of the Vietnam War, but its effects remain today. The leaders of the 2014 coup, who came of age during the 1960s and 1970s, appear to look on democracy like they once did on Communism: as a foreign ideology that threatens the network of Bangkok-based royalist elites they were trained to protect.The generals abhor the alternative power network centering on Thaksin Shinawatra, a telecommunications tycoon turned politician, that emerged in the wake of the 1997-1998 Asian financial crisis. Elected prime minister in 2001, Mr. Thaksin pursued various economic programs catering to the rural poor. This brought him widespread popularity, which meant he did not need to rely on traditional military and royalist patronage networks. Partly for that reason, the army deposed him in 2006; in 2014, it was his sister Yingluck, elected in 2011, who was ousted. (In both instances, the palace promptly recognized the military governments that took over.)The military\u2019s methods today also reflect the legacy of past American involvement. The Thai army\u2019s Internal Security Operations Command, which recent military governments have relied on to clamp down on critics, is an offspring of the Communist Suppression Operations Command that was created with Washington\u2019s assistance in the 1960s. Both outfits were implicated in Cold War-era atrocities.Counterinsurgency and psychological warfare tactics, a centerpiece of American-Thai cooperation in the 1950s and 1960s, inform the junta\u2019s campaign of \u201creturning happiness to the people.\u201d That program also largely amounts to spreading nationalist and royalist propaganda. It subjects critics of the Prayuth government to \u201cattitude adjustment\u201d \u2014 junta-speak for harassing, detaining and, some say, torturing detractors.Yet the United States has done little so far to curb such excesses or pressure the junta into relinquishing power, aside from making an occasional critical statement and freezing a few million dollars in military aid.The annual American-Thai joint military exercises known as Cobra Gold have continued to be held, if in reduced form, since the coup. Last month at the United States-Asean summit meeting in California, even as President Obama said that America continued \u201cto encourage a return to civilian rule\u201d in Thailand, he posed for chummy photos with General Prayuth.Washington instead should isolate the Thai military from its traditional backers to deprive the junta of a crucial source of legitimacy and support. Acting with the European Union, Japan and other allies, America should penalize not only the generals involved in the 2014 coup, but also the civilians the government has appointed to its rubber-stamping institutions.The United States is in a strong position to do so. Wealthy Thais have shoveled assets overseas at an astonishing rate since Mr. Thaksin was brought down in 2006. Their annual investments abroad have increased twelvefold, according to the Bank of Thailand, and now equal one-third of Thailand\u2019s G.D.P. Because of longstanding financial and personal ties to the West, much of this wealth is in the United States and European Union countries.The junta has been busy deepening economic and military ties with Beijing. But its \u201cChina card\u201d is too weak to offset Washington\u2019s continued importance. Thailand\u2019s primary security concerns \u2014 terrorism, refugees, a Muslim insurgency in the south \u2014 are still best served by cooperating with the United States. And if the country\u2019s conservative elites have fallen out of love with democracy, they continue to favor the West over China for their investments, their children\u2019s education and their holidays.Taking advantage of this exposure, the United States should lead an effort to subject these elites and the generals involved in the 2014 coup to restrictions on travel and financial transactions.According to a 2014 update of a classic study published by the Peterson Institute, 16 of the 35 sanctions programs deployed from 1970 to 2014 that were aimed at \u201cmodest policy change\u201d were successful. The study also showed that such measures work better when their goal is moderate and when they are used to pressure otherwise friendly governments, rather than enemies.The sanctions we propose are not aimed at imposing regime change. Their goal is to accelerate Thailand\u2019s return to electoral democracy, which the junta claims to want, and under a system in which elected governments are free of military interference. Thailand\u2019s 1997 Constitution, which is widely seen as the most pluralistic in the country\u2019s history, could serve as a guide.For decades America buttressed the Thai military to advance its own interests, at the expense of Thailand\u2019s democratic development. It\u2019s now time it try fixing the problem it helped create. As Thailand\u2019s most influential ally, the United States should do what it can to stop the junta from setting the country back any further.Tom Felix Joehnk writes for The Economist from Bangkok.

{"Headline": "Exemptions May Color Deal to Lift New York State\u2019s Minimum Wage", "Date": "2016-03-25", "News": "Supported byALBANY \u2014 Over the last several years, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo has repeatedly invoked a mantra of New York as \u201cone state,\u201d a place where all people, upstate and downstate, are treated equally.Except, perhaps, when it comes to the minimum wage.\u201cMy proposal is $15 upstate, downstate,\u201d he said. A moment later, after a reporter\u2019s question about a possible $13-an-hour compromise, or a longer timetable, he was curt: \u201cI support my proposal.\u201dAs he has done before, Mr. Cuomo said the economic realities in upstate regions were weighing on talks with State Senator John J. Flanagan, the Long Island Republican who serves as majority leader, and the State Assembly speaker, Carl E. Heastie, a Bronx Democrat.\u201cYou have different economies in this state,\u201d the governor said, noting the 10 different economic regions identified by his administration. Then he added, \u201cNow, you can have more nuances, you can say Long Island is a separate region, you know, that\u2019s part of the conversation.\u201dThe stakes for Mr. Cuomo would seem to be significant: Since January, he has made the $15 hourly wage and a paid-family-leave bill two of his major legislative priorities, and both are likely to be part of the state budget due on April 1. On Friday, he said that he was having \u201cgood conversations\u201d about the issue of family leave, though questions about its length and funding were still percolating.Opponents of the $15 minimum wage fear that Mr. Flanagan and other Republicans may be compelled to accept the plan, to avoid alienating moderate voters, who could hand control of the Senate to the Democrats.\u201cWhen you start hearing about carve-outs and caveats and bifurcated wage, it\u2019s almost like Albany now is starting to acknowledge that there is an impact on the upstate economy,\u201d he said.On that point, even ardent supporters of the $15 minimum wage seem to concede that some businesses, particularly those in rural areas, deserve special treatment.\u201cWe all know that the city of New York and downstate is a different economic situation than upstate New York,\u201d said Mr. Heastie, adding that dairy farmers, for instance, are subject to federal formulas that regulate prices. Asked about other industries, he said, \u201cIf we\u2019re going to take an action that causes a raise in their expenses and they can\u2019t set their revenues, then I think it\u2019s the state\u2019s responsibility to deal with that.\u201dFor his part, Mr. Flanagan seemed relaxed when asked about the negotiations this week, calling discussions with Mr. Cuomo and Mr. Heastie fruitful. But it also seemed that he would like to extract concessions from the two men, including eliminating the ability of the governor to call a state wage board \u2014 which was responsible for the $15-an-hour wage for fast-food workers, without legislative input \u2014 as well as getting traction on some of his own legislative priorities, including loosening business regulations and expanding small-business and middle-class tax cuts. Reforms to workers\u2019 compensation might also be in the mix.Mr. Flanagan strongly rebuffed notions that Republicans are being forced \u2014 by political pressure \u2014 to embrace the $15 minimum wage, noting past increases that have passed with the support of members of his party.\u201cYou have unique circumstances that should always be taken into account,\u201d he said, adding, \u201cWe believe in working men and women.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Europe\u2019s Border Checks Become Economic Choke Points", "Date": "2016-03-01", "News": "Supported byFREILASSING, Germany \u2014 Traffic along one of Europe\u2019s busiest highways, which used to flow unimpeded, now often backs up for miles at a newly installed checkpoint, where a phalanx of German police officers screens trucks and cars for hidden migrants.At this border crossing, as a result, Austrians who work in Germany have trouble getting to their jobs. Many companies in Germany must wait days longer for deliveries of food, machine parts and other goods. Shoppers who made quick weekend jaunts to Freilassing\u2019s stores now mostly stay away.\u201cIt\u2019s really bad,\u201d said Karl Pichler, the owner of a large gardening center here in Freilassing, whose sales of tulips, rose bushes and other plants has slumped as longtime customers from Austria have stopped coming.But as the bloc now grapples with the biggest migration crisis since World War II, the revival of checkpoints on some of the region\u2019s most important transport routes is crimping commerce and threatening to cost billions of euros in lost business just as Europe is recovering from a six-year economic slump.With no end to the migrant crisis in sight, some national governments are pushing to expand the number of checkpoints around Europe and extend their use for up to two years. The shift is not only straining political and social cohesion, but also threatening the region\u2019s postwar principle of peace through prosperity.While some calls for suspending Schengen might be political posturing, critics worry that border controls will become a fact of life.\u201cOne after another, we close the borders, and once they are all closed, we will see that the economic cost is huge,\u201d Jean-Claude Juncker, the president of the European Commission, warned the European Parliament in January.Of the 28 countries in the European Union, 22 have passport-free arrangements, with Britain as one of the notable exceptions. But the lines are quickly being redrawn across Europe.Since autumn, Austria, Denmark, France, Norway and Sweden have joined Germany in imposing and extending temporary border checks. Belgium last week temporarily shut its border with France. Fences have gone up on various other borders including ones in Hungary, Serbia and Croatia, and along the Austrian-Slovenian frontier.European governments and research institutions have started tallying the potential damage.Open borders drive growth, economic efficiency and jobs, said Vincent Aussilloux, the director of France Strat\u00e9gie, the French government\u2019s economic planning agency. \u201cThat\u2019s what we\u2019d put in danger,\u201d Mr. Aussilloux said, \u201cif we abandoned Schengen indefinitely.\u201dFor Doruk Tumer, a truck driver for a Turkish delivery company, the trip to Germany has become a roadblock-riddled odyssey.Previously, his route from Turkey and Greece through the west Balkans \u2014 a path similar to the one used by nearly one million migrants last year \u2014 took about five days. Now, Mr. Tumer said, it can last up to 12 days, while the former two-hour drive through Austria sometimes takes more than a day.\u201cTime is money,\u201d he said, noting that costs have risen 30 percent because of longer delivery times, higher refrigeration charges for perishable goods and the occasional use of a second driver to overcome delays.It is not clear that the European Union is ready to shelve Schengen just yet. Officials are seeking ways to secure Europe\u2019s outer boundaries, so that countries within the bloc do not have to seal theirs.In particular, European officials are pressing Greece, which constitutes Europe\u2019s southern frontier, to sharply strengthen its refugee controls by mid-May. Should Greece fail to comply, border controls like the one at Freilassing could be imposed through 2018 or beyond.For big companies operating through Europe, the impact has been manageable thus far.Ikea, the Sweden-based furniture group, said border controls had, so far, not disrupted its European commerce because it has worked closely with transport companies to ensure deliveries.Amazon, which has 29 hubs in the European Union, is ready to make sure its operations continue \u201cregardless of external factors,\u201d said Roy Perticucci, vice president of the company\u2019s European business.But in many corners of Europe, border checks are already having a costly impact. At the Oresund bridge, an eight-mile span that carries truck, car and train traffic between Sweden and Denmark, more than 15,000 commuters now contend with two identification checks daily, because both countries are requiring frontier inspections.The delays are costing the Danish Rail Company, or DSB, \u20ac1.2 million a month in lost business as trains are canceled and commuters opt to drive, said Tony Bispeskov, a spokesman for DSB.This month, the Copenhagen offices of Ferring Pharmaceuticals started providing buses to take employees home to Sweden so they would not have to endure train delays. Weekend shoppers heading from Copenhagen to Malmo, Sweden, \u201chave been scared away,\u201d Mr. Bispeskov added.The Netherlands, home to some of Europe\u2019s biggest exporters and importers, is also feeling vulnerable. While the Dutch have not yet ordered border checks, companies warn that costs would surge if Germany blocked their common border or if roadblocks continued elsewhere.The Dutch company FleuraMetz, which delivers roses, tulips and orchids to shops elsewhere in Europe and in North America, has already faced backups of at least 12 hours at Calais, France, near the road entrance to the Eurotunnel that links the Continent to Britain.The company, based in Aalsmeer, sends trucks through the tunnel to reach Heathrow Airport near London for shipments to the United States. At one point, the bottlenecks were so bad that FleuraMetz decided to fly flowers to Heathrow to catch connecting flights, raising costs on deliveries to New York by around 25 percent.In Germany, at the border near Freilassing, the police said they were working to limit the damage.\u201cIt\u2019s not in our interest to cause huge delays,\u201d said Rainer Scharf, a police spokesman. At the single-line checkpoint, police waved through trucks that bore inspection stickers from Austria, but stopped vehicles containing \u201cpeople who look Arabic,\u201d Mr. Scharf said.Today, the temporary border facility looks permanent, with offices and computer terminals, and a soaring white tent sheltering dozens of police officers. So many officers have been sent here that every local hotel is fully booked.Other local merchants are not faring so well. \u201cMost business in town has dropped tremendously,\u201d said Mr. Pichler, the florist, who worries he may soon have to lay off employees.Still, Mr. Pichler said, given the influx of migrants to Germany, the border controls are necessary.\u201cIt\u2019s the right thing to do, even if we take a hit,\u201d he said. \u201cWe need to get this migrant situation under control.\u201dLiz Alderman reported from Freilassing, Germany, and James Kanter from Aalsmeer, the Netherlands.

{"Headline": "Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump Circling Each Other in Michigan", "Date": "2016-03-04", "News": "Supported byThe presidential race began to shift in earnest to the industrial Midwest on Friday, with pivotal contests looming in Michigan, Ohio and Illinois, and Donald J. Trump and Hillary Clinton crossing each other\u2019s paths in a preview of what the general election could hold.The region is one where Mrs. Clinton performed quite well in the Democratic primaries in 2008, beating Barack Obama in Ohio, Indiana and Pennsylvania (Mr. Obama did not compete in Michigan.) And when she visits a manufacturing center in Detroit on Friday, she plans to reveal a job-creation and wage-growth program, according to her campaign.But the region \u2014 especially Michigan, which holds its primary on Tuesday \u2014 has been more welcoming to Republicans lately as its manufacturing-based economy has suffered.Mr. Trump, with his pointed messages about punishing American companies that send jobs overseas and taking an aggressive stance against countries like China that devalue their currency, is also finding an audience. The New York businessman holds a 10-point lead over his closest competitors in Michigan\u2019s Republican primary, according to a poll released this week by The Detroit Free Press.Mr. Trump greeted a crowd in Warren, Mich., on Friday morning to raucous chants of \u201cBuild the wall!\u201d and insisted, in an echo of his campaign slogan, that he would restore greatness to the American auto industry.\u201cThis is car country \u2014 rapidly not becoming car country, but we\u2019re going to keep it car country,\u201d he said, imploring the crowd to vote for him on Tuesday. \u201cMexico is becoming the car capital of the world, whether you like it or not,\u201d he said.\u201cIf you get laid off on Tuesday I still want your vote,\u201d he added. \u201cI\u2019ll get you a new job, don\u2019t worry about it.\u201dMrs. Clinton was set to speak in Detroit, not far away from where Mr. Trump appeared on Friday morning. Later, Mr. Trump was heading to the northern tip of the state, more conservative territory, for another event.After Michigan, Illinois and Ohio vote on March 15.On the Republican side, Ohio awards the primary winner all of its 66 delegates, making it a contest with considerable influence. John R. Kasich, the Ohio governor, had been strongly favored to win \u2014 so much so that Senator Marco Rubio decided to essentially abandon the state and refocus his efforts on Florida, which votes the same day and also awards its 99 delegates in a winner-take-all fashion. But Mr. Trump has recently been gaining in polls in Ohio, edging ahead of the governor.The fallout from the Republican debate the night before continued on Friday as Republicans absorbed the hostile and often crude tenor of the shout-fest, which kicked off with Mr. Trump assuring a national audience that his manhood was of adequate size.\u201cThis is a new low in presidential politics,\u201d said Mitt Romney, who on Thursday denounced Mr. Trump as dangerous and dishonest in an plea to Republicans to band together to stop the party\u2019s front-runner.Even Us Weekly, the entertainment magazine and website, weighed in. In an article about Mr. Trump\u2019s reference to his anatomy, it captured some Twitter reaction that seemed to sum up the general sense of revulsion. \u201cI wanna die,\u201d the article quoted a Twitter commenter as saying.A spokesman for Mr. Rubio said in an interview with CNN on Friday that the debate had descended to the point that he sent his 6-year-old son out of the room.Mr. Rubio, speaking to voters in Topeka, Kan., on Friday morning, seemed somewhat contrite about the ugly turn the debate took. \u201cI\u2019m not here to attack anyone,\u201d he said. \u201cWe did plenty of that last night, I suppose.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Clinton\u2019s Bold Vision, Hidden in Plain Sight?", "Date": "2016-03-17", "News": "Supported byOp-Ed ContributorsWith a string of major wins in Tuesday\u2019s primaries, Hillary Clinton finally seems to have a secure hold on the Democratic nomination. Yet her struggle to define herself in the race remains a top challenge of her campaign.Mrs. Clinton has put forth an ambitious and broadly popular policy agenda: family and medical leave, continued financial reform, improvements in the Affordable Care Act, investments in infrastructure and scientific research, measures to tackle global warming and improve air and water quality, and so on.But voters and pundits alike complain that she\u2019s a cold-eyed realist who hasn\u2019t articulated what George H. W. Bush once wistfully referred to as \u201cthe vision thing.\u201d Instead, it\u2019s Bernie Sanders who has been cast as the visionary in the Democratic contest, an idealist brimming with inspiring (if often unrealistic) proposals.But Mrs. Clinton does have an ambitious vision, and it\u2019s one that should be inspiring. The fact that it remains mostly hidden from view reveals more about our current political environment than it does about her \u2014 more about how we understand (or misunderstand) our nation\u2019s past and present than about the comparative merits of her governing philosophy.A few decades ago, Mrs. Clinton would have been seen as a common political type: an evidence-oriented pragmatist committed to using public authority to solve big problems. Her proposals clearly indicate that she believes in an active and responsive government that supplements, channels and polices markets. Moreover, unlike Mr. Sanders, she sees this role as primarily focused on correcting the shortcomings of weakly regulated markets rather than redistributing income and wealth. In a phrase, Mrs. Clinton believes in a \u201cmixed economy\u201d in which government serves as an essential supplement to and regulator of markets, using its strong \u201cthumb\u201d (as the political economist Charles Lindblom once described it) to assist and counterbalance the nimble \u201cfingers\u201d of the market.In the middle decades of the 20th century, this pragmatic problem-solving mentality had a prominent place in both parties. Some issues were deeply divisive: labor rights and national health insurance, for example, and civil rights. Nonetheless, a bipartisan governing coalition that included leaders from both business and labor proved remarkably willing to endorse and improve the mixed economy to promote prosperity.The embrace of an active government, working in creative tension with the private sector, also sowed the seeds for technological and health advances that are still flowering today, including the creation of vaccines and antibiotics to the development of sophisticated medical treatments for hypertension and cancer. Virtually every major computing technology \u2014 magnetic core memory, graphics displays, multiple central processors \u2014 has its roots in government procurement or financing.We are trapped in a vicious cycle: Disillusionment encourages dysfunction, and dysfunction empowers those who spread further disillusionment and dysfunction.Breaking out of this cycle is particularly hard for candidates for public office. Their primary imperative is to win an election, not change the conversation. A candidate who wants to buck the trend must be willing to take on more than just campaign opponents (and Mrs. Clinton will certainly face fierce attacks for proposing to raise taxes and create new programs in the general election). They must also overcome a juggernaut of organized anti-government forces: market-worshiping think tanks, right-wing media, a more staunchly conservative business leadership. In the face of a skeptical electorate, it\u2019s a tough sell \u2014 even for Democrats.Mrs. Clinton is heir to an enormously successful bipartisan governing tradition. Yet this tradition has been disowned by the Republican Party and has lost allure within a significant segment of the Democratic Party; it also runs sharply against the grain of current public sentiments about government and politicians. In this hostile environment, it should come as no surprise that Mrs. Clinton has proved reluctant to lead the charge for a more balanced discussion of government\u2019s role.Yet because Mrs. Clinton has had little success articulating her basic governing approach, the case for her has instead come to seem almost entirely instrumental \u2014 that she has the best chance of being elected or would be better at haggling with Republicans for incremental gains. In the context of widespread amnesia about what has made America prosper, pragmatism has come to be seen as lacking a clear compass rather than (in the original meaning of the word) focusing on what has actually proved to work in the real world.This is a problem, and not just for Mrs. Clinton\u2019s campaign. Our nation badly needs a dialogue that reminds Americans why a capable government is essential and how much we are paying for its erosion. Mrs. Clinton understands this, but she may have neither the opportunity nor the inclination to say it.Advertisement"}

But Herm\u00e8s has offered a different kind of validation for Dubois\u2019s intimate portraiture: Cory Jacobs, who\u2019s served as the label\u2019s go-to photography curator for the last seven years, has curated Dubois\u2019s first midcareer survey, \u201cIn Good Time,\u201d which opens this week at the Aperture Foundation in New York.Dubois became a subject of interest to the French fashion house, and its creative-support nonprofit the Herm\u00e8s Foundation, about a year and a half ago, when Jacobs attended a presentation of Dubois\u2019s latest series, \u201cMy Last Day at Seventeen,\u201d which Aperture had just published as a monograph. The series \u2014 of Irish teenagers from a working-class housing estate named Russell Heights in the city of Cobh \u2014 was taken when Dubois was an artist-in-residence there at the Sirius Arts Centre in 2009. \u201cIf you asked them what they first thought of me, they\u2019d all say, \u2018a perv,\u2019\u201d he says of the teens there, emphasizing the point with an expletive unprintable here. But things took a turn, so much so that Dubois returned to Ireland to study his subjects further. \u201cI developed an ensemble of young adults, who over five summers I would photograph repeatedly,\u201d he explains of these teenagers, who \u201cgrew up in a rare time in Ireland where there was a strong economy. But then as they come of age, it all collapses. That threshold is really interesting; I wanted that tension to always be there.\u201dUltra vivid and punchy with mood, the series nonetheless feels somehow distant \u2014 but everything about Dubois\u2019s work is inherently intimate. \u201cI spend a lot of time with people photographing; you just have to be there,\u201d he says. \u201cI always call it \u2018choreography\u2019 with another person,\u201d he says. He equates these up-close-and-personal glimpses to creative nonfiction: \u201cEverything is based on truth, but in my case folded into very conscious allusion, like cinema, even fashion. All images reference each other.\u201dAlso included in his exhibition are two older bodies of work: the two-part \u201cAll the Days and Nights,\u201d 1984-90 and 1999-2008, and \u201cAvella,\u201d 1990-95, which explore his own familial ties. \u201cA lot of my photos, starting with my family work, are collaborative,\u201d he explains. For the later installment of \u201cAll Days,\u201d Dubois drafted narratives for the photos: \u201cIt\u2019s more and more something that\u2019s constructed,\u201d he says, adding that he didn\u2019t always get the shot on the first try. \u201cMy mother and I would make appointments. Sometimes it takes four or five tries over a period of a few months.\u201dThis particular brand of intimacy is key to Dubois\u2019s work. \u201cIt\u2019s always portraiture, I\u2019m horrible at landscapes,\u201d he says. \u201cI can\u2019t talk to a tree!\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Brazil, in the Background When It Comes to Watches", "Date": "2016-03-19", "News": "Supported by\u201cIf its economy was normal, Brazil would be the biggest and most dynamic market for watches,\u201d said Ion Schiau, vice president of sales and marketing of the Swiss independent brand HYT, which recently pulled out of the country after 18 months. \u201cThere are very few players for the amount of people.\u201dA combination of political and economic problems, import and sales taxes and rising interest rates \u2014 which deter buyers from once-popular installment-payment buys \u2014 have kept this country of more than 200 million in the background while prompting most wealthy Brazilians to make their luxury purchases while on vacation.In 2015, valued at 38 million Swiss francs, or $38.25 million, Brazil\u2019s watch market languished outside the Federation of the Swiss Watch Industry\u2019s top 30 export markets. It trailed Greece, at No. 30 with 89 million francs, according Jean-Daniel Pasche, the federation\u2019s president.\u201cThe Brazilian economy is going through a very nasty, long deep recession,\u201d said Alberto Ramos, Goldman Sachs\u2019 chief economist for Latin America, on the telephone from New York, citing the 4 percent contraction of its gross domestic product in 2015 and predicting a further shrinking of 2 percent to 3 percent this year.Inflation has hit a 12-year high of 10.27 percent; unemployment is 7.6 percent, its highest level since 2009; and the country\u2019s investment status has been downgraded to junk, limiting much needed foreign investment.The exchange rate also has declined steeply, \u201cso luxury goods which used to be more affordable are a lot pricier now than two years ago,\u201d he said. The drop has been more than 60 percent \u2014 4.106 real to the dollar on Jan. 21, from 2.564 real to the dollar year over year, according to the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics.Paying on timeInterest rates have risen to 14.25 percent, a nine-year high, so the credit that Brazilians traditionally have relied upon for watches and other luxuries is significantly more expensive.\u201cCustomers buy in 10, 12 and sometimes 15 months on their Visa or Amex card,\u201d said David Zilberman, chief executive of one of Brazil\u2019s most prominent multibrand watch boutiques, Sara Joias, which sells timepieces including Audemars Piguet, Breitling and the exclusive Ballon Bleu de Cartier\u2019s vibrating diamond-set watch.Yet in the current climate, Reynaldo Saad, consumer business partner at Deloitte Brasil in S\u00e3o Paulo, said, \u201cPeople are still buying but in less quantity, less frequently and over a longer term.\u201dThe government has long relied on taxation but, said Gil Mendes, tax partner at Ernst & Young Servi\u00e7os Tribut\u00e1rios in S\u00e3o Paulo, \u201cwe don\u2019t rely on income tax, which is only 27.5 percent at its highest rate. Instead, we rely on indirect taxes on buying goods.\u201dSo the combination of federal and state taxes can double the price of the watch, said Michel Cheval, IWC Schaffhausen\u2019s regional director of Latin America and the Caribbean. \u201cWe can\u2019t be 100 percent more expensive than the rest of the world, so we subsidize this and don\u2019t reflect it in our prices as we are building our brand locally in the long term to maximize the market when the economy picks up, which we expect to be in two years,\u201d he said. As part of that long-term perspective, IWC opened a flagship boutique in S\u00e3o Paulo\u2019s swankiest shopping mall, JK Iguatemi, in 2012.For Roberto Stern, chief executive of the international watch and jewelry brand H. Stern, headquartered in Rio de Janeiro, there also is the cost of dealing with the country\u2019s tax bureaucracy, even if, as at H. Stern, a house assembles Swiss-made watch components in Brazil. \u201cI spend a half a day each week with the financial director and other directors to discuss ever changing tax issues, which loses time and resources and is unproductive,\u201d he said. \u201cWe need to constantly change our IT programs, too, which adds further costs and disruption.\u201dFor wealthy Brazilians, the answer in past years has been to buy luxury goods outside the country. As Benoit Vulliet, Hublot\u2019s regional director for Latin America, observed: \u201cAt best you break even, but as Brazilians travel a lot, we get our investment back in Miami and elsewhere.\u201d In fact, a United States International Trade Administration 2015 report noted that Brazil was of \u201cparamount importance\u201d to the country\u2019s tourism strategy, with 92 percent of its Brazilian visitors citing shopping as their top leisure activity. (Sightseeing, in comparison, was cited by 72 percent.)One of those vacation buyers has been Julio Oliveira, a tax partner at professional services firm PwC Brasil in S\u00e3o Paulo. \u201cI\u2019m a watch guy,\u201d he said. \u201cI used to live in the States, so I started buying them there as they are a lot cheaper.\u201d Now he has about 10 timepieces, including several Breitling models, a silver Ballon Bleu de Cartier and a white Baume & Mercier Capeland watch, which he was wearing the day of the telephone interview.With the current uncertainty, however, Brazilians are traveling less, and the ones who are buying are buying at home. For example, Carlos Jereissati Filho, president and chief executive of Iguatemi Group, said sales at its upscale malls like JK Iguatemi and Iguatemi S\u00e3o Paulo grew in real terms above inflation during the 2015 Christmas period. (However, the Associa\u00e7\u00e3o Brasileria de Lojistas de Shopping, the shopping mall owners association best known as Alshop, called the season the worst in 10 years.)And, Mr. Jereissati Filho added, watches have become vital in developing the local luxury market as they define the most valuable retail space, more so than fashion. \u201cWatch shops are unique. Often there is only one store in Brazil but there will be two or three Prada or Chanel,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd not so many people can buy a $100,000 watch. The watch shops, which like to be together, bring more people in because they are exclusive.\u201dRecoveryEconomists expect Brazil\u2019s recovery to begin in 2017. Although, Mr. Ramos of Goldman Sachs said, growth will be modest because \u201cBrazil\u2019s infrastructure is poor, with low education, low investment, no free trade, so growth won\u2019t be spectacular like China.\u201dAccording to Giovanni Carestia, the Latin American and Caribbean country manager for Vacheron Constantin, which opened a flagship S\u00e3o Paulo boutique in 2015: \u201cBrazil will be in a much stronger position in 10 to 15 years. It is a huge country with a G.D.P. of over 2 trillion euros, which is bigger than Italy and a little below France. Fifteen years ago, it wasn\u2019t even on the map, and today it is the world\u2019s seventh biggest economy.\u201dSeveral chief executives of major Swiss brands have clear opinions about Brazil\u2019s future. Angelo Bonati, chief executive of the Richemont brand Panerai, which has been in Brazil since 2000, noted that regional cities such as Salvador, Curitiba and P\u00f4rto Alegre are growing and are richer than before, thanks to their trading port, manufacturing and cattle farming, respectively.And, raw materials like gold, timber, coffee and hydropower are there and won\u2019t disappear, said Jean-Claude Biver, chief executive of TAG Heuer and president of the LVMH Watch Division.Some recent moves hint at the future. Take Montblanc, which opened two stores last year, one of them in Brazil\u2019s first outlet shopping destination, Catarina Fashion Outlet, 40 miles north of S\u00e3o Paulo on the busy highway to Sorocaba.As Alain dos Santos, Montblanc Brazil\u2019s managing director, noted, \u201cWe can find newcomers to luxury in a neighborhood with 20 million inhabitants.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Clinton Offers Economic Plan Focused on Jobs", "Date": "2016-03-04", "News": "Supported byIn an election year defined by angry populism, Hillary Clinton made an optimistic economic pitch on Friday, presenting a wide-ranging plan for job growth that would provide incentives for corporations that invest in employees and strip tax benefits from companies that move jobs overseas.Speaking at an auto parts manufacturer in Detroit, days before Michigan holds its Democratic primary, Mrs. Clinton proposed a \u201cnew bargain for the new economy\u201d that would bring back manufacturing jobs and increase collective bargaining rights.She unveiled her economic proposal as two other presidential candidates, Senator Bernie Sanders and Donald J. Trump, descended on the state as the campaign entered a new phase, moving to the industrial heartland of the country, where both men are hoping their anti-free trade message resonates.A new \u201cclawback\u201d proposal she unveiled would rescind tax relief and other benefits for companies that move jobs overseas. This is the latest revision to the corporate tax code Mrs. Clinton has proposed in an effort to create jobs and lift wages, which have been virtually stagnant for 15 years even as the costs of college, child care, housing and health care have soared.She also reiterated her plan to provide tax incentives for companies that share profits with employees and her proposal to raise the federal minimum wage. Her plan would also place an exit tax on companies that move their headquarters overseas to pay a lower tax rate abroad \u2014 known as inversions.\u201cCreating good paying jobs and raising incomes is the defining economic challenge of our time,\u201d Mrs. Clinton said after touring the state\u2019s largest business owned by women, Detroit Manufacturing Systems, which makes plastic assemblies for doors and dashboards.\u201cMichigan proves every day that American workers are the best in the world,\u201d she said. \u201cCompanies have to start treating workers like assets to be investing in, not costs to be cut.\u201dAddressing an audience of labor leaders, local elected officials and autoworkers, Mrs. Clinton singled out companies that she said had received tax benefits as they shipped jobs out of the country. \u201cThey have no problem taking taxpayer dollars with one hand and giving out pink slips with the other,\u201d she said.But unlike Mr. Sanders, her Democratic rival, or Mr. Trump, Mrs. Clinton did not espouse a red-hot indictment of the private sector or offer a dire assessment of the state\u2019s future. She provided a stark contrast with their messaging, which came on a day in which the government said job growth accelerated in February while wages had stagnated.\u201cI\u2019m not interested in condemning whole categories of businesses or the entire private sector,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I do want to send a clear message to every boardroom and every executive suite\u201d that \u201cif you desert America, you\u2019ll pay a price.\u201dThe speech was a turning point in the Democratic contest as Mrs. Clinton, who largely relied on the support of minority voters to push her to victories across the South on Super Tuesday, looks to the white, working-class voters in places like Michigan who will vote on Tuesday. Those voters propelled Bill Clinton to the presidency in 1992 and gave Mrs. Clinton a boost in her 2008 campaign, but have since abandoned the party in droves, drawn most recently to Mr. Trump\u2019s candidacy.Holding a solid lead in the race for the 2,383 delegates needed to capture the Democratic nomination and facing another debate on Sunday, Mrs. Clinton appeared less inclined to adopt Mr. Sanders\u2019s anti-Wall Street message. This week the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center released analyses of both Democrats\u2019 plans to raise taxes, especially on the wealthy and some businesses, to pay for their respective spending initiatives. Mrs. Clinton\u2019s plans would raise $1.1 trillion in the first decade to Mr. Sanders\u2019s $15.3 trillion, mainly to pay for his proposal for government-run universal health care \u2014 making her tax proposals \u201cincremental\u201d by comparison, said Leonard E. Burman, the director of the Tax Policy Center. According to the Associated Press, Donald J. Trump and Hillary Clinton have each won enough delegates to claim their party\u2019s nomination for president.\u201cHer experience in government and in politics for a long time tells her that those are the kinds of things that she might get done,\u201d Mr. Burman said. \u201cBernie Sanders clearly wants to just change things radically.\u201dIt is unclear how effective her clawback proposal would be, and whether in the balance of a corporation\u2019s business decisions the loss of tax breaks or threat of penalties would tip the scale against moving operations out of the country. The proposal would face an uphill battle in a Congress that will most likely have at least one chamber, the House, still under Republican control after 2016.Mrs. Clinton repeatedly alluded to the economic successes of the Clinton administration, when median family income, adjusted for inflation, increased to $56,080 in 1999 from $48,884 in 1993, compared with a decline to $51,017 in 2012 from $55,987 in 2000, according to census data.\u201cIn the 1990s, we made incomes rise for everyone,\u201d she said.And without mentioning Mr. Trump by name, she rebuffed his negative assessment of America\u2019s prospects. \u201cI\u2019ll tell you, when I hear people running for president who spend all their time bad-mouthing America, it really upsets me,\u201d she said.Mrs. Clinton\u2019s optimistic assessment of the economic recovery under President Obama stood in stark contrast to the perspectives of her opponents on both sides.Before Mrs. Clinton took the lectern, Mr. Trump greeted a crowd in Warren, to raucous chants of \u201cBuild the wall!\u201d and delivered a fiery message about taking on China and other nations that devalue their currency to hurt American workers.\u201cThis is car country \u2014 rapidly not becoming car country, but we\u2019re going to keep it car country,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cIf you get laid off on Tuesday, I still want your vote,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ll get you a new job; don\u2019t worry about it.\u201dMrs. Clinton\u2019s address was her most exhaustive yet focused on job creation, and leaned on an economic philosophy called inclusive capitalism that many of the Clintons\u2019s closest advisers adhere to. It calls on corporations to invest in employees, communities and the environment rather than relying on short-term profits that increase shareholder value.Mrs. Clinton criticized companies that are overly dependent on dividends and stock buybacks to reward shareholders. \u201cThat\u2019s money they\u2019re not using to train their workers or give them a raise,\u201d she said.The approach speaks to Mrs. Clinton\u2019s belief that the private sector must be part of the solution, said Gene B. Sperling, an economic adviser in the Clinton and Obama administrations.\u201cShe is quite comfortable offering more tax relief to companies investing long-term in American workers and jobs,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd just as comfortable telling them they are going to face a much tougher tax code when they break their side of the bargain through inversions or short-term cut-and-run strategies.\u201dIf the economic approach of the Bill Clinton years may evoke fond memories for some voters, the policies he and his advisers advanced have also come back to haunt Mrs. Clinton\u2019s campaign.On Friday, Mr. Sanders, hoping his populist economic message can help him regain his footing in the Democratic race with a victory in Michigan, held two rallies in the state. He criticized Mrs. Clinton over the North American Free Trade Agreement, which Mr. Clinton signed in 1993 and has become a symbol of voters\u2019 frustration with free trade.\u201cIf the people of Michigan want to make a decision about which candidate stood with workers against corporate America and against these disastrous trade agreements, that candidate is Bernie Sanders,\u201d he told about 2,000 supporters in Traverse City.Jackie Calmes, Jeremy W.

{"Headline": "How Saudi Arabia Turned Its Greatest Weapon on Itself", "Date": "2016-03-12", "News": "Supported byOpinionFOR the past half-century, the world economy has been held hostage by just one country: the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. Vast petroleum reserves and untapped production allowed the kingdom to play an outsize role as swing producer, filling or draining the global system at will.The 1973-74 oil embargo was the first demonstration that the House of Saud was willing to weaponize the oil markets. In October 1973, a coalition of Arab states led by Saudi Arabia abruptly halted oil shipments in retaliation for America\u2019s support of Israel during the Yom Kippur War. The price of a barrel of oil quickly quadrupled; the resulting shock to the oil-dependent economies of the West led to a sharp rise in the cost of living, mass unemployment and growing social discontent.\u201cIf I was the president,\u201d Secretary of State Henry Kissinger fumed to his deputy Brent Scowcroft, \u201cI would tell the Arabs to shove their oil.\u201d But the president, Richard M. Nixon, was in no position to dictate to the Saudis.In the West, we have largely forgotten the lessons of 1974, partly because our economies have changed and are less vulnerable, but mainly because we are not the Saudis\u2019 principal target. Predictions that global oil production would eventually peak, ensuring prices stayed permanently high, never materialized. Today\u2019s oil crises are determined less by the floating price of crude than by crude regional politics. The oil wars of the 21st century are underway.In recent years, the Saudis have made clear that they regard the oil markets as a critical front line in the Sunni Muslim-majority kingdom\u2019s battle against its Shiite-dominated rival, Iran. Their favored tactic of \u201cflooding,\u201d pumping surplus crude into a soft market, is tantamount to war by economic means: the oil trade\u2019s equivalent of dropping the bomb on a rival.In 2006, Nawaf Obaid, a Saudi security adviser, warned that Riyadh was prepared to force prices down to \u201cstrangle\u201d Iran\u2019s economy. Two years later, the Saudis did just that, with the aim of hampering Tehran\u2019s ability to support Shiite militia groups in Iraq, Lebanon and elsewhere.But this time, they overplayed their hand.When Saudi officials made their move in the fall of 2014, taking advantage of an already glutted market, they no doubt hoped that lower prices would undercut the American shale industry, which was challenging the kingdom\u2019s market dominance. But their main purpose was to make life difficult for Tehran: \u201cIran will come under unprecedented economic and financial pressure as it tries to sustain an economy already battered by international sanctions,\u201d argued Mr. Obaid.Oil-producing countries, especially ones like Russia, with relatively undiversified economies, base their budgets on oil prices not falling below a certain threshold. If prices plunge below that level, fiscal meltdown looms. The Saudis expected a sharp reduction in oil prices not just to hurt the American fracking industry, but also to hammer the economies of Iran and Russia. That in turn would weaken their ability to support allies and proxies, particularly in Iraq and Syria.The tactic had been brutally effective in the past. This was the grim scenario that confronted the shah in 1977 when the Saudis flooded the oil market to rein in Iran\u2019s influence. The 1977 flood was not the sole cause of the Iranian revolution, but it certainly was a factor: The shah\u2019s rule was destabilized just as Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini mounted his offensive to replace a pro-Western monarchy with a theocratic state. In that sense, the oil markets fueled the rise of political Islam.The price of oil also helped end the Cold War. Then, like Russia today, the Communist superpower was a global energy producer heavily reliant on revenues from oil and gas. In 1985-86, the Saudis\u2019 decision to flood the market \u2014 which some believe was encouraged by the Reagan administration \u2014 led to a collapse in prices that sent the Soviet economy into a tailspin.Unhappily for President Vladimir V. Putin, Russia\u2019s fiscal crisis has coincided with his military interventions in eastern Ukraine and Syria. If Russia\u2019s economy worsens and Mr. Putin feels cornered, he may look for ways to distract the Russian people with more rally-round-the-flag provocations, as well as induce panic in the oil markets about supplies and gin prices back up.Another oil producer, Nigeria, is running out of money, hobbling President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s campaign against the Islamist Boko Haram insurgents in the northeast. The plunge in oil prices has also shaken Central Asia, where Azerbaijan and Kazakhstan have expressed interest in emergency bailouts from the I.M.F. and other lenders.In the Middle East, reduced oil revenues have restricted Iraq\u2019s ability to wage war against the Islamic State. Persian Gulf oil producers like Qatar and the United Arab Emirates estimate collective losses of $360 billion in export earnings in the past year. Such a big budgetary hole poses problems with maintaining order at home while fighting wars in Syria and Yemen, and propping up cash-strapped allies like Egypt.And then there is Saudi Arabia itself.Meanwhile, by concluding the historic nuclear agreement, Iran is getting out from under the burden of economic sanctions. It will not be lost on Riyadh that this adds another oil producer to the world market that it can no longer control.The instability and economic misery for smaller oil-producing states like Nigeria and Azerbaijan look set to continue. But that\u2019s collateral damage. The real story is how the Saudis have been hurt by their own weapon.Andrew Scott Cooper is the author of \u201cThe Oil Kings: How the United States, Iran and Saudi Arabia Changed the Balance of Power in the Middle East\u201d and the forthcoming \u201cThe Fall of Heaven: The Pahlavis and the Final Days of Imperial Iran.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Yi Fuxian, Critic of China\u2019s Birth Policy, Returns as an Invited Guest", "Date": "2016-03-23", "News": "Supported bySinosphereBEIJING \u2014 Eight thousand miles is a long way to fly someone so he can tell you you\u2019re wrong.The day will mark a remarkable transition for Dr. Yi, from pariah to V.I.P. Six years ago, officials in his home province of Hunan threatened to arrest him if he returned from the United States, where he has lived since 1999, for helping his sister-in-law escape a forced abortion at seven months, he said in an interview in Beijing this week en route to the forum in Hainan Province. Also, his cousin\u2019s wife\u2019s baby was killed in utero one week before the baby\u2019s expected birth, he said. It was not possible to confirm Dr. Yi\u2019s accounts, but they echo many confirmed ones.Dr. Yi has a message for Boao: Because of China\u2019s birth control policies beginning in 1980, there is no way its economy will overtake that of the United States. Growth is already beginning to fall amid a distorted demographic structure, he said.After the 1949 revolution, \u201cwe had the advantages of having lots of young people,\u201d said Dr. Yi, who remains a Chinese citizen. \u201cBut that\u2019s ending.\u201d\u201cPeople say we can be two to three times the size of America\u2019s economy,\u201d Dr. Yi said. \u201cI say it\u2019s totally impossible. It will never overtake America\u2019s, because of the decrease in the labor force and the aging of the population.\u201d The United States has a much healthier age distribution, he said.As the number of women of childbearing age shrinks, so will births in a long-term trend, he said. Meanwhile, a rising median age is creating great financial burdens.Dr. Yi creates scores of graphs using data from the government\u2019s national population censuses and its \u201cone-percent\u201d mini-censuses. He pieces official figures together as they are released in snippets, updating constantly. The projections are his own, he said.\u201cThe 2015 one-percent census will show that fertility in 2014 was 1.25 children per woman,\u201d he predicted. \u201cThey expected 1.8.\u201d\u201cNow they say with two kids, they\u2019ll get 2.1 children per woman,\u201d Dr. Yi said. \u201cBut they won\u2019t. I think they\u2019ll get 1.4. Over all, they say they\u2019ll get 21 million births per year. I don\u2019t think so. Maybe 15 million.\u201dHe sees China\u2019s population, now at 1.35 billion, declining.\u201cBy 2060 there will be one billion Chinese. By 2080 there will be 700 million. And the result will be \u2014 all old people,\u201d he said, flicking through graphs for a lecture he will deliver at universities across the country in April, after Boao. He predicts that within two years the government will have to lift all birth restrictions.The world has grown accustomed to hearing from Western and Chinese economists and businesspeople that China\u2019s economy will overtake that of the United States in 2025, or in 2030 or another point in the future. That makes Dr. Yi\u2019s message one that will be hotly debated, including by China\u2019s leaders, who only partly understand, he said.\u201cThey\u2019re not as worried as I am, because they haven\u2019t fully understood the problem yet,\u201d he said.\u201cI can go to Boao because the Chinese government isn\u2019t against me anymore!\u201d he said. \u201cBefore, they said I was a traitor because I opposed state birth policies. Where I used to be a traitor, I\u2019m now being paid to fly, business class, from Madison to Chicago, to Beijing, to Hainan.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Whole Foods Plans 100 Rooftop Solar Systems", "Date": "2016-03-08", "News": "Supported byThings at Whole Foods are about to get even greener.The grocery chain plans to install as many as 100 rooftop solar systems, mainly through the power provider NRG Energy, on nearly a quarter of its stores and distribution centers, the companies said on Tuesday. SolarCity will also provide systems for the grocer, which could expand the rooftop solar program as the installations proceed.\u201cInstalling solar at Whole Foods locations across the country will increase the percentage of renewable energy that is generated in communities where we work,\u201d Kathy Luftus, global leader in sustainability at the company, said in a prepared statement. NRG plans to install systems in nine states, including California, Colorado, Connecticut, Massachusetts, Nevada and Texas.Solar energy is in keeping with the Whole Foods image but it will also save the company money, because the solar providers can offer electricity at prices below what the stores and centers would normally pay utilities.The grocer has been under pressure to reduce costs as it has faced increasing competition from other chains offering specialty and organic foods at lower prices.For NRG, the move shows that the company, in retreat from an ambitious attempt under its former chief executive, David Crane, to become the Google or Apple of green energy, will pursue the market for renewables on a large scale.The new chief executive, Mauricio Gutierrez, told investors last month that NRG was refocusing on its core business and was in negotiations concerning the fate of the home solar and electric vehicle charging divisions that he expected to complete in the second quarter of this year.\u201cSimplification of our business is an imperative, both for external perception and internal focus,\u201d he said on a conference call. \u201cNot all renewable businesses are viewed the same in terms of fit and value for NRG.\u201dThat means NRG, which has headquarters in Princeton, N.J., and Houston, will continue to invest in large-scale wind and solar, including rooftop systems for commercial and industrial customers like Whole Foods, said Craig Cornelius, senior vice president.The installations, which will range from five to 200 times the size of a typical home array, are attractive, Mr. Cornelius said, because the larger scale allows NRG to replicate a similar design across several sites.\u201cIt really just comes down to streamlined engineering design, economies of scale in equipment purchasing and construction, and the finance-ability of Whole Foods as a quality customer,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}

In all, more than 3,100 miles of projects have yet to be built, in need of government approval.One of the most ambitious projects, called the Grain Belt Express from a company called Clean Line Energy Partners, spent six years winning the go-ahead in three of the Midwestern states it would cross, only to hit a dead end in Missouri when state regulators voted 3 to 2 to stop the project. They were swayed by landowners like Jennifer Gatrel, who runs a midsize family cattle operation with her husband, Jeff, here in the northwestern part of the state.She and other opponents made the usual arguments against trampling property rights through the use of eminent domain, obliterating their pastoral views and disrupting their way of life.But they also argued something else: Why should they have to live beneath the high-voltage lines when there is plenty of wind in the East?Now the whole project is waiting, putting the Gatrels in the middle of an emerging battle over how the nation should shift to renewable energy and meet ambitious targets in carbon reduction. The outcome will determine where and how green energy will develop over the coming decades.\u201cWe have this potential for high-quality renewables in real volume for the first time,\u201d said James J. Hoecker, a former chairman of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission who now advises the transmission industry. \u201cThe problem is, where the best renewables are, there are few customers.\u201dThe transmission lines like Grain Belt Express, he said, would bring the electricity to where there is demand.The push to enhance the grid has gained urgency as renewables have spread. Already, electric systems in areas like Hawaii and Germany are under strain as wind and solar power fluctuate and overload the wires. What is needed, proponents say, is a new infrastructure better suited to handle renewable energy.Energy Department officials acknowledge as much, saying that the United States must significantly upgrade its transmission and distribution system to meet both the needs of the information economy and clean energy goals, an effort that would require an estimated $900 billion in investment by 2030.A recent study by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and the University of Colorado, Boulder, found that with such a network, the United States could supply most of its electricity with renewables by then at costs near today\u2019s prices and get close to meeting the goals set in the Paris agreement on climate change.But opponents like Ms. Gatrel say that giant projects like the Grain Belt Express represent an outmoded, centralized approach to delivering energy. Just as it is healthier and more sustainable to eat foods close to where they are grown, the argument goes, so, too, should electricity be consumed closer to where it is produced.\u201cWe believe that the East Coast has access to abundant offshore wind and that any time you talk about green or clean, you should also be talking about local,\u201d she said. \u201cUnnecessary long-haul transmission lines are not our country\u2019s future.\u201dIt isn\u2019t just here in northwestern Missouri that construction of new power lines has met resistance, and transmission projects can live or die at the hands of state and county officials representing the local interest.Clean Line has five projects in the works, including one that failed to gain approval in Iowa and another that ran aground in Arkansas and is awaiting federal approval under a thus-far unused provision of the 2005 Energy Policy Act. TransWest Express, a connector that the billionaire Philip Anschutz is proposing to install from the enormous wind farm he is developing on his south-central Wyoming cattle ranch to Las Vegas, is also awaiting a federal go-ahead.But some energy officials and executives say there is a more dynamic and resilient alternative to these sprawling networks. Instead, they are promoting the development of less centralized systems that link smaller power installations, including rooftop solar, storage and electric vehicles, an approach known as distributed generation.Conflict over those competing visions has cropped up across the country in fights over both wind and solar developments, but nowhere is that conflict starker than in Missouri\u2019s rejection of Grain Belt.The transmission line, which could create thousands of temporary manufacturing and construction jobs in the state, attracted strong support among some economic development officials and landowners. They saw it as a chance to bring needed revenue to local counties and school districts, as well as to provide extra income for those whose land it crosses.\u201cI\u2019m wanting to make sure that my local district has the assets to be able to do what they need to do,\u201d said Wayne Wilcox, 68, who runs a farm that has been in his family since 1884 and is a commissioner in Randolph County. \u201cI just believe a project like this brings a lot of good to a community.\u201dBut opponents flooded the state Public Service Commission with thousands of comments against the proposal. Among the objections was granting Clean Line eminent domain so it could profit from shipping electricity to energy-hungry regions that command higher power prices. In addition, opponents say that the lines can interrupt farming operations, pierce the country quiet with humming or popping sounds and pollute the nights with a glow.And although the lines are said to be safe, farmers are warned not to refuel vehicles underneath them, or if refueling is necessary, to ground equipment with heavy chains.Michael Skelly, Clean Line\u2019s president and founder, said that the lines would not glow, but acknowledged that most landowners wouldn\u2019t be eager to have the towers, which could rise 150 feet, on their properties. He also said that the exceptional winds of the Great Plains could go a long way toward reducing the country\u2019s carbon emissions, and that the company would compensate landowners for their sacrifice. And since there is no comprehensive, national transmission-building program, he said, it was up to private companies to devise business models to handle it.\u201cThe difficult thing is that with infrastructure of any type, it has to go somewhere,\u201d he said, adding, \u201cTo motivate investors, there has to be a possibility that they make money \u2014 otherwise, it\u2019s not going to happen.\u201dThe state\u2019s five-member Public Service Commission, which rejected the proposal by one vote, concluded that its priority was Missouri, and \u201cthat any actual benefits to the general public from the project are outweighed by the burdens on affected landowners.\u201dOne of the dissenting commissioners, Daniel Y. Hall, who is now the chairman, wrote that the majority had used an \u201coverly narrow and parochial interpretation of the public interest\u201d that put the state \u201con the wrong side of history.\u201dThat debate is far from over. Clean Line plans to reapply, Mr. Skelly said, and Ms. Gatrel and her neighbors have vowed to continue their fight.Last month, she stood on a windswept hill at her home, just below a flock of chickens and ducks pecking near a cold frame holding the last of a crop of lettuce. Her son, Dalton, ran a pony around a ring while her husband, who like his wife is 35 years old, worked cattle on horseback in a nearby pasture.\u201cI love this life,\u201d she said. \u201cI love this land.\u201dAdvertisement"}

He was 77.His wife, Anna, confirmed his death.Mr. Thurow was a prolific author and took to television and the lecture circuit with gusto, paying special attention to the income gap and globalization, which he contended would have a deleterious impact on American labor. He also taught at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology for decades.In his writing, he tried to make the dry and difficult-to-grasp intricacies of the American economy accessible to a mass audience.Mr. Thurow said that he decided to devote himself to communicating about economics after he was not offered a job in President Jimmy Carter\u2019s administration, although he had been an economic adviser to Mr. Carter\u2019s campaign.\u201cI decided that if I could not have the king\u2019s ear, I would talk to the public,\u201d he said in a 1997 interview. \u201cThat\u2019s the other way to have an impact on the economic system.\u201dHe was the dean of the M.I.T. Sloan School of Management from 1987 to 1993 and a founder of the Economic Policy Institute, an influential progressive research group. In his heyday, he charged speaking fees of $30,000 and was one of the most sought-after economists on the lecture circuit.\u201cHe was prone to simplifications more than grandeur \u2014 a strength as well as a weakness,\u201d said Richard Schmalensee, a colleague and professor at M.I.T.Some of Mr. Thurow\u2019s bolder predictions \u2014 for example, that Japan would emerge as a titanic trading power that would not just rival but overwhelm the United States and Europe in the global economy \u2014 never materialized.Still, his impact among fellow economists and his influence on how they disseminated their work were significant.\u201cLester used both print and TV more than anyone of his generation,\u201d said Thomas A.

He received a Ph.D. in economics from Harvard in 1964 and, by the time he was 30, was a professor at M.I.T.After he turned to writing books, he appeared often on PBS and wrote extensively for The New York Times and Newsweek. He wrote several books, including \u201cThe Zero-Sum Society\u201d (1980) and \u201cThe Future of Capitalism\u201d (1996).And he tackled the income gap before it was widely discussed.\u201cHe was one of the first important economists to suggest that too much inequality is bad for society,\u201d said Jared Bernstein, a senior fellow at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. \u201cAnd he was writing this just as the inequality trend that is so historically high right now was taking off.

{"Headline": "Gas Prices Will Be Low for Easter, but Don\u2019t Get Used to It", "Date": "2016-03-24", "News": "Supported byHOUSTON \u2014 With gasoline prices at their lowest point for the Easter weekend since 2004, holiday travelers have something to cheer about.But they better fill up their tanks fast.Across the country, according to the AAA motor club, drivers are paying 31 cents more per gallon than only a month ago.The principal reason for the rise in gasoline prices is the roughly 50 percent spike in the American oil benchmark from $26 a barrel on Feb. 11 to just over $40 a barrel before crude prices sputtered in the last couple of days.Much of the recent price rise is from changes in seasonal driving habits, including spring break road trips. At the same time, many refineries are retooling to produce summer blends, which leads to a temporary decline in local fuel production.\u201cPeople still have more money to spend,\u201d said Tom Kloza, global head of energy analysis for the Oil Price Information Service. \u201cThe mystery is: Are people spending it, or are they saving it, or are they paying off some debt?\u201dOver the last two and a half years, the oil industry experienced its deepest downturn since at least the 1990s.Whatever the answer, oil and gasoline prices are not a big political issue this year, and few drivers are openly complaining. That is because drivers are saving 31 cents a gallon from what they were paying a year ago, representing a saving for the average motorist of roughly $30 a month. Two years ago drivers spent roughly $1.60 more a gallon than today, before oil prices collapsed by roughly 70 percent since the summer of 2014.People are using some of those savings to buy more gas. Motorists have been encouraged to drive more and buy bigger vehicles, including S.U.V.s, which guzzle more fuel. Government weekly estimates of domestic gasoline demand so far this year suggest a 4 percent increase over the same period last year, leading some to project that the country should easily surpass its 2007 record for gasoline consumption.Increasing gasoline demand in the United States has also helped push oil prices higher. In addition, supply is slowing in several oil-producing countries, including the United States. There is also the possibility that Saudi Arabia, Russia and a handful of other producers will freeze their output in the coming weeks.Since the lifting of nuclear sanctions, Iran has added several hundred thousand more barrels of crude a day on world markets. But that modest addition has been more than offset by terrorist attacks on pipelines in the Middle East and unplanned production outages in several countries.The oil and gas industry continues to suffer through its worst downturn in more than a generation. At $40 a barrel, most oil companies can avert bankruptcy, but few wells can be profitably drilled, and financial turmoil still grips the industry. Linn Energy, a major Houston-based oil and gas company, recently stopped meeting payment obligations to creditors and may well join the scores of mostly small companies than have fallen into bankruptcy. One of the latest was Denver-based Emerald Oil, with assets of $405.4 million and debts of $361 million, which filed for Chapter 11 protection this week.Many in the industry caution that once oil prices rise a bit, many companies will complete unfinished wells and even drill new ones, putting pressure on prices once again.Over 1,200 oil rigs have been idled in the United States over the last two years, and most oil companies have slashed their exploration budgets by more than 40 percent from 2014 levels. That has caused a sharp drop in American production, by about 600,000 barrels a day from a year ago.Several of the largest international producers will gather in Doha next month to discuss curtailing or at least restraining output. Nevertheless most experts expect that the current, stubborn worldwide glut in oil and petroleum products should keep crude prices well below their average levels of the last decade until at least the end of the year.\u201cThe industry continues in severe distress, severe,\u201d said Ken Hunter, president of Vaquero Energy, a California-based oil company. Even with oil prices approaching $40 a barrel, Mr. Hunter added, \u201cI feel a little better, but personally I expect more downward volatility again in the price.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Nafta May Have Saved Many Autoworkers\u2019 Jobs", "Date": "2016-03-29", "News": "Supported byEconomic SceneWhen Donald Trump threatened to \u201cbreak\u201d the North American Free Trade Agreement, auto industry workers offered up some of the loudest cheers.Mr. Trump easily won the Republican primary in Michigan this month. The state, home base for the American auto industry, also delivered an upset victory to Bernie Sanders, the Democratic anti-Nafta standard-bearer.But the autoworkers\u2019 animosity is aiming at the wrong target. There are still more than 800,000 jobs in the American auto sector. And there is a good case to be made that without Nafta, there might not be much left of Detroit at all.\u201cWithout the ability to move lower-wage jobs to Mexico we would have lost the whole industry,\u201d said Gordon Hanson of the University of California, San Diego, who has been studying the impact of Nafta on industries and workers since its inception more than two decades ago.Even in the narrowest sense \u2014 to protect jobs in car assembly plants \u2014 a wall of tariffs against America\u2019s southern neighbor would probably do more harm than good.In the home of the once proud Big Three carmakers, which virtually owned the American car market through most of the 20th century, the issue is personal. Nafta put them in direct competition with Mexican workers earning little more than one-fifth of their compensation.The American trade deficit in autos and parts tripled in the two decades after the trade deal struck with Mexico and Canada took effect in 1994, to about $130 billion in 2013. The industry lost 350,000 jobs, or about a third of its workers, over the period.\u201cIt was a massive shift in a flagship industry,\u201d said Thea Lee, deputy chief of staff of the A.F.L.-C.I.O.Workers, she said, were promised one thing but got another. \u201cOne thing you need to understand about why working-class people are so cynical about these trade agreements,\u201d Ms. Lee said, \u201cis that every time we had these big debates, and they heard these optimistic projections and it never turned out the way they were told it would be.\u201dChina, where workers were even cheaper and which has attracted far more foreign investment in manufacturing, ultimately bumped Mexico out of many American markets after Beijing entered the World Trade Organization in 2001.Nafta is often blamed for dynamics that are not of its making. The surge of Mexican exports in the 1990s was propelled by a sharp devaluation of the peso, which set off the so-called Tequila Crisis. The wave of immigration from Mexico into the United States, which lasted until 2005, was driven by a decline in government subsidies to farmers and an economic collapse that occurred just as millions of young Mexicans were entering their late teens and were desperate for jobs.Luis Rubio, who heads the Center of Research for Development in Mexico City \u2014 known as CIDAC for its spelling in Spanish \u2014 complains that Nafta gets the blame for the whole package of globalization and breakneck technological change that took off more or less at the same time.\u201cNafta is also blamed for lots of things that are actually because of competition with China,\u201d he told me.The truth is that autoworkers in Detroit were not just competing with cheap workers in Mexico. They were also competing with American workers in the union-averse South, where many car companies set up shop. They were competing with robots and more efficient Japanese and Korean automakers.Detroit responded by cutting as many costly factory jobs as it could. But value added by the car and car-parts makers in the United States is only slightly lower than it was in 1993.In the final analysis, Nafta might have saved hundreds of thousands of jobs. By offering a low-wage platform, Mexican plants increased the scale of production in North America, allowing domestic and foreign automakers to amortize their large fixed costs. Carmakers and parts suppliers tend to cluster relatively close together. So assembly plants in Mexico help sustain a robust auto-parts industry across North America.This regional integration gave the United States-based auto industry a competitive edge that was critical to its survival. \u201cThere was a concern 20 years ago that an auto industry production chain would develop across Asia, including China and Taiwan and Southeast Asia,\u201d Professor Hanson said. \u201cMaybe Nafta saved us from that.\u201dRobust North American trade is also critical to the United States. If Mexico achieved significantly higher living standards, Mr. Trump could save the money for his border wall. Already fewer Mexican migrants are coming to the United States than going. Were Mexico richer, the flows back home to Mexico would probably be greater.And if the real concern is China \u2014 another target of Mr. Trump\u2019s ire \u2014 a truly integrated North American market would help keep it at bay.The auto industry remains a bright spot.\u201cEvery auto manufacturer is setting up shop in Mexico,\u201d said Eugenio Sevilla-Sacasa, vice president for international supply chain operations and cross-border logistics at Ryder, whose trucks cross the border between Mexico and the United States 150,000 times a year. \u201cFord, G.M. and Chrysler but also Toyota, Mazda, Honda, Mercedes-Benz, Kia.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s exactly the wrong time to blow up Nafta,\u201d Professor Hanson argued. \u201cWe would be doing China an enormous favor.\u201dAdvertisement"}

This exhibition makes clear that the city \u2014 where Mr. Willems became a parent when his daughter, Trixie, was born in 2001 \u2014 is the emotional home base of the children\u2019s books that were first published in 2003.It is a devastating piece of work, compressing, as the best comics do, enormous meaning and emotion. Mr. Willems depicts himself walking to work in a self-absorbed haze. Then he stands with members of a cross-section of New York on the smoky bridge as they all fall silent, then begin chattering desperately, trying to understand what is happening on the Manhattan side of the East River. Slowly the horrific reality becomes clear. As he makes his way home we see a man already changed.\u201cHow could they do this to my city?\u201d he thinks. The final panels show Mr. Willems opening the door to his apartment, saying, \u201cHoney, I\u2019m home.\u201d His wife, her features torqued in confusion and grief, holds their infant daughter. Behind them, on a television screen and outside the windows, we see the twin towers burning. \u201cHome,\u201d we understand, will never be the same again.The rest of this show is pitched to include children, as is the audio tour. Mr. Willems delivers kid-friendly jokes and clear explanations of how he makes his art. Free headsets are placed in children\u2019s reach on the wall inside the show\u2019s entrance, and Mr. Willems directs his listeners right past the Sept. 11 story, into the next room, which is focused on his most famous characters.The cast of the \u201cKnuffle Bunny\u201d books comes first, even though the pigeon is an earlier creation. This nonchronological order, presumably, is meant to call adults\u2019 attention to the fact that the baby we first saw in \u201cWalking the Williamsburg Bridge to Work\u201d is Trixie, is the preverbal, tantrum-throwing toddler of \u201cKnuffle Bunny.\u201d Her parents, now a bit comically helicoptery, once held her as they watched their city under attack. With that context we see the delightful art from \u201cKnuffle Bunny\u201d in a more poignant and serious light. It\u2019s a canny move in a show that makes a case for Mr. Willems\u2019s cultural importance. Unlike Dr. Seuss, Mr. Willems has not introduced overt political themes into his children\u2019s work, but here is evidence that they are there, if submerged.Much of the focus is on Mr. Willems\u2019s process \u2014 how he creates characters, and then builds his picture books around them. We learn that Mr. Schulz was Mr. Willems\u2019s childhood hero, and that he considers himself not an illustrator but, like Mr. Schulz, a cartoonist, who uses \u201cletters and shapes and drawings to create one work.\u201dThe simplicity of Mr. Willems\u2019s lines and stories is the result of strictly methodical, even obsessive, work. \u201cPut as little in as possible,\u201d he is quoted as saying in the show\u2019s catalog. Several sketches are shown alongside the finished drawings, and we can see where he made the tiniest of changes \u2014 the pigeon\u2019s wing extended by mere millimeters, the angle of the angst-ridden Gerald the Elephant\u2019s knocked knees expanded infinitesimally. A tone of practical encouragement to young artists prevails. A video invites visitors into Mr. Willems\u2019s studio, where he works on a drawing and offers tips such as \u201cDon\u2019t be afraid to move your paper around!\u201dListeners who stick it out with the audio tour to the final room will be rewarded with more madcap Willems charm as he introduces the cover and two illustrations from the 25th and final Elephant and Piggie book, \u201cThe Thank You Book,\u201d which will be published in May. \u201cElephant and Piggie are my two best friends,\u201d he says, more or less believably.Around the corner is a drawing from \u201cNaked Mole Rat Gets Dressed,\u201d which, Mr. Willems says in the audio, he drew with a pen nib that belonged to Mr. Schulz. When he was 5, Mr. Willems explains, he wrote a letter to Mr. Schulz saying, \u201cDear Mr. Schulz, can I have your job when you are dead?\u201d There was no response. But after Mr. Schulz died, Mr. Willems became friends with his widow, Jean, who gave him one of his nibs.

Mr. de Blasio called the remarks \u00e2\u0080\u009creprehensible\u00e2\u0080\u009d and accused Mr. Cruz of demagogy.On Wednesday, Mr. Cruz by turns depicted Mr. de Blasio as a shill for the teachers\u00e2\u0080\u0099 union and an enemy of police officers, describing a 2014 police protest against the mayor after the shooting deaths of two officers.\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhen the heroes of the N.Y.P.D. stood up and turned their backs on Mayor de Blasio, they spoke not just for the men and women of New York but for Americans all across this nation,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Cruz said, to cheers.Mr. Cruz is considered an underdog in the New York primary on April 19, given Mr. Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s local ties and the perception that a message of conservative purity might not resonate with more moderate voters.Yet in the crowd, there were signs of his potential strength, including several voters who cheered his \u00e2\u0080\u009cNew York values\u00e2\u0080\u009d remarks.\u00e2\u0080\u009cHe understands New York politics,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said John Cudney, 33, from the Williamsburg section of Brooklyn.And even in his neighborhood, Mr. Cudney said, the tide seemed to be turning for conservatives, if only slightly.\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s getting gentrified,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said, gesturing toward his smart purple button-down. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThere are more people who dress like me there.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\t\tFirst Draft provides fast-paced and comprehensive coverage of politics and elections by The New York Times.

{"Headline": "China Military Budget to Rise Less Than 8%, Slower Than Usual", "Date": "2016-03-04", "News": "Supported byBEIJING \u2014 As China\u2019s economy slows, its military budget will rise by 7.6 percent this year, the lowest increase in six years and less than the double-digit increases that have been the norm for years, the government said Saturday at the opening of the country\u2019s annual legislative meeting.But in comments made ahead of the meeting, Fu Ying, a spokeswoman for China\u2019s legislature, the National People\u2019s Congress, gave no sign that Beijing would soften its stance on disputes in the South China Sea, and she renewed China\u2019s warnings to the United States not to intervene there.\u201cThis year, China\u2019s military budget will continue rising, but more slowly compared to the previous few years,\u201d Ms. Fu said at a news conference in Beijing on Friday.The rise of 7.6 percent was revealed in Prime Minister Li Keqiang\u2019s annual report to the legislature, and it would increase China\u2019s military spending to $146 billion, Xinhua, the state news agency reported.The last single-digit increase was in 2010, when the military budget grew by 7.5 percent. Last year, the People\u2019s Liberation Army\u2019s official budget grew 10 percent to about $136 billion, and in 2014 it grew 12.2 percent. From 2005 to 2014, China\u2019s official military budget grew an average of 9.5 percent annually, after adjusting for inflation, according to a Pentagon estimate.\u201cThe whole economy is slowing, the pace of G.D.P. growth is slower than before, and military spending, the defense budget, should be in step with the pace of G.D.P.,\u201d said Xu Guangyu, a retired People\u2019s Liberation Army major general who is now a senior counselor with the state-run China Arms Control and Disarmament Association.Dennis J. Blasko, a retired United States Army lieutenant colonel and the author of \u201cThe Chinese Army Today,\u201d said that China\u2019s annual military expenditure was generally kept in line with gross domestic product plus inflation and that a single-digit increase for 2016 was in keeping with that formula.\u201cThis is consistent with the way the economy has been going, and that\u2019s the way the military budget has been determined for the last 20 years,\u201d Mr. Blasko said. \u201cThe whole point is not to overburden the economy with military expenditures.\u201dChina has been feverishly piling sand onto reefs in the South China Sea, creating seven new islets in the region and straining already taut geopolitical tensions.He said Chinese leaders were also aware that throwing large amounts of money at the military, as the Soviet Union did, is not the way to modernize it. \u201cThey look at the example of the Soviet Union, which flushed billions down the drain on the military, and that was the reason for its collapse,\u201d Mr. Blasko said.Mr. Xu, the retired general, said that the lower defense outlays for this year also probably reflected a temporary slowdown in the tempo of equipment modernization and that the pace would pick up again in the coming years.\u201cThere\u2019s a certain cycle in developing and producing weapons and equipment,\u201d Mr. Xu said. \u201cIt fluctuates. It isn\u2019t in a straight line.\u201d\u201cAmerican actions and statements now leave people feeling that it\u2019s provoking tense emotions, and it makes people put a big question mark over American motives,\u201d Ms. Fu said.Jin Canrong, a professor of international relations at Renmin University in Beijing, said the relatively modest increase in military spending was partly a gesture to mollify China\u2019s neighbors about its intentions in the South China Sea \u2014 specifically, the 10 members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations. \u201cThey are the pillars of China\u2019s diplomacy in the region,\u201d Mr. Jin said.But Mr. Jin said the slowdown in military spending was also prompted by domestic concerns. He said Beijing was living up to a promise to spend more on social welfare programs to support the poor during China\u2019s economic slowdown. \u201cNow is not the correct time to dramatically increase the military budget,\u201d he said.Mr. Jin said it was \u201cvery possible\u201d that the People\u2019s Liberation Army would be disappointed in the single-digit spending increase, but he noted that the military would continue to see benefits from significant expenditures announced in recent years. \u201cIn the coming two or three years China will get a lot of new equipment,\u201d he said. \u201cThe impact of this slowdown will be five years ahead.\u201dAdvertisement"}

But that\u2019s what President Obama did last week in presenting a well-considered analysis of troubles in the relationship with Saudi Arabia.Mr. Obama, who has blamed Saudi Arabia and other Sunni Arab governments for encouraging anti-American militancy, also told Mr. Goldberg that the Saudis should try harder to \u201cshare the neighborhood\u201d by achieving \u201csome sort of cold peace\u201d with their enemies in Iran.The Saudis have become so afraid that Shiite Iran will dominate the region that they tried to kill the Iranian nuclear deal, even though it sharply curbed Tehran\u2019s nuclear activities. The Saudi-Iranian competition has fanned proxy wars in Syria, Yemen and Iraq. The Saudis\u2019 intervention in Yemen has further fueled a disastrous war there between a Saudi-supported government and the Iranian-backed Houthis. And they have supported some of the more radical rebel groups fighting President Bashar al-Assad of Syria, who is backed by Iran.Given all this, it\u2019s little wonder that Prince Turki scoffed at Mr. Obama\u2019s \u201cshare the neighborhood\u201d idea.Mr. Obama has now forced a behind-the-scenes conversation about the Saudi-American relationship into the open. Is there anything Washington can do to encourage transformative reforms? Apart from expressing critical views, even Mr. Obama, who will visit Saudi Arabia for a meeting with Gulf leaders next month, has felt a need to maintain the alliance largely along traditional lines.There is little time left in the president\u2019s term to rethink how the United States and Saudi Arabia can move forward together.

{"Headline": "The Enduring Curse of Caste", "Date": "2016-03-09", "News": "Supported byOp-Ed ContributorNEW DELHI \u2014 Of the many protests to convulse public universities across India in recent weeks, the one held on Feb. 23, in which thousands of students, faculty and activists marched through central Delhi demanding \u201cJustice for Rohith,\u201d was the largest and perhaps the most palpably indignant.A month before, Rohith Vemula, a 26-year-old Ph.D. student at the University of Hyderabad, in southern India, hanged himself from the ceiling fan in a friend\u2019s hostel room. Mr. Vemula was raised by his single working mother, who is from a \u201cscheduled caste,\u201d the lowest rung of the hierarchical system that structures traditional Hindu society, and which used to be deemed \u201cuntouchable\u201d until India\u2019s independence in 1947. Mr. Vemula identified as Dalit, a word meaning \u201ccrushed\u201d or \u201cground down\u201d and refers to the oppression, often violent, suffered by scheduled castes over centuries of Indian history.Mr. Vemula had secured admission to a prestigious graduate science program, as well as a highly competitive national research fellowship. He was a brilliant scholar and a popular and vociferous campus activist for the rights of disenfranchised communities. He killed himself because of relentless caste discrimination.He left behind a searing suicide note: \u201cThe value of a man was reduced to his immediate identity and nearest possibility. To a vote. To a number. To a thing. Never was a man treated as a mind.\u201dMr. Vemula\u2019s suicide \u2014 hardly a rarity among Dalits at India\u2019s best universities \u2014 is emblematic of the problems of the country\u2019s affirmative action program. Within a few years after independence, India had set aside for Dalits and other disadvantaged castes about 23 percent of government jobs and seats in public universities. Today, the reservations apply to many more groups and cover about 50 percent of such posts and seats. But numerical improvement does not an equal society make.Dalit students still come from severe poverty. They lead de facto segregated lives on nominally diverse and inclusive campuses. They still face daunting disadvantages in the job market even after they graduate with degrees. The ability of \u201creserved\u201d candidates is always suspect, regardless of their performance.The gap between the high and the low castes, between so-called backward and forward communities, not only persists, it also manifests itself through ever-more subtle and complex forms of discrimination and violence. Being the beneficiary of reservations can itself be a stigma.B.R. Ambedkar, a Dalit and an architect of India\u2019s 1950 Constitution, warned the Constituent Assembly in 1949 that the political revolution inspired by Mohandas K. Gandhi, which had led to India\u2019s freedom from British rule, must be accompanied by a social revolution upholding the ideals of fraternity and dignity for all.Together with other progressive founders of the Indian Republic, Ambedkar helped make social, economic and political justice the first item of business in the statute books. The Constitution they drafted made it a punishable offense to treat anyone as \u201cuntouchable,\u201d outlawed discrimination based on caste, and encouraged the state to pass measures correcting its effects. With that, the bare bones of affirmative action \u2014 the \u201creservations,\u201d or quota, system \u2014 were in place.Ambedkar believed that within a decade or two quotas would bring about \u201cthe annihilation of caste\u201d and become unnecessary. But this was not to be. In the late 1970s the government set up the Mandal Commission to study which other groups, even if not among the lowest castes, might also be suffering from social, economic or educational deprivation. By the early 1990s, India had begun to expand reservations to include the so-called Other Backward Classes.But today it is clear that even the Mandal reforms have failed to bring about Ambedkar\u2019s dream of a genuinely equal society. Caste, instead of withering away as Indian democracy matures, has asserted itself in new ways.Mr. Vemula viscerally understood this unhappy truth. Since August 2015, he had faced the hostility of university authorities for being politically engaged and unusually articulate. In just one semester, he had lost his hostel accommodation, his monthly stipend and access to the classroom.For several nights leading up to his suicide, during the coldest stretch of the winter, he had camped on mattresses and blankets set outside the hostel\u2019s gates. A few other students were with him, and they wryly referred to their makeshift arrangement as a \u201cDalit ghetto.\u201dMr. Vemula\u2019s fault was not simply being a Dalit. He was also a leader in the Ambedkar Students Association, which actively campaigned to \u201ceducate, agitate and organize\u201d students, following a rousing slogan from Ambedkar. The group\u2019s members discussed not only Dalit issues, but also other controversial matters: the death penalty; Kashmir\u2019s problematic relationship with the Indian union; communal violence against minorities, especially Muslims, in what is an officially secular nation.Worse perhaps, Mr. Vemula had gained admission to the University of Hyderabad in the general, nonreserved category \u2014 meaning that his trajectory had not followed the standard script of marginality and exclusion. Politically aware and assertive youth like him face the brunt of double discrimination: Not only are they Dalit, but they refuse the victimhood expected of them.Contrast that with groups that traditionally have been better off but increasingly are calling themselves victims in order to claim special protection. Castes like Jats in Haryana, Patidars in Gujarat, Marathas in Maharashtra and Kapus in Andhra Pradesh have been agitating recently, asking to benefit from reservations, even though they often are wealthy or own land.India started opening up its economy at the same time that the Mandal recommendations were being debated. By the mid-2000s, overall prosperity increased, lifting many poor people into the middle class. But liberalization, along with urbanization, also created unforeseen types of inequality.The so-called dominant castes agitating for reservations fall between two stools: the old model of social justice, meant principally for the weakest of the weak, and the gains brought on by the free market. The sociologist Satish Deshpande refers to them as the \u201cbackward forwards.\u201d\u201cMy birth is my fatal accident,\u201d Mr. Vemula wrote in his suicide note. But his birth as a citizen of democratic India should have been a guarantee of dignity, opportunity and respect. He also wrote that he blamed no one. Yet there are culprits: his fellow Indians who have embraced democracy without understanding that its first principle is equality for all.Ananya Vajpeyi, an associate fellow with the Center for the Study of Developing Societies, in New Delhi, is the author of \u201cRighteous Republic: The Political Foundations of Modern India.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Protest in Indonesia Against Ride-Hailing Apps Turns Violent", "Date": "2016-03-22", "News": "Supported byJAKARTA, Indonesia \u2014 The center of Jakarta, the Indonesian capital, was paralyzed Tuesday morning by a violent mass protest by taxi and other public transportation drivers against ride-hailing apps, with demonstrators blocking major roads and highways and attacking other taxis that were not taking part.An estimated 10,000 members of the Indonesian Land Transportation Drivers Association had planned a protest march from the national House of Representatives complex to the Presidential Palace to demand that the government ban app-based transportation companies, including Uber and Grab, saying they were hurting their ability to earn fares.Instead, drivers ran amok in the district near the legislative complex, blocking roads leading to the Semanggi Flyover, the city\u2019s main highway artery, and Jalan Sudirman, a primary thoroughfare that runs through the heart of Jakarta\u2019s business district.Traffic was backed up for miles in all directions, and some offices closed because of security concerns.Two miles away, other protesters parked dozens of taxis on a thoroughfare off the city\u2019s landmark roundabout, known as Bundaran H. I., blocking south-moving traffic throughout the morning.\u201cStop illegal taxis,\u201d protesters yelled. \u201cNo more apps.\u201dTelevision news footage as well as videos posted on social media sites showed enraged taxi drivers pulling fellow drivers who were not part of the protest out of their vehicles and assaulting them. Their passengers were also forced to get out and run away.Protesters threw rocks at some taxis, smashed the windshields of others with sticks, or broke off their side mirrors.Some protesters wearing their uniforms were seen attacking taxis belonging to their own company, as well as targeting those of rival operators. They were joined in the violence by the drivers of public transportation buses, three-wheeled scooters and minivans.In one bizarre scene, a taxi driver repeatedly tried to drive through a throng of protesters from his own company, the Blue Bird Group, who appeared to be trying to attack his cab and pull him from the vehicle. The driver was eventually able to drive away.In another incident, protesters attacked a driver for Go-Jek, a popular Indonesian app-based motorcycle transportation company, whom they had pulled off his motorcycle.Many of the protesters work for Blue Bird, Indonesia\u2019s largest taxi company, and were plainly visible in their blue uniform shirts.During a live televised news conference on Tuesday afternoon, Andri Nida, a spokeswoman for Blue Bird, said the company did not approve or support the protests.\u201cIf any vandalism was done by unscrupulous Blue Bird drivers, we\u2019ll cover the costs,\u201d she said. \u201cWe will punish any anarchic drivers, but we have to gather witnesses and evidence.\u201dBy midday, the protesters had ended their blockade and marched or drove toward northern Jakarta, where they staged demonstrations at the Ministry of Communications and Information, and across from the State Palace.The Jakarta police had deployed 6,000 officers early Tuesday to monitor the protest march. Police officials vowed to take action against protesters who committed violence, but it was unclear if they had made any arrests.\u201cWe are still digging deeper into the incidents,\u201d Senior Commander Mohammad Iqbal, a spokesman for the Jakarta police, was quoted by The Jakarta Globe, a local newspaper, as saying. \u201cThe principle is that we will surely move against those who engaged in illegal acts.\u201dApp-based transportation has seen explosive growth in numerous cities across Indonesia in the past two years, with motorcycle and car companies offering rides, deliveries, bill payments, shopping, cleaning services and even massages.The growth is driven by cheaper costs than traditional public transportation operators and more convenience, plus the fact that most Indonesians use their mobile phones for Internet access, according to many technology analysts.However, traditional transportation operators have taken exception to app-based companies, saying that they are not licensed and do not pay state taxes, and that their drivers, who are independently employed, do not have to pay for an annual transport permit. App-based transportation companies employ hundreds of thousands of drivers.Last year, Jakarta\u2019s governor, Basuki Tjahaja Purnama, called on the police to arrest Uber drivers, saying they were operating illegally. The company has denied this, citing Indonesian law on independent taxi operators.On March 15, the transportation association held a peaceful rally of 2,000 drivers who protested outside City Hall, the Ministry of Communications and Information, and the Presidential Palace, saying the new competition was hurting their livelihoods.Rudiantara, Indonesia\u2019s communications minister, who like many Indonesians has only one name, rejected calls to ban ride-hailing apps, saying they were part of Indonesia\u2019s growing digital economy.Instead, he said, the government will expedite licenses and permits for the companies so they do not have to suspend operations but do conform to Indonesian laws on public transportation.Advertisement"}

Her disappearance into the mist at a storytelling festival sets in motion the plot of Hamer\u2019s novel, which is divided into parallel story lines charting the attempts Carmel and her mother make to survive their separation.Although the book is cast as a thriller in the mold of \u201cGone Girl\u201d or \u201cThe Girl on the Train,\u201d Hamer seems primarily interested in attempting to explore the interior lives of her characters, using her child narrator to engage in language experiments in the style of Emma Donoghue\u2019s \u201cRoom.\u201d (Carmel\u2019s first taste of spicy food is like a \u201cdragon\u201d; worms are \u201cthin like the lines in my writing books.\u201d) But while the novel\u2019s uncanny atmosphere successfully evokes the surreal horror of losing a child, Carmel isn\u2019t a convincing character, ultimately emerging as little more than a vehicle for the author\u2019s stylistic flourishes.In the opening lines of this satire of race and identity, an unemployed Nigerian named Furo Wariboko wakes up one morning to find himself transformed into a white man. Although the scene pays homage to Kafka, Furo, unlike Gregor Samsa, is singled out for special privileges everywhere he goes. Vendors ladle extra meat into his soup, women try to pick him up, and when he applies for a job as a salesman, he\u2019s hired over more than 40 other applicants. (\u201cI\u2019ll be frank with you,\u201d his boss says, \u201cwe need a man like you on the team.\u201d)The novel uses Furo\u2019s shifting status to provide a cross-section of contemporary Lagos, from its traffic-clogged streets and crowded offices to the luxury malls and secluded enclaves of the newly rich, who drink expensive cognac and watch the Kardashians on television but lapse into the local dialect when they\u2019re drunk. Although uneven, the novel vividly captures the frenetic energy of one of the world\u2019s \u00adfastest-growing cities and provides a perceptive and engaging meditation on the mutability \u2014 and the stubborn persistence \u2014 of identity.Frank Clifton, a returning soldier, and Wendell Wilson, a small-town taxidermist, become lovers in the years immediately following World War II. Cutting themselves off from their rural Southern surroundings, they move to a secluded house in the woods, which becomes both a refuge and a prison. For more than half a century, their life revolves around the circumscribed domestic rituals of cleaning, gardening, cooking and keeping house, maintaining little contact with the outside world.This graceful and understated novel, which alternates between glimpses of the aging lovers in the present and flashbacks of their past together, is meant, in part, as a portrait of a particularly repressive period in gay history. But Griffin\u2019s focus on Wendell and Frank\u2019s hermetic existence is so tight \u2014 only a handful of scenes are set outside the space of their home \u2014 that the social forces arrayed against them remain obscure. What comes through instead is the rhythm of their everyday life, like \u201cthose last moments before dawn,\u201d when everything seemed \u201cmade of rain and cloud,\u201d and \u201cthose quiet, empty hours, while the evening light grew heavy, filled with copper, and sank to the floor.\u201dFame, we are told, is fickle. But the quantification enabled by social media \u2014 the ability to calibrate the precise degree of attention paid to every post and tweet \u2014 seems to have made popularity less subjective, easier to measure if not always to explain. Stagg\u2019s slim novel deftly explores the shifting landscape of celebrity through the story of a young woman\u2019s rise from obscurity to Internet stardom \u2014 the \u201clow numbers\u201d to the \u201chigh ones\u201d \u2014 after an online flirtation with a semifamous social media personality.

Told in the affectless, minimal style of Jean Rhys\u2019s \u201cGood Morning, Midnight,\u201d the novel avoids direct descriptions of the virtual world at its center, instead focusing on the anonymous hotel rooms and black-lit nightclubs that serve as its staging ground. Against this bland backdrop, the mechanics of the attention economy stand out with unnerving clarity.In 1933, the Russian choreographer George Balanchine immigrated to the United States. Over the following decades, he reshaped American dance, introducing an aesthetic of strong, clean lines that emphasized the power and athleticism of the female body. This ideal \u2014 the Balanchine girl \u2014 is at the center of Wilson\u2019s novel, which is divided into two strands. One, set in the 1970s, follows Mira, a gifted young student at Balanchine\u2019s School of American Ballet in Manhattan; the other, which takes place in the present day, is anchored to the more prosaic perspective of Kate, a teacher and dance historian looking back on her own past.A former ballet student, Wilson skillfully details the world of her teenage dancer: the \u201cspiderweb-thin\u201d nylon hairnets; the salmon pink tights under Fiorucci jeans; the grimy Capezio slippers carefully cracked at the arches. But the book\u2019s subject is less the ballet itself than the costs of early virtuosity \u2014 the feeling of being propelled by a force you don\u2019t understand and can\u2019t control \u2014 and the dangerous intoxication of the perfect, weightless moments when everything but \u201cair, motion, height\u201d falls away.Namara Smith is an associate editor at n+1.Advertisement"}

The global economy was showing fresh signs of slowing, and crude prices were collapsing so steeply that virtually every well in America was unprofitable.But when Diamondback Energy went out to raise $226 million worth of new stock that week in the middle of January, the oil and gas company found more buyers than it could accommodate. It had to nearly double the amount of shares it sold, to four million.Since Diamondback issued equity that day, the company\u2019s share price has increased more than 29 percent.Across the oil industry, investors have been placing their bets that prices have hit bottom. Risk-seeking investors like hedge funds and private equity firms, which were already lending money to struggling energy companies at high interest rates and onerous terms, are among those to have smelled opportunity in a potential comeback.Yet some of the biggest and most successful bets on oil are being wagered by mutual funds and index funds that are scooping up plain-vanilla equity offerings like Diamondback\u2019s deal in January.There is still a way to go before a full recovery. Many analysts caution that the recent recovery in prices could easily reverse itself. They argue that the tentative agreement between Saudi Arabia, Russia and a few other producing countries to freeze output at January levels will probably make little difference to global supplies.On Monday, fresh worries about supplies emerged as analysts expressed more skepticism about whether Iran would abide by a freeze. The United States oil benchmark fell 3.4 percent, to $37.18 a barrel on Monday.Prices, however, are still more than 40 percent higher than their lows in mid-February. And that has made investors more optimistic about energy.Oil and gas companies have issued about $11 billion in equity just in the two first two months of this year, according to the data provider Dealogic, putting the sector on pace to eclipse the $24 billion that was raised last year.Among the companies that have been able to secure capital from the equity markets are many midsize exploration and production companies that have been leaders in the shale revolution, like Marathon Oil, Devon Energy, Pioneer Natural Resources, Concho Resources, Parsley Energy, RSP Permian and Diamondback.The stock offerings are helping the companies maintain their oil fields, meet payrolls and keep up with debt payments at a time when production and revenue are falling.While that adds flexibility for many of the strongest companies, more than 100 mostly small oil and gas companies have been forced into bankruptcy in recent months, as banks call in credit lines and broadly curb lending to the industry.\u201cThe market sees the haves and the have-nots,\u201d said Robert Santangelo, co-head of Credit Suisse\u2019s equity capital markets in the Americas. \u201cAnd has done a good job allocating capital to survivors.\u201dSince the start of 2015, Credit Suisse has netted $126 million in revenue from underwriting equity deals in the oil and gas sectors, including the Diamondback offering, more than any other investment bank, according to Dealogic.Many of the equity issuers are active in the Permian Basin of West Texas and New Mexico, the source of more than 20 percent of the nation\u2019s production, which helps explain why the field\u2019s output has been more resilient than virtually any other field in the country. Production in early February exceeded two million barrels a day, up from 1.4 million barrels a day two years ago.Pioneer Natural Resources, for instance, announced in January a $1.4 billion stock offering intended to help fund its 2016 capital program, heavily weighted in the Permian Basin.Soon afterward, the company decided to reduce drilling when oil prices suddenly dropped by $10 a barrel. The cash from the added equity offering, however, gives the company one of the strongest balance sheets in the industry to increase production when prices stabilize and go up.\u201cIf prices recover mid-2016, if they recover late 2016, if they recover early 2017, we have tremendous firepower to start up faster than anybody else,\u201d Scott D. Sheffield, Pioneer\u2019s chief executive, said in a recent conference call.Over the last two and a half years, the oil industry experienced its deepest downturn since at least the 1990s.Even the strongest companies are not immune to pressure, however. Diamondback, for instance, had to discount its stock 3.5 percent from the market price when it issued new shares in January.Rebounding oil prices have at least temporarily quelled speculation by analysts that many more companies will go bankrupt or look to merge with larger competitors. There are tentative signs that the oil market is beginning to regain its balance between new supply and demand, but there is still a large glut of oil worldwide.United States oil production is dropping fast, by more than a half million barrels a day since last spring, and that decline should quicken: The oil rig count has fallen by roughly 75 percent from the peak in 2014. This is the first time since the 2009 recession that the rig count has fallen below 400 rigs.Now, with weather warming and refineries beginning their spring maintenance for summer blends, surpluses in gasoline inventories are beginning to ease.Crude production is also falling in Nigeria and Iraq as a result of insurgent attacks on pipelines. A wild card is Iran, which has been slow to meet its promise of exporting an additional 500,000 barrels of crude a day now that nuclear sanctions have been lifted. Nevertheless, tankers full of Iranian oil have left port in recent days destined for Spain, France, Romania and Tanzania.The ability of American companies to go to the equity market for capital is helping them finance production. And once the price of oil rises above $45 a barrel, there could be a revival of at least some of the dropped production. Many companies are waiting until oil and gas prices recover to put wells already drilled on line or fix wells that have been sidelined.\u201cThe equity raise isn\u2019t available for everybody out there,\u201d said Vance Scott, oil and gas leader for the Americas at Ernst & Young transaction advisory services. \u201cIf we see a firming of oil prices, in the $40 to $45 range,\u201d he added, \u201cthere are companies out there with good enough acreage position and cost structure that they can get the returns that they want.\u201dProduction costs have declined almost as steeply as crude prices because service companies have been forced to lower their rates and drillers have developed more efficient well designs. Rystad Energy, a Norwegian-based consulting firm that studies oil fields around the world, has estimated that the break-even price for production in the main shale fields of North America declined by more than 40 percent between 2013 and 2015.Although the future for oil prices remains uncertain, experts say the recent rise \u2013 if sustained \u2014 could mean more equity offerings, but only for strong companies.Mr. Santangelo, the Credit Suisse banker, says that while oil prices may still be volatile over the next few months, the shale industry is proving resilient.\u201cComing into this you heard shale would be the first to go,\u201d he said. \u201cThat is not happening. What\u2019s emerging is a healthy shale industry that is very competitive in the global market.\u201dAn article on Tuesday about growing optimism among investors that the energy market is poised for a rebound misstated the amount by which Iran has promised to increase its oil exports. The plan is for an additional 500,000 barrels a day, not 500 million.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "A Future Without Jobs? Two Views of the Changing Work Force", "Date": "2016-03-08", "News": "Supported byIn the utopian (dystopian?) future projected by technological visionaries, few people would have to work. Wealth would be generated by millions upon millions of sophisticated machines. But how would people earn a living? Silicon Valley has an answer: a universal basic income. But what does that have to do with today\u2019s job market, with many Americans squeezed by globalization and technological change? Two columnists for Business Day, Farhad Manjoo, who writes State of the Art on Thursdays, and Eduardo Porter, author of Economic Scene on Wednesdays, have just taken on these issues in different ways. So we brought them together for a conversation to help sharpen the debate about America\u2019s economic future.A problem I have with the idea of a universal basic income \u2014 as opposed to, say, wage subsidies or wage insurance to top up the earnings of people who lose their job and must settle for a new job at a lower wage \u2014 is that it relies on an unlikely future. It\u2019s not a future with a lot of crummy work for low pay, but essentially a future with little or no paid work at all.The former seems to me a not unreasonable forecast \u2014 we\u2019ve been losing good jobs for decades, while low-wage employment in the service sector has grown. But no paid work? That\u2019s more a dream (or a nightmare) than a forecast. Even George Jetson takes his briefcase to work every day.So, first, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s quite right to say that the proponents of U.B.I. are envisioning a future of no paid work at all. I think they see less paid work than we have today \u2014 after software eats the world, they say it\u2019s possible we\u2019ll end up with a society in which there\u2019s not enough work for everyone, and especially not a lot of good work.They see a future in which a small group of highly skilled tech workers reign supreme, while the rest of the job world resembles the piecemeal, transitional work we see coming out of tech today (Uber drivers, Etsy shopkeepers, people who scrape by on other people\u2019s platforms).Why does that future call for instituting a basic income instead of the smaller and more feasible labor-policy ideas that you outline? I think they see two reasons. First, techies have a philosophical bent toward big ideas, and U.B.I. is very big.They see software not just altering the labor market at the margins but fundamentally changing everything about human society. While there will be some work, for most nonprogrammers work will be insecure and unreliable. People could have long stretches of not working at all \u2014 and U.B.I. is alone among proposals that would allow you to get a subsidy even if you\u2019re not working at all.If there are, in fact, jobs to be had, a universal basic income may not be the best choice of policy. The lack of good work is probably best addressed by making the work better \u2014 better paid and more skilled \u2014 and equipping workers to perform it, rather than offering a universal payment unrelated to work.The challenge of less work could just lead to fewer working hours. Others are already moving in this direction. People work much less in many other rich countries: Norwegians work 20 percent fewer hours per year than Americans; Germans 25 percent fewer. They have taken much more of their wealth in the form of leisure rather than money. But they still work for a living.And, by the way, I\u2019ve read about robots that can program. So maybe the programmers aren\u2019t safe either.This brings to mind something else. You give the techies credit for seriously proposing this as an optimal solution to wrenching technological and economic change. But in a way, isn\u2019t it a cop-out? They\u2019re just passing the bag to the political system. Telling Congress, \u201cYou fix it.\u201dIf the idea of robots taking over sounds like science fiction, the idea of the American government agreeing to tax capitalists enough to hand out checks to support the entire working class is in an entirely new category of fantasy.Still, like you, I\u2019m skeptical that we\u2019ll see anything close to this sort of proposal anytime soon. Even Bernie Sanders isn\u2019t proposing it. The techies, as usual, are either way ahead of everyone, or they\u2019re living in some other universe. Often it\u2019s hard to tell which is which.But let\u2019s get back to the question of productivity. You\u2019re right that software hasn\u2019t produced the sort of productivity gains many had said it would. But why do you disagree with the techies that automation is just off beyond the horizon?The question is whether this could produce another burst of productivity like the one we experienced between 1920 and 1970, which \u2014 by the way \u2014 was much greater than the mini-productivity boom produced by information technology in the 1990s.While I don\u2019t have a crystal ball, I do know that investors don\u2019t seem to think so. Long-term interest rates have been gradually declining for a fairly long time. This would suggest that investors do not expect a very high rate of return on their future investments. R.&D. intensity is slowing down, and the rate at which new businesses are formed is also slowing.Little in these dynamics suggests a high-tech utopia \u2014 or dystopia, for that matter \u2014 in the offing.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Brighter Lights, Bigger City: The Odeon\u2019s Second Act", "Date": "2016-03-23", "News": "The restaurant acquires new life thanks to the arrival of Cond\u00e9 Nast downtown (plus regular infusions of new money).Supported byThe publisher and TriBeCa resident Judith Regan was in her reliable old neighborhood restaurant the Odeon the other day when she smelled something different in the air, and it certainly wasn\u2019t a new entree on the menu.\u201cYou\u2019re very hip again,\u201d Ms. Regan told the headwaiter.\u201cThey make a fantastic burger,\u201d Mr. Alan said.Mayor Bill de Blasio has been here recently, as has Cyrus R. Vance Jr., the Manhattan district attorney. \u201cNot together,\u201d stressed Aimee Bell, the deputy editor of Vanity Fair and another regular.\u201cIt\u2019s the new Lamb\u2019s Club,\u201d Ms. Nnadi said of the Odeon, which regulars refer to as \u201cthe O.\u201dMs. Malle, who likes to conclude her lunches by polishing off a dish of house-made ice cream, compared Brookfield Place to the Dubai airport. \u201cAnd I\u2019ve been to Dubai,\u201d she said.The Odeon arrived in TriBeCa in October 1980, opened by the British-born Brian McNally, his younger brother Keith McNally, and Keith\u2019s American girlfriend, Lynn Wagenknecht, with $150,000 in seed money from their families and a couple of close friends.Keith McNally had acquired a substantial customer Rolodex after working as a headwaiter at One Fifth, a restaurant near the north end of Washington Square Park that was decorated like the inside of a cruise ship and had become popular among artists, writers and the cast of \u201cSaturday Night Live,\u201d which had many of its post-show-parties there. (Brian had been the bartender there and Lynn had waited tables.)The three were taking a significant risk. Back then, getting south of the Holland Tunnel was for taxi drivers an endeavor somewhat akin to passing through the Bermuda Triangle. High-end furniture showrooms did not yet exist.Odeon, said the author Jay McInerney, who helped put it on the map and is now a wine columnist for Hearst, was: \u201can oasis in the desert. There wasn\u2019t much down there. There was commercial industrial activity during the day, and at night they were very dark streets.\u201dSeated on a recent afternoon at a table by the wall, Brian McNally said, \u201cAll of us thought it would last a week.\u201d Mr. McNally, a stout man of 67 whose streaks of gray and other markings of middle age do little to detract from his boyish demeanor, was surrounded by the deco furnishings that have ornamented the place since the days of Janice Dickinson and Bolivian marching powder.The McNallys and Ms. Wagenknecht, 62, who has a degree in art history from Stanford and spends much of her spare time painting, had both a voracious appetite for culture (Keith, 64, had briefly been an actor, starring in plays by Alan Bennett) and coolheaded business sense.\u201cWe didn\u2019t do drugs,\u201d Ms. Wagenknecht said. \u201cWe were actually sort of na\u00efve about them.\u201dThe food was always good, mostly impervious to the loopy trends (verticality, foam, pig trotters) that overtook restaurant culture over the next two decades.During that time, Ms. Wagenknecht and Keith McNally would marry and then divorce, Brian would break off from Keith in a feud that lasted many years, and each brother would open other restaurants.\u201cWe would pull down the metal gate in front at 4 a.m. and people inside could stay until 6 a.m.,\u201d Brian McNally said.The writer Dirk Wittenborn, who often accompanied his good friend John Belushi there, said, \u201cNo place was open that late.\u201d (And it no longer is, closing down no later than midnight these days, reflecting the new lock step of affluent Manhattanites to the Google calendar.) Many longtime customers recall Mr. Belushi taking over the kitchen one night, although getting the particulars is about as likely as explaining the Cuban missile crisis.There were other actors as well, like Harvey Keitel, who went there with a date early on, using the occasion to try out a long-coveted belted leather trench coat like the ones he used to see in movies about World War II but was nervous to wear himself.\u201cI thought \u2018Now\u2019s the perfect time, because no one\u2019s around on the street,\u2019\u201d Mr. Keitel said. \u201cSo I put on the trench coat, I go down to the Odeon, and there\u2019s a guy sitting there in a booth on the opposite side of the bar, and he looks at me and he says, \u2018Harv.\u2019 Real slow. I peer down and it\u2019s Jack Nicholson. And the next thing out of his mouth is \u2018You\u2019re wearing a leather trench coat?\u2019 That was the first and last time I ever wore it.\u201dAnother evening that didn\u2019t end so well was a party celebrating the gallerist Mary Boone\u2019s 30th birthday, with the sort of crowd that she described in New York glitterati shorthand as \u201ceverybody.\u201dThis meant a pile of big artists, among them David Salle, Julian Schnabel and Jean-Michel Basquiat. Sometime during the course of the evening, Mr. Schnabel and Mr. Basquiat went downstairs to the bathrooms and decided to do a little art project of their own, soaking all the toilet paper in the toilet bowls, after which they threw them up on the walls.\u201cLike snowballs,\u201d Ms. Boone said, describing perhaps the duo\u2019s only creative efforts from that time not to be sold later on by her or Mr. Gagosian, another super-gallerist regular at the Odeon, for millions of dollars.\u201cKeith just threw us out,\u201d Ms. Boone said. \u201cWe didn\u2019t get to have birthday cake.\u201dOver the next few years, the Odeon\u2019s supremacy (\u201ca downtown Elaine\u2019s,\u201d is how the publisher Morgan Entrekin put it) only seemed to increase. Keith Haring began coming in, as did Andy Warhol, Robert Mapplethorpe and Calvin Klein.But by the publication of Mr. McInerney\u2019s first novel, \u201cBright Lights, Big City\u201d in 1984, which had a picture of the Odeon on the cover and scenes set there, the relationship between Brian and Keith was beginning to fray.\u201cKeith was the driving pulse of the place,\u201d Brian McNally said. \u201cI was, by definition, less responsible.\u201d (Keith said at first that he would prefer to answer questions about the Odeon over email. When asked for a little more than that, he said he\u2019d like not to be interviewed at all.)Brian left the operation and went on to start a number of restaurants, including 150 Wooster Street, the Canal Bar and, most successfully, Indochine. During the aughts, he moved to Saigon, Vietnam, where he still spends part of the year.Keith and Lynn began colonizing the rest of the city, heading first to the Upper West Side with their second successful update on the French bistro Caf\u00e9 Luxembourg (Odeon for the Central Park set). After that came Nell\u2019s, a dinner spot and nightclub on West 14th Street that Ms. Wagenknecht ran until 2006. In 1989, the couple opened Lucky Strike on Grand Street.Following the couple\u2019s divorce in the early \u201990s, Ms. Wagenknecht bought Keith out of Caf\u00e9 Luxembourg and the Odeon, both of which she operates today; Keith kept Lucky Strike. \u201cShe deserved it,\u201d Brian said. \u201cWhy not?\u201dAfter a brief detour in film direction, Keith began building his empire. Many of his restaurants have been remixes of the original concept: Balthazar (which one might think of Hard Rock Odeon) in SoHo, Pastis (\u201cSex and the City\u201d Odeon) in the meatpacking district, Schiller\u2019s Liquor Bar (hipster Odeon) on the Lower East Side and Minetta Tavern (hedge-fund Odeon) in Greenwich Village. There was also Pulino\u2019s on the Bowery, an upscale pizzeria recently refashioned as, you guessed it, yet another French bistro, Cherche Midi. (Bowery Odeon).Meanwhile, the original was changing in profound ways.AIDS killed many of the restaurant\u2019s loyalists, as well as its employees. \u201cI can\u2019t tell you how many waiters died,\u201d Brian McNally said. Others overdosed (see Mr. Belushi 1982) or moved away, particularly as the city and the economy changed.Out went the artists. In rolled the bankers and their blond wives, their bodies honed at nearby Flywheel, followed by Bugaboo strollers. \u201cTriBeCa became what it is today, and I left,\u201d Mr. Bleckner said.And though the McNallys and Ms. Wagenknecht remained and even capitalized on the transformation of the city, they are smart and introspective enough to feel somewhat conflicted about it.Looking out a packed dining room, Ms. Wagenknecht offered that even now, when creative people have returned to the fold, she can barely identify anyone eating there. The expression on her face was actually a little sad, like a person who appears to have gotten over the death of a loved one decades ago and then finds the person\u2019s picture buried at the bottom of a desk drawer. Later this year, Keith is opening a new restaurant near ground zero in the coming Beekman Hotel and Ms. Wagenknecht is aware it will take some of her new customers away.But with Elaine\u2019s gone and the idea of a convivial lunch in New York increasingly old-fashioned, the regulars at the revivified Odeon seem merely grateful it\u2019s still here.They chalk up its success over the years \u2014 including as a local refuge after 9/11 and through two financial crises \u2014 to its excellent service (no one at Odeon seems to wait more than 15 to 20 minutes for anything, and that\u2019s on a bad day) and a broadly appealing menu that now includes a kale salad (\u201cIn the \u201980s it was kiwi,\u201d Ms. Wagenknecht said of the ingredient du hour) along with ye olde reliable oysters and soft, perfect omelets.Speaking of the food at Elaine\u2019s, Mr. Entrekin said, \u201cIf you did a steak or a veal chop, you were O.K.,\u201d adding, \u201cThe food at Odeon is better.\u201dMs. Regan is particularly partial to the fris\u00e9e with poached egg. \u201cThe crowd waxes and wanes, but the truth is, it makes no difference,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s like the boyfriend you\u2019re still friends with. The one you like even after you broke up with him.\u201dShe praised the service, yes, but also the lighting.\u201cThat amber lighting, which becomes more important to you as you get older,\u201d Ms. Regan said. \u201cIt\u2019s home.\u201dThree pictures last Thursday with an article about the re-emergence of the Odeon, a fixture of the downtown Manhattan dining scene, were published in error. They were of scenes from Cafe Luxembourg on the Upper West Side, not of the Odeon. (The filmmaker Gus Van Sant, shown in one photograph, was misidentified as Jim Jarmusch.) In addition, the article described incorrectly the fris\u00e9e salad, a signature dish of the Odeon. It is made \u2014 and always has been \u2014 with a poached egg, not a chopped egg. The article also misidentified a mall near the restaurant. It is Brookfield Place \u2014 not Westfield World Trade Center, which is also nearby. And because of an editing error, the article gave an outdated name for another restaurant owned by Keith McNally and Lynn Wagenknecht, who together opened the Odeon in 1980. It is now the Cherche Midi, no longer Pulino\u2019s.Advertisement"}

In fact, Mr. Castro confiscated all privately owned properties, factories and banks and, within a few years of taking control, barbershops, beauty parlors, newspaper stands and other businesses without a scintilla of due process. As a rebel in Cuba\u2019s mountains, Fidel Castro assured the world that, with the end of the Batista dictatorship, Cuba\u2019s Constitution and the due process of law would be fully reinstated. It never was and hasn\u2019t been since the Obama administration precipitously moved to restore diplomatic relations with Cuba, which was also done without public discussion. The president\u2019s action set a bad precedent. The confiscation of Mr. Lopez\u2019s properties had little to do with his relationship to the Batista regime; it was part of the total confiscation of all businesses and private property on the island. After almost 60 years, Cuba\u2019s Communist regime says whatever it wants without challenge. The fact remains that no judicial process or assessment of the real-estate or industrial, financial and communications businesses that were confiscated ever took place then. Neither is there one now for people who want to \u201cdo business\u201d in Cuba today.  The writer is executive director of the Center for a Free Cuba.

There is also significant research being funded under the National Environmental Science Program, through the Australian Antarctic Division, and the climate data analysis, monitoring and forecasting efforts of the Australian Bureau of Meteorology.Csiro will continue to lead the way, spending about 83 million Australian dollars a year on research into climate change mitigation and adaptation.

Re \u201cSyria\u2019s White Rose\u201d (Feb. 19): I don\u2019t fault Roger Cohen for pushing for more action on Syria. Too often, Americans believe they do much more for struggling nations than they actually do.However, in his attempt to explain the rise of ISIS, Mr. Cohen invokes the voodoo concept of \u201cpure evil\u201d as a legitimate origin of violence. Reducing the scourge of ISIS simply to a \u201ccontempt for humanity\u201d overlooks the extent to which, historically speaking, American aggression and do-nothingism has played into the hands of violent extremists.Keeping the memory of those mistakes in the forefront of our minds is crucial when moving forward, not just with Syria, but with other countries at risk of being exploited and terrorized by radicals.Specifically, it is important that the United States look for opportunities to help such countries with diplomacy and aid before using force. All too often, we have seen how failing to use the former can lead to excessive use of the latter.Advertisement"}

Suddenly Ted Cruz is beginning to look kind of attractive. At least he\u2019s sort of predictable, and he doesn\u2019t talk about his sexual organs in presidential debates!Well, Republicans, have your standards really fallen so low so fast? Are you really that desperate? Can you remember your 8 p.m. selves, and all the hope you had about entering a campaign with such a deep bench of talented candidates?Back in the early evening, before the current panic set in, Republicans understood that Ted Cruz would be a terrible general election candidate, at least as unelectable as Donald Trump and maybe more so. He is the single most conservative Republican in Congress, far adrift from the American mainstream. He\u2019s been doing well in primaries because of the support of \u201cextremely conservative\u201d voters in very conservative states, and he really hasn\u2019t broken out of that lane. His political profile is a slightly enlarged Rick Santorum but without the heart.On policy grounds, he would be unacceptable to a large majority in this country. But his policy disadvantages are overshadowed by his public image ones. His rhetorical style will come across to young and independent voters as smarmy and oleaginous. In Congress, he had two accomplishments: the disastrous government shutdown and persuading all his colleagues to dislike him.There is another path, one that doesn\u2019t leave you self-loathing in the morning. It\u2019s a long shot, but given the alternatives, it\u2019s worth trying. First, hit the pause button on the rush to Cruz. Second, continue the Romneyesque assault on Trump. The results on Saturday, when late voters swung sharply against the Donald, suggest it may be working.The party would go to the convention without a clear nominee. It would be bedlam for a few days, but a broadly acceptable new option might emerge. It would be better than going into the fall with Trump, which would be a moral error, or Cruz, who in November would manage to win several important counties in Mississippi.This isn\u2019t about winning the presidency in 2016 anymore. This is about something much bigger. Every 50 or 60 years, parties undergo a transformation. The G.O.P. is undergoing one right now. What happens this year will set the party\u2019s trajectory for decades.Since Goldwater/Reagan, the G.O.P. has been governed by a free-market, anti-government philosophy. But over the ensuing decades new problems have emerged. First, the economy has gotten crueler. Technology is displacing workers and globalization is dampening wages. Second, the social structure has atomized and frayed, especially among the less educated. Third, demography is shifting.Orthodox Republicans, seeing no positive role for government, have had no affirmative agenda to help people deal with these new problems. Occasionally some conservative policy mavens have proposed such an agenda \u2014 anti-poverty programs, human capital policies, wage subsidies and the like \u2014 but the proposals were killed, usually in the House, by the anti-government crowd.The 1980s anti-government orthodoxy still has many followers; Ted Cruz is the extreme embodiment of this tendency. But it has grown increasingly rigid, unresponsive and obsolete.Along comes Donald Trump offering to replace it and change the nature of the G.O.P. He tramples all over the anti-government ideology of modern Republicanism. He would replace the free-market orthodoxy with authoritarian nationalism.He offers to use government on behalf of the American working class, but in negative and defensive ways: to build walls, to close trade, to ban outside groups, to smash enemies. According to him, America\u2019s problems aren\u2019t caused by deep structural shifts. They\u2019re caused by morons and parasites. The Great Leader will take them down.If the G.O.P. is going to survive as a decent and viable national party, it can\u2019t cling to the fading orthodoxy Cruz represents. But it can\u2019t shift to ugly Trumpian nationalism, either. It has to find a third alternative: limited but energetic use of government to expand mobility and widen openness and opportunity. That is what Kasich, Rubio, Paul Ryan and others are stumbling toward.Amid all the vulgarity and pettiness, that is what is being fought over this month: going back to the past, veering into an ugly future, or finding a third way. This is something worth fighting for, worth burning the boats behind you for.The hour is late and the odds may be long. But there is still hope. It\u2019s a moment for audacity, not settling for Ted Cruz simply because he\u2019s the Titanic you know.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Oklahoma Puts Limits on Oil and Gas Wells to Fight Quakes", "Date": "2016-03-07", "News": "Supported byFacing a six-year barrage of increasingly large earthquakes, Oklahoma regulators are effectively ordering the state\u2019s powerful oil-and-gas industry to substantially cut back the underground disposal of industry wastes that have caused the tremors across the state.On Monday, the state Corporation Commission asked well operators in a Connecticut-size patch of central Oklahoma to reduce by 40 percent the amount of oil and gas wastes they are injecting deep into the earth. The directive covers 411 injection wells in a rough circle that includes Oklahoma City and points northeast.It follows a February request that imposed a 40 percent cutback on injection wells in a similar-size region of northwest Oklahoma.The actions significantly increase the effort to rein in the quakes, which the commission has long tried to reduce one well or a handful of wells at a time.But they are an equally notable challenge to the industry, which will most likely be able to make the cutbacks only by reducing oil and gas production. The liquid wastes are a byproduct of pumping oil and gas, and the more that is drawn from the ground, the more wastes must be disposed of.The directives were phrased as requests, because the Corporation Commission\u2019s legal authority to order cutbacks over such broad areas is unclear. The commission has come close to legal battles over the issue twice this year, and a third challenge would not be a surprise. The commission has pledged to take to court any operator that refuses to carry out the reductions.The new orders come after three of the largest quakes in the state\u2019s history, 4.7, 4.8 and 5.1-magnitude shocks that rocked a major oil field this year.In 2010, when the tremors began, Oklahoma recorded three earthquakes at or above a magnitude of 3. Last year, it had 907. So far in 2016, it has had nearly 160.Maps showing a rise in the number of earthquakes.Ms. Fallin abandoned her position as the number of quakes rapidly increased. But the political leadership was not jolted into action until January, after a series of small earthquakes damaged homes and interrupted power in Edmond, an Oklahoma City suburb home to many in the state\u2019s political and financial elite.Seismologists have long warned that the rise in the number of earthquakes in Oklahoma could presage a temblor that could cause extensive damage.\u201cYou really can\u2019t rule out the possibility of a larger earthquake,\u201d Justin L. Rubenstein, the deputy chief of a program on man-made earthquakes at the United States Geological Survey, said on Monday.Reducing or stopping waste disposal often leads to a reduction in tremors, he said, but because Oklahoma has so many injection wells, \u201cthe problem is very complicated.\u201dThe 40 percent cutbacks are based on the amount of waste injected into the wells in 2014, a peak year. Matt Skinner, a spokesman for the state Corporation Commission, said the latest directive was a proactive measure, based on a new and more detailed analysis of the quakes.The directives come at a difficult time for industry companies, which Mr. Skinner said were generally pumping oil and gas at high rates to eke out a profit during a collapse in oil prices. Well operators can decide how to meet the 40 percent reduction target, he said, but \u201cit is certainly possible that operators will decide to cut production.\u201dSome operators dispose of waste by trucking it elsewhere, but that is probably unprofitable when oil prices are so low.A week after the last of the Edmond quakes, Governor Fallin allotted $1.4 million in state funds to the state geological survey and to the Corporation Commission, both of which had been chronically short of money. Among other improvements, the money has allowed the state to beef up its earthquake monitoring network, hire a geophysicist and other staff members, and better monitor quakes.The Legislature is considering a bill introduced by an Edmond legislator and others that would allow the state insurance commissioner to create an earthquake reinsurance program. Residents of quake-prone areas have complained for years that private insurance was either impossible to get or that it included such high deductibles for damage that it was not worth buying.Some critics incorrectly blame the earthquakes on hydrofracturing, or fracking, which frees hard-to-reach deposits by pumping liquids into the surrounding rock. Still, the rise in quakes tracks the increase in oil and gas wastes produced since a wave of fracking wells began operating in the middle of the last decade.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "\u2018The Syrian Jihad,\u2019 by Charles R. Lister", "Date": "2016-03-15", "News": "Supported byWhen you purchase an independently reviewed book through our site, we earn an affiliate commission.When I last visited Syria in July 2011, four months after the protests had begun, around 2,000 Syrians had already died. The Syrians I spoke to during that visit were confident that their country would not collapse into civil war as Iraq had. Today, the death toll in Syria stands at over a quarter of a million, and half the population has been displaced from their homes. In \u201cThe Syrian Jihad,\u201d Charles R. Lister explains how a popular revolution calling for justice and better government metamorphosed into an intractable civil war with a prominent role for jihadists.When Bashar al-Assad became president on the death of his father, Hafez, in 2000, there was initial optimism that the youthful leader would bring about reform. And in the first few years of his rule, attempts were made to liberalize the country both politically and economically. Assad increased the representation of Sunnis, Christians and Druze within his Alawite-dominated regime, and won the loyalty of Damascus\u2019s business elite with a partial opening up of the economy. The beneficiaries, however, turned out largely to be Assad\u2019s cronies, while inequality increased. Rising fuel prices and reduced access to water resulted in lower living standards for the middle class, and drought forced many farmers to migrate from the countryside to the cities, where they struggled to make a living.Meanwhile, Assad maintained a pervasive security apparatus. He continued his father\u2019s strategy of \u201cinfiltrating and exporting internal threats,\u201d perhaps fearful of retaliation for the 1982 massacre of an estimated 10,000-40,000 Sunnis in the Muslim Brotherhood stronghold of Hama. And after 2003, he facilitated the entry of jihadis into Iraq to join the resistance against the American occupation.In March 2011, the detention and torture of children in the southern town of Deraa sparked peaceful protests, but the government responded with brutal repression. This had a reverse effect, with Syrians forming militias to protect themselves, and leading to the rise of the Free Syrian Army, the so-called moderate armed opposition.From the outset, Assad sought to portray the insurgents as Islamist terrorists in order to undermine them in the eyes of the international community. He consciously released Syrian jihadis from his jails so that they would assume prominent roles in the opposition.But as the insurgents succeeded in taking more ground, Assad\u2019s army found itself stretched to the breaking point. Although it was led by an Alawite officer corps, a considerable number of the foot soldiers were Sunni and therefore regarded as unreliable. By 2013, Assad was forced to turn to his closest allies, Iran and Hezbollah, for extra manpower, further sectarianizing the conflict.Lister painstakingly tracks the evolution of the insurgency month by month, from March 2011 to September 2015. With granular detail, he describes the myriad armed groups and how they compete against one another, attract outside support, change alliances and sometimes cooperate or fight among themselves. He argues that the rise of violent jihadi groups was due to the failure of the international community to back the moderates. But he also says that the Islamist groups were more successful at attracting recruits because they were better organized, more committed and better financed. He contrasts them with the Free Syrian Army, whose leadership was based outside the country in southern Turkey, and whose financial support came from different donors with different interests, leading to factions competing against one another.Lister dates the arrival of ISIS to spring 2013. In Iraq, the failure of the international community to uphold the 2010 election results, and the support of both Iran and the United States for a second premiership for the sectarian Shiite Nouri al-Maliki, had devastating consequences for the region. Maliki accused Sunni politicians of terrorism and drove them out of the political process. He stopped paying the salaries of the Sahwa (Sunni awakening) that, fighting alongside American forces during the 2007 surge, had defeated Al Qaeda in Iraq. He arrested Sunnis en masse. This created the environment that enabled ISIS to rise from the ashes of Al Qaeda in Iraq, presenting itself as the defender of the Sunnis \u2014 and then expanding into Syria.As Lister describes it, ISIS was particularly fearful of being stabbed in the back again by Sahwa, and through violent intimidation it attempted to suppress any potential opposition. Yet, at the same time, ISIS sought to hold and govern territory by winning the \u201chearts and minds\u201d of the local population. In Aleppo, for example, it held \u201cfun days\u201d where \u201cboth children and adults were encouraged to take part in interactive games. Children were challenged to speedily eat ice creams and watermelon, and also quizzed on their knowledge of the Quran, with prizes presented to winners. Adult men, meanwhile, took part in games of musical chairs, arm wrestling and tugs of war.\u201dAssad was able to benefit greatly from the opposition\u2019s internal rivalries. The infighting in Syria between ISIS and the Qaeda affiliate Jabhat al-Nusra (or the Nusra Front), for instance, led to their split and to Al Qaeda\u2019s disavowal of ISIS in February 2014. Lister also describes how in 2014 \u201cthe extremists and the moderates were now at each other\u2019s throats and the fight against the regime was temporarily demoted to second rank.\u201dLister\u2019s knowledge of the various groups is impressive. A visiting fellow at the Brookings Doha Center, he has met with the leaders of over a hundred opposition groups. He estimates that there are at least 150,000 insurgents spread across 1,500 groups. And over the course of the civil war, he calculates that at least 30,000 foreign fighters from over 100 countries have come to Syria to fight.\u201cThe Syrian Jihad\u201d is not easy going, mainly because of its level of detail. It is not for the general reader seeking an overall understanding of the Syrian civil war. But it is an indispensable guide to the different jihadi factions. It will also be invaluable to students of comparative civil wars, who will recognize the familiar patterns of how individuals mobilize; how regimes respond; how groups are formed, organized and financed; what motivates people to join them and the war-fighting tactics they use.What lesson should the United States draw from Syria? Surely not that the primary driver of the conflict is \u201cancient hatreds\u201d dating back to the schism in Islam in the seventh century. Lister comments that the rise of ISIS and its expansion has \u201crevealed the real threat that political instability and state collapse represents.\u201d The civil war is taking place in an environment where the legitimacy of regimes is contested, and in the midst of a larger geopolitical struggle between Iran and Saudi Arabia, which make use of religion to mobilize support.As with Iraq, the United States has missed many missed opportunities to help influence better outcomes in Syria. While the Obama administration weighed the cost of intervention, Lister laments that it never honestly examined the potential consequences of failing to back the moderate armed opposition. Nonetheless, the greatest blame must be laid at the feet of Assad himself, who was unwilling or unable to reform, while portraying himself as the only alternative to ISIS amid the chaos he helped engineer. Tragically, it is the Syrian people who continue to pay the price.Emma Sky is the director of Yale World Fellows and the author of \u201cThe Unraveling: High Hopes and Missed Opportunities in Iraq.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "F.C.C. Fine-Tunes Plan to Subsidize Internet Access", "Date": "2016-03-08", "News": "Supported byThe agency on Tuesday will circulate a final proposal to F.C.C. members to approve a broadband subsidy of $9.25 a month for low-income households, in the government\u2019s boldest effort to date to narrow a technological divide that has emerged between those who have web access and those who do not. While more than 95 percent of households with incomes over $150,000 have high-speed Internet at home, just 48 percent of those making less than $25,000 can afford the service, the F.C.C.\u2019s chairman, Tom Wheeler, has said.\u201cWhen we talk about digital equity, we need to remember that we\u2019re talking a key part of the answer to many of our nation\u2019s greatest challenges \u2014 issues like income inequality, job creation, economic growth, U.S. competitiveness,\u201d Mr. Wheeler said last month in a speech on the plan.Investigations have revealed many participants were double billing for landline phone and wireless services when they were allotted only one subsidy per home. In a 2015 report, the United States Government Accountability Office questioned the effectiveness of the plan. In 2012, the F.C.C. reformed Lifeline after complaints and created a database to track subsidies.Apart from suggesting the $9.25 monthly broadband subsidy, Mr. Wheeler\u2019s Lifeline proposal also tries to clamp down on potential abuse and fraud by appointing a third party to vet individuals for eligibility and to ensure companies are following rules. In the past, Lifeline participants were vetted by mobile carrier companies including Verizon and T-Mobile USA. The F.C.C. will also make data on the program publicly available, including subscriber counts from providers.Any broadband subsidy could substantially reduce monthly Internet fees that average $52.50 in urban areas, but are often purchased as part of more expensive bundles that include television and phone service.Michael O\u2019Rielly, a Republican commissioner of the F.C.C., said the new proposal put Lifeline at risk of exceeding the agency\u2019s budget estimates and called for a spending cap.\u201cSuch irresponsible action will balloon a program plagued by waste, fraud and abuse, and result in higher phone bills for every American \u2014 including those already struggling in the current economy,\u201d Mr. O\u2019Rielly wrote in a blog post last week. \u201cIn sum, it\u2019s a recipe for disaster, and I can\u2019t and won\u2019t be part of it.\u201dPublic interest advocates have pushed for faster Internet speeds and unlimited data in the broadband subsidy proposal, arguing that homework and other tasks increasingly require downloading big files and streaming videos that gobble up the monthly allotments. The F.C.C. said the proposed speeds and data limits were in line with consumer averages.Democratic commissioners at the F.C.C. have argued that there is an urgent need to update the Lifeline fund for broadband as homework, job searches, and health and other services increasingly move online. Seven in 10 teachers, for instance, require students to go online for homework, according to Commissioner Jessica Rosenworcel, a Democrat. Mr. Wheeler and Mignon Clyburn, a Democratic commissioner, spearheaded the reform.Senior officials at the F.C.C. who drafted the new Lifeline proposal say the agency hopes the subsidy will also encourage Internet service providers like Comcast, AT&T and Time Warner Cable to go into low-income areas where they may not normally make a profit.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "As Economy Slows, Experts Call on China to Drop Growth Target", "Date": "2016-03-04", "News": "Supported byBEIJING \u2014 Every March, China releases a closely watched growth target for the year, a number that looms large for the world\u2019s economists, executives and policy makers. But a growing number of those experts are now calling for China to stop setting that goal, saying the target actually harms the economy and encourages officials to falsify data.On Saturday, at the start of the National People\u2019s Congress, the government announced a target for 2016 that acknowledges a worsening slowdown. It is a range, 6.5 percent to 7 percent economic growth over last year, rather than a number, suggesting that leaders are rethinking their adherence to hard-and-fast goals. Still, even the broader target is unlikely to reduce skepticism of official Chinese figures.The government\u2019s reading on the growth rate last year was 6.9 percent. The new target range means that leaders expect China\u2019s growth could dip this year, which would further depress the global economic outlook.Following tradition, Prime Minister Li Keqiang declared the new target at the legislature\u2019s opening session. The Chinese government also announced its intent to keep the annual growth rate at a minimum of 6.5 percent through 2020, according to a copy of the 13th Five-Year Plan released Saturday.Prime Minister Li Keqiang of China delivered his government's annual work report to the National People\u2019s Congress, the Communist Party-controlled legislature, on March 5. Here is a \u200bsearchable\u200b transcript of his speech.Economists say that is necessary to meet another goal China has set: having both the size of the economy and per capita personal income in 2020 be double that of 2010.The annual growth target \u2014 a product of China\u2019s mix of central planning and quasi capitalism \u2014 gives a general sense of what leaders think of the country\u2019s economic health, but no indication of how the growth is supposed to happen or what policies the leaders are adopting. Economists and investors want to know whether China is really addressing deepening economic problems.Though its service sector is growing, China is grappling with heavy debt and a glut of factories and homes, a legacy of years when the government pumped money into the economy to keep it humming. Global weakness has reduced demand for China\u2019s exports, while money is increasingly leaving the country.It also reinforces a growth-at-any-cost mentality that harms China\u2019s economy because it leads to wasteful investment and piles of debt. In January, the pace of lending reached a record level, with aggregate financing soaring to $525 billion.\u201cPutting too much emphasis on G.D.P. has become a habit,\u201d said Han Meng, a researcher at the Institute of Economics under the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, referring to gross domestic product, the focus of the annual target. \u201cNow we need to break that habit. We need to keep G.D.P., but at the same time not make it into a hard goal.\u201d\u201cThey\u2019re so obsessed with this G.D.P. target \u2014 it\u2019s not an economic narrative, it\u2019s a political narrative,\u201d said Leland Miller, president of China Beige Book, which provides independent economic data for investors.Now the propaganda value of hitting the target every year is wearing thin. Ordinary Chinese and foreign analysts say they doubt the economy is growing as quickly as the official rate indicates, given the facts on the ground: stagnant wages, mass layoffs and empty buildings nationwide, including apartment towers and shopping malls.They also point to missteps by Chinese leaders that highlight economic mismanagement in areas unrelated to the growth target, like the desperate, failed attempts in recent months to prevent a stock market rout.There is \u201cmuch more scrutiny on policy makers for their economic policy-making,\u201d said Mark Williams, chief Asia economist for Capital Economics, based in London. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t that long ago when the world felt the Chinese government could do no wrong when it came to managing their economy. But there\u2019s a lot more skepticism now, both in China and abroad.\u201dSome analysts say Chinese leaders should put more focus on measurements that give a much better sense of the nation\u2019s economic health \u2014 gauging quality of life or the purchasing power of households, for example.China\u2019s economy is faltering, prompting concerns that are now shaking global stock markets.Qi Jingmei, a senior economist with the State Information Center, which does economic research for central government agencies, said G.D.P. growth is \u201cnot the only number.\u201d\u201cWe want the public to care more about how and where the growth comes from,\u201d she said, \u201crather than only care about what the number is.\u201dChristopher Balding, an associate professor at the Peking University HSBC Business School, noted how the official growth number announced after the year ends always hews closely to the target set months earlier. Last year, the announced target was \u201cabout 7 percent,\u201d and the official achieved growth at year\u2019s end was 6.9 percent.As the economy stumbles, individuals and companies are pulling money out of China en masse, leaving the government scrambling to limit the outflows.\u201cIt\u2019s absurd how close they get to basically hitting their target,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve seen that pattern going back years.\u201dWhen gauging Liaoning\u2019s economy, Mr. Li preferred to look at three indicators, he said: electricity consumption, volume of rail cargo and the amount of loans disbursed.In December, Xinhua, China\u2019s official news agency, published a series of stories examining the problems in the lagging economies in the three northeastern provinces, including Liaoning. One article concluded that some local officials were falsifying data to burnish G.D.P. numbers and many other economic indicators.Analysts say the shift this year from one number for the target to a range is a move in the right direction, even if the change reveals uncertainty among policy makers about the strength of China\u2019s economy. Besides the central government, nine provinces are announcing ranges this year, according to official news reports.In 2014, Hu Shuli, founder of the influential Chinese economic magazine Caixin, wrote an essay that asked, \u201cIs the yearly G.D.P. target still important?\u201d She said there appeared to be a gap between the 7.5 percent target set that year and the economic slowdown already underway.\u201cWhen the growth goal originally set can\u2019t be met due to a change of economic climate, the government must meet the target using any favorable condition, or even create stimulus policies if there are no favorable conditions at all,\u201d Ms. Hu wrote.\u201cGrowth at any cost would cause policies to fail, leaving many illnesses such as overcapacity and high government debt, which will delay the economic structural shift.\u201dMia Li contributed research.Advertisement"}

China can also accelerate the destruction if we are not careful. So we like to be in an open dialogue about ways to mitigate destruction, but also to get China\u2019s assistance \u2014 financial, political, technical \u2014 to promote sustainable development.In the Focac\u2019s new three-year agenda, for the first time, Africa\u2019s wildlife and wild lands have been written into the plan. We think that\u2019s very significant. But we need to work quickly to say, What does that mean? Where? Which species? Which projects? Which investments? Our goal eventually is to meet with the Chinese government to offer our recommendations. The three years will go very quickly.I think that\u2019s a really systematic way that China could begin working with Africa. Also with nobody feeling left out.Now here is the other side. We have to be careful about where these roads go. We have to be careful about where large-scale agriculture goes. Our view is that the national parks and game reserves should be hands-off.What we hear sometimes is you have a national park and a company will come in, maybe Chinese, maybe somebody else, and will start to prospect. And if conservationists say, \u201cHey, what are you doing?,\u201d they say, \u201cNo, no, no. We are just prospecting.\u201d A year later, you find out they found something, and now they are talking about how to begin to drill for oil, to dig for minerals.I would love to see China taking this position, together with African countries, European countries and the West, saying national parks, game reserves, conservation areas, forest reserves are absolutely hands-off. No prospecting. No exploitation.A.W.F. has initiated talks with the Chinese Embassy in Kenya, and they\u2019ve asked us for proposals on what we can work on together. So it\u2019s country by country, which is a good start. What we\u2019d like to do now is make it systematic and planned across the whole continent.We do need companies and state-owned enterprises to behave in the right way, including what I\u2019ve mentioned: hands off national parks when Chinese companies are doing construction, or even things like mining or logging in Africa.Rich people from China are looking for places across the world to park their money. At least some people are parking at least some money in ivory. It\u2019s killing the elephants. So that behavior needs to change.Chinese people can be involved financially. You know in Western society, people have been donating. Regular people go on a website and give $20 or $30 or 20 euros. So somebody please go and give 100 renminbi. Regular people should use their social media to educate their friends. People should take safaris when they come to Africa and educate themselves and also help African economies. So our vision for the future is China participating fully in the entire spectrum of conservation.Because of an editing error, an earlier version of a picture caption with this article misstated the year that the picture, showing burning elephant ivory, was taken.

By charging banks more to keep deposits at the central bank and less to borrow from it, Mario Draghi, the E.C.B. president, and his colleagues hope to make it less attractive for commercial banks to hoard cash.Whether the broad and even radical set of measures will have an effect, only time can tell. But their sheer scope underscores the challenges that Mr. Draghi is up against in trying to formulate monetary policy with so many forces working against sustained economic growth in Europe.Those negative forces include a drop in demand for eurozone exports from emerging countries like China, unstable financial markets, and a decline in confidence among consumers and business managers.Together, those drags on the economy of the 19-country eurozone are a reason the bloc\u2019s unemployment rate is more than double that of the United States, and why eurozone growth has lagged the American rebound in recent years.Mr. Draghi on Thursday noted widespread criticism that central banks had become powerless in the face of economic trends. \u201cThe best answer to this is being given by our decisions today,\u201d Mr. Draghi said. \u201cWe have shown that we are not short of ammunition.\u201dBut the unexpected sweep of Thursday\u2019s announced steps was also seen as a sign that the E.C.B. was more worried than analysts thought about the risk of deflation.\u201cThis has all the hallmarks of the E.C.B. having thrown the kitchen sink at the problem,\u201d Patrick O\u2019Donnell, an investment manager at Aberdeen Asset Management, said in a statement.Experts said that paying banks to lend has never been tried by one of the world\u2019s major central banks. In theory, Sweden has such a rate, but banks there have not taken advantage of it because they already have more funds than anyone wants to borrow.The whiff of desperation in Thursday\u2019s moves helped explain why stocks gave up initial gains after Mr. Draghi\u2019s remarks. And the euro rose against the dollar \u2014 a potential drag on eurozone exports \u2014 after he said that rates would not be cut further.In normal times, commercial banks earn interest on money parked at the central bank, and pay money to borrow. That convention will now be reversed, at least in some cases.The new approach, being paid to lend, will apply to a special program that allows banks to borrow money for four years, provided they lend the money on to consumers and businesses.Initially banks will pay zero percent interest, the new main benchmark rate. But if the commercial banks meet certain criteria, they will get a bonus of 0.4 percent annually on the value of the loan after two years, applied retroactively.Theoretically, banks would be able to refinance up to 30 percent of their loan books under this new arrangement.One of the eurozone\u2019s enduring problems is a dangerously low inflation rate. Despite the bank\u2019s stimulus measures to date, inflation in the 19 countries of the eurozone has been stuck near or below zero for more than a year.The inflation rate, which had been slightly positive, was minus 0.2 percent in February, according to official figures.Falling prices are a symptom of slow growth. They also hurt borrowers, whose loan payments become more onerous if there is no inflation. Moreover, a broad, sustained decline in prices can become self-fulfilling and difficult to reverse, which is why economists fear it so much.As recently as December, the central bank had forecast an inflation rate of 1 percent for 2016. On Thursday, Mr. Draghi said the forecast was now for 0.1 percent for this year.The bank\u2019s forecast calls for inflation to revive, rising to 1.3 percent next year and 1.6 percent for 2018. That would still be less than the official target of below, but close to, 2 percent.The central bank last hit the target in 2013.There has been considerable debate among economists about whether the central bank measures have done any good. There are also risks. For example, negative interest rates on central bank deposits could hurt bank profits even as many lenders are struggling with bad loans or other troubled assets.The new, extraordinarily favorable terms announced Thursday on money borrowed from the central bank may help to counteract the drag on lenders\u2019 profits, though Mr. Draghi said that was not the goal.It was almost exactly a year ago that the E.C.B. set eurozone precedent by buying government bonds and other assets. The program, similar to one begun in the United States much earlier, has not been enough to bring eurozone growth back to where it was before the global financial crisis of 2008.On Thursday, he defended the central bank\u2019s stimulus efforts so far, saying that without them the eurozone would have already incurred \u201cdisastrous deflation.\u201dBut he also called on eurozone governments, as he has often done, to do their part to stimulate the economy by taking measures to raise productivity and by making changes to improve the business environment. Those steps, he said, should include more spending on infrastructure.Mr. Draghi also appeared to take pleasure Thursday in defying critics who said the E.C.B.\u2019s Governing Council suffered from internal disagreements that prevented it from aggressively stimulating the economy.As far as the measures announced Thursday were concerned, he said, \u201cThe majority in favor has been overwhelming.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated when the European Central Bank began using negative interest rates on commercial banks\u2019 deposits. It was June 2014, not last June.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Sotheby\u2019s and Christie\u2019s Adapt to Digital Age", "Date": "2016-03-11", "News": "Supported byArt for TomorrowThe top art auction houses had a carefree and comfortable time of it for most of the first couple of centuries of their existence, but lately they have been hustling to adjust to a radical transformation of their industry. New digital technology and new customers with new attitudes in new places, along with new competition from deft and nimble upstarts eager to cater to them, have forced the dominant companies, Sotheby\u2019s and Christie\u2019s, to develop new ways to do business.They are responding to the challenge by throwing their money and names around, buying or forming looser affiliations with rivals that understand the shifting realities of the marketplace, including a collector base increasingly inclined to buy art online and on the go, better than they do because the arrivistes helped create those realities. \u201cBusinesses need to evolve, and although the auction process has been around close to forever, the technology changes things; the way the market works changes things, and so does the global nature of the market,\u201d said Suzanne Gyorgy, global head of art advisory and finance at Citi Private Bank, a subsidiary of Citigroup. As with many businesses, the Internet presents the greatest threat to the established order in the art market and the greatest opportunity, too. Online art sales in 2014 reached 3.3 billion euros, or about $3.6 billion, according to the latest edition of the European Fine Art Foundation annual report. That represents about 6 percent of the global market in art and antiques and a 32 percent increase from 2013. Global auction sales totaled \u20ac24.6 billion in 2014, the report said. That was 48 percent of the market, but it marked just a 9.3 percent gain on the year before and was barely over the \u20ac24 billion recorded in 2007, the previous high-water mark. Tefaf and other organizations that monitor the market, such as Hiscox, an insurance company that specializes in art, among other niches, foresee growth of about 25 percent a year in online sales for the rest of the decade. To grab a piece of the action, the auction industry leaders have expanded vigorously online. Christie\u2019s, in 2011, set up an online-only auction platform that held 79 sales in 2015, said Jennifer Ferguson, a company spokeswoman. Last year Christie\u2019s bought Collectrium, a digital art collection management service. \u201cWe have made important hires to support a new marketing and content strategy in both print and digital across all our platforms, as well as strategic digital acquisitions,\u201d Ms. Ferguson said. \u201cNone of this happened in just the last 12 months, but has been happening over the last five years.\u201d Sotheby\u2019s raised its profile online last year when it began streaming its auctions live on eBay, the all-purpose auction website. \u201cWe want to create more channels and more ways for our collectors to be able to engage in and buy things that they love,\u201d said David Goodman, Sotheby\u2019s executive vice president for digital development and marketing.Perhaps more important, arrangements such as this give the company access to customers they might not have had otherwise. \u201cWe\u2019re able to see a different group of people from what we would normally have in the consignment auction process,\u201d Mr. Goodman said. \u201cIt\u2019s a way to expand our distribution and our brand and introduce new people to the world of collecting. We\u2019re excited about the momentum we\u2019re seeing in the online space.\u201d The marketplace is expanding in the real world, too, and auction firms are taking varied steps to cater to new buyers. Sotheby\u2019s recently bought Art Agency Partners, which provides collectors with advice on art, legal and investment matters. The acquisition is expected to help Sotheby\u2019s expand and enhance its private sales, an activity that the industry sees as a more lucrative way to sell art than the traditional auction business. Among the moves that Ms. Ferguson highlighted at Christie\u2019s is the opening of offices in Shanghai and in Mumbai, India, part of an effort that \u201chas helped nurture new growth across both the emerging collector and established collector sectors.\u201d The collectors that have emerged from places like China and India have become a critical segment of the global art market. They have been sources of tremendous growth for auction houses, but also sources of volatility and consternation. China accounted for 27.3 percent of global art transactions in 2014, according to a Citigroup report, compared with just 0.2 percent in 2000. But after years of surging growth, the Chinese art market, like its economy and stock market, has been slumping lately. Auction sales of Chinese contemporary art dropped 41 percent last year, according to a report by ArtTactic, a London firm that analyzes the art market. The report noted that sales in other Asian markets took up some of the slack, rising 14 percent in India, for instance, and 28 percent in Southeast Asia. In a survey of industry experts by ArtTactic, 19 percent more respondents said they expected the Chinese art market to shrink this year than to expand, worse than for any market except Russia. India was considered to have the best prospects, with a net 48 percent positive on the market. The American and European markets combined had a 16 percent net favorable assessment. The possibility that Chinese art sales may be leveling off leads Benjamin R. Mandel, global strategist for multi-asset solutions at J.P. Morgan Asset Management, to warn that the next 15 years for the global art market may not be as fruitful as the last 15. He is also concerned that the trend toward ever more extravagant prices for a handful of works amid so-so growth elsewhere is bound to reverse. \u201cChina\u2019s extraordinary period of catch-up growth has largely played out, while the inequality in auction prices may reach some natural limit,\u201d Mr. Mandel wrote in a recent report. \u201cAs a result, the slowing of these factors could subtract up to a third from the annual growth of the global market; that is, global growth would be on the order of 9 percent, rather than 13 percent.\u201d Whether or not the auction houses are taking such forecasts to heart, they are easing back on the splashy evening sales that they\u2019re best known for by combining different genres of art, such as Impressionism and Postwar Contemporary, and bunching sales together on the calendar. They present the moves as a means of catering to clients with eclectic tastes, but they also may reduce costs. The more traditional competition that auction houses face comes from brick-and-mortar galleries, and they are adapting and contributing to the evolution of the market, too. Alessia Zorloni, adjunct professor in art markets at Libera Universit\u00e0 di Lingue e Comunicazione IULM, in Milan, observed a trend among galleries to abandon the middle ground. \u201cThere are two choices for dealers today, either to run a lightweight, cost-effective operation that supports young artists or adopt the mega-gallery model,\u201d she said. \u201cThe high-end art market is controlled by a few dozen operators and characterized by a small number of large and powerful galleries, often organized as real commercial companies with a wide network of connections with other galleries, and in the most important cases, with branches in other cities.\u201d These galleries trade on the value of their brands and reputations, Ms. Zorloni said, just as the auction houses do. These are important aspects of any business but especially in one like art where the value of the main product is hard to calculate and based on subjective criteria. That\u2019s why the auction industry faces little threat at the top end from online entities, in her view. \u201cIf you think about this feature of the art market, there will never be competition with websites, even mainstream ones like Amazon and eBay,\u201d she said. \u201cThey are simply different market segments appealing to different customers. The power of auction house brands will remain strong. Not only do auction houses have access to first-class works, but obviously they also have access to the clientele that no one dealer can compete with.\u201d As time goes on, auction companies may embrace the distinctions between market segments even further: providing a premium service for high-end collectors centered on a few evening sales while using extensive online abilities to grant greater access to the market, with fewer frills, to a growing number of customers with thinner wallets. \u201cThe number of buyers in the art market has increased so dramatically in the last five years,\u201d said Ms. Gyorgy, of Citi Private Bank. \u201cDeveloping an online presence is really smart.\u201d As for the marquee sales, \u201cpeople really like the auction experience,\u201d she said, adding, \u201cIt\u2019s some of the best theater in town, but it\u2019s expensive theater to put on.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Alaska\u2019s Schools Face Cuts at Every Level Over Oil Collapse", "Date": "2016-03-14", "News": "Supported byANCHORAGE \u2014 Alaska\u2019s schools are bleeding red ink.The most troubling part, teachers, professors and administrators across the state said, is that with a roughly $3.5 billion state budget shortfall, things could get much worse \u2014 not least for morale.\u201cAt every one of our campuses, something is likely to go away,\u201d said James R. Johnsen, the president of the University of Alaska. \u201cAnd if every campus is losing something, then every campus has a constituency that is aggrieved.\u201dDrillers are pumping less, and at around $40 a barrel, the state is collecting less in taxes on the oil that is pumped, making for a state budget crater of crisis proportions. The Republican-controlled Legislature has so far been loath to consider new taxes in an election year, and education, along with health and welfare, accounts for about two-thirds of the state budget.The deeper story, educators and state officials said, is that a long-delayed day of reckoning over education policies and promises made in a different era, under different circumstances, has arrived.In the mid-1970s, for example, when memories of the bleak and barren boarding schools for rural tribal people were still fresh, Alaska declared that it would eliminate the differences between rich districts and poor ones. Fairness and equity, the state said, would be the rule. Oil money allowed that promise to be kept, with the state paying almost $60,000 per year, per pupil, to educate students in some of the country\u2019s most remote and isolated public schools.The University of Alaska, gifted with a flood of oil money and federal research grants \u2014 which have also been in retreat \u2014 embarked on a path of ambition that included introducing new academic disciplines. As enrollment grew to nearly 29,000 students, the school built hundreds of buildings across three major campuses \u2014 in urban centers like Anchorage and Fairbanks, and in rural spots off the road system where the costs for heating fuel and supplies, all of which have to be delivered by airplane, can be absurdly high.In 2006, when the stock market was near its peak, Alaska also shifted its teacher retirement system for new hires, from guaranteed pensions to self-directed plans similar to a 401(k). Then, to make the idea more attractive, it made benefits portable, meaning that teachers vested in plans could quit and not lose money that they, or the state, had put in. The result, as tough times have walloped the schools, is a flood of resignations, and teachers heading south with Alaskan money in their pockets, looking for new jobs somewhere else.\u201cIt\u2019s gotten harder to get teachers to come here, and very hard to get them to stay,\u201d said Kameron H. Perez-Verdia, the president of the Anchorage School District.Gov. Bill Walker, an independent, has proposed restoring the state\u2019s personal income tax, which was repealed in 1980 after the oil gusher hit, and raising many other taxes as well, from alcohol to gasoline.Over the last two and a half years, the oil industry experienced its deepest downturn since at least the 1990s.And while Mr. Walker\u2019s plan includes deep cuts in spending for education, some legislative proposals are even more drastic. One lawmaker proposed closing dozens of the smallest rural schools. Others have said the university should retreat from its expensive research function and become more like a community college system, focused on teaching. A proposal to cut back on subsidies for high-speed Internet in rural areas sent another shiver through the education system, since about 90 percent of University of Alaska students take at least one course remotely.\u201cIt would set us back 10 years,\u201d said Linda Ady, the library director in Pelican, an island community of 110 people in southeast Alaska, where good cellphone service is available only if you climb a mountain, and high-speed Internet at the library is the main link for people doing university course work or connecting with the wider world.Making matters worse is that Alaska\u2019s economic cycle is profoundly out of step with the rest of the nation. During the depths of the recession in 2008 and 2009, Alaska was barely scathed because oil revenues held steady. So it could \u2014 and did \u2014 happily entice teachers to come north for the pay, or the adventure, or both. Now the tables have been turned, and states like Oregon, Nevada and Arizona have said that with better economic times, they are hiring teachers again.Stories of teacher departures are varied, and often anguished and conflicted.Amanda Barrett, 24, who came to Nightmute \u2014 almost 1,100 miles from Juneau \u2014 last August for her first teaching job, said she was returning home to New Jersey when the school year ended to look for work there or in Pennsylvania. The reasons, she said, are personal, and no reflection on her school or village. But the cultural shock of bush Alaska in winter, off the road system, was also no small thing, she said.Frank von Hippel, a professor of biology at the University of Alaska, recently accepted a job at Northern Arizona University in Flagstaff, which is giving him a raise and paying the costs of moving his lab. He said that the unsettled budget climate had prompted him to look around, and that when he did, the offer was great.\u201cPart of the problem up here is the uncertainty,\u201d Professor von Hippel said. \u201cIt\u2019s not only the declining budgets, but no clarity on where we\u2019re going to end up.\u201dSome state lawmakers said Alaska\u2019s education system, in the fat financial years, rarely had to restrain the impulse to provide a new service, add a new job or build a new building, and that going back to a core mission could be positive.\u201cYou just can\u2019t do everything, and that, in my opinion, is what they have tried to do,\u201d said Tammie Wilson, a Republican who chairs the subcommittee in the Alaska House of Representatives that oversees the University of Alaska\u2019s budget. \u201cThey can\u2019t keep doing business the way they have.\u201dDr. Johnsen, the university president, said he completely agreed with that position and has a plan that would consolidate strengths \u2014 and notably reduce administrative overhead \u2014 at the school\u2019s three main accredited campuses, in Fairbanks, Anchorage and Juneau.He said that the troubles in Alaska\u2019s oil were also a signal the state\u2019s economy was shifting into a new era, and that the education system must be a part of the answer in training people for that next economic chapter.But with fewer high school graduates in Alaska continuing directly to college than in almost any other state, partly because well-paying blue-collar jobs have been so abundant, there are also fewer traditions around education to support it or sustain it, or to push lawmakers to fund it. The inevitable reality for now, Dr. Johnsen said, is that there will be blood.\u201cWe\u2019ve got to bring out the sharp knives,\u201d he said.An article on March 15 about budget cuts that Alaska schools are facing because of lower oil prices referred incorrectly to science faculty departures at the University of Alaska. Ten biology faculty members who have left were from both the Fairbanks and Anchorage campuses, not just Fairbanks, creating a loss of 10 faculty members out of 60, not 10 out of 45.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Bernie Sanders Sees Michigan Win as a Springboard to the Nomination", "Date": "2016-03-11", "News": "Supported byMr. Sanders seemed newly energized and tactical as he sat by a pool at his Miami hotel and predicted that Tuesday\u2019s win was just the beginning of a phase of the campaign that he would dominate. Saying that coming primaries and caucuses looked unusually promising for him, he described plans to crisscross the country arguing that Mrs. Clinton championed policies that wrecked lives. He also said he would tell voters that he was the strongest candidate to put up against Donald J. Trump, the Republican front-runner.\u201cWe are heading to the Midwest. We are going to Ohio. We are going to Illinois, going to Missouri, drop into North Carolina,\u201d Mr. Sanders said. \u201cThese states in the Midwest are going to respond to us and our message in the same way Michigan workers did, and that is, \u2018We need an economy that works for all of us and not just the 1 percent. We need a trade policy that creates jobs in America, not in China or in Mexico.\u2019\u00a0\u201d\u201cI think the future now bodes well for us because we are moving out of the Deep South, where we have not done well,\u201d he continued.Several Democratic strategists and pollsters said they now thought Mr. Sanders could win the Ohio primary \u2014 and perhaps Illinois and Missouri \u2014 after the senator performed unexpectedly well among independents and young people in Michigan and also beat Mrs. Clinton by more than 10 percentage points with white voters there, according to exit polls. Mr. Sanders also won support from about 30 percent of Michigan\u2019s black voters, a larger share than in recent contests in the South, a sign that he might be able to stop Mrs. Clinton from winning the landslides she is aiming for in predominantly black neighborhoods in Chicago, Cleveland and St. Louis.\u201cAfter Michigan, Bernie can certainly win Ohio, and frankly you cannot write him off in any major urban metropolitan state anymore,\u201d said Peter D. Hart, a veteran Democratic pollster. \u201cHe has hit a perfect dynamic that few of us expected: He is campaigning on issues like economic insecurity and inequality that are central in this election, he is not seen as overtly political, and he has an ability to contrast himself with every other candidate by being frank and authentic.\u201dOhio, a bellwether swing state in presidential elections, is particularly crucial for Mr. Sanders because a victory could increase doubts about Mrs. Clinton\u2019s vulnerabilities in a general election. His free trade argument has become an enviable weapon with blue-collar workers in Ohio and other Rust Belt states because his longtime opposition to trade pacts is a rare and clear policy difference with Mrs. Clinton. She has supported deals like the North American Free Trade Agreement and still argues that trade can benefit American workers.\u201cIf Sanders wins Ohio, there is a new narrative for the next three months, and the nomination fight goes on to the California primary on June 7 in a way that no one ever predicted,\u201d said Robert Shrum, a veteran political adviser to several Democratic presidential campaigns. \u201cOhio would give Sanders further legitimacy and the standing to go all the way to the convention and make the case to superdelegates there that he is better able to win in November.\u201dMr. Sanders acknowledges that it will not be easy to erase Mrs. Clinton\u2019s delegate lead, but he is convinced that he can persuade superdelegates, who can support any Democratic candidate for the nomination, to back him if he wins enough states.Superdelegates could become critical if neither candidate has clinched the nomination when the contests end in June. Such was the case in 2008: Barack Obama had a lead over Mrs. Clinton of about 100 pledged delegates in June, but not enough to secure the nomination. But he did have support from enough superdelegates to put him over the top, and Mrs. Clinton \u2014 under pressure to unite the party \u2014 chose not to go to the Democratic convention to try to peel away his superdelegates.According to the Associated Press, Donald J. Trump and Hillary Clinton have each won enough delegates to claim their party\u2019s nomination for president.Mrs. Clinton now has 214 more pledged delegates than Mr. Sanders, and support from 461 superdelegates to his 25. Superdelegates are not bound by the popular primary vote. (The Republicans do not have superdelegates.)Mrs. Clinton\u2019s advisers expressed confidence that no matter how many more narrow victories Mr. Sanders won in major states like Michigan, he would never overtake her in the pledged delegate count \u2014 and that superdelegates would stand by her. Advisers for Mr. Sanders said their candidate was unlikely to win more delegates than Mrs. Clinton on Tuesday, adding that they hoped to come close and then start winning more delegates in contests starting in late March.Mr. Sanders, for his part, declined several times to name states where he could win 60 percent or more of the vote, the sort of margin he would need to catch up to Mrs. Clinton in the delegate race.Still, he radiated more optimism than at any point in his 11-month campaign.\u201cI think we\u2019ve got a good shot to win New York State, which is obviously a state with a lot of delegates,\u201d he said, referring to Mrs. Clinton\u2019s home base. \u201cI think we have an excellent chance to win California.\u201dMr. Sanders has also been increasingly talking about a strategy for the West Coast, and not just California, which has a whopping 546 delegates at stake. Democrats in Alaska, Idaho, Utah, Washington State and Wyoming hold caucuses, a voting format that has favored Mr. Sanders, and his supporters are hopeful that he could prevail in those states, as well as in Oregon.\u201cThe only thing that would have stopped Bernie is if it was clear he didn\u2019t have a shot to win the nomination or influence the debate, but a lot of people feel he can do both,\u201d said Pramila Jayapal, a Washington State senator who is a prominent Sanders supporter in Seattle.In Tuesday\u2019s voting, Mr. Sanders also hopes to peel away delegates from Mrs. Clinton in North Carolina, where she and former President Bill Clinton have been campaigning.\u201cI expect him to perform better in North Carolina than the conventional wisdom suggests,\u201d said Jack Quinn, a Democratic superdelegate from Asheville, N.C., who is backing Mr. Sanders. \u201cYes, he will do well in college towns, and in my town, and my county.\u201dMr. Sanders also said he would be stressing to voters that he could win battleground states in the general election in a way that Mrs. Clinton could not.\u201cShe is getting a lot of delegates from states that most observers think, unfortunately but truly, that Democrats are not going to win,\u201d Mr. Sanders said. \u201cBernie Sanders won in Michigan, which is a tossup state, won big in New Hampshire, which is a tossup state, won big in Colorado, which is a tossup state, won big in Minnesota, which is a tossup state. These are states the Democrats can and must win.\u201dTad Devine, the campaign\u2019s senior adviser, said Mr. Sanders would soon have television and digital advertising in the five states voting on Tuesday \u2014 Florida, Illinois, Missouri, North Carolina and Ohio. He also described the race as developing in phases now.\u201cThe general picture is this: Our goal for next Tuesday is to win as many delegates as we can. If we can win states, too, that would be great,\u201d Mr. Devine said. \u201cWe are then going to go into a period of the process where we believe we have great opportunities to win a lot of contests in states and to beat Hillary Clinton.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "India's Water Wars", "Date": "2016-03-01", "News": "Supported byOp-Ed ContributorNEW DELHI \u2014 Army trucks rumbled along dusty village roads, soldiers opened fire, crowds panicked and eventually the Indian Army took control of Munak canal, the conduit that supplies three-fifths of New Delhi\u2019s fresh water.This happened late last month in Haryana, the state that borders New Delhi on three sides. Demonstrators from the Jat caste blocked roads and railway lines, torched buses, shops and homes, and switched off the water supply to the capital\u2019s 18 million residents. They were demanding inclusion in India\u2019s caste-based affirmative action program, seeking access to government jobs.A local newspaper quoted one Jat protester as saying, \u201cIf we remain hungry, you, too, will die of thirst.\u201d The authorities responded by sending thousands of troops into the state. At least 18 people were killed, and 200 people were injured.The Jats occupy an ambiguous position in India\u2019s social hierarchy. Some consider them low caste, but they dominate political life in Haryana. For decades, they acquired significant wealth by tilling, and more recently by selling, farmland adjoining Delhi. But as farms have fragmented with every passing generation, profits from agriculture have shrunk and the local property market has tanked.The problem of Haryana, like that of the rest of the country, is that corporate India has enriched itself without creating meaningful, well-paid employment for the 10 million young Indians who come of working age each year. And since Indian politicians are beholden to their corporate donors, arguments about economic inequality, redistribution of wealth and unemployment are best couched in other terms, namely the language of social injustice.The Jats know from long historical experience that the best way to garner attention in order to make such a point is to paralyze the daily workings of the state, but stopping just short of outright revolt. In cutting off Delhi\u2019s water supply, the Jat community has deployed a form of protest refined over centuries of negotiation between the countryside and the imperial city of Delhi.Arid Delhi has been obsessed with access to water since its inception. In the 13th and 14th centuries, a complex arrangement of reservoirs and channels kept the city supplied: A well-run hydraulic system was the sign of a well-run empire. When local order crumbled, the supply of water failed and urban settlements came under threat, the historian M. Athar Ali notes in a compendium of essays on Mughal India.In the 1260s, Mr. Ali writes, the city\u2019s beloved reservoir dried up \u201cbecause the channels feeding it were damned up by \u2018dishonest men.\u201d\u2019 Could these \u201cdishonest men\u201d of courtly record be the forebears of the Jats, who would soon come to occupy the farmlands through which these canals were laid? Mr. Ali doesn\u2019t say, but at the close of the 16th century the Jats had settled all around the capital. And by the 18th century, with the Mughal Empire in decline, Jat bandits routinely blocked the arterial roads leading into Delhi, leaving hundreds of travelers stranded and at their mercy.In the colonial period, the Jats initially suffered under the rapacious rent regime of the British, but they bounced back after the mutiny of 1857. By the end of the 19th century, they had consolidated their land holdings, often by buying up and settling entire villages. A government report from the time, quoted by Kai Friese in \u201cPeasant Communities and Agrarian Capitalism,\u201d describes a transaction in Meerut, about 40 miles from Delhi: \u201cThe purchase was effected not only through clear proposals but also by force, arson and even murder.\u201dToday, Jats remain active in the land and water market surrounding Delhi. The metropolitan city area sucks up 900 million gallons of fresh water each day from across northern India, 60 percent of which must first flow through the Jat lands of Haryana. One quarter of Delhi\u2019s households live without a water connection, according to 2013 government figures, the most recent and most reliable data available. Many people are forced to turn to private, and predominantly Jat, water-tanker suppliers, who are demonized in the press as a local \u201cwater mafia.\u201d And when the state angers the Jats \u2014 as it did in 2014 when it asked the Jat leader Ajit Singh to vacate his official residence long after he had ceased to be a minister \u2014 they march off to the nearest canal.The roots of the current violence date back to the 1990s, when the Jats were excluded from a significant expansion of India\u2019s affirmative action program, which set aside a percentage of government jobs and university seats for less privileged groups. Both the Congress Party and the Bharatiya Janata Party, which came to power in 2014, have at different times moved to include Jats in the quota system. But the Supreme Court has refused, claiming the group isn\u2019t \u201cbackward\u201d enough.The recent protest erupted when a seemingly peaceful march of Jat demonstrators suddenly turned violent and quickly spread across Haryana. The violence has since subsided, after the army was deployed and the government offered to establish a high-level committee to look into Jat demands.Newspaper editorials have condemned the destruction of property, and describing the unrest as \u201cquota blackmail\u201d have warned the government against setting a bad precedent for other politically dominant communities who are demanding reservations, like Patidars, also known as Patels, in Gujarat. Granting job reservations to powerful castes takes away opportunities from genuinely oppressed groups like dalits, who are routinely discriminated against by most caste groups, including Jats.These are good arguments, but they miss a core point, which is that the Jats\u2019 move to articulate their economic grievances in terms of caste is strategic.India\u2019s poor wind up paying more than the middle class for water and electricity because they are often forced to give bribes for essential services, and they are disproportionately affected by direct taxes on consumption. While India\u2019s state-owned banks have written off millions of dollars worth of unpaid corporate loans, indebted farmers are driven to suicide.Electoral politics, rather than fundamentally transforming this system, simply puts a democratic gloss on routinized appropriation. Workers who organize to demand better pay are called Maoists, villagers who oppose land acquisition are accused of working at the behest of foreign-funded NGOs, students who criticize the government\u2019s social and economic policies are labeled seditionists.But if you organize yourself and agitate as a caste of dominant landowners, like the Jats, no one will question your patriotism.Haryana is one of India\u2019s wealthier states. It is close to Delhi, land prices are relatively high, and after several hundred years of investment in irrigation it has a network of canals that allows farmers to grow remunerative crops like rice and wheat. The state also boasts of a robust manufacturing base, particularly for automobiles.If despite all this, young Haryanvi are willing to face the might of the Indian Army for a better chance at a government job, something must be rotten at the heart of India\u2019s economy. By cutting off Delhi\u2019s water and invoking social equality, what the Jats are really saying is this: There are no jobs, and we, in the countryside, are seething.Aman Sethi is a journalist and the author of \u201cA Free Man: A True Story of Life and Death in Delhi.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Fall of China\u2019s Hedge-Fund King", "Date": "2016-03-29", "News": "FeatureXu Xiang was a legend in the country\u2019s booming stock market \u2014 until the bubble he helped to create took him down with it.Supported byThat weekend, Xu Xiang, one of the wealthiest men in China, had been visiting Ningbo, his hometown, to attend his grandmother\u2019s 100th birthday party. As the founder of Zexi Investment, one of China\u2019s most successful hedge funds, Xu had consistently produced returns that were truly unbelievable: His worst-performing fund had grown by nearly 800 percent in five years. He had also survived countless corruption investigations, market falls, purges and other scares. Yet even as his legend grew, Xu remained intensely secretive. He had amassed a fortune by trading on knowledge and information no one else had, rumors no one else knew \u2014 a strategy perfectly crafted for China, where information is tightly controlled and reluctantly released. (Almost every source I approached for this article would only speak to me anonymously, fearing government reprisal or harm to their business.) Even as Xu grew richer and more powerful, he kept nearly every detail about his personal life and his trading techniques jealously hidden.That equilibrium seemed certain to crumble on June 12, when the Chinese stock market began a free-fall. In the span of three weeks, the market lost a third of its value. It continued to careen downward throughout the summer, with major declines on July 27 and Aug. 24. On the second of these, named Black Monday by The People\u2019s Daily, the Shanghai composite index fell by 8.5 percent, its worst single-day tumble in eight years. In the span of two and a half months, $5 trillion was wiped out of the market. The ripples were felt around the globe. On Black Monday, the Dow Jones industrial average fell more than 1,000 points shortly after opening, and the FTSE 100 index in London lost $116 billion. Yet Xu (pronounced shu) somehow managed to survive this free-fall unscathed.Despite his wealth, the party in Ningbo had been a low-key affair. Xu\u2019s family shared his taste for anonymity. His wife preferred the subway to her chauffeured car, and his grandmother still lived in the same middle-class neighborhood where Xu grew up. But the festivities were interrupted a little before 10:30 that Sunday, when Xu received a message bearing a warning: The authorities were coming for him.Xu left the party immediately and sped north on the G15 Expressway toward Shanghai. As he drove, he passed neighborhoods of squat gray apartment buildings with smog-stained walls, unkempt courtyards and barred windows. He crossed the Fenghua River, which bisects Ningbo, and curved along Hangzhou Bay, racing toward the bridge. But he didn\u2019t know about the police blockade. When he reached the bridge, the authorities ushered him from his car and shuttled him to the side of the expressway to an office of the highway patrol.Xu began trading while still in high school. He was entirely self-taught: His parents, a retired factory worker and a homemaker, knew nothing about investing. \u201cI studied the stock market by reading books and attending lectures and by studying foreign investment techniques,\u201d Xu later told Caixin, a Chinese news organization, in one of the few interviews he has given. After graduating from high school, he skipped China\u2019s infamous college entrance exam and borrowed 30,000 renminbi (roughly $5,000) from his parents to trade full time. He would later say that he had actually been born in 1993 \u2014 the year he first started trading stocks.At the time, millions of Chinese were opening stock accounts with an enthusiasm that proved long-lasting and transformative. Between Shanghai and a second exchange in Shenzhen, the market grew from a capitalization of $61 billion in 1993 to $10 trillion by the summer of 2015. Unlike in the United States, where institutional investors dominate the market, China\u2019s 200 million mom-and-pop investors make roughly 85 percent of all trades. According to a survey by the State Street Center for Applied Research, 81 percent of these trade at least once a month. But less-experienced individual investors are easily swayed by rumors and operate with a poor understanding of market fundamentals, making them easy prey for more systematic and sophisticated traders. \u201cAll these small individual investors are called \u2018chives\u2019 in the market,\u201d says Hong Yan, a finance professor at the Shanghai Advanced Institute of Finance. \u201cThey get cut over and over again, but they come back every time, like little weeds.\u201dIn his early days, Xu worked from the Galaxy Securities trading hall on South Liberation Road in Ningbo. Stock prices were written in chalk on blackboards, and arbitrary rule changes affecting stock issuance and corporate disclosure constantly jostled an already unpredictable market. In 1992, the Shanghai index grew by 167 percent \u2014 then tumbled roughly 75 percent between April 1993 and July 1994. The fact that China Galaxy Securities was a state-owned enterprise offered little protection; as Xu cut his teeth, the traders around him won and lost fortunes almost overnight.On an overcast Monday morning last December, I visited Galaxy. The building itself had hardly changed from the days when Xu first set foot inside. Located beside a pharmacy that glowed with blue lights, the eight-story structure seemed on the verge of physical collapse. A wide concrete staircase, littered with cigarette butts and sun\u00adflower seeds, led up to the main trading hall on the second floor, which, by 9 a.m., was packed with haggard-looking investors. Directly opposite the trading board, hung above a small statue of a golden bull, was a red banner urging traders to \u201cstay away from illegal securities activities.\u201dAs Xu\u2019s fame grew, so did his network. By the late 1990s, he became the unofficial captain of a group popularly known as the Ningbo Death Squad. The squad made its reputation by manipulating cheap, relatively unknown stocks, which in the Chinese market are not allowed to rise or fall more than 10 percent in a single trading day. To game the system, the squad devised a strategy: Out of nowhere, it would place a gigantic order for a chosen stock. Other traders, seeing the sudden upward movement in price, would flood in, pushing the stock toward its daily 10-percent limit. Once the stock hit the limit on the first day, the momentum became self-perpetuating. Eager traders rushed to buy the stock as soon as the market opened the next day, propelling it toward the 10-percent limit once again. The movement generated its own publicity and easy profits. After a few days, the squad would sell out, and the stock would tumble back to a lower price as other traders followed. In the American context, this tactic was reminiscent of present-day schemes in \u201cpenny stocks,\u201d but with much higher stakes, and playing out in a regulatory environment that mirrored the early days of the United States market. One Chinese day trader I talked to spoke in reverent tones about the turn-of-the-century American stock picker Jesse Livermore, who made and lost several multimillion-dollar fortunes before killing himself in 1940 at 63.As the squad gained notoriety, other traders began to monitor the buy orders coming from the Galaxy trading hall \u2014 any stock they picked was guaranteed to attract attention, and a corresponding surge in buy orders. Profit was almost unavoidable.Despite Xu\u2019s preference for anonymity \u2014 he eschewed flashy purchases while other squad members parked new sports cars conspicuously in front of the trading hall \u2014 the group took on a mythical status. There was a series of books by two self-proclaimed \u201cNingbo masters,\u201d as well as traveling seminars that promised to teach legions of novice investors the moneymaking secrets of the Ningbo Death Squad. Copycat death squads popped up in other Chinese cities.The attention was not all positive. After a 2003 article in The China Securities Journal raised questions, the China Securities Regulatory Commission, the country\u2019s chief market watchdog, assigned a special czar to investigate the trading practices at Galaxy Securities and five other Ningbo trading halls. In the process, the czar called in a number of big-name local traders for an \u201cinformal discussion session.\u201d The squad disappeared from the market, only to return a week later when the czar released a public statement saying he had found no evidence of wrongdoing. Whatever the traders\u2019 methods, they were pulling in millions, and Ningbo \u2014 and the greater Chinese economy \u2014 was thriving.It was only in 2005 that a revision to China\u2019s Securities Law helped pave the way for hedge funds. Those funds that decided to operate openly within the new framework became known as \u201csunshine funds,\u201d to distinguish them from funds who kept their participants hidden. As this was happening, a new class of wealthy Chinese, enriched by the country\u2019s rapid economic boom, suddenly found themselves with billions of renminbi to invest. \u201cIt was just the perfect storm,\u201d says Zhang Howhow, the director of strategy at KPMG in Hong Kong. \u201cPeople were starting to study the regulations more closely, more seriously, to find a relatively legal way to approach this as a business. The market was going up, and you have a group of high-net-worth individuals.\u201d This was Xu\u2019s chance \u201cto build a proper hedge fund in China \u2014 the biggest, the most successful.\u201dOn Dec. 7, 2009, Xu founded Zexi Investments with 30 million renminbi \u2014 a little under $4.5 million \u2014 in capital. The name was a homage to the two men Xu admired most: \u201cZe\u201d for Mao Zedong, the founder of the People\u2019s Republic of China, and \u201cxi\u201d for Emperor Kangxi, the longest-ruling emperor in Chinese his\u00adtory. In March 2010, Xu opened Zexi\u2019s first fund with one billion renminbi. It was technically a sunshine fund, but because it had fewer than 200 investors, he wasn\u2019t required to divulge the names of his clients.As a boss, Xu was obsessive and untiring. Friends say he had no hobbies or interests outside the stock market. He arrived at Zexi\u2019s sleek Shanghai office each morning at 8:45, and often stayed until 2 a.m. From his seat at the back of the firm\u2019s trading floor, he personally directed Zexi\u2019s investments, even as the firm\u2019s assets approached 30 billion renminbi. He remained intensely secretive. The firm\u2019s researchers did not know if he had heeded their stock recommendations until they saw their performance assessments at the end of each year. \u201cXu Xiang is always trading,\u201d a longtime friend said. \u201cIf he\u2019s not trading, he\u2019s thinking about trading.\u201dIn meetings, Xu was glued to two smartphones, one displaying market prices and the other pinging with news about economic developments. He preferred to let others speak, and when he did interject, his answers were brief and dismissive. One Western fund manager said he seemed as if he was \u201cbored of answering questions and would rather get back to trading.\u201d He dressed informally, sometimes in tracksuits.As he had in Ningbo, Xu regularly poured billions into big, risky bets that always seemed impeccably timed. He focused on buying stocks that were either small and relatively unknown or sinking toward bottom-dollar price, then pulled out as soon as he made a profit. The strategy was partly a reaction to the peculiarities of the Chinese market. Practices common among United States hedge funds, like short-selling stocks to protect against downturns in the market (in other words, hedging), are restricted in China, where regulators treat them with suspicion. Instead, fund managers rely almost exclusively on buying and selling stocks at just the right time.The results Xu achieved were unbelievable \u2014 perhaps literally. Between March 2010 and October 2015, Zexi\u2019s Fund No. 1 produced a return of more than 3,270 percent, even while the Shanghai Stock Exchange index grew by only 11.6 percent. Other Zexi funds grew at similarly startling rates. By 2015, Xu controlled at least 28 billion renminbi, the most of any Chinese hedge-fund manager. An adoring public, aspiring to his rags-to-riches tale, called him \u201cChina\u2019s Carl Icahn,\u201d \u201cXu the Legend\u201d and \u201cHedge Fund Brother No. 1.\u201dIn an elegant waterfront coffee house in Ningbo, I met a young stock trader who speculated about the web of political connections that had enriched and ultimately doomed Xu. \u201cXu was pushed onto the stage,\u201d the trader told me, as fashionable young women toting Gucci bags and wearing Cartier watches strode past us. \u201cThere are a lot of red capitalists in Shanghai, the children of leaders and important officials. They put a lot of money into his private fund to use as their personal bank account.\u201dBy the young trader\u2019s telling, Xu\u2019s entire operation was a cover for this simple scheme. \u201cXu had seven products,\u201d the trader told me. \u201cThe most successful are for the red capitalists. The others are rat funds\u201d \u2014 dummy products used to drive up stock prices and enrich Xu\u2019s clients.Nearly every one of the experts I spoke with repeated some version of the same rumor: that Xu was less a financial genius than a puppet of even larger powers. Most often, this explanation was deployed in response to a question that had been troubling observers of the Chinese financial world for months: Why hadn\u2019t Xu stopped earlier? Rumors of his illegal methods were an open secret, and he had already built the most successful hedge fund in China, reaping billions of dollars in personal wealth in the process. Why keep going and risk a reckoning?\u201cThat goes to the investor conspiracy,\u201d a former hedge fund researcher told me. \u201cThe people who give money to him to manage would not like to see the fund wound down.\u201d Whether Xu had begun as a willing partner or was coerced from the start was just further speculation. \u201cWhen you have someone very politically powerful and well connected coming to you who wants you to manage money for him or her,\u201d the researcher said, \u201cthen it\u2019s sort of difficult to say no, right?\u201dIf Xu was indeed tied to figures in the country\u2019s opaque political elite, his carefully protected anonymity was all the more crucial. In a nation where political and economic control are inseparable, and where the flashiest are often the first to fall, remaining unknown can serve as a survival technique. Even the true value of his assets remains a mystery. In 2015, the Hurun Rich List ranked Xu as the 188th-richest person in China, with a value of $2.2 billion. But that figure does not necessarily include all of Xu\u2019s earnings from privately managed funds, the money he controlled through family members or assets stashed outside Zexi. Xu\u2019s true wealth was unknown and unknowable.In late 2010, he began operating through a network of shell companies and affiliated investment funds with near-identical names, purchasing ownership stakes in companies. He took on the role of the activist investor, padding corporate boards with his associates, who would then implement investor-friendly policies \u2014 particularly dividend payouts.Between 2010 and 2014, Zexi invested in 45 companies that issued dividends \u2014 more companies than the average Chinese hedge fund had invested in altogether during that period. \u201cThat strategy was quite unique,\u201d the China-based Western fund manager told me. \u201cMaybe in part because there are only a few managers who can pull that off.\u201d But Xu had the leverage and the connections. A company\u2019s performance or fundamentals did not seem to concern him; if he could find a few winning stocks, he could use his tactics to ride them to huge profits. Zexi would use dividend payouts to purchase additional shares in the company, which it could then sell when prices rose, netting millions more in profits.To execute this scheme, Xu relied on a network of trusted proxies. Two of the most important were his parents. As executives at Zexi and controlling shareholders at several related companies, Xu\u2019s mother and father helped direct billions in investment in their son\u2019s name. They also ran many of the companies that made up Xu\u2019s secret empire. Through a Zexi-affiliated fund, Xu\u2019s father owned a large share of Ningbo Zhongbai, a department store company based in Xu\u2019s hometown. Other corporations, like an unprofitable apparel chain called Shanghai Metersbonwe Fashion & Accessories, were run by friends and allies.The stock rout last summer coincided with the apex of both Xu\u2019s success and his notoriety. The government\u2019s response to the crisis was swift and heavy-handed. Large shareholders were prohi\u00adbited from selling listed stocks; I.P.O.s were halted, and state-run institutions were ordered to maintain their positions or to buy shares. The government also mobilized a \u201cnational team\u201d of brokers and investors, backed by up to three trillion renminbi in state capital, to purchase shares and raise prices.But while the rest of the market was collapsing, Xu continued to thrive. From the beginning of 2015, one of Zexi\u2019s funds grew by 357 percent, ranking first among 1,649 funds in China. Another grew by 187 percent. All five publicly listed funds had growth of at least 20 percent during three weeks of the crash in mid-June.Xu benefited from seemingly miraculous luck and timing, according to The South China Morning Post. At least three of the stocks that Zexi held most heavily were purchased en masse by the \u201cnational team.\u201d More remarkable still, all the funds run by Xu seemed to exit the stock market at just the right moment, when it briefly re\u00adbounded during the late summer before plummeting again. By the end of the summer, the annual return on his funds was more than 200 percent.But as the market dried up, Xu became a target. In September, a social-media post implicating Zexi in corruption and insider trading went viral on the Chinese Internet. The post, written anony\u00admously, claimed that Zexi had conspired with Citic Securities, a powerful state-owned investment house, to direct buyers toward Shanghai Metersbonwe Fashion & Accessories, which saw its share prices surge during the worst of the market rout. Zexi denied that Xu had worked with Citic to manipulate the price of Metersbonwe, but the arrest of several Citic executives that fall only fueled more speculation.The same post provided a possible motive for the swindle. It began when a Shanghai princeling who held shares of Metersbonwe complained to Xu about the stock\u2019s low price during the summer rout. Xu called in a favor at Citic Securities, and in a matter of weeks the \u201cnational team\u201d purchased 15 percent of the company\u2019s total shares in circulation, sending prices soaring. The C.S.R.C. noticed the incident and began investigating. Almost immediately, the government placed restrictions on Xu\u2019s ability to travel outside the country.Nine days later, Xu was fleeing his grandmother\u2019s birthday party, trying to reach Shanghai. The timing was not coincidental. A special group organized by the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection was about to begin a top-to-bottom review of the activities and leadership of the C.S.R.C. Taking down Xu \u2014 especially in public, and with photographic evidence \u2014 was a display of force and competence from a government battered by a summer of bad economic news. \u201cIn China,\u201d one fund manager told me, \u201cthe compromising and bargaining is in the execution of the law, not the formulation. The government is using this case to show that from now on, they will enforce the law.\u201dXu himself seemed to sense the end coming. A year before his arrest, in November 2014, he moved to Beijing and opened an office less than half a mile from the headquarters of the C.S.R.C. According to colleagues, the move was the start of a yearlong effort by Xu to use his connections and money to avoid a reckoning. But despite his billions, Xu was an ordinary man from a poor family. By itself, Xu\u2019s market malfeasance might have been enough to spell his downfall; that he was said to be protected by some of the same corrupt officials targeted by the anticorruption push meant there was no escape.In the months since the crash, the Chinese government has instituted a sweeping crackdown on illegal practices in the financial markets. \u201cThere are many, many, many, many, many other managers in the market who could be apprehended for the same reasons,\u201d the Western fund manager told me. Xu proved an irresistible target not because of his own malfeasance, but because he offered a path to an even larger target \u2014 perhaps the clique of Shanghai princelings. \u201cIf you\u2019re going to knock somebody down, first you take out the whole row of people around them, the people who support them,\u201d the fund manager said. \u201cYou tighten the noose around them.\u201dFrom the beginning of 2015 through September of that year, 34 companies listed on the Chinese stock market reported officials as either missing or under investigation by the authorities, according to Bloomberg News. As of late November, Xinhua, the official Chinese news agency, had identified at least 16 major finance industry figures tied directly to the stock-market cleanup who were either arrested, under investigation or assisting the authorities. In early January, the chairman of Metersbonwe joined the list, disappearing without explanation for more than a week.\u201cThe level of corruption is beyond your imagi\u00adnation,\u201d a prominent Beijing-based hedge-fund manager told me over coffee several weeks after Xu\u2019s arrest. Like all my sources, this fund manager was extremely nervous about being interviewed. The irony of the crackdown was clear: Though a lack of transparency had clearly shattered the market, the Chinese government was responding with a crushing clampdown on information. The fund manager insisted that I could not use his name, for fear of being blacklisted or arrested. The ubiquity of wrongdoing, he said, did not make anyone safe. \u201cNo one knows who will be next. If they want to catch you, they will catch you.\u201dFor China\u2019s would-be tycoons, the stakes of the crackdown go far beyond the market. During my conversation with the Beijing-based fund manager, which took place in a cafe on a university campus, a young man wandered toward us, admiring a pair of paintings on a nearby wall. The manager went quiet, and shifted uncomfortably, watching the potential eavesdropper from the corner of his eye. When the young man had passed, the manager turned back to me. \u201cIn China,\u201d he said, \u201cthe losing side doesn\u2019t get to sleep at night.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "De Blasio\u2019s New York Feels Effects of Recovery to Relief of Business Leaders", "Date": "2016-03-07", "News": "Supported byWhen Bill de Blasio was running for mayor on a starkly liberal platform in 2013, some of New York\u2019s business leaders feared the city\u2019s economic well-being was doomed.\u201cThere was definitely something in the ether,\u201d said Alicia Glen, a deputy mayor whom Mr. de Blasio recruited from Wall Street. \u201c\u2018The lefties are taking over.\u2019 \u2018This is not a pro-business mayor.\u2019 \u2018They\u2019re going to ruin the economy.\u2019 I heard a lot of that myself.\u201dIt did not help that Mr. de Blasio was hoping to succeed Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, a self-made billionaire and a darling of business elites.Along with the steady increases in employment, the wages of workers in the city have risen at a fast pace over the last two years, helping them cope with the dizzying cost of living. Residential and office construction are booming. Tourism is at a high.Still, by virtually any measure, the city continues to do better than the rest of the country in rebounding from the financial crisis, economists said.\u201cFor the first time in this recovery, workers generally are enjoying the benefits of the recovery full-on,\u201d Mark Zandi, the chief economist of Moody\u2019s Analytics, said. \u201cIn the rest of the country we\u2019re not quite there yet.\u201dMr. de Blasio, a Democrat, inherited a city that had already begun recovering impressively under Mr. Bloomberg, a political independent whose businesslike approach to running New York was heralded as helping to rescue it from the depths of the recession.\u201cContrary to fears in the business community when the mayor first took office, the city economy has continued to do very well,\u201d Ms. Wylde said.Mr. de Blasio still scares corporate executives with some of his liberal ideas, Ms. Wylde added, like raising the minimum wage. \u201cBut that is a matter again of occasional differences on political rhetoric and, frankly, there\u2019s much less of that than many of them feared,\u201d she said.Before Mr. Bloomberg\u2019s three terms in office, from 2002 through 2013, business leaders did not typically expect mayors to become deeply involved in economic matters beyond tending to the city\u2019s budget, Ms. Wylde said.\u201cWhat we expect from mayors is they encourage private-sector economic activity and they don\u2019t screw it up,\u201d she said. Appraising Mr. de Blasio\u2019s performance so far, she said, \u201cIt\u2019s obvious he has not screwed it up.\u2019\u2019In fact, the city has a record number of jobs (4.2 million) and a record number of employed residents (four million), and attracted a record number of tourists last year (58.3 million). The share of the city\u2019s population that is employed is at its highest level \u2014 58 percent \u2013 in at least four decades.In the early years of the recovery, the bulk of the hiring was in lower-paying fields like retail and health care. But it has broadened to all sectors, including Wall Street, construction and even manufacturing.Wages, too, have begun to surge, and not just for white-collar workers at the upper end of the pay spectrum, said James Parrott, chief economist with the Fiscal Policy Institute, a union-backed research group. Mr. Parrott said that average wages for workers at all levels of pay had risen faster than inflation in the last two years, after being flat for the previous three years.\u201cThis last five or six years has been the most sustained period of job growth in the city,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019d have to go back to the \u201950s or early \u201960s to see anything like that.\u201dAnthony C. Roman Jr. is one of the newest beneficiaries of the city\u2019s growing prosperity. After months of searching for a job, he started on Friday in the marketing department of Bareburger, a fast-growing restaurant chain founded in Astoria, Queens.Armed with a degree in food studies from the New School, Mr. Roman, 25, said he had still found it difficult to land a job because of \u201can oversupply of highly educated people\u201d seeking work in his industry.\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of energy\u201d in the city\u2019s economy, but he said he would call it \u201cnot necessarily a boom, but a bloom.\u201dThough Mr. Roman and his fianc\u00e9e, who works in finance, now have jobs that pay well, he said they each planned to continue living with their parents until their wedding.\u201cWhen you look at the financial commitment of renting,\u201d he said, \u201cit\u2019s just a huge drain on any kind of hope or future that you have in the short term.\u201dSoaring commercial rents in the city have posed a problem for Bareburger, said Euripides Pelekanos, one of the company\u2019s founders. Bareburger is opening restaurants as far away as Tokyo and Dubai, in the United Arab Emirates, but Mr. Pelekanos said he gave up looking for a location in Harlem because landlords were asking too much.Mr. Pelekanos said he had no trouble finding students and actresses to hire as servers, but the intense competition among restaurants was making it hard to staff the kitchens. Another burger chain, he said, tried to poach Bareburger\u2019s hostesses and cooks.As for his sentiments about City Hall, Mr. Pelekanos said he opposed Mr. de Blasio\u2019s push for a minimum wage as high as $15 an hour.\u201cI don\u2019t think he fully understood the impact on local businesses, on small businesses,\u201d Mr. Pelekanos said, adding that such an increase would force restaurants to raise prices and reduce staffing.Helping to raise the wages of the city\u2019s lowest-paid residents is a priority for his administration, said Ms. Glen, who was an executive at Goldman Sachs before leaving for City Hall.The mayor may not have won over all of the doubters yet, Ms. Wylde said, but he had scored points with them by being \u201cvery fiscally responsible,\u201d referring to the mayor\u2019s budgeting process and the contracts his administration had reached with unions.Mr. de Blasio has also sought to diversify the economy and encourage job creation beyond Manhattan. Since Mr. de Blasio took office, employment has risen faster in the other boroughs as the city\u2019s unemployment rate has steadily declined, to 5.3 percent in January, from 8 percent in January 2014.The robust economy has helped people like Mulu Amlesom, a 36-year-old Bronx resident who bounced through a series of office jobs before returning to college to pursue a nursing degree. But after completing her studies, she said, she spent several months trying to find work at a hospital.She was ready to leave New York before she enrolled in a training program financed by the city\u2019s Small Business Services Department and a health care industry partnership. When Ms. Amlesom completed the training in late 2014, she was hired into a full-time position at Mount Sinai Beth Israel in Manhattan that pays more than $70,000 a year.Referring to the condominium she and her husband own in the High Bridge neighborhood, Ms. Amlesom said, \u201cNow we can actually pay the mortgage.\u201dAdvertisement"}

No. 1, it\u2019s obsolete. When NATO was formed many decades ago we were a different country. There was a different threat. Soviet Union was, the Soviet Union, not Russia, which was much bigger than Russia, as you know. And, it was certainly much more powerful than even today\u2019s Russia, although again you go back into the weaponry. But, but \u2013 I said, I think NATO is obsolete, and I think that \u2013 because I don\u2019t think \u2013 right now we don\u2019t have somebody looking at terror, and we should be looking at terror. And you may want to add and subtract from NATO in terms of countries. But we have to be looking at terror, because terror today is the big threat. Terror from all different parts. You know in the old days you\u2019d have uniforms and you\u2019d go to war and you\u2019d see who your enemy was, and today we have no idea who the enemy is.(Laughter.)Second interview begins:But during the period I\u2019ve been, I think very well versed on matters as we\u2019re discussing and many more than just what we\u2019re just discussing. Now as it gets \u2014 as we get you know closer to the end of the process it\u2018ll take place more and more. I\u2019m setting up a council, I\u2019m setting up \u2014 and I have other people coming in, I gave you the other few names I think that we added, we have a few more coming in.

And some of them are military. Look, the military is going to be very important because we have to do something with ISIS, David, and you know we do want the military. And I think that over the next few weeks I\u2019ll be able to give you some more names.

China has great power over North Korea even though they don\u2019t necessarily say that. Now, Iran, we had a great opportunity during this negotiation when we gave them the 150 billion and many other things. Iran is the No. 1 trading partner of North Korea. Now we could have put something in our agreement that they would have led the charge if we had people with substance and with brainpower and with some negotiating ability. But the No. 1 trading partner with North Korea is Iran. And we did a deal with them, and we just did a deal with them, and we don\u2019t even mention North Korea in the deal. That was a great opportunity to put another five pages in the deal, or less, and they do have a great influence over North Korea. Same thing with China, China has great influence over North Korea but they don\u2019t say they do because they\u2019re tweaking us. I have this from Chinese. I have many Chinese friends, I have people of vast wealth, some of the most important people in China have purchased apartments from me for tens of millions of dollars and frankly I know them very well. And I ask them about their relationship to North Korea, these are top people. And they say we have tremendous power over North Korea. I know they do. I think you know they do.Now whether or not the Palestinians can live with that? You would think they could. It shouldn\u2019t be hard except that the ingrained hatred is tremendous.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "What Donald Trump Gets Pretty Much Right, and Completely Wrong, About China", "Date": "2016-03-17", "News": "Supported byEconomic TrendsIf there is one thing Donald Trump seems sure about, it is that the United States is getting a raw deal from China.To people who spend time studying the United States\u2019 economic relationship with China, Mr. Trump\u2019s accounting of its dysfunctions contains both legitimate, accurate complaints and elements that completely misstate how things work between the world\u2019s largest and second-largest economies.\u201cThey\u2019re killing us,\u201d Mr. Trump has said in many debates, rallies and television appearances. He has threatened to put a 45 percent tax on Chinese imports \u201cif they don\u2019t behave.\u201dIf you take Mr. Trump\u2019s comments at face value, as president he would try to renegotiate a complex set of ties that has pulled hundreds of millions of Chinese out of dire poverty, made a wide range of goods available to American consumers at more affordable prices and contributed to the decline of American manufacturing.Here is a reality check on Mr. Trump\u2019s arguments. (It\u2019s also a way to understand the economic relationship between the countries.)\u201cWe have very unfair trade with China. We\u2019re going to have a trade deficit of $505 billion this year with China.\u201d \u2014 Mr. TrumpAmerica\u2019s trade deficit with China was $338 billion last year, and there\u2019s no reason to think it would swing by as much as Mr. Trump suggests in 2016 \u2014 but what\u2019s $167 billion among codependent trading partners? (Mr. Trump seems to be conflating the China number with the $505 billion total American trade deficit in 2014, which was first reported to be that much.)The central point, that the United States imports a lot more from China than it exports, is correct. To put it a bit differently, from 1999 to 2015 annual imports from China rose by $416 billion. In the same span, American exports to China rose by $145 billion.That said, many economists would argue that a trade balance shouldn\u2019t be viewed as a simple scorecard in which the country with the trade deficit is the loser and the one with the surplus the winner.So the question isn\u2019t whether there is a persistent, large trade deficit between the United States and China, but why. And that leads to another arm of Mr. Trump\u2019s argument, and one of the stronger ones.\u201cI have many friends, great manufacturers, they want to go into China. They can\u2019t. China won\u2019t let them.\u201d \u2014 Mr. TrumpIt\u2019s not that American multinational companies \u2014 heavy industry, technology or finance \u2014 can\u2019t do business in China. Rather, their executives complain of Chinese government restrictions that they see as arbitrary, unpredictable and highly favorable to domestic companies \u2014 so much so that in practice they are either shut out or can\u2019t make money in China.Doing business in China typically requires a partnership with a Chinese company, and that often means sharing crucial intellectual property that can enable the partner to become a competitor down the road. The rules of engagement can change capriciously, especially for American and European companies, rendering major investments worthless.This may reflect a faltering Chinese economy that is leading the government there to be more concerned than usual about protecting domestic companies.\u201cThey are the single greatest currency manipulator that\u2019s ever been on this planet.\u201d \u2014 Mr. TrumpMr. Trump\u2019s complaint about China\u2019s devaluation of its currency has a long, bipartisan tradition. It is also out of date.It is true that China intervenes in currency markets to influence the price of its renminbi against the dollar. And it is true that a decade ago, both the American government and independent economists tended to think that the interventions served to depress the currency, in the Chinese government\u2019s deliberate effort to make its exports more price competitive.But a lot has changed in the last decade. The renminbi was allowed to rise sharply from roughly 2006 to 2015, and is up 23 percent from a decade ago.\u201cAt least in 2006, 2007 or 2008, the yuan was undervalued \u2014 now it\u2019s probably not,\u201d said Derek Scissors, a resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute and chief economist of China Beige Book, an information service.Indeed, the Chinese government has been trying to restrict capital from flowing out of the country to stop the renminbi from falling any further. It would seem that the Chinese government and Mr. Trump are, for the moment at least, on the same side.Mr. Trump\u2019s broader argument is that a generation of unfair economic relations with China (and also Mexico, Japan and others) is a primary cause of the troubles of American workers.Mainstream economists are more sympathetic to this view now than they were even a few years ago. Traditional trade theory holds that the losers from global trade \u2014 factory workers who lose their jobs when that factory moves overseas \u2014 are more than compensated by other opportunities created by a more efficient economy.That said, it\u2019s easy to assign too much of the blame for the collapse of manufacturing employment to China or trade more broadly. Hundreds of millions of workers across the globe \u2014 many of whom were in dire poverty a generation ago \u2014 have become integrated into the world economy. That\u2019s a lot of competition, all in a short span, for American factory workers.At the same time, factory technology has advanced so that a company can make more stuff with fewer workers. The number of manufacturing workers in the United States has been declining as a share of all jobs nearly continuously since 1943, and the total number of manufacturing jobs peaked in 1979; China\u2019s trade with the United States didn\u2019t really take off until the 1990s.In other words, trade has been an important economic force over the last few decades, and the deepening of the United States\u2019 ties with China is one of the most important developments in global economics of the last generation. But to look at China as the sole force affecting the ups and downs of American workers misses the mark.Advertisement"}

(More accurately, five volcanoes that erupted and overlapped with fiery magma flows.) Flying over to Hilo, on the eastern side of the island, provided gorgeous views of Mauna Kea, the tallest and most holy of the Hawaiian peaks, and Mauna Loa, the bigger, grouchier sibling.The poke in question was a half-pound of cool, bite-size tuna cubes ($7), which I doctored (with guidance from Mr. Kaholoaa) with shoyu, green onion, spicy mayonnaise, chopped garlic and furikake, a dry mixture of chopped seaweed, sesame seeds and seasonings. The result was amazing \u2014 imagine sushi, only more accessible and casual.I also loved the Spam musubi, another traditional snack that consists of a fat slab of salty Spam sandwiched between two warm rectangles of rice, all wrapped in seaweed. It was only a buck, and made for a great snack later in the car.The service was friendly and meandering; a big sign out front proclaims \u201cIf no can, no can; if can, Verna\u2019s!\u201d It\u2019s a twist on a phrase that sums up, in a lot of ways, the spirit of Hawaii: If something works out, great. If not, no need to worry. Verna\u2019s gravy cheeseburger, at $3.65, was something of a revelation. The meat was charred so that the outside of the patty almost had a crust. The gravy and American cheese melded together to create a single, super condiment. I had never had gravy on a burger before, but I can\u2019t wait to try it again.Ms. Masuda, like many Buddhists, rarely eats meat, but was not judgmental; her demeanor was an interesting mix of calm wisdom you might expect from one who meditates every morning at 5:30 during the week (as she does) and of a former wild child, a firebrand who had had periods of profligacy. She was, in a word, wonderful.\u201cI was in the Peace Corps, too!\u201d she told me one morning, over a simple breakfast of rambutans, oranges, granola and coffee (breakfast is included, and communal with other guests). Ms. Masuda, who looks to be in her late 60s, is petite, muscular and tan. She adjusted her do-rag. \u201cBut I got kicked out,\u201d she continued, flashing a smile somewhere between sly and winsome, \u201cfor shacking up with a volunteer.\u201dThe B&B is set up like a little compound: A couple of buildings hold guests, there\u2019s an office, a space for meals, and a different building used for meditation. There are outdoor cats \u2014 lots of them \u2014 that patrol the area. (Don\u2019t worry about allergies: I\u2019m fiercely allergic and had no problems.)There is a phone in the main house, as well as limited Wi-Fi, but they\u2019re not actively used. There was a slight dampness to everything \u2014 Hilo is one of the wettest cities in the Northern Hemisphere, and I had arrived just after a period of heavy rain. If you get something wet and hang it up, don\u2019t expect it to dry anytime soon.Part of staying at Akiko\u2019s is the spirit of ohana, which roughly means \u201cfamily.\u201d Ms. Masuda encourages you to get to know the surroundings, and to participate in activities she engages in. \u201cSo Lucas,\u201d she said one morning after breakfast, apropos of nothing, \u201care you coming to clean graveyards with us?\u201d I couldn\u2019t turn down an invitation like that.We met up with a larger group of volunteers and spent the afternoon cleaning up an old Japanese graveyard that had fallen into disrepair. Afterward, we made one more stop on Kukuihaele Road. We visited a private residence with some centuries-old graves, and also one of the most extraordinary things I had ever seen: a banyan tree that had swallowed an old church.I had a great view of the glowing volcano while being towed back to Hilo after I got two flat tires on my rental car in Kau. During the long, slow drive, the driver of the tow truck, Larry Carvalho, told me about his life and family. He was kind to me, told me not to worry about the car, and proceeded to take my mind off things with stories of pig hunts, his children and growing up in Mountain View. When he dropped me off, I tried to tip him. Repeatedly. He refused, repeatedly, and told me to take care. He was simply doing his job, to be sure.But that small kindness typified the aloha spirit and encapsulated my experience on the Big Island \u2014 an easy, casual compassion, welcoming of others, looking simply to live and let live.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Simmering for Decades, Anger About Trade Boils Over in \u201916 Election", "Date": "2016-03-29", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The United States is in the midst of one of the longest economic expansions in its history. Even American factories have lately added hundreds of thousands of jobs.Meanwhile, the rest of the world is stumbling. Even China.Yet at perhaps the least likely moment in the last several decades, misgivings about globalization are playing a starring role in the presidential election. Why now?It is a situation that has surprised many experts because polls show voters\u2019 concern about the overall health of the American economy has declined significantly in recent years.Yet many Americans are just taking stock of the transformations wrought by global trade. In two dozen conversations with voters across the country, only two said they had heard of the proposed new trade deal, the Trans-Pacific Partnership, involving the United States and a host of Pacific Rim nations.Instead, the concerns they expressed were about changes in their own lives and communities over the last couple of decades.\u201cWhen we first did that big trade agreement I thought it was a good idea, but now I\u2019m getting a little more conservative about it,\u201d said Phyllis Arthur, a 74-year-old Republican from Walnut Creek, Calif. \u201cI think we\u2019re being overwhelmed by the goods coming in. That\u2019s practically all that\u2019s available in the stores.\u201dKevin White, a 47-year-old Democrat from Dayton, Ohio, said it was hard to find a job. He used to work at a hospital; now he gets federal disability payments.\u201cThe jobs went overseas,\u201d lamented Mr. White. \u201cThen people couldn\u2019t afford their mortgages and we had a crash and nobody was able to buy anything.\u201dDouglas Irwin, an economist at Dartmouth College who studies trade, said the impact of China\u2019s economic rise had become more visible in recent years, even though the worst effects of its rise may already be in the past.Between 2000 and 2011, imports from China grew to equal 2.6 percent of American economic output, up from around 1 percent. That \u201cunprecedented shock\u201d was much larger than that from the increase in Japanese imports in the 1980s or Mexican imports in the 1990s, Mr. Irwin said. China\u2019s rise, fueled in part by currency manipulation to make its exports cheaper, played a key role in the loss of roughly five million American manufacturing jobs.Those losses, however, were offset and obscured during the housing boom by a rise in construction jobs. Now, both the factory jobs and the construction jobs have gone away.Rationally, said Mr. Irwin, \u201cIt\u2019s too late to get upset about China.\u201dThe United States is no longer losing factory jobs. It has added 600,000 over the last five years. Beijing is no longer suppressing its currency; it\u2019s now trying to prop up the value.Politically, however, it appears that the moment is perfectly ripe.Ahead of another Rust Belt primary next Tuesday in Wisconsin, Mr. Trump is pressing for \u201cfair trade\u201d with foreign countries, while Mr. Cruz has adopted similar language. \u201cWe\u2019re going to see millions and millions of new high paying jobs,\u201d Mr. Cruz told a crowd at an Oshkosh plastics factory on Monday, \u201ccoming back to America, coming back from China, coming back from Mexico.\u201dPersonalities also appear to be playing a role. Mr. Trump has proved an unusually effective spokesman for concerns among Republican voters. \u201cYou look at those empty factories all over the place, and nobody hits that message better than me,\u201d he said after winning the Republican primary in Michigan this month.Mr. Sanders has connected with a Democratic base whose support for President Obama may have damped longstanding concerns about trade.Mr. Trump and Mr. Sanders have also succeeded in focusing anger on trade as an explanation for broader economic problems afflicting many Americans. Trade flows make up a small part of America\u2019s economic activity. The primary explanations for the stagnation of middle-class incomes are necessarily domestic.\u201cThey are following in the footsteps of politicians of all stripes who have found it convenient to blame the boogeyman of unfair trade for domestic economic problems,\u201d said Eswar Prasad, a Cornell economist. \u201cTough talk on trade is an easy way to distract attention from taking on difficult domestic challenges.\u201dMainstream economists regard the evidence as unequivocal that trade has produced significant benefits for the American economy and the average household.Yet much of the American public has long been skeptical. A recent New York Times/CBS News poll found that 61 percent of respondents favored more trade restrictions to protect domestic industry, just as a majority of respondents has favored increased restrictions in every such poll since 1988.Charles Shank began to change his mind about foreign trade in the early 2000s as he carried the pieces of Pennsylvania factories south to the Mexican border to be reassembled there.Mr. Shank, then working as a truck driver, supported the expansion of trade with Mexico and Canada. A registered Republican, Mr. Shank said he subscribed to the party\u2019s position that trade deals would open new markets for American companies.But Mr. Shank, now retired, said the politicians made a mistake. He said he planned to vote in Pennsylvania\u2019s coming presidential primary for a candidate who would \u201cgo back and renegotiate\u201d better deals with the nation\u2019s trading partners.\u201cI think our trade deals were good ideas with good intentions, but I don\u2019t think it had enough controls to protect the United States,\u201d said Mr. Shank, 65. \u201cThe fact that the factories are leaving, there\u2019s something wrong with that whole system right there.\u201dAt the same time, Mr. Shank has personally benefited from globalization. He spent years driving imported goods to market. Trade reduced the price of his television and his clothing and increased the variety of food available at the local grocery store.Like many Americans, Mr. Shank said he would still rather pay more for American goods. A recent Bloomberg poll conducted by Selzer & Company found just 13 percent of respondents said they wanted goods at the lowest price, while 82 percent of respondents said they wanted goods made in America.But do they?Mr. Shank said he has always driven Dodge trucks.He paused.\u201cActually,\u201d he said, \u201cthis year, I bought a Mazda.\u201dEconomists and politicians understated the costs of globalization, which tend to be more concentrated than the benefits. Everyone gets a discount; some people lose their jobs. Moreover, the United States has lagged significantly behind other developed countries in providing support for those left behind.Linda Young lost a good job in 1998 when Munekata America, which made plastic cases for televisions and other electronics, closed its factory in Dalton, Ga., because most of the companies it served had moved to Mexico. Ms. Young worked until the factory\u2019s final day, packing equipment so it, too, could be shipped to Mexico.Ms. Young, 62, ran a restaurant for a few years. She now cares for her grandchildren.Her children have navigated globalization with greater success. Her son works for an electric motor company that once served the carpet factories that dominated Dalton but now focuses on construction equipment. Her son-in-law lost his job at one of those carpet plants last year, after 26 years, but, a few months later, he found work at the new Volkswagen plant in nearby Chattanooga, Tenn.Ms. Young said she knew globalization had improved the lives of millions around the world. But she was thinking about Dalton\u2019s decline when she decided to vote for Mr. Trump in Georgia\u2019s Republican primary.\u201cI don\u2019t see their future being better than mine,\u201d Ms. Young said of her grandchildren. \u201cI understand we have to help others, but I think we should be a little more astute about helping ourselves.\u201dGiovanni Russonello contributed research.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "New Proposal to Divide Jerusalem Unites People Against It", "Date": "2016-03-06", "News": "Supported byJERUSALEM \u2014 A new plan on how to divide Jerusalem\u2019s Jewish and Arab neighborhoods has had the peculiar distinction of uniting people against it.Instead, it has been rejected at both ends of the political spectrum, as well as by Palestinian leaders.The new campaign describes Jerusalem\u2019s Palestinian residents as imperiling the security, demographic balance, standard of living and economy of the city. It argues that a majority of people 18 and under in the city are Palestinian and plays on fears raised by the recent surge of Palestinian attacks against Israeli Jews.Ir Amim, a leftist group that advocates a status for Jerusalem as a dual capital of Israel and of a future Palestine, said the proposal was \u201cdetached from any understanding of the fabric of daily life in Jerusalem.\u201d Without agreement from the Palestinian leadership, the group added, such a move would \u201clead to political, urban and humanitarian chaos.\u201dMoshe Arens, a former minister from the conservative Likud Party, wrote in a recent column that any such split \u201chas become essentially impossible\u201d and that stripping East Jerusalem Arabs of their Israeli residency permits \u201cwould be legally questionable and morally reprehensible.\u201d Saeb Erekat, the secretary general of the Palestine Liberation Organization, called the proposal \u201cracist.\u201d\u201cThousands of Jerusalemites will be separated from their schools, hospitals, religious sites and also their properties,\u201d he said. \u201cThis plan clearly shows that even members of the so-called progressive Israeli camp are falling into the same policies of the Israeli right.\u201dDividing Jerusalem, with sacred Jewish, Muslim and Christian sites at its core, has long been one of the most emotional and intractable issues of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.Israel conquered Jerusalem\u2019s Old City and its environs, along with the West Bank, from Jordan in the 1967 war. Then it expanded the city limits, taking in 28 West Bank villages on the high ground surrounding the city, and annexed the territory in a move that was never internationally recognized. Ever since, its leaders have claimed sovereignty over what they deem Israel\u2019s \u201cunited capital.\u201dBut the Palestinians demand East Jerusalem as the capital of their future independent state. They and much of the world see the developments that Israel has built in the annexed area since 1967, now home to some 200,000 Jews, as illegal settlements. These would remain within Israeli Jerusalem under the plan.The vast majority of the city\u2019s 300,000 Arab residents \u2014 about a third of Jerusalem\u2019s population \u2014 chose not to apply for Israeli citizenship, but hold permanent residency status that entitles them to social benefits and to work and move freely throughout Israel.International road maps for peace have long imagined Palestinian control of Jerusalem\u2019s Arab areas and Israeli control of Jewish ones, with a special arrangement for the Old City and its surroundings. But this latest plan \u2014 which would remove about two-thirds of Jerusalem\u2019s Arab residents by disconnecting populous outer neighborhoods like Beit Hanina, Sur Baher and Issawiya from the city \u2014 comes in the absence of peace talks and amid months of rising violence.\u201cWe have to open a public debate and a parliamentary debate: What is it we want to keep?\u201d said Shaul Arieli, a map specialist who took part in past peace talks and helped formulate the plan. Advancing a unilateral plan for Jerusalem as an interim measure, in the absence of talks for a permanent deal, he said, \u201cshows the Israelis that nothing is holy.\u201dMr. Arieli, a reserve colonel in the Israeli Army who participated in the 2000 Camp David negotiations, is among more than 30 Israeli public figures \u2014 veterans of the political, diplomatic and security establishments \u2014 who signed the campaign ads.Haim Ramon, a former minister from Labor and the centrist Kadima Party who is the architect of the new plan, said that if the Arab residents ended their boycott of city elections, the next mayor of Jerusalem would not be Jewish. \u201cIf the Palestinians were clever, they would decide, instead of the knife, to use the vote,\u201d he told reporters. \u201cYou cannot have a strategy that your enemy will be stupid forever.\u201dThe long impasse in the Israeli-Palestinian peace process has given impetus to various Israeli proposals for unilateralism, usually involving withdrawal from part of the West Bank.The geography of the issues surrounding the ongoing violence.Such plans, calling for Israel to control its own destiny by defining its borders, aim to satisfy a majority of Israeli Jews, who want some kind of partition but do not believe that a full peace deal is attainable at present. They imagine that removing some settlements and reducing the amount of West Bank territory under occupation could take some international pressure off Israel. But Mr. Ramon\u2019s idea of shedding parts of East Jerusalem is causing confusion, even among supporters of other unilateral initiatives meant to hasten the two-state solution.\u201cDemographically, it\u2019s a compelling argument,\u201d said Michael Oren, a center-right member of Parliament who has proposed his own interim measures involving withdrawal from some settlements. \u201cIsrael has a strategic interest in maintaining a Jewish majority in the capital of the Jewish state.\u201dBut, Mr. Oren added, \u201ckeep in mind that redefining who is a Jerusalemite is not the only way of addressing that.\u201d Instead, he suggested, a government push to create jobs and lower municipal taxes could encourage more Israeli Jews to move to Jerusalem.The Palestinian residents of East Jerusalem generally have a higher standard of living than those in the West Bank or Gaza Strip. But about three-quarters of Arab families in Jerusalem are below Israel\u2019s poverty line, compared with about 21 percent of the city\u2019s Jewish families.For the Israeli right, Jerusalem has long posed a conundrum, pitting security and demographic concerns against ideology.Mr. Netanyahu and Nir Barkat, Jerusalem\u2019s mayor, argue that Israeli sovereignty guarantees the Arab residents a quality of life superior to that of Israel\u2019s Arab neighbors. Naftali Bennett, the right-wing education minister, has declared the next school year \u201cthe year of united Jerusalem\u201d to mark the 50th anniversary of the reunification of the city in 1967.Part of Mr. Bennett\u2019s plan is to increase school trips to Jerusalem from across the country. Proponents of the \u201cSaving Jewish Jerusalem\u201d campaign noted wryly that the schoolchildren were unlikely to be taken to Sur Baher or Issawiya, where few Israeli Jews dare venture these days. As Mr. Ramon put it, \u201cNobody would think to go to these places.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Hold your nose, if you have to. The only thing standing between a thuggish narcissist and the White House is the almost-certain Democratic nominee \u2014 Hillary Clinton.Not-quite-as-Super Tuesday was an unqualified triumph for Clinton, who outperformed polls and expectations across much of the map. Whatever momentum Bernie Sanders had after the upset in Michigan dissipated Tuesday night. Madame secretary cleaned his clock where she had to.It was the last chance for Sanders to show that he had a path to the nomination. The math now makes it nearly impossible for him to get the bid, even with a favorable string of states ahead.Particularly in Florida \u2014 with a Democratic Party of New America demographics \u2014 Clinton showed once again that her appeal is far broader than Sanders\u2019s. To catch Clinton, Sanders needed to get beyond his core of young, college-educated whites. If he\u2019d won Ohio and Illinois, where he was competitive, he\u2019d have some wind at his back. He\u2019s a statement candidate now \u2014 a strong one, full of integrity.But that doesn\u2019t mean the 74-year-old socialist-lite should get out. He\u2019s done a real service, for the party he only recently joined, and for the country. Clinton is a far better candidate because of him. More than that, the Democratic Party is paying attention to the angry millions in the margins, those who may be tempted by the demagogue who wants to make America white again. Thank Sanders for that.And because of Sanders, millennial voters who flocked to Barack Obama but have a meh feeling about another Clinton are back in the arena. This generation will determine who is the next president. They\u2019ve been whacked by student loans, a humiliating recession, the hangover of a disastrous war. They\u2019re trying to find their way in an economy that is more unequal now than at any time since the 1920s. Sanders has organized them, thrilled them with ideas once considered radical, and done it all without personally insulting his rival.Because of Sanders, the word \u201csocialist\u201d is no longer toxic in the United States. I have many problems with socialism, not the least of which is that it\u2019s generally been a failure wherever it\u2019s been broadly applied. But capitalism has its cruel excesses, its many failures as well. Why has the average low-wage worker been left behind in this nation of hypercapitalism?One reason is those \u201cdisastrous trade deals,\u201d as Sanders calls them. And because of him, Clinton has now hedged her support for the latest of these trade agreements, the Trans-Pacific Partnership, one that she helped negotiate. The next president has to listen less to the corporations that drive these deals, and more to the people who are their victims.On health care, on banks, on the influence of Wall Street, Sanders has pulled Clinton to the left. By raising more than $135 million from 1.5 million individual donors, Sanders has shown he can match big money. His ideas will shape every part of the party platform, which will give Clinton what she lacks: a clear message. Eventually, he\u2019ll endorse the woman he influenced, and Democrats will be the better for it.Advertisement"}

The Federal Police temporarily detained Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva, the former president, for questioning earlier this month in connection with a huge \u2014 and expanding \u2014 graft investigation. President Dilma Rousseff, Mr. da Silva\u2019s handpicked successor, could be next.The corruption scheme under investigation unfurled from 2003 to 2010, during Mr. da Silva\u2019s two terms in office. Prosecutors allege that during that time Brazil\u2019s biggest construction firms; the state-controlled oil giant, Petrobras; and the country\u2019s political leaders traded bribes, padded contracts and political support in a vast, mutually beneficial scheme.So far, Ms. Rousseff has remained on the sidelines, but she is the one to watch. Over the past several weeks, the inquiry has gotten dangerously close to the president. She has let it run without interference. The danger is that now, with the investigation tugging at the bases of Brazil\u2019s power structures, she will be tempted to step in.Ms. Rousseff has reasons to worry. As Mr. da Silva\u2019s appointee, she was chairwoman of the board of directors at Petrobras, the center of this web of corruption. Key figures in her inner circle are toppling and could take her down with them.Corruption has been endemic in Brazilian politics for decades. An investigation as serious and far-reaching as this one is new for the country. For that reason, it is also inspiring.Because this investigation has remained independent and unafraid to go after the country\u2019s most powerful politicians, it has emerged not as a tool for coup-mongers, as some have charged, but as evidence of the country\u2019s maturing democracy. Despite the headlines and the scandals, Brazil is now a place where the law applies to all, equally. Ms. Rousseff should recognize that this is worth preserving \u2014 even if it costs her the presidency.Juliana Barbassa is the author of \u201cDancing With the Devil in the City of God: Rio de Janeiro on the Brink.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Mr. Sanders expanded on his critique in an interview Wednesday.\u201cHillary Clinton has supported virtually every one of these trade agreements,\u201d Mr. Sanders said in the interview, conducted Wednesday at a hotel in Miami. \u201cOur message is resonating increasingly with the American people and especially working people and young people who understand \u2014 and we saw this in Michigan yesterday.\u201dKristina Schake, a spokeswoman for Mrs. Clinton, told MSNBC that the Sanders campaign had \u201creally mischaracterized\u201d her record on trade \u201cin the lead-up to Michigan, and she is ready to get in there and set the record straight.\u201dThe Clinton campaign says that going forward, it will continue to run its own advertisements highlighting how Mrs. Clinton has called out specific bad corporate actors by name, an effort to combat Mr. Sanders\u2019s line of attack. Trade deals alone could be more difficult to disavow.\u201cNafta was her husband\u2019s achievement, and it is hard to claim implied credit for his economic successes and claim opposition to one of the cornerstones of his policy,\u201d said David Axelrod, the former senior strategist for Mr. Obama. \u201cShe can claim the TPP was an Obama initiative, but walking away from him too overtly runs counter to her strategy.\u201dOr, as Mr. Obama put it during their 2008 primary battle, \u201cThe fact is, she was saying great things about Nafta until she was running for president.\u201dAnd the new headwinds she faces in Midwestern states could have implications beyond the nominating contests. A primary loss in Michigan and potentially Ohio, where polls show Mrs. Clinton leading and where Mr. Trump has drawn widespread support among the white working class, could be a troubling sign in a general election, Democratic strategists say.Mr. Sanders\u2019s victory in Michigan is sure to energize his donors and ensure that he can remain in the race and continue to challenge Mrs. Clinton on her ties to Wall Street and trade \u2014 even as he lags in the delegate count.In the early contests, Mrs. Clinton did not have to contend as directly with her record on global trade deals, but when the race reached the Midwest, the issue became acute, with her past positioning coming back to haunt her. In a 2012 speech in Australia, Mrs. Clinton said the Trans-Pacific Partnership deal \u201csets the gold standard in trade agreements,\u201d but in October said she could not support the deal.And for years, she has called to renegotiate Nafta to make it more favorable to workers in the United States. Former aides to Mr. Clinton said she opposed the pact in 1993, but could not speak out against it as first lady.According to the Associated Press, Donald J. Trump and Hillary Clinton have each won enough delegates to claim their party\u2019s nomination for president.\u201cI won\u2019t support any agreement unless it helps create good jobs and higher wages for American workers,\u201d Mrs. Clinton said Friday.She also refused to adopt the crisper messaging of Mr. Sanders or Mr. Trump. \u201cThere are people in both parties who think we can somehow shut ourselves off from the world,\u201d she said. \u201cEven if the United States never signs another trade deal, globalization isn\u2019t going away.\u201dThat type of balance will probably not appease non-college-educated voters, who have seen their job prospects drastically diminish and their wages stagnate.\u201cSanders had an opening because Hillary Clinton has been very responsible in how she raised questions about Nafta and TPP,\u201d said Matt Bennett, a former Clinton administration aide and a senior vice president at the centrist Third Way think tank. \u201cWhen you are responsible and battling an anecdote-driven campaign, you\u2019re going to lose that battle.\u201dUnderscoring the potency of the trade issue in Michigan, almost three-fifths of voters there said that trade with other countries was more likely to take away jobs, and those voters favored Mr. Sanders by a margin of more than 10 percentage points, according to exit polls by Edison Research.And the Sanders campaign sees similar openings in other battleground states.\u201cTrade will be front and center in Ohio, Illinois and elsewhere, and we will be expanding on the arguments against free trade deals that we made in Michigan,\u201d said Tad Devine, a senior adviser to Mr. Sanders. \u201cWe\u2019ll be making the explicit connection between trade and being beholden to special interests that want trade deals. Bernie\u2019s argument is that the people who are rigging the economy are also rigging the trade deals.\u201dMr. Mook acknowledged that the campaign needed to better communicate Mrs. Clinton\u2019s plan to bring jobs back to the United States and to create new ones in clean energy, infrastructure and other areas.\u201cShe is the only candidate who has rolled out a specific plan to create more good-paying manufacturing jobs,\u201d Mr. Mook said. \u201cSo we are aligning this campaign to amplify that message as loudly and as clearly as we can nationally and in those states.\u201dYamiche Alcindor contributed reporting from Miami, and Patrick Healy from New York.Advertisement"}

He also hoped that it would increase employee morale and help tamp down the turnover among the company\u2019s truck drivers and nighttime \u201cselectors,\u201d men who wear insulated suits to protect against the cold working conditions and spend hours on their feet lifting boxes to put together orders.\u201cI\u2019d like us to have an environment here where people like to come to work,\u201d Mr. Romanoff said. \u201cHow are you going to sugarcoat working in a freezer at night?\u201dIf approved by state lawmakers, Mr. Cuomo\u2019s proposal to increase the statewide minimum wage to $15, from $9, could benefit an estimated 2.3 million workers, according to state data. The figure is more than double the federal minimum wage of $7.25 an hour. Mr. Cuomo, a Democrat, has made it a centerpiece of his agenda and has been touring the state promoting the plan, which would make New York and California the only states in the country poised to make a $15-an-hour minimum wage mandatory.\u201cRaising the minimum wage empowers workers with a fair salary, helps them support their families with dignity, and grows the economy for all,\u201d Mr. Cuomo said in a statement. \u201cThe staff at Nebraskaland joins fast-food workers as well as state and SUNY employees who experience the transformative impact of a living wage, and I commend the company for leading by example.\u201dSupporters of the increase, including leaders in the Democratically controlled Assembly and labor unions, say that it would benefit workers and local economies. Opponents, including many in the Republican-controlled Senate, counter that it would harm many businesses, particularly in struggling communities in upstate New York, and could force them to lay off workers, reduce hours and benefits, raise the prices of their goods and services, and even relocate to another state, or close altogether.She said many employers around the state already paid their employees significantly more than the minimum wage, because market forces dictated higher compensation.Ms. Briccetti, citing economic studies, said that raising the minimum wage could result in more than 200,000 lost jobs statewide. Instead of an across-the-board wage increase, her group has called on state leaders to focus their efforts on developing a trained work force for fields that involve science, technology, engineering and math, where the demand for better-paying jobs is strong.In response to such criticisms, the governor\u2019s aides counter that almost every time the state has raised the minimum wage in recent years, there has been a net gain in jobs. For instance, they said, when the minimum wage was raised to $8.75 from $8 an hour in December 2014, there was an overall gain of 115,900 private sector jobs in the state from December 2014 to December 2015.The debate over a $15 minimum wage has reached Nebraskaland, where workers have argued for and against it on their lunch breaks. When the company announced that it was introducing the higher wage floor, many new employees were elated, but many veterans were not.\u201cI was a little bit upset because I think they should have worked a little bit more time like I did,\u201d said Luis Quiles, 40, who started at $10 an hour as a forklift driver in 2001. Today, he earns $19 an hour, as a shipping receiver. He added, \u201cI opened the doors for them.\u201dStill, Mr. Quiles, who has two teenage sons, said he had come to support the $15 minimum wage for both his company and the rest of the state because it would give his sons a better start than he had. \u201cIf it benefits them, it benefits me, because they\u2019re going to be helping me with the bills,\u201d he said.Mr. Romanoff said that because of resistance from some employees, the company had decided to phase in the wage increase. Workers who already earned $15 an hour or more received their regular annual raises, but did not receive any additional bonuses.Mr. Romanoff, who got his start dealing in oxtails, beef livers, cow\u2019s feet and other cheap meat parts that no one else wanted, rings up more than $450 million a year, in sales to supermarkets, stores and wholesale companies in eight states. The company is based in a 100,000-square-foot warehouse in Hunts Point, where animal heads are mounted on the walls and nearly every aspect of the operation has been computerized to improve efficiency while moving an average of two million pounds of meat a day.Since new workers have to be trained to use the technology, retention of employees is important; the company loses time and money when they leave, Mr. Romanoff said. He has taken other steps to show his employees that they are appreciated, he said, including providing generous health and retirement benefits, annual raises, clean bathrooms, and free turkeys and pork shoulders at Christmas.The wage increase, at least so far, has not had a measurable impact on retention for the company\u2019s hardest-to-fill jobs. In the first quarter of this year, 35 people, including 16 night selectors and 11 drivers, left the company, up from 27 during the same period last year.Alissa Marcus, Nebraskaland\u2019s human resources manager, attributed the higher turnover, in part, to more people being fired for safety violations and other infractions.In addition, she said, the wage increase has helped attract more potential employees, some of whom earned $2 to $3 less per hour doing the same job elsewhere. Last year, she had so few applicants for night selectors that she had to recruit at job fairs and hand out fliers in the community. This year, she has 48 applicants for six open positions.Mr. Romanoff said he had no regrets about raising the minimum wage at his company, but stopped short of saying there should be an increase statewide.\u201cFor me it\u2019s good, but I\u2019m in no position to judge other companies,\u201d he said. \u201cI know people who are happy to have a job for $10 an hour.\u201dAdvertisement"}

As required by law, the government is conducting a review soon to better reflect consumer and market realities. This is especially important since the writers suggested that consumers would save $8,000, but that projection is based on gas prices being nearly double what they are today.Automakers support a strong fuel economy program in which government targets align with affordable technology and market realities.

Auto manufacturers are outperforming the 2014 standards by 1.4 miles per gallon. In all vehicle categories, from subcompacts to pickup trucks, there are cleaner choices for consumers, and plenty of them. In 2014, while overall fuel economy remained at a record 24.3 miles per gallon, the standards boosted truck m.p.g. to a record 20.4.We are seeing fuel-efficient technologies enter the market at a more rapid pace than anyone anticipated.

{"Headline": "Low Gas Prices Create a Detour on the Road to Greater Fuel Economy", "Date": "2016-03-22", "News": "Supported byDETROIT \u2014 Since agreeing to tough new federal fuel economy standards five years ago, automakers have been methodically improving the gas mileage of their vehicles and reducing emissions harmful to the environment.But despite investing billions in fuel-saving technologies and introducing a raft of lower-mileage models and electric cars, the industry will be hard-pressed to meet its target of 54.5 miles per gallon in 2025.Now, with a crucial midterm review of federal fuel-economy rules to begin this summer, automakers are expected to seek adjustments to the government\u2019s formula for increasing mileage and cutting greenhouse gas emissions.Proposed changes could include extending the time frame on mileage targets and expanding emissions credits to include enhancements for safety and autonomous driving \u2014 such as the move that carmakers announced last week to make automatic braking standard on all models by early next decade.\u201cWe think the government needs to start thinking outside of the box and not just look at the traditional ways of reducing greenhouse gases,\u201d said Gloria Bergquist, a spokeswoman for the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers in Washington.An industry effort to relax the mileage goals could set off conflict with the Obama administration, whose pledge to reduce emissions, as part of last year\u2019s Paris climate accord, includes making big gains in vehicle fuel efficiency.For now, government officials and auto executives are taking a cooperative stance and extolling the gains in fuel economy in recent years rather than questioning the industry\u2019s ability to reach much higher standards down the road.\u201cIt\u2019s clear that our standards are working,\u201d said Christopher Grundler, director of the agency\u2019s Office of Transportation and Air Quality.The 24.3 figure is based on real-world driving performance, and it is lower than the mileage numbers used to calculate the government\u2019s Corporate Average Fuel Economy. For CAFE purposes, the average for 2014 was about 31 miles per gallon.Individual carmakers have also been able to increase their CAFE scores by using a complex menu of emissions credits issued by the government for technical innovations like low-energy headlights and advanced air-conditioning systems.Over all, most major automakers are on track to achieve CAFE\u2019s unadjusted midterm target of 37 miles per gallon next year. Some of them, like Fiat Chrysler Automobiles, are on pace only because they have bought emissions credits from other companies.But improving fuel economy significantly across vehicle fleets is becoming more challenging and expensive.\u201cNow they are complying, but they are worried that in the future, the climb gets much steeper,\u201d Ms. Bergquist said.Cheap gas prices are prompting more consumers to buy trucks and sport utility vehicles instead of small cars, hybrids or pure electric vehicles.With gas prices hovering around $2 a gallon, sales of low-mileage pickups and S.U.V.s have skyrocketed. Meanwhile, electric and hybrid models are languishing in dealer showrooms.A study of monthly vehicle sales by the University of Michigan shows that fuel efficiency gains have stalled since gas prices plunged last year.The peak efficiency was recorded in August 2014, when the average fuel economy of new vehicles sold was 25.8 miles per gallon in real-world driving. But the figure has steadily declined since then. In the first two months of this year, the average was 25.2 miles per gallon.\u201cEven though both passenger cars and trucks are getting better mileage year by year, consumers are overwhelmingly choosing to buy some of the lowest-mileage models like pickups and S.U.V.s,\u201d said Michael Sivak, who compiles the study with his associate, Brandon Schoettle, for the university\u2019s Transportation Research Institute.Individual automakers have complex formulas, based on their product lineups, for compliance with CAFE standards. Pickup trucks and large S.U.V.s, for example, have lower mileage requirements than passenger cars.\u201cOne of the areas that needs to be addressed is consumer demand,\u201d Ms. Bergquist said. \u201cAutomakers can build models that are extremely fuel-efficient, but they can\u2019t control sales.\u201dTalks have already begun with the government in advance of the E.P.A.\u2019s opening the midterm review in June, she said.Automakers have not formally asked for changes in CAFE goals yet. But they are building a case, through academic papers and studies, that the 2025 standard was agreed to when gasoline cost close to $4 a gallon and consumers were more likely to consider fuel-efficient models when they shopped for a new vehicle.With the mileage targets rising each year, automakers are adding more electric and hybrid models to offset the increasing sales of lower-mileage trucks and S.U.V.s. Yet the lowest-emission models are among the least popular.Environmental activists contend that automakers do not need big sales of electric cars to meet CAFE goals and can consistently improve fuel economy by adding current technology \u2014 like stop-start systems, which cut engine power when a car is idling \u2014 in all of their vehicles.\u201cAuto companies are producing more trucks and fewer cars,\u201d said Daniel Becker, director of the advocacy group Safe Climate Campaign. \u201cBut they are failing to use their best technology, like turbocharging and stop-start, throughout their fleets.\u201dInstead, companies are relying on emissions credits to balance their surging sales of lower-mileage trucks and S.U.V.s. \u201cThese loopholes are questionable and need to be tightened,\u201d he said.Most automakers are in compliance with current fuel standards and have been steadily improving the mileage of most vehicles in their lineups with lighter materials, more aerodynamic designs and smaller engines.Yet hybrid versions of midsize sedans sell poorly compared to gasoline-powered models, and consumers are more often choosing larger engine options in pickups because of cheaper gas.This week, an array of new electric and hybrid vehicles will be on display at the annual New York International Auto Show. The success of models like the electric Chevrolet Bolt from General Motors and Fiat Chrysler\u2019s hybrid minivan are crucial for the type of mileage improvements needed to meet future federal standards.\u201cFuel efficiency increases are like losing weight,\u201d said Karl Brauer, an analyst with the research firm Kelley Blue Book. \u201cThe first five or 10 pounds are the easiest, and after that it gets a lot harder.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "San Francisco, \u2018the Silicon Valley of Recycling\u2019", "Date": "2016-03-25", "News": "Supported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Robert Reed, who is enjoying a surprising career turn as a busy tour guide at the latest hot spot here, stood smiling one recent sunny morning before 10 foreign dignitaries and journalists. They included the mayor of Genoa, Italy, and the general consuls from Italy, Canada and Switzerland.Each visitor wore a sport coat and tie, and a yellow safety vest to ensure they wouldn\u2019t be run down by garbage trucks.\u201cIt\u2019s always nice to meet new friends from around the world,\u201d Mr. Reed said in his introduction, beaming. \u201cIn fact, we\u2019ve had visitors from 58 countries.\u201d Behind him stood a warehouse filled with a 630-ton mountain of refuse being pecked by sea gulls. \u201cCome on,\u201d Mr. Reed continued, \u201cI\u2019ll show you the bottles, cans and paper.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s like a modern art installation,\u201d marveled Mauro Battocchi, the Italian consul general here. \u201cSo fabulous \u2014 the people and machines and objects of our lives all working together.\u201dForeign officials and others come here to pick up tips on how to handle their own mushrooming piles of garbage back home. As the world\u2019s population grows, people are consuming more, creating more trash, and countries are looking for ways to deal with it that put less stress on the environment.More broadly, skeptics contend that the energy and other resource costs required to recycle some items are not worth the investment. But the visitors to Recology tend to be among the converted, who believe that incineration and landfilling carry their own devastating, long-term ecological costs.Recology, a private company, gets most of its operating budget from the monthly fee of $35.18 it charges each household for residential trash, recycling and compost.Mr. Reed says the Recology operation is cost effective, at least by one measure: San Franciscans pay the same amount or less than residents of other Bay Area big cities do for curbside pickup, but they compost or recycle a greater percentage of their garbage.San Francisco has become a recycling model for some cities, including Paris. The city\u2019s deputy mayor, Mao Peninou, visited in October 2014 and said Recology\u2019s composting now serves as a proof-of-concept for new Parisian efforts along the same lines.Recology continues to draw visitors even though it is \u201cnot state of the art,\u201d said Jack Macy, the Zero Waste coordinator for San Francisco. He acknowledged that other places have pulled ahead with newer technology, and noted that San Francisco itself originally drew inspiration from Germany, which was recycling and beginning to compost in the 1980s.San Francisco also has a world-class reputation for its composting processes, which turns food waste into fine, coffee-like grounds that is sent to farms as fertilizer.The Recology tour starts at Pier 96, an industrial hub at the city\u2019s southern edge, inside the doors of a cavernous, 200,000-square-foot warehouse.The first step is the separation of all recyclable garbage, with tractors scooping up piles and pouring them onto five conveyor belts. It travels up to the first culling level, where human \u201cclassifiers\u201d wearing masks, gloves and aprons pull out the biggest pieces of cardboard and drop them down chutes where they are baled.A few feet later, everything else bustles up a fast-moving moving ladder that carries the lighter paper to the top, while heavier cans and bottles fall back down. The bottles and cans are then divided.Farther along, an optical sorter uses a beam of light to determine which plastic bottles are clear and which ones are colored. The clear ones are flipped off the belt by puffs of air.\u201cIt\u2019s Willy Wonka\u2019s everything-you-can-imagine recycling place,\u201d Mr. Reed said during the recent tour. The former freelance reporter for The San Francisco Chronicle loves talking about recycling and composting so much that it is as enjoyable \u201cas a woman asking if she can give me a back rub.\u201d he says.Mr. Reed likes to explain that Recology is a private, employee-owned company that has created around 210 jobs, most of them drawn from Bayview-Hunters Point, one of the city\u2019s poorest neighborhoods, where the plant is.\u201cIt\u2019s the Silicon Valley of recycling,\u201d said Christian Forthomme, chief executive of RealChange, a Bay Area-based consulting firm that brings foreign executives and officials to visit Silicon Valley, including four delegations to Recology in the past six years.One group included Bruno Hug de Larauze, president of the Chamber of Commerce in Brittany, France, who likens Recology to an Uber or Airbnb for waste that shows how technology and capitalism can change the world. Plus, the place is just impressive, Mr. de Larauze said.\u201cIt was the wow effect. It was incredible,\u201d he said of his first visit (he\u2019s been twice), and added with a laugh, \u201cIt smelled, let me be frank.\u201dAfter the tour with Genoa\u2019s mayor and the consuls general, Mr. Reed organized a lunch of salad with French and Italian cheeses. As they sat down to eat, Mr. Reed raised the possibility of another destination for the group.\u201cI hope you\u2019ll get a chance to visit our composting facility,\u201d he told the dignitaries. \u201cBut we probably don\u2019t want to talk about that while you\u2019re eating.\u201dLike the Science Times page on Facebook.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Seeking Access to Facebook in China, Zuckerberg Courts Risks", "Date": "2016-03-20", "News": "Supported byHONG KONG \u2014 In terms of publicity, it was a great weekend for Mark Zuckerberg in China.The visits have cemented his place as one of the best-known foreign business executives in China. But it is far from clear whether his charm offensive will unlock Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s ultimate goal: persuading the Chinese government to lift its ban on the social media service and open it to the country\u2019s almost 700 million Internet users.The few American technology firms that have entered China in recent years have played down their efforts. Though Travis Kalanick, a founder of Uber, frequently travels to China, news of his presence rarely spreads across the Chinese Internet. There was almost no fanfare in advance of LinkedIn\u2019s deal with two closely connected Chinese venture capital shops to enter China, an event that was marked with a blog post.If Mr. Zuckerberg succeeds, it could show other foreign companies blocked in China that they have a potential path into the huge and fast-growing market \u2014 one that calls for them to accept China\u2019s strict controls on discourse and to refrain from rocking the boat. A failure would underscore Chinese distrust of foreign technology companies and cement the idea that the low-profile approach is the only way to gain market access.Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s meeting with Mr. Liu \u2014 a rarity for an American business executive \u2014 underscores the dynamic. Mr. Liu sits on the Chinese Communist Party\u2019s Politburo Standing Committee, the summit of power in China. The meeting serves China\u2019s propaganda purposes, allowing the country to show that one of the titans of America\u2019s new tech-based economy is happy to pay homage to China\u2019s leaders and its style of Internet governance.If there is anyone Facebook has to win over, it is Mr. Liu, who has for years presided over the controls on China\u2019s highly censored and stage-managed media.At the meeting, Mr. Liu lauded Facebook\u2019s technology prowess, but he also emphasized the importance of Internet governance \u201cwith Chinese characteristics,\u201d according to an official state news media account, a reference to censorship and surveillance within China.Mr. Zuckerberg praised China\u2019s progress in building an advanced Internet and vowed to work with Chinese peers to \u201cbuild a better world in cyberspace,\u201d according to Xinhua, China\u2019s official news agency.Facebook did not respond to a request for comment.On Friday, Mr. Zuckerberg posted a photo of himself smiling as he jogged past the Mao Zedong portrait in Tiananmen Square. He avoided mentioning both the violent crackdown on peaceful demonstrators there in 1989 and that morning\u2019s dangerous air pollution levels.During the discussion with Mr. Ma, the Alibaba founder, on Saturday, Mr. Zuckerberg also generally avoided sensitive topics, speaking instead about artificial intelligence and what should motivate entrepreneurs. He also praised China\u2019s emphasis on engineering, saying that he believed it would help solve future labor shortages associated with high-technology jobs.\u201cIn general we\u2019re seeing a huge constraint around the world on the number of good engineers who are graduating from universities,\u201d Mr. Zuckerberg said. \u201cAnd I think this is something that China has gotten really right by emphasizing for a long time.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Andy Grove\u2019s Warning to Silicon Valley", "Date": "2016-03-25", "News": "Supported byEditorial ObserverMr. Grove acknowledged that it was cheaper and thus more profitable for companies to hire workers and build factories in Asia than in the United States. But in his view, those lower Asian costs masked the high price of offshoring as measured by lost jobs and lost expertise. Silicon Valley misjudged the severity of those losses, he wrote, because of a \u201cmisplaced faith in the power of start-ups to create U.S. jobs.\u201dMr. Grove contrasted the start-up phase of a business, when uses for new technologies are identified, with the scale-up phase, when technology goes from prototype to mass production. Both are important. But only scale-up is an engine for job growth \u2014 and scale-up, in general, no longer occurs in the United States. \u201cWithout scaling,\u201d he wrote, \u201cwe don\u2019t just lose jobs \u2014 we lose our hold on new technologies\u201d and \u201cultimately damage our capacity to innovate.\u201dAnd yet, an all-out commitment to American-based manufacturing has not been on the business agenda of Silicon Valley or the political agenda of the United States. That omission, according to Mr. Grove, is a result of another \u201cunquestioned truism\u201d: \u201cthat the free market is the best of all economic systems \u2014 the freer the better.\u201d To Mr. Grove, that belief was flawed.The triumph of free-market principles over planned economies in the 20th century, he said, did not make those principles infallible or immutable. There was room for improvement, he argued, for what he called \u201cjob-centric\u201d economics and politics. In a job-centric system, job creation would be the nation\u2019s No. 1 objective, with the government setting priorities and arraying the forces necessary to achieve the goal, and with businesses operating not only in their immediate profit interest but also in the interests of \u201cemployees, and employees yet to be hired.\u201dWhen Mr. Grove wrote his critique, he was concerned about the corrosive social and economic effects of high unemployment, then 9.7 percent nationally. Unemployment has dropped considerably since then, but problems persist. Insecure, low-paying, part-time and dead-end jobs are prevalent. On the campaign trail, large groups of Americans are motivated and manipulated on the basis of real and perceived social and economic inequities.The result is a high-profit, low-prosperity nation. \u201cAll of us in business,\u201d Mr. Grove wrote, \u201chave a responsibility to maintain the industrial base on which we depend and the society whose adaptability \u2014 and stability \u2014 we may have taken for granted.\u201d Silicon Valley and much of corporate America have yet to live up to that principle.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Carrier Workers See Costs, Not Benefits, of Global Trade", "Date": "2016-03-19", "News": "Supported byINDIANAPOLIS \u2014 The fuzzy video, shot by a worker on the floor of a Carrier factory here in the American heartland last month, captured the raging national debate over trade and the future of the working class in 3 minutes 32 seconds.\u201cThis is strictly a business decision,\u201d a Carrier executive tells employees, describing how their 1,400 jobs making furnaces and heating equipment will be sent to Mexico. Workers there typically earn about $19 a day \u2014 less than what many on the assembly line here make in an hour. As boos and curses erupt from the crowd, the executive says, \u201cPlease quiet down.\u201dWhat came next was nothing of the kind.Within hours of being posted on Facebook, the video went viral. Three days after Carrier\u2019s Feb. 10 announcement, Donald J. Trump seized on the video in a Republican presidential debate and made Carrier\u2019s move to Mexico a centerpiece of his stump speeches attacking free trade.Jennifer Shanklin-Hawkins is one of those Carrier workers who listened to the announcement on the factory floor. After 14 years on the assembly line, she earns $21.22 an hour, enough to put her oldest son through college while raising two other children with her husband, a truck driver.And when she saw Mr. Trump talking about Carrier on the news, all she could do was shout \u201cYessss!\u201d at the TV. \u201cI loved it,\u201d she said. \u201cI was so happy Trump noticed us.\u201dIn living rooms and barrooms across Indianapolis, conversations with Carrier workers like Ms. Shanklin-Hawkins crystallize what has become an extraordinary moment in the American political and economic debate. As both political parties belatedly recognize the anxiety and deep-seated anger of blue-collar workers nationwide, the more-trade-is-good bipartisan consensus that has long held sway in Washington is being sundered.What isn\u2019t evident in the video \u2014 or in the furious debate it has spawned \u2014 is that both the company and its soon-to-be former employees are reacting to the same transformative quarter-century of American economic policy aimed at lowering trade barriers and staying globally competitive.\u201cWe have to look around the corner and see how this market will change in order to invest and stay in business for another 100 years,\u201d said Robert McDonough, a senior executive at Carrier\u2019s parent company, United Technologies. \u201cYou can blink and see your market position erode.\u201dThe rub is that the costs and benefits aren\u2019t distributed equally. Global trade has produced big gains for Americans, like more affordable goods \u2014 clothes, computers, even air-conditioners \u2014 and led to a more advanced economy.At the same time, a chronic trade deficit and an overvalued dollar have caused factory jobs to dry up, contributing to a deep divide between the political and economic elite and the rest of the nation. Perhaps a clash was inevitable.Consider the case of Ms. Shanklin-Hawkins. While she says she won\u2019t be voting for Mr. Trump and considers him a racist, she applauds his message on trade. She says she plans to vote for Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, who similarly blasts free trade, but from the left. The two populist candidates may be political opposites, but when it comes to the downside of globalization, Mr. Sanders and Mr. Trump are speaking to her with one voice.In fact, many Carrier workers here say that it was not so much Mr. Trump\u2019s nativist talk on illegal immigrants or his anti-Muslim statements that has fired them up. Instead, it was hearing a leading presidential candidate acknowledging just how much economic ground they\u2019ve lost \u2014 and promising to do something about it.Mr. Trump has repudiated decades of G.O.P. support for free trade, calling for heavy tariffs on Mexican-made goods from the likes of Carrier. This has helped put him within arm\u2019s reach of the Republican nomination.Opposition to trade deals has also galvanized supporters of Mr. Sanders, helping him unexpectedly win the Michigan Democratic primary this month. At the same time, it has forced his rival Hillary Clinton to distance herself from trade agreements she once supported, like the proposed 12-nation Trans-Pacific Partnership and the North American Free Trade Agreement, the 1994 deal with Mexico that is an important part of President Bill Clinton\u2019s political legacy.Exit polls after the Michigan primary , for example, showed that a clear majority of both Republican and Democratic voters believe international trade costs the American economy more jobs than it creates.Nicole Hargrove, a 14-year Carrier worker, said she was an undecided voter and was uncomfortable with Mr. Trump\u2019s attacks on immigrants, particularly Mexicans. \u201cBut I\u2019d like to turn him loose on the financial world,\u201d she said. \u201cMaybe if Carrier had to pay more to bring stuff in, they\u2019d think twice about moving jobs out.\u201dMark Weddle, 55, started work at Carrier 24 years ago and earns $21 an hour running a machine that makes heat exchangers. \u201cI have two brothers-in-law from Mexico,\u201d he said, explaining why he disagrees with Mr. Trump\u2019s anti-immigrant stance.But when it comes to Carrier, \u201cwe\u2019ve all worked our butts off,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd now they\u2019re going to throw us under the bus? If Trump will kick Carrier\u2019s ass, then I\u2019ll vote for him.\u201dThat\u2019s pretty much what Mr. Trump has threatened to do. At rally after rally, to rapturous crowds, he vows to impose a 35 percent tax on Carrier products from Mexico. Then, the laugh line: \u201cI want to do this myself, but it is so unpresidential to call up Carrier.\u201dAnd Mr. Trump vows not to take Carrier\u2019s calls until it agrees to change course. \u201cAs sure as you\u2019re here, they will call me up within 24 hours,\u201d he promises, and say to him, \u201c\u2018Sir, we\u2019ve decided to stay in the United States.\u2019\u201dIt is powerful talk.The relentless loss of American manufacturing jobs, however, goes back nearly half a century, driven largely by forces beyond the control of any president. The advances of technology, the diffusion of industrial expertise around the world, the availability of cheap labor and the rise of China as a manufacturing powerhouse would have disrupted the nation\u2019s industrial heartland even without new trade deals.Nor are tariffs likely to bring many of these jobs back, said David Autor, a professor of economics at M.I.T., who is one of the country\u2019s foremost specialists on the pluses and minuses of free trade. \u201cWe don\u2019t have silver bullets,\u201d he said.\u201cWhen I learned about the impact of trade agreements, the theory was that workers would be \u2018released\u2019 into the labor market and hired back at slightly lower salaries,\u201d Mr. Autor said. \u201cThat\u2019s not what happened. And no amount of cheaper air-conditioners will make these workers whole.\u201dOn a rainy Thursday afternoon this month, after their 6 a.m.-to-4:30 p.m. shift, a dozen Carrier workers gathered at Sully\u2019s Bar & Grill to talk about the decades they had spent at the low-slung, beige-and-white factory across the street.The group was diverse: black and white, male and female, old and young. And until the announcement of the eventual shutdown, most of them said they had loved working for Carrier, assembling furnaces and fan coils, hard as the work could be.The workers in the Indianapolis factory are represented by the United Steelworkers union. As has been the case in the auto industry, the union agreed in 2011 to a two-tier wage system in which new hires were paid less than veteran employees.\u201cI\u2019m more skilled with my hands than I am with my brain,\u201d said Robin Maynard, half joking. He holds two associate degrees, oversees a team of 15 and has worked at Carrier almost 24 years. \u201cBut I like working with my hands.\u201dMs. Shanklin-Hawkins emphasized that she, too, enjoyed her work, despite having little flexibility when it came to setting hours. \u201cI missed football games, graduations, you name it,\u201d she said.Her shifts can run 10 hours a day, six days in a row during summer and fall, when her line is busy, and mandatory overtime can total 20 hours a week. The pay, benefits and pension plan are all good, but it wasn\u2019t just the money that kept her on the assembly line, Ms. Shanklin-Hawkins said.\u201cIt\u2019s pretty cool working there,\u201d she said, describing how she carefully puts together \u201ctubular mixers,\u201d batches of rods that control the air flow in Carrier furnaces. \u201cAnd when you do it for 60 hours a week, people are like family.\u201dIt is painstaking work: Bend the rods, or force them into place, and the line can come to a halt, prompting a tongue-lashing from a supervisor. Despite that, like many of the 12 million American factory workers, Ms. Shanklin-Hawkins says the nation\u2019s leaders have simply lost respect for people who make things.\u201cThey didn\u2019t even thank us for our work,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was wrong.\u201dIndianapolis is far better off than many other cities in and around the Rust Belt. For the most part, it has successfully made the transition to an economy powered by services like health care, logistics and banking. The city\u2019s unemployment rate is 4.6 percent, below the national average of 4.9 percent.But many of the new jobs don\u2019t pay nearly as well as Carrier does. Next to the 49-year-old Carrier plant is an Amazon warehouse that opened in 2011, but with salaries there averaging just over $15 an hour, that\u2019s a lot less than the $20 or more an hour Carrier workers typically earn.Indiana politicians, who granted Carrier tax breaks and other incentives, are furious at the company and want their money back. They are also angry because Carrier\u2019s parent, United Technologies, is a major military contractor that receives $5.6 billion annually from the federal government.\u201cThat\u2019s financed by the taxpayers they just fired,\u201d said Senator Joe Donnelly, Democrat of Indiana. \u201cThey are trying to be the ultimate free rider.\u201dCarrier has said it will return public money in cases where the company has not kept its commitments to invest. But that\u2019s small change for United Technologies, a company with sales of $56 billion annually, more than Walt Disney, Coca-Cola or Goldman Sachs. And, in any case, it won\u2019t bring the jobs back.Carol Bigbee, 59, has worked at Carrier for 13 years. Her 32-year-old daughter has a college degree and the kind of job that many economists say is the future in postindustrial America \u2014 she works in a medical lab. The only problem, Ms. Bigbee said, is that her daughter\u2019s hourly pay is one-third less than her own pay at Carrier.\u201cI think it will be extremely hard to find a job that pays $22 an hour,\u201d Ms. Bigbee said. \u201cYou have to be really blessed to find a job that pays that kind of money.\u201d The few manufacturing jobs left require math tests, something she says she worries she could not pass.The first layoffs won\u2019t begin until 2017, and the final shuttering of the factory isn\u2019t expected to happen until 2019, giving employees time to prepare. In addition, United Technologies has offered to cover the cost of at least four years of additional schooling for Carrier workers. But that\u2019s cold comfort to people who can\u2019t afford not to work or those, like Ms. Bigbee, who are near retirement.She will be 60 in May, making retraining impractical. \u201cIf I were in my 40s, I\u2019d go back to school,\u201d she said.As Ms. Bigbee and her co-workers were talking over beers and Tequila Sunrises at Sully\u2019s in Indianapolis, executives from United Technologies were hosting a gathering of their own in New York City \u2014 at the Plaza Hotel, a property that was once owned, as it happens, by Donald Trump.That meeting was part of \u201cinvestor day,\u201d an annual ritual for many Fortune 500 companies in which management sits down with analysts and shareholders and tells them why their company\u2019s stock is a good buy. Carrier\u2019s message: Moving jobs south of the border is a major part of the company\u2019s strategy to increase profits.Manufacturing products in lower-cost locales isn\u2019t new for Carrier, which has had operations in Monterrey, Mexico, since 1969, decades before Nafta\u2019s passage.But Akhil Johri, the chief financial officer, noted that recent factory consolidation was among the reasons Carrier\u2019s management is eyeing a list of targets for future cuts. \u201cThey are painful\u201d but are necessary \u201cfor the long-term, competitive nature of the business and shareholder value creation,\u201d he said. \u201cWe feel good about being able to execute on that.\u201dUnited Technologies faces pressure from investors hungry for earnings growth in an economy that\u2019s only modestly growing at home, and falling in important overseas markets like China and the Middle East. Although the company\u2019s stock has vastly outperformed benchmarks in the last few decades, the shares have badly trailed the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index over the most recent five years.Wall Street is looking for United Technologies to post a 17 percent increase in earnings per share over the next two years, even though sales are expected to rise only 8 percent. Bridging that gap means cutting costs wherever savings can be found, as Mr. McDonough suggested at the meeting with analysts.Still he rejected the notion that pressure from Wall Street, or corporate greed, or even trade policy, had prompted the factory move to Monterrey. \u201cThis was a really tough decision,\u201d he said. \u201cThis will have a real impact on folks we care about and this community. We\u2019re an American company, but we compete globally.\u201dStaying competitive, raising profits and investing are among the reasons 400 white-collar jobs in areas like engineering and marketing will remain in Indiana.\u201cOur company, with American workers,\u201d he added, \u201cbuilds a heck of a lot of stuff in the U.S.\u201dLess than a three-hour drive south of Laredo, Tex., where the mountains meet the desert scrub near Monterrey, lies one industrial park after another. That\u2019s where Carrier and many other American manufacturers have built gleaming factories.Outside Carrier\u2019s plant on Hermenegildo Galeana Street in the suburb of Santa Catarina, a worker named Antonio Arroyo has nothing but positive things to say about his job, much like his colleagues in Indianapolis until last month. \u201cThe atmosphere is relaxed, a healthy environment,\u201d he said. \u201cEven the temporary workers are constantly trained.\u201dAs in the United States, the day shift starts around 6 a.m. and finishes about 4 p.m., with a break for lunch. Temporary workers, who have contracts lasting from three to six months, earn 163 pesos a day, or $9.40. Permanent workers make 330 pesos for a day\u2019s work, or $19.Hourly salaries in Indianapolis range from $15 to $26 an hour, as they do up the road in Huntington, Ind., where an additional 700 United Technologies jobs will be transferred to Mexico as well.United Technologies is not hurting like the American automakers or steel giants who lost billions when they were caught short by up-and-coming Japanese and South Korean competitors in the 1970s and 1980s. But the company says it fears it could end up in a similar situation if it doesn\u2019t make sure it is among the most efficient manufacturers in the world.Over all, United Technologies earned nearly $7.6 billion last year, and $2.9 billion of that came from the climate, controls and security division that includes Carrier. Those profits aren\u2019t under pressure; in fact, margins in the unit have steadily expanded in recent years.But that\u2019s not good enough, said Howard Rubel, a senior analyst at Jefferies, who notes that United Technologies has vowed to cut at least a half-billion dollars in costs annually for the next few years. \u201cThe stock hasn\u2019t done well,\u201d Mr. Rubel pointed out.United Technologies\u2019 board cut the bonus of its chief executive, Gregory J. Hayes, by nearly half for 2015. Still, with a total compensation package of $5.7 million, he made more last year than Carrier\u2019s factory workers could earn in several lifetimes. But in corporate boardrooms and country clubs, that\u2019s not the point.\u201cIt\u2019s embarrassing,\u201d said Mr. Rubel. \u201cThe stock didn\u2019t do well, and he got dinged. And whether it\u2019s the board or personal pride, no one wants that.\u201dBack in Indiana, smaller bonuses for top executives are the last thing state Representative Karlee Macer wants to hear about these days. Her district includes the Carrier plant, and for all their grit and noise and physical strain, manufacturing jobs aren\u2019t like many other positions available to Americans who lack a college degree, she said. For one thing, they pay more, giving the children of factory workers other options if they so choose.\u201cMy family has all been factory workers, including my grandmother, who came home with burn marks from welding,\u201d she said over breakfast across the street from the Indiana Statehouse. \u201cIs everybody who is not a white-collar worker supposed to earn $12 an hour?\u201dJuan Zertuche contributed reporting from Monterrey, Mexico.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": null, "Date": null, "News": "AdvertisementMarch 17, 2016Robert E. ScottJeffrey J. SchottTrade has become an increasingly important part of the United States economy. In the 1960s, exports and imports represented less than 10 percent of U.S. gross domestic product; today the share is closer to 30 percent. As a result, American  exporters sell more U.S. goods abroad than ever before \u2014 and imports give American  consumers more choices at lower prices. Americans have higher living standards because trade enables them to afford more goods.Trade benefits consumers in other ways \u2014 many of the products that are produced in the United States are cheaper and better because they have imported components and raw materials, improving their quality and lowering their cost. Trade thus boosts the competitiveness of products made at home, which, in turn, allows American  producers to sell more abroad and employ more workers in the U.S.For the United States, trade agreements open markets abroad without significant changes in current U.S. trade restrictions. That is because with few exceptions, U.S. trade barriers are already low and U.S. regulatory requirements protecting consumers, workers and the environment are high. Almost all our trading partners have higher barriers; trade negotiations are largely about how much and how fast they will change their practices, upgrade their regulatory standards toward U.S. norms and open their markets to new competition from the United States and other countries. From the U.S. perspective, the benefits are straightforward. We get more access abroad to sell our competitive farm products, manufactured items and services.Why do other countries accept such \"unbalanced\" deals? Because trade pacts require them to undertake domestic policy reforms that they need to do in any event to boost productivity and growth in their economies. Often those countries find it easier to pursue necessary but politically contentious reforms as part of an international accord in which they receive other economic and political benefits. Trade pacts reinforce U.S. political and strategic interests beyond the gains in commercial ties. Recall that the first U.S. free trade pact was in 1985 with Israel, and it is a cornerstone of the U.S.-Israel relationship.  The Trans-Pacific Partnership will similarly cement American ties with the Asia-Pacific region.  It reassures our allies that the United States is a reliable partner that remains engaged in a region facing North Korean adventurism.To say that trade agreements are good for America doesn\u2019t mean that they benefit all Americans.  Some firms can take advantage of the new opportunities and others suffer from increased competition.  Yes, trade deals can displace some workers from their current jobs, but they also create many new jobs in areas where America has a competitive advantage such as business services and high-tech industries. Compared to overall U.S. job creation and dislocation each month, affected largely by technological advances and changes in consumer demand, the impact due to trade agreements is exceedingly small, but positive because, on balance, trade pacts create better and higher paying jobs than the ones displaced. Workers in manufacturing firms that export generally earn wages 12 to 18 percent higher than their counterparts in firms that only serve the domestic market.Of course, the net result is little solace for those suffering loss of job or income.  But the response should not be to make everyone less well off.  Instead, we should be doing more, like other advanced countries, to promote labor adjustment through programs that provide wage insurance, targeted job training and other transition support.  Our political leaders have given such programs short shrift and are now witnessing the political backlash against their inaction.Let\u2019s not forget that trade pacts create commercial opportunities but do not guarantee sales. American  firms and workers face tough competition at home and abroad.  Inadequate investment in educating American children and retraining and retooling  workers is a higher tax on U.S. competitiveness than tariffs and quotas hindering America\u2019s  access to foreign markets.\nIt\u2019s no surprise that voters on the right and the left are uneasy with U.S. trade policy \u2014 and they have every right to be. For years, the United States has consistently run much larger trade deficits than other developed nations, and we have suffered more trade-related job loss as a result. While growing exports tend to support domestic employment, growing imports costs jobs and reduces domestic output. Thus, the size and growth of trade deficits is strongly correlated with trade-related job loss.Workers without a college degree make up more than two-thirds of the U.S. labor force, roughly 100 million people. Thus, the growth of globalization, as encouraged by more than 20 U.S. trade and investment deals, plus the proposed T.P.P., is responsible for transferring approximately $180 billion per year from low- and middle-income workers to those in the top third, and especially to those in the top 10, 1 and 0.1 percent of the population.It is time for a reset in U.S. trade and international economic relations. We must put an end to unfair trade practices such as currency manipulation, which is the single largest cause of U.S. trade deficits and trade-related job losses. The United States needs to develop a results-based approach to trade negotiations that is designed to rebalance global trade and ensure that the benefits of trade are broadly shared, and not funneled to those with the most wealth and power in our society.\nRob\u2019s comments on job losses are not supported by the actual data.  Over the last year, total U.S. private sector, non-farm employment went up by 2.6 million jobs, and the unemployment rate fell from 5.5 percent to 4.9 percent -- a level most economists consider to be near full employment.  Yet Rob suggests that U.S. trade with the 11 other countries in the Trans-Pacific Partnership cost us 2 million jobs in this period!The basic fallacy in Rob\u2019s analysis is the assumption that trade deficits increase overall U.S. unemployment.  Over the last 25 years, we have implemented a large array of trade agreements.  During that period, the U.S. trade deficit has fluctuated generally in line with U.S. economic performance.  The deficit grows when times are good and shrinks when the economy slows.The simple answer is that Rob cites real problems but misdiagnoses the causes.  As I said earlier, the source of many stresses in the U.S. labor market is a combination of technological advances and under-investment in U.S. human and physical infrastructure; the impact of trade agreements is relatively minor but positive.\nJeff claims that \u201cthe impact due to trade agreements is exceedingly small, but positive because, on balance, trade pacts create better and higher paying jobs than the ones displaced.\u201d But he is wrong on both counts. Trade deals have both cost jobs and pushed workers into lower paying ones.The majority of our trade deficits and manufacturing job losses are because of currency manipulation by China and about 20 other countries, including Japan, Malaysia, Singapore and Vietnam in the proposed Trans-Pacific Partnership. These policies act like a subsidy of 30 to 40 percent on all of their exports to the United States, and a tax on all of our exports to those countries, and to all other countries where we compete with their exports (essentially, the rest of the world).

{"Headline": "To Beat the Rush, Americans Rush to Cuba, Overloading Services", "Date": "2016-03-24", "News": "Supported byHAVANA \u2014 In Vi\u00f1ales, a lush valley about 100 miles from Havana, cabdrivers are charging stranded foreigners $10 to sleep in the back of their taxis.In Varadero, a popular beach town, tour groups are being rerouted to resorts two hours away, which Americans are not really supposed to be visiting. And upon arrival in Havana, tourists sometimes face five-hour delays, because the airport lacks the mobile staircases needed to disembark and the conveyor belts to process luggage.\u201cIt\u2019s funny, it\u2019s like Americans are rushing to Cuba before Americans rush to Cuba,\u201d said Tony Pandola, a tour guide here.State hotels have already increased prices by nearly one-third, as demand for lodging far exceeds Cuba\u2019s ability to meet it.Travel agents and industry specialists say the move is guaranteed to unleash a new flood of visitors to Cuba, where hotels and popular restaurants are already at full capacity and struggling to find a steady supply of food, water and gas to keep their doors open.The lack of tourism infrastructure is just one of the many challenges Cuba faces as it strengthens economic and diplomatic ties with the United States. Cuba, which has suffered from a failing economy for decades, lacks the number of rooms that would allow it to catch up quickly to the rush of visitors.Even with at least three major hotel construction projects underway, and a Starwood deal in the works, experts say it will take years before Havana can absorb the number of travelers arriving each year.Tourism to Cuba reached a record last year, when 3.5 million people visited, according to state news media. In 2016, one million people have visited so far, up nearly 15 percent from the same period last year. The number of Americans who traveled to Cuba increased 77 percent in 2015 from the prior year, according to the Havana Consulting Group, which monitors business trends in Cuba.\u201cIt\u2019s pretty close to impossible to find rooms right now; the demand for Cuba is just unbelievable,\u201d said Peter Sanchez, president of Cuba Tours and Travel in Miami. \u201cIt\u2019s not just Americans. It\u2019s also the rest of the world that wants to see Cuba \u2014 the clich\u00e9 \u2014 \u2018before it changes.\u2019\u201dHe said hotels in smaller cities are full through next year, and others are charging up to $375 a night. For the second week in May, a room at the Habana Libre \u2014 a former Hilton so in need of repair that Mr. Sanchez refuses to book his customers there \u2014 is $300 a night.The state tourism company, Gaviota, said it plans to add 50,000 hotel rooms by 2020, with Havana as the top priority. The goal, a state-run media report said, is to \u201cposition Havana as one of the top destinations for urban tourism in the Caribbean\u201d by opening three new hotels by 2018.Airbnb, the home-share service, announced last week that in its first year in operation, more than 13,000 American travelers had booked stays in Cuba. Nearly 4,000 homeowners have listed their homes there, the company said.The strain on the hospitality industry is particularly acute in Havana, because the Cuban government for years focused on building hotels at beach resorts popular with Europeans, but which are off-limits to Americans, who even under the new rules are prohibited from engaging in vacation-style excursions.Cuba has about 70,000 hotel rooms, but only 20 percent of those are in Havana. In places like Vi\u00f1ales and Trinidad, there are so few hotels that private entrepreneurs who rent rooms have stepped in to fill the void.\u201cThere\u2019s been an explosion of new business,\u201d said Annalisa Gallina, who manages Caf\u00e9 Bohemia, a cafe in Old Havana that also offers two one-bedroom apartments and a room for rent.Ms. Gallina said providing consistent, quality products is a challenge in a country where shortages are common.\u201cThere are days that no water comes out of the pipes,\u201d she said. \u201cSometimes the gas is so slow, that when you\u2019re cooking with gas it causes serious delays.\u201dIn a recent survey, 12 of 25 stores Mr. Morales checked did not have chicken, and more than half of the stores had no soft drinks or bottled water.\u201cThese changes are going to trigger an avalanche, and Cuba is not ready for it,\u201d Mr. Morales said. \u201cThis is a big opportunity for Cuba. If they don\u2019t take this train, they are going to miss it.\u201dRestaurants already require advance booking and with more cruise ships flooding the region with travelers, experts say it will become even more difficult to find a place to dine. Among the reasons experts say Cuba has agreed to accept cruise ships: the passengers do not require hotels.Experts say it is unlikely that Cuba will be able to process the 110 new daily flights that American carriers hope to schedule at airports around the country by later this year. The terminal that handles American flights at Jos\u00e9 Mart\u00ed International Airport has just two luggage belts.A spokeswoman for American Airlines said the carrier\u2019s operations team is working with the Cuban authorities to ensure the airport is ready for scheduled service. \u201cWe feel we\u2019re well-positioned given that we have operated charter flights to Cuba for the past 25 years,\u201d said the spokeswoman, Martha Pantin.Collin Laverty, an American who organizes tour groups in Cuba, said travelers should avoid checking luggage.\u201cThat airport is definitely not ready for the challenge,\u201d Mr. Laverty said. \u201cYou can have a 45-minute flight, and then six hours to get out of the airport. After a three-hour check-in in Miami, that can be a long day.\u201dHannah Berkeley Cohen contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Mideast Came to Idaho State. It Wasn\u2019t the Best Fit.", "Date": "2016-03-21", "News": "Supported byPOCATELLO, Idaho \u2014 When the Rev. Jim Jones, pastor of the Blazing Grace Church here, approached the lectern at City Hall, he was holding a copy of the Quran.The Islamic text commanded followers to embrace intolerance, hate and violence, he told the zoning panel, explaining why he felt uncomfortable with the plan of Middle Eastern students at Idaho State University to build a mosque within walking distance of campus.\u201cI get very fearful because I live close to this place,\u201d Mr. Jones told the panel, which was considering a rezoning request.The mosque was approved. But the remarks by Mr. Jones and other opponents at the February 2014 hearing were signs of the fissures developing in this railroad town as Idaho State became increasingly dependent on Saudi and Kuwaiti students to replace income lost from steep declines in local enrollment and state funding.But Idaho State had not bargained for the cultural clash in this isolated community. Even if they were just normal, rowdy college kids, the behavior of the mostly male students stood out in this conservative, predominantly Mormon city. Free from the strict cultural mores of their home countries, some students have faced charges like drunken driving and stalking.At the same time, professors said students, many of them unfamiliar with English, were ill-prepared and frequently resorted to cheating.Students have taken umbrage to the accusations, and have recounted episodes of discrimination on campus and in town. Now some students are leaving.For Idaho State, it is a moment of truth, with a loss of more than $2 million a year in tuition alone from 100 students who left last summer. More declines are expected.\u201cWe\u2019re preparing for the worst,\u201d said Scott Scholes, the associate vice president for enrollment management.As colleges across the country, including prestigious universities like the University of California, Berkeley, second-tier state universities and little-known private institutions, look to make up for budget cuts and declining enrollment by accepting more foreign students, the situation at Idaho State is a cautionary tale, an example of the complexities of integrating foreign students into a campus and a community.Mr. Scholes said new limits established by the Saudi and Kuwaiti governments might mean that no Middle Eastern freshmen will be arriving at Idaho State for the next academic year, cutting enrollment by more than 250, on top of the 100 Saudi students who have already departed.Explaining another reason for the declining enrollment, Daniel Hummel, a political-science professor who is also secretary of the new mosque, said, \u201cSome of the students are dissatisfied, and they\u2019re leaving.\u201dAlthough this virtually all-Christian city does not appear to be a natural fit for Muslims \u2014 the courthouse lawn features a monument chiseled with the Ten Commandments \u2014 everything seemed fine when the first 17 Saudi students arrived in 2006, mostly in the engineering school. Over time, the students began sending word back home about Pocatello\u2019s attributes, particularly the low cost of living, said Nezar Alnejidi, a marketing major and student leader. On a monthly stipend of about $1,850, students could pay their room and board and have money to spare.But the students also brought unease. On campus, several professors said their colleagues chafed at the extra work required of them because of the poor English skills of many students who needed help after class. Some professors also believed the students did not have the proper math backgrounds for their chosen majors: A chart sent to the faculty by one dean revealed that in some classes with more than 20 Middle Eastern students, 90 percent of them had failed physics, 75 percent had failed introductory English, and more than 60 percent had failed math.David Rodgers, an associate dean of science and engineering, described the challenges many students have faced.\u201cIn engineering, every single class is scripted,\u201d Dr. Rodgers said. \u201cThere\u2019s not a lot of room for a screw-up. If you fail a class, you can make it up perhaps by taking 18 hours the next semester. You know your funding is running out. You know you\u2019ve come to America to be an engineer. The cultural change, the language barrier, all these things stress kids.\u201dThat might explain why several professors said Middle Eastern students seemed prone to cheating and plagiarism. Eighty percent to 90 percent of the cheating cases reported in recent semesters in engineering and science have involved foreign students, Dr. Rodgers said.The university has bought antiplagiarism software, installed cameras, and gone so far as to track the Internet addresses of submitted papers, but Martin Hackworth, a departing physics lecturer, said the response was inadequate.\u201cThey viewed these students as A.T.M. machines,\u201d Mr. Hackworth said in an interview.The cheating accusations are one reason Mr. Alnejidi is now telling friends not to come to Idaho State.\u201cThe Saudi students are leaving because they feel they will not graduate under that level of scrutiny,\u201d he said.On a recent afternoon at the engineering school, groups of Middle Eastern students chatted outside. Inside, Saudi students worked in a basement laboratory on a virtual shield to protect United States borders from incursion, both by undocumented immigrants \u2014 and terrorists.As he drove his Mustang one night to a gym and tried to park, a car with an open door blocked his parking spot. When Mr. Alheid complained, he said, the man flashed a handgun at him. On another day, a middle finger was directed his way as he approached the newly built mosque, he said.While acknowledging instances of discrimination, officials and professors say some of the students have done little to adapt.

{"Headline": "Turkey Places Conditions on E.U. for Migrant Help", "Date": "2016-03-07", "News": "Supported byLeaders assessed the demands at an emergency summit meeting in Brussels, where\u00a0Turkey\u2019s prime minister asked for billions of euros in new assistance, easier access to visas for Turks to go to Europe and the dramatic acceleration of talks on Turkey\u2019s membership in the bloc, a discussion that has languished for years.The toughening of the Turkish position underscored Ankara\u2019s apparent attempt to win more support from Europe if it is going to be expected to protect the bloc from hundreds of thousands of new asylum seekers.But after a long day of negotiations that stretched into the early hours of\u00a0Tuesday, the European leaders had made only partial progress, with many of them still assessing the terms. Even so, Angela Merkel, the German chancellor, said leaders would meet again in Brussels on\u00a0March 18.A proposal put forward by Turkey \u201cis a breakthrough if it is to be realized, if it is to be implemented,\u201d Ms. Merkel told a news conference at the end of the summit.Ms. Merkel said that under the proposed deal, for each person resettled directly from camps in Turkey to Europe, Turkey would in exchange accept one person who does not qualify for asylum in Europe to be returned to Turkey.The idea was \u201cto break, if you like, the vicious circle of entering an illegal boat,\u201d Ms. Merkel said, adding that the deal could restore \u201corderly migration.\u201d David Cameron, the British prime minister, agreed that \u201cwe do have the basis for a breakthrough, which is the possibility that in the future all migrants who arrive in Greece will be returned to Turkey.\u201d The Turkish demands, however, laid bare the European Union\u2019s weakening position and signaled that the difficulties \u2014 and costs \u2014 of managing the crisis might only rise the longer it stumbled on.Hoping to avoid a repeat of last year, when hundreds of thousands of refugees overwhelmed the authorities from Greece to Germany and beyond, European leaders were weighing whether to declare \u201cclosed\u201d the route migrants have taken through the Balkans to Western Europe.But such a step threatens to bottle up migrants in Greece and has sharply divided European leaders, with Ms. Merkel reluctant to burden Greece, which is trying to regain its economic footing after a six-year debt crisis.\u201cYou end up in situations like this when you have neglected to build the capacity to deal with the bigger issues of our time,\u201d said Fredrik Erixon, the director of the European Center for International Political Economy, a research group in Brussels.\u201cTurkey now is going to raise the costs for Europe,\u201d he added, \u201cand to such an extent that Europe may not be able to oppose Turkish goals in the region, including how to deal with Syria and the Kurds.\u201dTurkey is fighting Islamic extremists across its border with Syria as part of an international coalition that includes the United States, and it is confronting Kurdish militias that the Turks say are also a terrorist threat.As the meeting in Brussels got underway, Prime Minister Ahmet Davutoglu of Turkey reiterated calls for a \u201csafe zone\u201d in Syria where migrants could be free from the violence that has torn the country apart over the past five years.The additional money, amounting to about \u20ac3 billion, that Turkey requested on Monday was a precondition for curbing new migrants from crossing the Aegean Sea to reach Europe.Mr. Davutoglu also surprised European leaders in a negotiating session that dragged into Monday morning by putting Turkey\u2019s attempts to join the European Union \u2014 a process known as accession \u2014 on the agenda.\u201cTurkey is ready to work with the E.U.,\u201d Mr. Davutoglu said Monday. \u201cTurkey is ready to be a member of the E.U. as well.\u201d He added, \u201cI hope this summit, which will not focus only on irregular migration but also on the Turkish accession process to the E.U., will be a success story and a turning point in our relations.\u201dMs. Merkel resisted the wording of Mr. Tusk\u2019s statement about closing the Balkan route.Germany also has been sharply at odds with a neighbor, Austria, after the government in Vienna restricted the flow of migrants, threatening the bloc\u2019s system of passport-free travel.Others would like to see European borders stay shut.\u201cIf we bring migrants from Greece or Turkey directly into Europe, that\u2019s an invitation to waltz,\u201d Hungary\u2019s right-wing prime minister, Viktor Orban, told reporters here. He added, \u201cBorders must be closed, and direct resettlement is out of the question, at least as far as Hungary is concerned.\u201dNow much of the attention is on how to stop migrants from reaching Europe in the first place \u2014 and to distinguish Syrians and Iraqis, whose claims to asylum are generally viewed sympathetically, from those who are fleeing poverty and chaos elsewhere.For many years, Turkey has ostensibly been a candidate for European Union membership, but Mr. Erdogan\u2019s authoritarian turn has made that seem like an ever more distant prospect.Melissa Eddy contributed reporting from Berlin, Palko Karasz from London, and Ceylan Yeginsu from Istanbul.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Filmed in New York, Starring My Home", "Date": "2016-03-11", "News": "Supported byStanding on a leafy Brooklyn block in the 2015 film \u201cThe Intern,\u201d Anne Hathaway gazes at the handsome brownstone where her character lives, turns to Robert De Niro and says: \u201cI love this house. It just looks happy to me.\u201dMany others share her enthusiasm. The Clinton Hill townhouse, with four stories, five bedrooms and a library, took center stage in a Nordstrom holiday commercial that aired last year. It also turned up in print ads for West Elm, New Balance and Best Buy. In all, it was filmed on 10 separate occasions last year. Its owner, Merele Williams-Adkins, fields inquiries about it monthly.As the film industry expands in the city, the opportunities for New Yorkers to turn their homes into ad hoc film studios grow, too. And with that, of course, comes more reason for neighbors to complain about everything from film crews monopolizing parking spaces to autograph-seekers hogging the sidewalks.Last week, more than 100 projects, including television shows, movies and newscasts, had permits to film in the city, a typical week in New York.Still, it takes a certain amount of fortitude to stand by while your home is overrun by a harried film crew. Not for the nick-conscious or the ding-averse is watching your furniture being loaded onto a truck while the walls are being covered in red floral wallpaper, as happened once when a New York State lottery commercial was shot at a Victorian in Ditmas Park, Brooklyn. On another occasion, an area rug in the same Victorian emerged from a shoot looking like Rocky after a fight. The crew rolled it up, took it to a cleaner and returned it a few days later.\u201cWe\u2019re going to break something, we\u2019re going to scratch something,\u201d said Nick Carr, a location scout. \u201cAt the end of the day, your house is going to look a little off-kilter.\u201dAll the action could quickly alienate and enrage neighbors who rarely see any of the money, but invariably endure a good dose of the upheaval. Complaints from angry residents and business owners are on the rise, say elected officials and neighborhood associations, particularly in neighborhoods that drip with historic charm, a favorite of film crews. Tensions can run particularly high when neighbors can point to a lone brownstone on the block that is profiting at the expense of everyone else.When \u201cThe Intern\u201d was shot in 2014, Ms. Williams-Adkins and her daughter, Turiya, now 17, moved out for almost three months, staying in a hotel and a short-term rental, paid for by the production. Her son, Titus, now 21, was away at college. Ms. Williams-Adkins declined to say how much she earned for the deal, saying only that it was \u201cin the six figures.\u201dWhen they returned 11 weeks later, the place had been put back together \u2014 but not exactly as they had left it, which gave the family an unexpected chance to hit an emotional reset button, as Mr. Adkins had died just five months earlier. \u201cIt was actually quite cathartic,\u201d Ms. Williams-Adkins said.Not all properties are ready for prime time. Some directors are looking for living quarters that look like a page torn from a Pottery Barn catalog. But not always. Sometimes, they want shag carpeting, vintage bathrooms and dated Formica.And they always want enough space to accommodate a crew.\u201cIt doesn\u2019t have to be a pretty baby,\u201d said Barbara Wilson, an associate broker with Halstead Property who works as a liaison with location managers and scouts. \u201cAn episode is not always about rich people with huge apartments.\u201dThe city has been steering scouts to areas that haven\u2019t seen a lot of film activity, like the South Bronx. \u201cYou\u2019ve got a lot of neighborhoods that are yearning for filming because they recognize the economic need,\u201d said Julie Menin, the commissioner of the Mayor\u2019s Office of Media and Entertainment.In neighborhoods that are beyond discovered, many buildings bar the door, restricting film crews from using common areas or the elevators. \u201cThey perceive it to be an extraordinary inconvenience for not a great benefit,\u201d said Peter Ferrara, the president of the co-op board of 194 Riverside Drive on the Upper West Side, which feels differently and has been used for film locations for about 20 years.Last year alone, film crews were on the premises of the 1902 building a dozen times. The building, Mr. Ferrara said, has made appearances on television shows like \u201cBillions,\u201d \u201cOrange Is the New Black\u201d and \u201cThe Americans.\u201d Woody Allen shot a new project there, too.\u201cThe basement is a good place for drug addicts and murderers to hang out,\u201d Mr. Ferrara said. The lobby became a casino for the Showtime drama \u201cBillions.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re not raking in billions,\u201d he said. \u201cBut if your heating bill is $140,000, you can defray some of that.\u201dAn apartment building might receive around $10,000 to $15,000 for a few days\u2019 work, according to location agents.Because of the Moguls\u2019 film-friendly reputation, when the television show \u201c30 Rock\u201d was filming an outdoor scene on their block a few years ago, the crew paid the Moguls a few hundred dollars to let Tina Fey and Jon Hamm warm up inside. \u201cI said, \u2018That\u2019s fine as long as Tina talks to my wife for a few minutes,\u2019 \u201d Mr. Mogul said. \u201cMy wife had a great time.\u201d Dr. Mogul, 54, is a cardiologist.Some neighbors, however, are less than keen. The Moguls have appeased some with bottles of wine, but when one neighbor wrote them an angry note, that relationship soured. \u201cMy wife is not really friends with him anymore,\u201d Mr. Mogul said.Over in Clinton Hill, Ms. Williams-Adkins faced the same discontent during the filming of \u201cThe Intern.\u201d \u201cSome neighbors would call me or scream at the production crew,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was difficult. I think there are people who are still upset.\u201dFor some city residents, the fun ended a long time ago.\u201cI\u2019ve wanted to protest and chant in the middle of the filming,\u201d said Richard Rubin, 57, an editor who lives on West 94th Street in Manhattan. \u201cThere\u2019s just no reward for the neighborhood.\u201d Last September, while Mr. Rubin was walking his dog near Riverside Park, he noticed telltale no-parking signs ordering drivers to move their cars on Yom Kippur, one of the Jewish High Holy Days. \u201cIt was disrespectful,\u201d said Mr. Rubin, who once had his car towed by a film crew when he had not moved it in time.Parking needs for a shoot depend on the size of the project. A small production might request permits for one or two blocks for a day or two, whereas a large feature film with trailers for cast members could occupy five or six blocks for weeks, according to Michael Kriaris, who, as a location manager, oversees properties during productions.Ms. Menin, the commissioner of media and entertainment, said the benefits outweigh any temporary disruptions New Yorkers may experience.During the 75 days that Warner Brothers filmed \u201cThe Intern,\u201d the studio spent an estimated $45 million locally on vendors and payroll. \u201cThe economic impact for those businesses that are located in areas of filming is really impactful and very meaningful,\u201d Ms. Menin said. \u201cAt the same time we recognize that filming can have an impact on communities.\u201dAs of March 1, more than 40 neighborhoods were on the hiatus list, mostly in Manhattan, Brooklyn and Queens. In December, the city added a swath that includes 194 Riverside and the Mogul family\u2019s brownstone. The Riviera and the Grinnell, another vintage Washington Heights co-op, have been unable to participate in film shoots since crucial streets ended up on the list last April.The solution, said Bruce Robertson, an associate broker for Corcoran who lives in the Grinnell, is to change attitudes in the neighborhood. Residents of the Riviera and the Grinnell started a committee in the hopes of persuading nearby co-ops and condos that they, too, can profit from the film industry. The committee plans a neighborhood meeting next month; parking solutions will be on the agenda.\u201cNothing\u2019s a cash cow,\u201d Mr. Gross said. \u201cBut it takes the edge off the bills. It makes it a little easier.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "At Omega, Quality Is Key", "Date": "2016-03-17", "News": "Supported byBIENNE, Switzerland \u2014 At Baselworld, the world\u2019s premier watch fair, Omega will trumpet the rollout of six new Master Chronometer movements for 2016, including the new annual calendar for the Globemaster that places the months on each facet of the pie-pan dial. Also on offer: new Planet Ocean Chronographs for women and men and a Speedmaster Moonphase.History, precision, branding. Those watchwords seem to echo through the halls of Omega\u2019s imposing headquarters on the outskirts of this industrial town, where German and French coexist and its parent company, Swatch Group, operates nearby.Not far from the reception area, a museum, open to the public, houses timepieces and memorabilia that highlight 160 years of company history. \u201cTo me, Omega stands for perfection,\u201d said Petros Protopapas, the museum curator, as he pointed to Omega\u2019s first wristwatch, a 1900 timepiece fitted with the 19-inch Omega caliber.\u201cOmega is the only company named for this most important movement \u2014 not for a founder,\u201d he said.Omega prides itself on being the brand chosen for precision timekeeping: by the Allied forces during World War II, for the Olympic Games and by NASA for the United States space program. Mr. Petros himself glows when talking about the museum\u2019s latest addition: a Speedmaster Chronograph worn by Capt. Ronald E. Evans on the Apollo 17 mission to the moon in 1972. Mr. Petros helped buy it for $245,000, a record price for the model, at a Christie\u2019s Omega auction in December. \u201cWe are actively using our past to make our future,\u201d he emphasized.At the company\u2019s helm is Stephen Urquhart, president for the past 16 years.\u201cThe producers wanted a bezel that could turn both ways,\u201d he explained with delight while turning it back and forth and then pointing out the distinctive lollipop seconds hand and NATO strap. \u201cIt\u2019s eye-catching and beautiful. People love it.\u201dSo does Omega.Asked how much the 20-year Bond connection means to the company, Mr. Urquhart flashed a wry smile: \u201cIt\u2019s unbelievable what it\u2019s meant for the brand.\u201dHe said sales of its Bond-related watches ramp up immediately when Omega, working on a handshake-basis with the franchise\u2019s producers, runs its obligatory film-related advertising around a new movie. \u201cCommercially, it\u2019s a fantastic operation for us,\u201d Mr. Urquhart noted. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s manna from the sky, but it\u2019s very rewarding.\u201dHistory features prominently in the match. Mr. Urquhart tells the story of the fashion designer Lindy Hemming who set about revamping Bond\u2019s image in 1992 \u2014 picking the right car, the right Champagne, the right watch. She chose Omega\u2019s Seamaster, first introduced in 1948, because it was strongly favored by Britain\u2019s Royal Navy, where the fictional spy holds the rank of commander.Mr. Urquhart also readily recounts his own history. Born in the West Indies to European parents, he was initially schooled in England. In 1968, after his university studies in Switzerland, he joined the Omega communications department. \u201cI answered an ad in the paper,\u201d he recalled. \u201cI was interviewed in this building on this floor.\u201dHe left for a job at Audemars Piguet in 1974. \u201cI didn\u2019t see a future at Omega,\u201d he explained, his departure coinciding with the beginnings of the rise in quartz watches that would accelerate the decline of the mechanical watch sector into the 1980s.His return to Omega in 1999 came at the behest of the Swatch Group mastermind Nicolas Hayek, who plucked him from Omega\u2019s sister brand, Blancpain.\u201cHayek called me in Lausanne one Saturday \u2014 I remember it vividly,\u201d Mr. Urquhart recalled, breaking into a grin. \u201cHe said, \u2018I want you to take over Omega. And by the way, you have no choice.\u2019 I started two days later.\u201dBy then, Omega was again on the rise, thanks to the company\u2019s embrace of the experimental coaxial escapement that year, invented by the British horologist George Daniels to improve watch durability and accuracy.\u201cMr. Hayek and I sat down and said, \u2018This will be our mission statement for the future,\u201d\u2019 Mr. Urquhart said, noting that Omega produces 500,000 watches a year with the coaxial movement, which is 75 percent of its total production.On Mr. Urquhart\u2019s list of corporate achievements, coaching the coaxial movement through a seven-year development phase comes first \u2014 followed by cracking the magnet problem, the bane of timepiece accuracy. In 2013, Omega created the world\u2019s first \u201ccageless\u201d movement to resist magnetic fields up to 15,000 gauss.Pointing out that magnets, which are everywhere in modern life, cause watches to slow down and even stop, Mr. Urquhart said, \u201cWe felt ours was a big breakthrough \u2014 a spiral which we could make in silicon. It\u2019s a new standard.\u201d He gestured to the floor above his office where this year Omega installed a Swiss government lab to test its watches, certifying each as waterproof, accurate and magnetic-resistant.His other major achievement: reviving the flagship retail concept that Omega had used during the \u201950s and \u201960s. Beginning with a flashy Zurich boutique that opened in December 2000, Omega has steadily opened 137 corporate stores worldwide, plus 150 franchised ones.\u201cIt\u2019s a very costly operation,\u201d he said, noting that Omega does not make public its sales figures, finances or revenue. \u201cBut I believe, down the road, it will really be a tremendous asset for the brand.\u201dThese days, most of Mr. Urquhart\u2019s time is spent on what he labels product branding. \u201cThat is the key,\u201d he said. \u201cI work with the team on design ideas and help bring each watch from inception through to market.\u201dThe unsettled global economy, Mr Urquhart maintains, does not affect product design. \u201cWe are making no drastic changes and certainly won\u2019t compromise on quality,\u201d he said. \u201cIf anything, we are trying to raise standards so that Omega remains relevant and prominent as a watch brand. You can see that in what we are doing with our new Master Chronometers. It\u2019s all about creating more desirability and giving customers confidence in their choice.\u201dAs for favored locations, China will remain the brand\u2019s star because it still leads the world\u2019s luxury market, despite a sharp drop in 2015 watch sales due to its economic problems and the government\u2019s anti-corruption drive. As one of the first brands to enter China, Omega maintains an edge in the country, Mr. Urquhart said, and intends to focus on its flagship stores there.\u201cIt\u2019s showing the way,\u201d he added. \u201cThe middle class is growing every year by enormous figures. It\u2019s still unbelievable market for the future.\u201dMr. Urquhart on: The definition of luxury\u201cI don\u2019t like the word, it makes you think of diamonds; remember, good water is also a luxury. But luxury in Webster\u2019s Dictionary is defined as \u2018what you don\u2019t need.\u2019 I would have to agree with that.\u201dThe watch industry\u2019s biggest enemy\u201cMagnetism is the biggest enemy of mechanical watch that exists today. Magnetism is rampant today \u2014 you find it in induction stoves, in handbags, in every tablet cover. If I take a normal watch and put it on a tablet cover, the watch will stop.\u201dMechanical watches vs. smartwatches\u201cTo have watch on your wrist is to give you a sentimental, emotional reassurance \u2014 and pleasure. A smartwatch, to use the awful word, won\u2019t give you that.\u201dWomen\u2019s watches\u201cWe have to get away this idea of a \u2018woman\u2019s watch.\u2019 Women don\u2019t want to buy something made for them because they\u2019re women.\u201dHis favorite Omega?\u201cThat\u2019s difficult to answer. It\u2019s like asking, \u2018Who\u2019s your favorite child?\u2019 I\u2019ve been involved, in some manner, in developing every product. But if there\u2019s one product from the past that stands out, it\u2019s the Speedmaster watch that went to moon. I bought one, the same watch we sell today, which I have at home. I don\u2019t wear it much; I want to keep it. It\u2019s an iconic product.\u201dOmega prices\u201cThe average price for an Omega watch is $7,000. We\u2019ve moved up alot, but I don\u2019t think it will go much higher.\u201dOmega\u2019s Bond connection\u201cIn the current film, the watch is very prominent, and we\u2019re very happy. But we have little say in how the watch is used. The filmmakers come to us with their vision and we help them achieve it. We see what watch Daniel would like to wear. Pierce had his taste; Daniel has a different taste. But it always has been a Seamaster, and will always be a Seamaster.\u201dThe financial link between Omega and Bond\u201cIt\u2019s a unique business structure. We commit ourselves to invest \u2018X\u2019 amount of money on Omega ads with \u2018Spectre\u2019 a few weeks before and after the opening. We would be crazy not to do it. Every year we overshoot what we commit to do. It\u2019s all built on trust. There\u2019s no contract.\u201dWhether star branding pays off \u201cPeople ask me all time, does working with stars, does it pay? I can\u2019t answer that question. It\u2019s impossible. How do we know? But Bond? Easy. I can show a graph for eight films. It\u2019s a perfect chart. Every time it goes up when the promotion starts and comes down when the promotion stops. But the sales are always higher than they were before the film.\u201dOn China\u2019s anticorruption drive\u201cWhat the government is trying to do there is a positive thing. But gift giving is still there, though not for the same reasons. In China, when someone does you a favor, you give him something back. It\u2019s part of their way of life. People are buying watches with their own money today. Now what\u2019s been slowed there, and curtailed, has been nearly compensated for by normal consumption.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "How Clinton and Sanders Pursue Change, Academically Speaking", "Date": "2016-02-29", "News": "Supported byLetter From AmericaHow, actually, does the world change?As Hillary Clinton, the former secretary of state, and Senator Bernie Sanders compete for the Democratic presidential nomination, they have fleshed out not only rival policy platforms, but also rival theories of change: How to diagnose what needs changing, where to stand relative to the system you would change, and how to measure change.I asked some scholars for their help in distilling and distinguishing these theories of change.If you think the United States\u2019 ailments have multiple, intersecting, sometimes unrelated causes, Mrs. Clinton may be more your speed. If you believe those ailments can be traced to the root cause of money, Mr. Sanders may be a better fit.Ann Fabian, a historian at Rutgers, suggested that Mrs. Clinton is a fox and Mr. Sanders a hedgehog, a reference to the philosopher Isaiah Berlin\u2019s formulation about those \u201cwho pursue many ends\u201d (foxes) and those who \u201crelate everything to a single central vision\u201d (hedgehogs). \u201cWhich is why Sanders is the better campaigner right now,\u201d Professor Fabian added.For Peter Alexander Meyers, a professor of American studies at the Sorbonne Nouvelle in Paris, Mr. Sanders\u2019s focus on money is compelling because \u201cthe money in question is not one thing, or even a thing.\u201d\u201cIn America, in modernity, money is an entire and pervasive symbolic realm that infuses almost everything else.\u201dProf. Tiya Miles, a historian at the University of Michigan, admires both candidates but is more drawn to Mrs. Clinton\u2019s notion of multiple, intersecting \u201cbarriers,\u201d not all reducible to economics.\u201cThere is no single, stand-alone root for the problems that Americans face today,\u201d she said. \u201cFor example, American slavery was an exploitative economic system developed by the elite, but it depended on widespread ideologies of race and gender for its persistence and brutal effectiveness.\u201dIf you value a candidate\u2019s ability to work an existing system and are willing to overlook the compromises involved in belonging to it, Mrs. Clinton may suit you. If you most admire purity of purpose and are willing to overlook a lack of experience in dealing with the systems a candidate pledges to reform, Mr. Sanders could resonate more.The Berlin-based ethnographer Alexa Clay, who studied change agents in her book, \u201cThe Misfit Economy,\u201d talks about mainlands, islands and peninsulas.The mainland is where old power rules. On islands you can \u201cincubate alternative agendas,\u201d but it is hard to \u201cinfect and influence the system.\u201d A peninsula, though, \u201chas enough isolation to stand in integrity for something new, while maintaining influencing ties to the mainland.\u201d Ms. Clay framed the Sanders-Clinton race as a choice between the builder of an alternative power base on a peninsula and a mainland cultural maverick who knows how to \u201cgame the system.\u201dIf you value tangible legislative accomplishments most, Mrs. Clinton is perhaps your pick. If you would be willing to trade fewer such accomplishments for a shot at changing the terms of political debate for years to come, Mr. Sanders may be more appealing.\u201cMost of what Sanders preaches would be irrelevant during his hypothetical presidency because he couldn\u2019t get any of it approved by Congress,\u201d said Robert J. Gordon, an economist at Northwestern University.But Lily Geismer, a historian at Claremont McKenna College and the author of \u201cDon\u2019t Blame Us: Suburban Liberals and the Transformation of the Democratic Party,\u201d argued that not getting things done has sometimes been the prologue to getting a lot done.She cited the Republican Barry Goldwater\u2019s ideologically purist, failed 1964 presidential run. Mr. Goldwater has been called \u201cthe most consequential loser in American politics\u201d \u2014 because, in Professor Geismer\u2019s telling, he forged a new coalition (the young, suburbanites, libertarians, religious conservatives, business elites, Southern whites) and distilled a message about freedom. His party won five of the next six presidential contests.\u201cCampaigns, even more than presidencies, can have a long-term impact,\u201d Professor Geismer said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Who Gets the Blame for the Slowing Economy?", "Date": "2016-03-10", "News": "Supported byECONOMIC alarm bells are ringing: Financial markets have wilted. Forecasters have been slicing their projections for future growth. And some leading wise men \u2014 including the megabillionaire George Soros \u2014 are predicting a return to disastrous 2008 conditions. That\u2019s almost certainly an overly pessimistic view. But without a doubt, the leading global economies are in a major slowdown.Not evident is whether another recession looms. While current data suggests that modest growth continues in the United States, economists are notoriously bad at forecasting downturns. As The Economist noted, between 1999 and 2014, the International Monetary Fund, in its April forecasts, failed to predict every one of the 220 instances in which one of its members suffered negative annual growth in the next year. Even the Federal Reserve uncharacteristically recently described the outlook as \u201cunclear.\u201dWhat\u2019s unusual about today\u2019s raft of challenges is the extent to which governments around the world have added to the problems, rather than ameliorating them. Poor policy choices, like misguided spending priorities and too much austerity, have added to the drag on growth. Notably, failing to act at all has cut deeply into business and investor confidence, an important support mechanism for markets and consumers alike.Governments alone are not to blame; the reasons for the sagging economies are multifarious and jumbled, more de Kooning than Mondrian.For a start, global competition and weak productivity growth have held down wages in developed countries. That has depressed consumer spending, as have increased saving and growing income inequality, which has pushed more money into the hands of the rich, who are less likely to spend it.Lacking confidence and seeing weak demand, many businesses have held back on investing, and in the challenged energy sector, cuts are rampant. Meanwhile, the rise of capital-efficient businesses \u2014 from Amazon to Uber \u2014 means less spending on machinery and buildings.Well-intentioned efforts to avoid another financial crisis have put the banking system in a straitjacket, discouraging lending and reducing liquidity on trading desks, which has contributed mightily to market gyrations.In turn, weakening credit markets stir fears of corporate bankruptcies. While falling prices of oil and other commodities help industrialized countries, they signal not just rising supply but also disappointing demand.All that said, governments haven\u2019t done enough to help the situation \u2014 and have done a lot to exacerbate it. Closest to home, of course, is gridlock in Washington. Anti-deficit fervor has led to a meat-ax approach to spending cuts, under which nondefense discretionary outlays (which include key pro-growth areas like research and development and infrastructure) have fallen in real terms by nearly 20 percent over the past five years, at a time when they should be growing substantially.Meanwhile, Congress has not passed a comprehensive tax reform package in three decades, which has given clever experts room to develop loophole after loophole, particularly for multinational companies eager to cut their tax bills by sequestering profits overseas.Fueling still more fear among consumers and businessmen alike is the looming presidential election and the surprising strength of contenders like Donald J. Trump and Bernie Sanders, who promise unconventional, and potentially disruptive, changes if elected.Europe is in far worse shape. Bedeviled by a poorly constructed single currency system, the Continent has lurched from crisis to crisis as weaker countries like Greece fail to keep up with the German juggernaut.And while reforming our regulatory apparatus would be a welcome economic positive, that should be urgent business for Europe. Sclerotic labor laws in countries like France result in unyielding double-digit unemployment. In many European countries, regulatory red tape impedes new business start-ups. Germany\u2019s aggressive tilt toward renewable energy has raised costs enormously for its industrial sector.Meanwhile, key private sector actors are particularly fearful that central banks, which have kept growth alive by keeping interest rates near zero, have run out of ammunition, making the need for more robust fiscal policy even more urgent.Then there\u2019s China. Unlike their counterparts in developed countries, Chinese leaders aren\u2019t afraid to act; their problem is that they often don\u2019t seem to know what to do, particularly when it comes to managing financial markets.When Chinese stocks sagged, the authorities exhorted the citizenry to buy them up. As shares soared, they curtailed the ability to purchase shares on margin, causing prices to plummet. Similarly, beginning last August, China made a muddle of its effort to unpeg its currency from the strong dollar, leading to huge capital flight from the country ($159 billion in December alone).Most scary to China watchers is the country\u2019s fast rising debt. All these worries are exacerbated by the country\u2019s opacity; for example, almost no expert believes that China is growing at the nearly 7 percent rate that it claims.The past two recessions were caused largely by private actors: the risky lending of the mid-2000s and the dot-com bubble at the turn of the century.This time, if we fail to break out of the current stagnation \u2014 or worse, fall into global recession \u2014 the fault will lie with our leaders.Steven Rattner is a Wall Street executive and a contributing opinion writer.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "An American Olympian Prepares, on the Enemy\u2019s Turf", "Date": "2016-03-15", "News": "Supported byRIO DE JANEIRO \u2014 Courtney Thompson, a veteran setter on the United States women\u2019s national volleyball team, stepped from the side door of the stifling hot gym and into a cool ocean breeze. The beach was close enough that waves could be heard crashing onto the sand. Sugarloaf, the bullet-shape mountain with a cable car to the top, familiar from Rio postcards, loomed overhead.It was winter back home, but midsummer in Brazil. Thompson\u2019s American teammates were scattered around the globe, in at least six countries on three other continents, playing in the type of professional indoor volleyball leagues that do not exist in the United States.But Thompson was here playing in Superliga, which might be the best women\u2019s league of them all, where almost the entire Brazilian national squad was clustered onto a few powerhouse teams. The United States and Brazil are fierce rivals and favorites to win the gold medal at the Summer Olympics in Rio. And Thompson had infiltrated enemy territory, like a spy doing reconnaissance for the Americans, on a team from Rio de Janeiro.\u201cThat\u2019s what they tease me about,\u201d she said. \u201cThey\u2019re learning about me, too. I may take a few tips back, but that was not my intent.\u201dTeammates called out to her. In a few months, Thompson will be on the other side of the net, perhaps with a gold medal at stake. Until then, she was here to learn.Brazil\u2019s two Superligas \u2014 one for men and one for women \u2014 are among the top professional volleyball leagues in the world. In Brazil, indoor volleyball and beach volleyball trail only soccer in popularity. Superliga games are routinely on television, and top players of both sexes are nationally known and recognized.But only about half of Brazil\u2019s national men\u2019s team stays home to play in Superliga, unable to resist the bigger paydays and growing talent pools offered in places like Russia, Poland and Italy. And there is no Superliga men\u2019s team in Rio de Janeiro.But the women\u2019s Superliga, while facing similar competition for talent around the world, has managed to keep most of the top Brazilian women at home. Only a couple of team members ventured overseas this season. The rest played together, or often against one another, on Superliga teams like Osasco and Sesi, in S\u00e3o Paulo. The best team all season, and for most of the league\u2019s history, has been the one in Rio de Janeiro, now named Rexona-Ades after its current sponsor, a deodorant. While Brazil\u2019s final roster will not be named until summer, as many as four of the 12 players are expected to come from Rio\u2019s team. With Thompson, it is basically a global all-star team.\u201cWalking around the streets, it\u2019s very different than the U.S.,\u201d Thompson said. \u201cPeople will say: \u2018Hey, Courtney! You\u2019re the American! How\u2019s it going?\u2019 I sat down at a restaurant the other night and the guy across from me, a Brazilian guy, said: \u2018Courtney, good to see you. How\u2019s the season?\u2019 You don\u2019t get that ever in the U.S. And the level of play? I\u2019m playing with half their national team.\u201dThompson came to Rio not just to play in Superliga, but to learn from Bernardo Rezende, known as Bernardinho. A two-time Olympian as a setter in the 1980s, Bernardinho coached the Brazil national women\u2019s team for a decade and has coached the men\u2019s national team since 2001.As Brazil\u2019s economy and the value of its currency, the real, collapses, it is increasingly difficult to keep Superliga filled with the best Brazilians and to attract outsiders. Top players might make 400,000 reais (about $108,000) per season in Brazil, Bernardinho said, but could command 600,000 euros (roughly $665,000) in well-financed leagues in places like Turkey.The two members of Brazil\u2019s national team who played the season overseas (one in Russia, one in Turkey) were looking for money, Bernardinho said.\u201cIt\u2019s not about whether they are going to grow, technically speaking, or if it\u2019s a stronger league,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s about the comparison of currency. When foreign players come here, they know they won\u2019t be getting the best contract. They could be abroad and make more money. But they like to grow and increase their level of playing.\u201dThat is what attracted Thompson. She wanted to do anything she could to make the United States Olympic team again, and she thought Brazil and Bernardinho offered the best chance. Her American teammates were spread across the globe. Four played for the same team in Italy.Thompson liked the style of play in Brazil, which she had seen from the other side of the net. It is a bit like soccer, the \u201cbeautiful\u201d game, full of speed, skill and finesse but moving toward size and power.\u201cThey play fast,\u201d Thompson said of the Brazilians. \u201cThey know the game well. It\u2019s almost like a dance. It\u2019s very fluid. Their ball control is very good; their defense is good; they see the game well. They\u2019re not always the most physical \u2014 of course, their national team is \u2014 but as a whole, they\u2019re just smart. And you can tell that when you\u2019re playing with them.\u201dShe said that the Brazilians have at least one built-in advantage over the Americans \u2014 volleyball is part of the national consciousness.\u201cThey grow up around the game, it\u2019s so popular,\u201d Thompson said. \u201cWe play twice a week, and the men play twice a week, so four nights a week you see really high-level volleyball on television. That\u2019s the way to learn. You watch it; you go out and try to do it. It\u2019s like watching video \u2014 you just don\u2019t know it.\u201dStill, Superliga can feel far from big-time sports like soccer in Brazil and football, basketball and baseball in the United States. Practice is at an un-air-conditioned gym on a military base (with extraordinary views). Most team members ride bikes or walk to the games at the Tijuca Tennis Club, set deeply into one of central Rio\u2019s compact, leafy neighborhoods. The gymnasium there, with its high, arched ceiling and capacity of about 3,000, has the feel of an old college field house, with four rows of seats on three sides (20 reais, or about $5), plus 10 rows of concrete bleachers above them (15 reais).The matches are spirited, family-friendly affairs, with banners, T-shirt guns and a mascot. Banners and photos of each player hang on the wall over one end of the gym. But while game results make their way into newspapers and onto television, few members of the news media come to practices or games, and the league does not track results or statistics online. The team\u2019s website is a Facebook page \u2014 though one with more than 450,000 likes.The volleyball, however, is world class. The eight-team playoffs, which started last weekend, attract sellout crowds, and Rio usually moves at least some matches to nearby Maracan\u00e3zinho, an arena with a capacity of nearly 12,000, that will be the site of the Olympic volleyball tournament in August.The intensity ratchets up several notches, especially between teams loaded with Olympians.\u201cSuperliga has most of the best Brazilian players,\u201d said Rio\u2019s Gabriela Braga, known as Gabi, an outside hitter expected to star at the Olympics. \u201cThe playoffs get really, really hard, so we play at a great, high level, and a high physical level. It gets us in good shape for the Brazilian national team.\u201dThe women on the national team see Superliga as an advantage, and most are willing to give up more money for the chance to stay home, play in front of familiar faces and prepare for the Olympics in ways that the Americans cannot.\u201cPlayers want to come here because we\u2019ve won the last two Olympics, and people around the world wonder, What are they doing in Brazil that is so good?\u201d said the defensive specialist Fabiana Alvim, a two-time Olympic and eight-time Superliga champion in Rio who is known as Fabi. \u201cWe get enough money to compete. And the teams can play.\u201dThat is what attracted Thompson. When she arrived in the fall, it did not take her long to see what she had gotten into in Brazil.\u201cWe played at Osasco, our big rival, right before Christmas,\u201d she said of a match in the S\u00e3o Paulo suburbs. \u201cProbably one of the coolest opposing gyms I\u2019ve ever been to. It was packed when we walked in there, and you could hear booing before we got out of the locker room. It was fun, you know? I think everyone here is pretty passionate, in all walks of life. It\u2019s a really fun place to live and see their culture. But they aren\u2019t afraid to let you know they\u2019re not happy, those fans. I love it. But also, when you\u2019re doing well, it\u2019s the coolest thing you\u2019ve ever seen.\u201dThompson and the rest of her American Olympic teammates, wherever they are around the world, will come see for themselves in just a few months.Helena Rebello contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

Each of them was received for meetings, had confirmation hearings and got a vote, he said.\u201cEvery nominee, including Justice Kennedy \u2014 in an election year \u2014 got an up-or-down vote by the Senate,\u201d Mr. Biden said. \u201cNot much of the time. Not most of the time. Every single time.\u201dMr. Biden dismissed Republicans\u2019 claim of following a \u201cBiden rule\u201d as \u201cridiculous.\u201d He said Republicans had been \u201cquoting selectively\u201d from his speech, which he said primarily criticized the fact that Justice Clarence Thomas had been nominated without consultation with the Senate.\u201cI made it absolutely clear that I would go forward with the confirmation process as chairman, even a few months before the presidential elections, if the nominee were chosen with the advice and not just the consent of the Senate, as the Constitution requires,\u201d he said.Mr. Biden, who served in the Senate for 36 years, still has many friends on both sides of the aisle, his grinning, backslapping persona standing in contrast to Mr. Obama\u2019s more strained relations with lawmakers. But on Thursday, speaking at Georgetown University Law Center, not far from the Capitol, Mr. Biden shook his finger and raised his voice to broadcast frustration.Fourteen Republicans and all Democrats are needed to break a filibuster and confirm the nominee.His language, however, veered toward hyperbole. Mr. Biden said Senate Republicans were creating a \u201cgenuine constitutional crisis\u201d that threatened the nation\u2019s standing in the eyes of the world. It also risked fragmenting the country, he said.\u201cIf those conflicts are allowed to stand, we end up with a patchwork Constitution inconsistent with equal justice and the rule of law,\u201d he said. \u201cFederal laws \u2014 laws that apply to the whole country \u2014 will be constitutional in some parts of the country but unconstitutional in others.\u201dHe called out two of his former colleagues, Senators Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, and Charles E. Grassley of Iowa, chairman of the Judiciary Committee, in particular, laughing off their assertions that the Supreme Court could function temporarily with only eight justices.Don Stewart, Mr. McConnell\u2019s spokesman, dismissed the vice president\u2019s speech as \u201can attempt to clean up\u201d his past statements on the Supreme Court.Conservative groups criticized the speech as disingenuous, saying Mr. Biden was trying to rewrite history.\u201cVice President Biden is the absolute last person who should be lecturing Republicans about the Supreme Court,\u201d Brian Rogers, the executive director of America Rising Squared, a conservative research group, said in a statement. \u201cAfter all, the G.O.P. is following the \u2018Biden rule\u2019 he outlined in 1992, when he said the Senate should not consider Supreme Court nominations made during presidential election years.\u201dMr. Biden was unrestrained as he discussed the implications of the standoff. He said it hampered the nation\u2019s still-recovering economy.\u201cEven worse, a patchwork Constitution will deepen the gulf between the haves and have-nots,\u201d he said. \u201cUnder a system of laws \u2018national\u2019 in name only, the rich and powerful will manipulate geographical differences and game the system.\u201dCalling Congress \u201cbroken,\u201d Mr. Biden urged the Senate to vote on Judge Garland\u2019s nomination.\u201cDysfunction and partisanship are bad enough on Capitol Hill,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we can\u2019t let the Senate spread this dysfunction to the Supreme Court of the United States.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Possible N.J. Transit Train Strike Raises Anxiety Among Commuters", "Date": "2016-03-02", "News": "Supported byFaced with the possibility of a rail strike starting next weekend, New Jersey commuters are increasingly worried about a shutdown that could paralyze the region and send them scrambling to find a way into New York City.A closing could force hordes of commuters onto buses and roads that are already packed. Officials in New Jersey and New York City are working on contingency plans for the more than 150,000 people who use the railroad each weekday.\u201cNo one\u2019s goal is to have a strike here,\u201d he said. \u201cEverybody wants to try to work it out.\u201dBut Mr. Christie took a swipe at the rail unions before leaving the state to join Mr. Trump on the campaign trail on Tuesday, calling some of their demands \u201coutrageous.\u201d The governor emphasized that \u201cevery extra dollar I give them\u201d would come from taxpayers and commuter fares.David P. Redlawsk, a political science professor at Rutgers University, said it did not look good for the governor to be campaigning with Mr. Trump as anxieties rose over a possible strike and other pressing financial issues in the state.\u201cThe question in terms of the governor is to what extent is he laser-focused on what\u2019s going on in New Jersey,\u201d Professor Redlawsk said, \u201cand to what extent is he more focused on the dynamics of the presidential campaign, even though he\u2019s not in it.\u201dBut the contingency plans are not likely to accommodate all of the regular train riders and could worsen the already snarled traffic between the states. Senator Cory A. Booker of New Jersey, a Democrat, said the strike could be \u201ca complete catastrophe for New Jersey commuters and the regional economy.\u201dNew Jersey Transit officials said they would release details of an \u201calternative service plan\u201d on Thursday.In the event of a strike, the agency said it would add five park-and-ride locations throughout New Jersey.\u201cWe remain focused on reaching an affordable settlement with the unions for our customers,\u201d the agency\u2019s interim executive director, Dennis Martin, said in a statement.The agency plans to set up five park-and-ride locations where people can catch a bus to New York City or to ferry and PATH stops in New Jersey, according to a person familiar with the plans who was not authorized to discuss them publicly. The pickup locations, which would have free parking, include MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford and PNC Bank Arts Center in Holmdel.The agency\u2019s more than 4,200 rail workers have been working without a new contract since 2011. The dispute has centered on wages and health care costs. The unions have proposed wage increases of about 17 percent over six and a half years, and workers would contribute a portion of their pay, up to 2.5 percent, toward health coverage.New Jersey Transit officials have said the agency does not have the money to pay for higher wages, even as it spends on other priorities like new buses, said Stephen Burkert, a spokesman for the rail unions.\u201cThey say they can\u2019t afford it,\u201d Mr. Burkert said. \u201cDoes that mean we work for the rest of our careers without a raise?\u201dIn New York City, officials have been working with New Jersey Transit on the contingency plans for a strike. Wiley Norvell, a spokesman for Mayor Bill de Blasio, said the city was preparing to handle an extra 120 buses coming from New Jersey.Veronica Vanterpool, the executive director of the Tri-State Transportation Campaign, an advocacy group, called on Mr. Christie and state legislators to provide additional funding for New Jersey Transit. If there is a strike, telecommuting would not be tenable for most New Jersey residents, she said.\u201cIt\u2019s fine advice for those people that have that option,\u201d Ms. Vanterpool said, \u201cbut most employees do not have that option.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Push to Oust Maduro", "Date": "2016-03-02", "News": "Supported byEditorialAfter a coalition of opposition parties won control of Venezuela\u2019s National Assembly in December, some of its leaders expressed hope that they could work with the government of President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro to find solutions to the country\u2019s crippling economic problems. Nearly two months since the new Parliament was sworn in, that conciliatory spirit has vanished. There is now near universal agreement within the opposition movement that Mr. Maduro must be ousted.That has set the stage for a confrontation that could plunge the country into an even deeper crisis. The Venezuelan economy shrank by 5.7 percent last year as inflation reached a staggering 181 percent. There are worsening shortages of food and basic goods, as well as rampant crime.The opposition\u2019s desire to get rid of Mr. Maduro is understandable. He has arbitrarily locked up political opponents, created ludicrous conspiracy theories to explain his government\u2019s failures, and has made a tough economic landscape bleaker by picking fights with neighbors and failing to rein in hyperinflation.But there is no easy legal way of cutting short Mr. Maduro\u2019s term, which ends in 2019. All of the alternatives that opposition leaders are contemplating are fraught with risks and obstacles.The speaker of the Parliament, Henry Ramos Allup, favors amending the Constitution to cut the president\u2019s term to four years from six. Re-establishing presidential term limits \u2014 which were abolished by referendum under Mr. Maduro\u2019s predecessor, Hugo Ch\u00e1vez \u2014 would certainly be healthy. But it would be hard to justify carrying out that change retroactively when Mr. Maduro was elected for a six-year term.Henrique Capriles, a former presidential candidate, proposes holding a referendum that would give voters the option of calling for early presidential elections. To accomplish that, the opposition would need to collect four million signatures in a short period of time. The process would have to be organized by the National Electoral Council, which is run by officials from Mr. Maduro\u2019s party. In an apparent attempt to derail Mr. Capriles\u2019s effort, the government on Monday announced that he was under investigation for suspected financial mismanagement in the state of Miranda, where he serves as governor.Meanwhile, Mar\u00eda Corina Machado, another opposition leader, has argued that popular pressure could persuade Mr. Maduro to resign. But it seems unlikely that Mr. Maduro would cave to street protests.Opposition leaders said that they would announce a detailed strategy on Thursday, and they may even attempt to pursue two or all three approaches concurrently. There\u2019s a slim chance that this confrontation could be averted if multilateral organizations, including the Union of South American Nations, worked to broker a deal between the government and the opposition.Mr. Maduro should realize that his options will only get worse if he doesn\u2019t start working with the Parliament. Venezuelans are growing increasingly desperate, and they primarily fault him, with good reason.Correction: March 7, 2016An earlier version of this editorial incorrectly implied that presidential term limits were abolished by former President Hugo Ch\u00e1vez. They were abolished by referendum.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Reinventing Yourself: Stories From Our Readers", "Date": "2016-03-29", "News": "We asked our readers to tell us how they had reinvented themselves. As usual their stories did not disappoint. Here are a few of our favorites, from a woman traveling the country as a volunteer to the late-in-life rabbi to the 70-year-old yoga instructor. From Mailman to Teacher\u201cUpon retiring from a 30-year career as a humble mailman, I began volunteering in my granddaughters\u2019 school. I quickly found that I really, really liked working with kids, and I spent a year training with Americorps as a reading tutor for struggling students. This training has given me an encore career as a substitute special-education assistant in the public schools. It\u2019s joyful, very challenging and immensely satisfying, maybe even rejuvenating. Compared with my old days, as Bob Dylan says, \u2018I was so much older then, I\u2019m younger than that now.'\u201dFrank Robertson, SeattleThe Professional Volunteer\u201cAfter a 45-year career as an administrative assistant, most of that time as a single parent, I would have loved to retire, but without adequate financial resources, what could I do? It it was time to be creative.I received a call from friends saying they had found a a small college in Sitka, Alaska, where the administration welcomed volunteers, offering free room and board. I began to rethink retirement. After all, all I needed do was get there!It was a full calendar year before I was ready. In July, 2005, I retired.  Feeling like Joan of Arc, I drove out of my driveway on my way to Alaska and never looked back. I found that I was welcomed by any organization I approached to help, that college in Alaska, Heifer Ranch in Arkansas, Menaul School in New Mexico, a wildlife refuge in Florida, plus many others. I have traveled the entire country on a fixed income, getting out and giving back, always receiving more than I contribute, making many new friends in the process.\u201dThe Later-In-Life Rabbi\u201cAfter having a successful career as a screenwriter for 25 years, I decided to become a rabbi. I entered rabbinical school at age 54 and it took nine years for me to graduate. Today, at age 66 I am one of eight rabbis at Wilshire Boulevard Temple, the biggest and oldest synagogue in Los Angeles.\u201dThe Lawyer Who Became a Chaplain\u201cAfter 40 years working as an attorney, I retired from the law in 2014 to enter a six-month chaplaincy internship program at Brigham and Women\u2019s Hospital. This led to volunteering as a chaplain at Boston Medical Center for six months and then a six-month chaplaincy internship at Boston Medical Center. I was later hired by Boston Medical Center as a per diem chaplain to help out on the weekends and one day a week. The chaplaincy work is intense, typically comforting patients and families whose lives have changed dramatically and precipitously. As a 70-year-old, I feel incredibly fortunate to be able to engage the world in this way.\u201d The Financially Savvy Actress\u201cIn 2008, I graduated college with a degree in drama and boarded a plane to the Philippines as a cast member on the international tour of \u2018Cinderella,\u2019 the musical. While performing in Asia, however, the American economy was in the midst of a meltdown. So, by the start of 2009, I was back in New York City, a young, recently unemployed actress at the height of the financial crisis.I now use my love of theater and storytelling to teach young audiences how to leverage the powerful tools of personal finance and entrepreneurship to build a life on their own terms. The messages of change, progress and gratitude I receive in reply are more gratifying than any curtain call or on-stage bow I\u2019ve ever taken.\u201d  Back to School at 53\u201cAfter 14 years doing a combination of engineering, teaching English in China and social justice work, I decided to take stock of my life. I\u2019m now 53 years old and in my second year of graduate school studying for a master\u2019s degree in clinical mental health counseling. Reading articles, writing papers and engaging with my much-younger peers has invigorated my mind and energized my desire for my soon-to-be new vocation. While many of my peers are trekking to work, I\u2019m in my jeans and sneakers making my way to classes with plenty of caffeine and snacks as I plow through my coursework. Frankly, it\u2019s hardly work to me. Rather, it\u2019s just part of a journey of not only reinvention but rediscovery of who I am and what I care about. It\u2019s taken me nearly 30 years but I\u2019m getting there!\u201dThe 70-Year-Old Yoga InstructorI\u201d retired from a job with the state of N.Y. about 15 years ago. At the time, I had been practicing yoga for about 20 years. I was offered an opportunity to teach at a senior center in the area and agreed to do it. I based my classes on what my teachers had been teaching me over the years. About seven years ago, I began training to be a yoga teacher at the age of 70. That was very challenging for someone who had taken her last college course many years earlier. I was the oldest person in my class to complete the training. Today, I teach about five classes a week, some at my home where I have transformed my former dining room into a small studio.

{"Headline": "In New Economic Plan, China Bets That Hard Choices Can Be Avoided", "Date": "2016-03-05", "News": "Supported byBEIJING \u2014 As economic growth has fallen while debts and excess industrial output have risen, Chinese leaders have faced growing questions about whether they will carry out the painful policy surgery many experts say is needed to cut away the financial dead weight on the economy.The Chinese economy, Mr. Li said, is \u201chugely resilient and has enormous potential and ample room for growth.\u201dThose may have been reassuring words for workers worried about losing their jobs at failing mines, steel mills and industrial plants. Mr. Li said the government\u2019s policies could help create more than 10 million jobs in towns and cities this year, and more than 50 million by the end of 2020.But many economists and investors have become much less confident that China can manage such rates of unstinted growth without piling up more bad lending and misused capital.\u201cI think the 6.5 percent growth target is very challenging,\u201d Shen Jianguang, the Hong Kong-based chief Asia economist at Mizuho Securities Asia, said after hearing Mr. Li\u2019s plans. \u201cThey want to choose a path that maintains real growth now and defers tough times for later.\u201d\u201cAs the government report said, setting this target is also aimed at anchoring expectations and confidence,\u201d Tao Wang, the chief China economist for UBS in Hong Kong, said in emailed comments. \u201cWe think this ambitious growth target signals more policy easing.\u201dBut such financial easing implies more debt, at a time when many Western economists and policy makers are already worried that total leverage in the Chinese economy has far outstripped economic output. The increased debt may help the government achieve its target of 6.5 percent to 7 percent economic growth this year, but at the price of burdening banks with even more loans to struggling businesses, or even effectively insolvent ones. That policy may also water down leaders\u2019 promises to shut companies that are producing unwanted industrial goods.\u201cIn China we have a new saying: \u2018Reform running idle,\u2019\u00a0\u201d said Yao Yang, an economics professor at Peking University.\u201cWe talk of the reforms, but the reforms are never being implemented. That\u2019s the problem,\u201d Mr. Yao said. \u201cWe know that monetary expansion is not going to have a huge effect.\u201dIn his speech, Mr. Li appeared guarded about saying how any cuts would be administered. He did not specify how many workers could lose their jobs as part of the government\u2019s plan to close, merge or restructure mines and factories weighed down by excess capacity.The government will set aside $15.3 billion to support laid-off workers and hard-hit areas, he said. On Monday, a labor official estimated that 1.8 million workers in the steel and coal sectors would be laid off, around 15 percent of the work force in those industries.\u201cThey definitely are relatively cautious in those areas like how boldly we tackle excess capacity, because they still want to grow,\u201d said Louis Kuijs, the chief Asia economist for Oxford Economics, an independent research firm. \u201cWhat I am particularly worried about is the overcapacity is probably going to get worse before it gets better, given the timidity of the approach.\u201dTo a surprising extent, the economic vision unveiled by Mr. Li echoed policies in the United States, the European Union and Japan, all of which have depended heavily on their central banks to expand money supply and keep growth aloft. The International Monetary Fund and many independent economists have strongly called for the world to shift from this reliance on monetary policy.Of the Chinese government\u2019s plan, Mr. Kuijs said: \u201cThe wording is that we will have proactive fiscal policy and prudent monetary policy, but if you look at the numbers, it\u2019s actually the other way around.\u201dThe government\u2019s plan said the target for this year\u2019s fiscal deficit at the national level would rise to 3 percent, from a target of 2.3 percent last year. But by most estimates, the actual deficit last year was already over 3 percent.China\u2019s central bank, like the Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank, has been wary of carrying almost the entire burden for sustaining economic growth through monetary policy, and one of its officials even publicly suggested recently that the fiscal deficit could be safely pegged as high as 4 percent.China\u2019s central government has a fairly low debt by international standards; what are deeply indebted are the country\u2019s corporate sector and local governments. But the Ministry of Finance has nonetheless been reluctant to allow a large, persistent deficit to form, particularly as China may yet face very heavy costs to help banks with the costs of large loans to nearly insolvent state-owned enterprises.Since the global financial crisis, there have been many calls in the West for broadening value-added taxes to encompass financial services, which could encourage more orderly and systematic accounting for many transactions. But Lachlan Wolfers, the head of indirect taxes in China for KPMG, a global accounting and professional services firm, said he was not aware of any countries other than Argentina and Israel that had taken steps as specific as China\u2019s to tax financial services.Chris Buckley reported from Beijing, and Keith Bradsher from Hong Kong.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "25 Songs That Tell Us Where Music Is Going", "Date": "2016-03-10", "News": "By Nitsuh AbebeBy then, though, the song had become such an intense focus of discussion at the digital water cooler \u2014 to the point where it felt difficult to turn on a computer without someone\u2019s views about \u201cFormation\u201d and its various sociopolitical valences reaching out and grasping for your throat \u2014 that my not having heard it acquired some kind of political dimension. A decision had to be made. Either I needed to dutifully consume this object of conversation and develop an opinion about it or I needed to develop a defense of why I hadn\u2019t yet done so.The point being: Here, for a moment, was music that actively dragooned me into paying attention to it, based not primarily on sound, performance or composition, but on the rolling snowball of perspectives, close readings and ideological disputes accreting around it.It\u2019s songs that do this now; individual songs and mass opinion, working in tandem. This wasn\u2019t always the case. We\u2019ve spent the past century or so trying, in creaky and convulsive ways, to figure out what music is even for, and how we intend to use it. When and where will we listen to it? Will other people be there? Should people own music? Who should write it \u2014 the performers? What\u2019s a normal amount to release at once? How will we find out about it? Will there be pictures? Are you absolutely, definitely sure we have to pay money for it? For the moment, there\u2019s only one answer to these questions that seems to connect strangers in a truly monocultural way: We shall gather in huge, fawning riots around towering pop singles to trade politicized takes on them.It\u2019s not the worst thing. One of the great tricks of pop music is that no matter how much we like to imagine it\u2019s about musicians expressing themselves, it tends to be more useful as a way for listeners to figure out their own identities: Each song lets us try on a new way of being in the world. For a long while, the idea was that young people could use music to shape their style \u2014 their clothes, their haircuts, their sense of cool. Then came high-speed Internet and a touching enthusiasm for the idea of playlists: With so much of the world\u2019s music at our fingertips, we\u2019d express our intelligence and taste by playing D.J. and curator, sorting through songs to assemble our own reflections. That didn\u2019t last, either. Showing off your eclectic, handpicked treasures? This has become such a common online performance that there\u2019s no one left in the audience.So these days it\u2019s the song, and the scale of the event surrounding it. One song, one digestible thing, with millions of people standing in a circle around it, pointing and shouting and writing about it, conducting one gigantic online undergraduate seminar about it, metabolizing it on roughly the same level that cable-news debate shows metabolize a political speech. This is an ever-greater share of the public life of music. A song like \u201cFormation\u201d isn\u2019t set up as a story, or an interior monologue \u2014 it\u2019s set up as Beyonc\u00e9, the public celebrity whose biography you already know, addressing the world, like an op-ed with drums. Thus can we argue not about what the song says to us, but about what we think the rest of the world needs to be told, and whether Beyonc\u00e9 is telling it right. What do we make of her dancers\u2019 Black Panther styling? Is she \u201callowed\u201d to work with beloved artists from New Orleans or use references to the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina? How does the song sound through a feminist lens, through a queer lens, through an anticapitalist one? Can we have a conversation about her daughter\u2019s hair, and also about police violence? People talked about these things until, three days in, I\u2019d been quoted every last line of a song I still hadn\u2019t heard.How the pop star won us back with a disappearing act.By Mary H.K. ChoiThe second single from \u201cPurpose,\u201d Justin Bieber\u2019s fourth studio album, \u201cSorry\u201d is an infectious confection \u2014 a Dorito for your ears. There are two official videos for it: a dance video that stars a diverse cast of young women who seem to have been dressed by magpies let loose in a Delia\u2019s catalog; and a lyric video, which is sort of like that footage they use in karaoke bars, but slightly more polished. Between the two, there have been well over 1 billion views. At no point in either does the Canadian heartthrob appear. He simply doesn\u2019t need to.In previous years, by contrast, he was everywhere. He had transformed in the public eye from a teen-star brat to a grown-up brat, with the D.U.I. arrest to prove it. He had become a hollow hashtag of a person. When he visited the Anne Frank house, he wrote in the guest book that he sincerely hoped Frank would have been a \u201cBelieber.\u201d Not only did he come off like Joffrey Baratheon with a Hitler-youth haircut, his callow bad-boy affectation reeked of a keening need to be cool \u2014 anathema, as any teenager can tell you, to actually being cool. But the backlash to the backlash is here, and much like both videos, it has less to do with Bieber \u2014 the actual Bieber \u2014 than you\u2019d expect.Because get this: The most inspired part of Justin Bieber\u2019s reinvention is its erasure of all previously identifiable Bieberish elements. \u201cSorry\u201d is unlike anything Bieber has made in the past. It has been classified as \u201ctropical house\u201d and \u201cdancehall,\u201d but everyone seems to agree on one thing: It\u2019s a banger. The song is about a relationship Bieber has screwed up, and in the lead-in to the hook, he asks, \u201cIs it too late now to say sorry?/\u2019Cause I\u2019m missing more than just your body.\u201d But by the time the actual chorus arrives, Bieber lets the production take over: All you hear is a cooing arpeggio that feels like a gentle breeze on your brain. It\u2019s the best part of the song, and Bieber seems to appear in it only as a sample.This song is a triumph of music over narrative in the hellscape that is the pop music-industrial complex. Consider, for example, the confusing, protracted drama of Kanye West\u2019s latest album release, which involved a huge fashion show, several tweet storms and title changes all leading up to \u201cThe Life of Pablo,\u201d a record that\u2019s being finished in real time on a platform no one wants to pay for.So what is it, exactly, that we want from Bieber? Likability? Yes, Justin Bieber is a contrivance. Yes, Justin Bieber\u2019s lyrics are insipid \u2014 worse still, disingenuous. Yes, his tattoos stink. Yes, he\u2019s lousy at skateboarding. But what does any of this actually matter? In case you missed it, Bieber won. You used to hate him, and now it\u2019s pointless. So who\u2019s sorry now? \u2666Even if you can\u2019t score tickets, the cast album is its own transcendent experience.By Wesley MorrisThere\u2019s being locked out of heaven. Then there\u2019s being locked out of \u201cHamilton.\u201d And with all due respect to Bruno Mars (and God), being locked out of \u201cHamilton\u201d is crueller \u2014 as farce, but still. The musical is sold out \u2014 for, like, ever. And the resale market has achieved spit-take-level hilarity. To wit, this Craigslist ad: \u201cI bought tickets for the wrong night. These are legitimate \u2018Hamilton\u2019 tickets for Friday March 11, 8 p.m., purchased though Ticketmaster. I just want to get back what I paid for them. Great seats! $933.80 per ticket.\u201dBack on Earth, there\u2019s the cast album: a 46-number souvenir for an experience most of us won\u2019t be experiencing. At less than $20 on iTunes, however, where it has been in and out of the Top 10 for months, and Amazon, this is a more-than-adequate substitute for the budget-conscious. It\u2019s a gateway to obsession. To know someone who has this album is to know someone who needs a restraining order.This is to say that the cast recording is its own experience. In an age in which the album is notional \u2014 musical Tupperware \u2014 this one works as a complete concept and doubles as its own playlist, crammed with jams. There are King George\u2019s long-distance interludes, in which, under the mostly brown circumstances, white power sings the same, out-of-style song over and over and over. Meanwhile, the first five numbers alone \u2014 \u201cAlexander Hamilton\u201d; \u201cAaron Burr, Sir\u201d; \u201cMy Shot\u201d; \u201cThe Story of Tonight\u201d; and \u201cThe Schuyler Sisters\u201d \u2014 get halfway to a greatest-hits collection. Pilfered dabs of R.&B., show tunes, rock and rap recombine until identifying whatever you think you\u2019re hearing becomes its own sport.The rapping that Hamilton, played by Lin-Manuel Miranda, the show\u2019s creator, does at the start of the song sounds like some sweaty couplet from LL Cool J\u2019s \u201cI Need Love\u201d from 1987. The \u201cnos\u201d from the ensemble echo the \u201cwhoas\u201d and \u201cheys\u201d from Naughty by Nature\u2019s \u201cHip-Hop Hooray,\u201d from 1993. When Miranda gets to the chorus (\u201cLord, show me how to/Say no to this/I don\u2019t know how to/Say no to this/But my God, she looks so helpless/And her body\u2019s saying, \u2018hell, yes\u2019\u201d) handclaps and guitar licks gently join the percussion and bass line. And suddenly all I can hear is Champaign\u2019s 1981 love jam, \u201cHow \u2019Bout Us.\u201d Pairing those Greek-chorus \u201cnos\u201d with the ecstatic sounds of a harp as Hamilton and Mrs. Reynolds (presumably) do it generates moral tension. The bass line is where \u201cSay No to This\u201d gets both its erogenous nerve and antique heat. Your head spins as the song proceeds to combine sounds from a half-dozen old-school districts.The Karl Ove Knausgaard of grumpy independent musicians.By Sam Hockley-SmithMark Kozelek, who used to front an epically moody band called Red House Painters, is known as something of a jerk. Onstage, when not singing in a voice like crumbling granite, he says things that usually end up offending somebody: hipsters, women, journalists, the band on the next stage. But on the records he now releases as Sun Kil Moon, he examines his life with plain-spoken brutality, saving the most cutting remarks for himself.\u201cI Watched the Film the Song Remains the Same\u201d occupies more than 10 minutes of \u201cBenji,\u201d the album he released in 2014. It begins as the story of the first time Kozelek saw the Led Zeppelin concert film \u201cThe Song Remains the Same\u201d as a child; it ends as a song about nostalgia, chronic sadness and the way people drop in and out of your life. One moment Kozelek\u2019s admiring the electric piano on \u201cNo Quarter\u201d; the next, he\u2019s sharing memories of being a \u201cvery melancholic kid,\u201d or apologizing for the time he punched a classmate in school. The way he writes isn\u2019t so different from Karl Ove Knausgaard, also in his late 40s; both men spent long careers skirting the spotlight, then found new renown when they started excavating their own biographies for details.So on \u201cBenji,\u201d Kozelek sings about his relationship with his parents, about buying lampshades, about death. A second cousin\u2019s death sets him thinking about family; James Gandolfini\u2019s sets him thinking about his prostate troubles. He approaches each topic as if flipping through a disorganized photo album, and the more insular and lived-in the details, the more enthralling they seem. At the end of \u201cI Watched the Film ... ,\u201d he says he\u2019s headed to Santa Fe to visit a friend he hasn\u2019t seen in 15 years. Close Googlers can deduce that friend must be Ivo Watts-Russell, who signed Red House Painters to his 4AD label back in 1992; Kozelek, grave and grateful, says he\u2019s going to New Mexico just to say thank you. \u2666How to chart your own path in a post-label music industry.By Jenna WorthamWatch the virtual-reality film that accompanies this article by downloading NYT VR.The women in attendance seemed especially mesmerized by Sydney Bennett \u2014 better known as Syd tha Kyd \u2014 the frontwoman, whose Tiger Beat sex appeal gave her performance a depth charge. Bennett, 23, brown-skinned with a blond-tinged Mohawk, has the swayback stance of an adolescent skater and dresses like one too: On the \u201cKimmel\u201d set, she wore black vans, a black T-shirt and black jeans low on her hips. As she sang, she roamed across each quadrant of the small stage, staring deep into the throng, as if to find out whether her crush had bothered to make an appearance at the show. To create her stage presence, Bennett studied the R.&B. singer D\u2019Angelo, whose 2000 video for \u201cUntitled (How Does It Feel)\u201d features nothing but his extremely defined and extremely nude upper body dripping with sweat for four and a half minutes. It showed. Bennett flirted with the crowd, peeking at them through her heavily lashed eyes, shooting sly smiles at fans and gently lifting her chin to acknowledge those she knew \u2014 among them, her mom, Janel, and her godmother, Sheryl.The TV appearance was a rarity for the members of the Internet, who, as their name suggests, live online and work from home. Two of the band\u2019s three albums were created and recorded almost entirely at the house where Bennett lives with her parents in L.A.\u2019s Mid-City neighborhood. But their most recent record, last year\u2019s \u201cEgo Death,\u201d caught the attention of the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences, and it was nominated for a Grammy in the Best Urban Contemporary Album category. (Past nominees in the category include Frank Ocean, Rihanna and Beyonc\u00e9.) The \u201cKimmel\u201d performance was a dip into mainstream media that the Internet has largely succeeded without.The band\u2019s name itself hints at an irreversible and inevitable shift in the way music works. For decades, the music industry fancied itself an apparatus for tastemaking, but as technology has made labels\u2019 role less relevant, that has ceased to be the case. Listeners decide what\u2019s popular now, and record labels have to find a way to attach themselves to it. Aside from a few big-name acts, most artists are doomed to languish in relative obscurity with middling profits. This is usually seen as a tragedy \u2014 the death of a musical middle class \u2014 but it has also presented an opportunity for artists to avoid the suffocating effects of the label machine. And so the Internet has carved out an entirely new corner of R.&B., thanks mostly to Bennett: an androgyne who sings seductive incantations about falling in and out of love with women.After the performance, a small constellation of cousins, little sisters and girlfriends milled about, snacking on doughnuts in the greenroom and helping the band pack up. After the equipment was loaded into a caravan of modest sedans and S.U.V.s, the band stood in a circle behind the studio, and someone produced a celebratory blunt. As the smoke drifted overhead, the conversation turned to the next day.The group needed to practice for the first stop on their upcoming tour, which would start a few days later in Japan. Jameel Bruner, who plays the keyboard, wouldn\u2019t be able to come until he was done with his shift at Amoeba Music, where he works as a clerk. There was drama to discuss, too. The 17-year-old guitar player, Steve Lacy, had been photographed smoking weed, and someone had texted the picture to his mother, who was not happy. Despite the chilly El Ni\u00f1o air, the band lingered, seeming reluctant to leave and break the spell of the evening. They eventually agreed to regroup at their home base, Bennett\u2019s house, to make sandwiches, catch their performance on \u201cKimmel,\u201d smoke again and, eventually, crash.The new virtual-reality film from NYT VR takes you inside Sydney Bennett\u2019s home studio as the Internet prepares for a world tour. You\u2019ll experience the rehearsal process as Bennett teaches her band a new song, then get onstage with the band as they perform it for the first time.Turner may have been reacting to the banality of the question, but his answer also illuminated a changing dynamic for rap, which has historically been categorized by regional sounds. People Turner and Bennett\u2019s age are defined by a completely different geography, the social networks and websites they spend their time on. Odd Future was the epitome of this new statelessness: They were neither engineered by a label nor hometown heroes, but something wildly different.Odd Future dominated many conversations about pop culture and the future of music by the end of 2010. They had released all of their early work \u2014 a barrage of clever mixtapes, striking artwork and bizarro music videos \u2014 for free on Tumblr and YouTube. Their sound was prodigious. And not only was their music different but they also looked different too, a bunch of black weirdos who skated in their free time and moshed onstage.The frenzy surrounding Odd Future reached its peak in 2011: Cartoon Network gave the group their own television show; plans for an Odd Future retail shop were in the works. Labels were desperate to sign deals with the group, and Sony Music Entertainment succeeded. The crew had the upper hand and persuaded the label to give them their own imprint, and to award each member a cushy solo record deal. Bennett, the D.J., got one, too.Music came naturally to Bennett. Though her parents are 9-to-5 people \u2014 Janel is a city clerk and her father, Howard, owns a manufacturing company based in China \u2014 her uncle, Mikey Bennett, is a producer in Jamaica. (He co-wrote Shabba Ranks\u2019s 1993 hit \u201cMr. Loverman.\u201d) When she was young, the family took vacations to the island, and Bennett hung out in the studio and watched her uncle work. \u201cAt some point, I started listening to music a little differently,\u201d Bennett said. \u201cRather than being like, Yo, this is dope \u2014 who made this? it started being like, I wish I made this.\u201dWhen she was 16, her parents let her transform their guesthouse into a studio, where she worked on her own songs and recorded local musicians. In high school, she took music-technology classes and piano lessons; at night, she devoured beat-making tutorials and messed around with music software. She downloaded tracks from LimeWire (a file-sharing network like Napster) and remixed them using Pro Tools and GarageBand. She didn\u2019t need much capital to be a producer, just good Google skills and a wealth of persistence and patience.Bennett gravitated toward artists who had pioneered brand-new sounds: The sonic spaciness of Missy Elliott, the stanky soul of Erykah Badu and the acid jazz of Jamiroquai. Pharrell Williams, the original black skater weirdo, is her patron saint. And like most kids interested in music and living in Los Angeles in the mid-2000s, Bennett knew about a teenager named Tyler Okonma who called himself Tyler, the Creator. He had a sizable following on MySpace, where he released his music. \u201cHis production drew me in,\u201d she told me. \u201cIt didn\u2019t sound like what everyone was making \u2014 it was different and hot.\u201d Bennett noticed that one of the people at the top of his friend list was a kid named Matt Martin (who goes by Matt Martians). She browsed through his page, listening to the songs he posted, too. She admired his ability to create deeply complex soundscapes, and she eventually messaged him, seeking advice on ways to advance her own style.The two became friends, trading feedback on songs, which put her into Okonma\u2019s orbit. And when Okonma needed a place to record the early Odd Future mixtapes, Bennett offered up her home studio. She produced some of their early tracks and eventually became the group\u2019s D.J. In old footage of early Odd Future shows, Bennett plays songs from a laptop on a table at the back of the stage. Tomboyish, in a muscle tee and a short haircut, she crackles with the manic energy that Odd Future shows were famous for. She was generally indistinguishable from the boys in the group.From the beginning, Odd Future was meant to be a galaxy of loosely knit projects; the whole point was for the members to collaborate and spin off solo efforts. Christian Clancy, one of the group\u2019s managers, had also been a marketing executive at Interscope Records, and around 2011 he took notice of Bennett and Martin\u2019s tight friendship and encouraged them to start recording together. After all, they liked the same sounds: jazz, old-school slow jams, neo-soul. So they began experimenting, and these experiments would eventually lead to the formation of the Internet.Odd Future was a rare example of a viral sensation with lasting power; the music industry is rife with the ghosts of web talents who couldn\u2019t be repackaged as megastars. The terms of the Internet\u2019s deal with Sony \u201callowed us to shape ourselves,\u201d Bennett says. The band is artistically cocooned, trying to create, as she sees it, an entirely new style of R.&B., one that includes all types of desire. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t a conscious thing,\u201d she emphasizes. \u201cI just like women.\u201dBennett personally related to the themes that lent Okonma\u2019s music its emotional gravity: alienation, isolation, loneliness. She felt they shared a connection, one born of \u201cnot being a typical black kid or even a popular kid.\u201d But eventually the hypermasculinity and caustic sense of humor wore on Bennett, who is naturally low-key. She made tearful calls to her mother from the road, wondering aloud whether she should quit. Bennett also struggled with depression, worsened by the stress of touring and feeling disconnected from her family and her girlfriend at the time. She says that no one in the group \u2014 other than Martin \u2014 seemed to care. \u201cI couldn\u2019t talk to any of them about it,\u201d she says. \u201cWe weren\u2019t all that close, and they never seemed to want to hear it.\u201dNot long after, Bennett began training her little brother, Travis \u2014 who goes by Taco \u2014 to take her place as Odd Future\u2019s D.J. Her musical experiments with Martin had begun to congeal into the core of their first album, \u201cPurple Naked Ladies,\u201d an amorphous but promising collection of experimental jam sessions and fuzzed-out, vibey tracks. One morning while Odd Future was on tour, when the group was watching the sun crest over a beach in Australia, Bennett broke the news that she was leaving. She says it was not well received. It felt like a divorce, like a family \u2014 however dysfunctional \u2014 falling apart.\u201cThey weren\u2019t happy about it,\u201d she says. \u201cI was their get-out-of-jail-free card. It\u2019s easy to say they aren\u2019t homophobic because Syd is there.\u201dBennett\u2019s exit came at a time when gender norms were blurring. Artists now feel more emboldened to hint at sexual fluidity; it\u2019s edgy, if not outright trendy. Musicians like Wiz Khalifa and Jaden Smith have been photographed wearing skirts and dresses. Angel Haze and Shamir have said they\u2019re genderqueer. But being openly gay can still feel especially difficult in the world of hip-hop and R.&B., where artists who are suspected of being closeted can face harsher scrutiny. Lesbianism is often fetishized, made into a hypersexualized performance. While Young Thug can get away with wearing nail polish, female artists who give off an even slightly masculine air, like the rapper Dej Loaf, are hounded about their orientation.Minya Oh, the hip-hop journalist who goes by Miss Info, thinks Bennett has benefited from upheaval in the industry. \u201cI\u2019m sure that on some level of the major-label and old-establishment industry, there are execs and agents who think homosexuality is a liability,\u201d she says. On the other hand, she adds, \u201cthere are more and more handlers and mentors and facilitators who will see a new artist who is gay as either an opportunity to tap into a new market or, at worst, just a talking point.\u201d But even more important than all that, Oh says, is that artists like Bennett may not even have to pander to the mainstream anymore: \u201cAs fragmented as music audiences are these days, it would be difficult to alienate fans who are already bunched into nomad tribes.\u201dBennett\u2019s outward manner is so nonchalant and mellow it can start to seem like an affectation, but as soon as the words left my mouth, Bennett put down her forkful of pancake and slid me a sideways look, the kind you give someone when your patience is wearing thin but you still feel obligated to be polite.The Internet \u2014 the network \u2014 has a way of normalizing fringe ideas, marginalized identities and emerging artists that old media tends to ignore. It has done such a good job, you could argue, that people like Bennett \u2014 black, queer and weird \u2014 can exist without the burden of having to represent something larger. Bennett will never be something she\u2019s not. She\u2019s not looking for validation from record labels, or even really from audiences. Later that night, as thousands of Mexican teenagers rushed the stage, singing along in English and screaming her name, Bennett looked completely at home, and completely herself. \u2666A song as salve in an age of rancor.By George SaundersHow does a song work? What does it actually do? It doesn\u2019t instruct, exactly, or teach, necessarily. A song, I\u2019d say, causes the listener to assume a certain stance. Through some intersection of melody/lyrics/arrangement, it causes a shadow-being within us to get a certain expression on its face and fall into a certain posture. (Argent\u2019s \u201cHold Your Head Up,\u201d for example, would cause my 1970s teenage self to assume a, well, Thor-like posture: stoic, windswept, capable of enduring any hardship while, you know, holding my head up.)How does the song accomplish this? Was that the intention? I\u2019m not sure. Like much of Wilco\u2019s work, it\u2019s fundamentally a damned good popular song (simple chords, compelling melody), rendered symphonic by a process by which the song, seemingly rebelling against its own simplicity, seems to be seeking higher levels of emotionality via sonic complexity. This led me to assume the song had to be a result of weeks of arranging. But reportedly the band recorded it in one take, learning it from the songwriter Jeff Tweedy as the tape rolled. The song starts with a catchy eight-note guitar riff, to which it keeps returning, like a well-intentioned guy steering back to his mantra. Via inventive instrumental fills and a false ending (from which it rejuvenates with renewed purpose), it manages the strange task of seeming contemplative while escalating like crazy. It puts me in mind of a group of lifelong pals on a front porch, trying to musically solve some existential problem they can\u2019t quite articulate.The effect of all of this on the listener \u2014 this listener anyway \u2014 is transformative. Listening to \u201cOne Sunday Morning\u201d (every time) fixes me \u2014 like some sort of aural medicine. I feel a positive alteration in my body and mind: a renewed sense of humility at the sadness of the world, and a corresponding resolve to keep trying to be better; freshly reminded of the stakes of being alive, and of the fact that there are, at my disposal, more positive resources than I am currently employing. In this, \u201cOne Sunday Morning\u201d serves, for me, as a reliable 12-minute prayer. \u2666The radical act of ending an album in midsentence.By Jace ClaytonAt first, I thought my MP3 must have been corrupted. There\u2019s a springy, up-tempo beat that kicks off \u201c\u201906,\u201d the last track on Vince Staples\u2019s 2015 debut double album, \u201cSummertime \u201906,\u201d whose 20 songs are stark portrayals of a childhood caught between gangs and the police in Southern California. A lengthy instrumental stretch in \u201c\u201906\u201d gives the listener a break. When Staples appears with a fulsome \u201cGood mornin\u2019! Hope you had a good time last night\u201d and starts rapping, it\u2019s one of the most optimistic-sounding moments on the album. He\u2019s midway through the first verse (\u201cI\u2019m finna bring the gang in the buil\u2014\u201d) when the song cuts to a blast of loud static, followed by silence. The effect is so jarring that it can easily be mistaken for an error, a glitch in the stream.When I learned that this tear into white noise was intentional, I was shocked. This went beyond breaking the rules. \u201c\u201906\u201d plays an entirely different game than most music. Its words and sounds don\u2019t matter. What matters here is the rupture. The track uses white noise to depict a kind of death, yet it\u2019s also the sound of a channel being changed or a TV or radio shutting off: Someone is controlling this switch. A young man has been unexpectedly silenced. When it\u2019s over for him, it\u2019s over for the listener, too.His compressed rhymes sparkle with aphoristic detail. The opening lines of \u201cSummertime \u201906\u201d are \u201cHey, I\u2019m just a nigga until I fill my pockets/And then I\u2019m Mr. Nigga, they follow me while shoppin\u2019/I feel like Mick and Richards, they feel like Muddy Waters/So tell me what\u2019s the difference, so tell me what\u2019s the difference?/My momma was a Christian, Crip walkin\u2019 on blue-waters.\u201d The references multiply into serious depth. Yet before we have time to consider the Rolling Stones\u2019 relationship to the blues or how churches and gangs may offer similar types of belonging or anything else, Staples has raced ahead to end the verse with a punch: \u201cUber driver in the cockpit look like Jeffrey Dahmer/But he lookin\u2019 at me crazy when we pull up to the projects.\u201dThere are no radio-friendly singles here. Staples likes to call out things as they are, but he is not a stern moralist; if he were, he probably wouldn\u2019t have landed his gig as a brand ambassador for Sprite. (\u201cDifferent \u2019cause I\u2019m just like you\u201d he says in a recent national TV ad for the soft drink.) The preternaturally gifted rapper dresses in unflashy T-shirts and jeans. He\u2019s straight edge (no alcohol or drugs), a shrewd experimentalist with a complex politics.The song that precedes \u201d\u201906,\u201d \u201cLike It Is,\u201d clues us in to what the shocking signal crash might mean. Over a lurching, industrial beat, Staples explains: \u201cYou looking at a person, telling them that they story don\u2019t matter really no better than me/walkin\u2019 down the streets tryna shoot at somebody.\u201d To deny the validity of another person\u2019s story, he says, is to deny them life. And even when one can voice his or her mind freely, to be a successful black rapper is to perform your persona before a predominantly white audience, whose aggregate opinion determines your worth. This is a problem Staples continually addresses, whether discussing how one of his ambitions is to leave the rap game (and move on to more reliable ways of earning a living) during interviews, or in songs like \u201cLift Me Up\u201d: \u201cAll these white folks chanting when I asked \u2019em \u2018Where my niggas at?\u2019/Goin\u2019 crazy, got me goin\u2019 crazy, I can\u2019t get with that.\u201d Rapping about it only aggravates the paradox; those lines have been among the most quoted in reviews of his album, used to praise his self-awareness.Then comes the static.Staples knows that possibilities for mainstream black visibility are few and fraught. Black entertainers in the celebrity spotlight mark one extreme, the grainy videoclips of African-Americans dying at the hands of the police, whose name-recognition is always posthumous, another. How to speak against that? You can\u2019t. You can only unplug.\u201c\u201906\u201d adds to a growing body of work by black artists who flirt with disappearance in order to trouble the idea of representation itself. In \u201cConcerto in Black and Blue,\u201d David Hammons\u2019s 2002 piece for a series of pitch-black rooms in a large SoHo gallery, visitors were invited to explore with tiny blue flashlights. Their looking was the only thing to see. When the dancer-choreographer Storyboard P performs for video, he exploits the camera\u2019s two-dimensional limitations to create on-screen moves that appear simultaneously awkward and impossibly fluid. He dances as if he doesn\u2019t want to be captured, in gravity-defying bends and evasions \u2014 all escape, no center. The poet Claudia Rankine, in her 2004 book \u201cDon\u2019t Let Me Be Lonely,\u201d opens each section with an image of a TV showing static. \u201cThe years went by and people only died on television,\u201d she writes. \u201cIf they weren\u2019t Black, they were wearing black or were terminally ill.\u201dThe jagged conclusion of \u201c\u201906\u201d asks what it might mean to turn away from self-representation in sound. White noise is a spray of pitches and volumes that contains all audible frequencies. It is constant and patternless. Quite literally, it\u2019s the sound of undifferentiated possibility. One can think of Staples\u2019s provocative noise as the opposite of a stereotype, or freedom in sonic form. His signal fritzes into static with a snarl of hope: Noise and silence mark the edges of what can be considered music. To end an album like this points to a world beyond the song and to hands manipulating the transmission. What can be said outside the culture\u2019s limiting expectations, and who might we become if we learn to listen to it? \u2666A singular voice, aching with desperation and resolve.By Carlo Rotella Price usually drops down in pitch when she sings the second syllable of \u201cbottle,\u201d but sometimes she takes it up a bluesy interval instead, turning a honky-tonk lament into a call to arms. The two deliveries of the line play up countervailing qualities of desperation and resolve in her voice. Together they make it sound as if she\u2019s exerting considerable strength of character to keep despair and bad luck from carrying her song off the road and headlong into a telephone pole. This instantly detectable tension in her voice causes listeners to become alert, even alarmed, the moment she starts singing.\u201cHurtin\u2019 \u201c is the first single from Price\u2019s album \u201cMidwest Farmer\u2019s Daughter,\u201d which will be released by Jack White\u2019s Third Man Records on March 25. She\u2019s being rolled out with the fanfare appropriate to the next big thing out of Nashville, as the appearance on Colbert suggests, but she\u2019s not on country\u2019s standard ing\u00e9nue track. At 32, having weathered lean times and near misses, she\u2019s more of a hard-bitten classicist. Her album title evokes Loretta Lynn\u2019s \u201cCoal Miner\u2019s Daughter,\u201d and her diction, especially the way she chews on the word \u201cpain,\u201d raises echoes of Tammy Wynette; her mask of barroom bravado over tender vulnerability recalls Merle Haggard; and her band, the Price Tags, favors old-school arrangements, with Luke Schneider\u2019s pedal-steel guitar weaving prominently around her voice.As attention has built around Price, she has sometimes found herself placed in a cohort with Chris Stapleton, Sturgill Simpson and other scruffy dissenters who have recently made inroads into the dominion of the bro acts currently ruling Nashville\u2019s major labels and country radio. As the underground rocker-turned-\u201dcountry/garage\u201d producer Jonathan Bright has suggested, if current Nashville stars like Luke Bryan and Florida Georgia Line are the equivalent of M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce and other such glam-pop acts who dominated rock in the late 1980s, Price and company could be part of country\u2019s long-awaited back-to-basics riposte. Roots-music boosters are always announcing that the inevitable cyclical swing back to hard-country twang has begun, but listening to Price \u2014 or watching the growly, uncute Stapleton clean up at the Country Music Association Awards last November \u2014 you can begin to believe that maybe it\u2019s really happening.The songs on \u201cMidwest Farmer\u2019s Daughter\u201d mine the experience of further hard knocks. Her parents lost the family\u2019s corn-and-soybean farm in Buffalo Prairie, Ill., and her father went to work as a prison guard. Price endured a run of professional disappointment and personal sorrow after arriving in Nashville in 2003. With her husband, Jeremy Ivey, who plays bass in the Price Tags and writes songs with her, she tried her hand at rock and soul and made a brief, unhappy foray into writing commercial country music. Serially turned away, ripped off and let down by operators in the music industry, she grew used to selling her meager possessions to pick up and start over, waitressing, hoping for some luck. \u201cI can\u2019t count all the times I\u2019ve been had,\u201d she sings in \u201cThis Town Gets Around,\u201d her ode to the lecherous manager, fraudulent publicist and other Music Row animals who preyed upon her.Five years ago she gave birth to twin sons, one of whom died of a rare heart ailment two weeks later. She sank low after that and couldn\u2019t pull herself out of it. Drinking didn\u2019t help. \u201cIt just snowballed,\u201d she says. \u201cI felt as if I was cursed, some kind of running cosmic joke.\u201d A long weekend in the Davidson County jail after a drunken-driving incident persuaded her to get help and break the downward momentum. \u201cWeekender,\u201d a jail song on the album, is a good girl\u2019s rueful acknowledgment that the women in lockup are tougher and less fortunate than she is. \u201cThey were hard, and I was really scared,\u201d she says. \u201cThey could tell by your shoes that you were just a weekender.\u201dShe and Ivey sold their car to finance the recording of \u201cMidwest Farmer\u2019s Daughter\u201d at Sun Studio in Memphis. The album was rejected all over Nashville and eventually picked up by a label they didn\u2019t even consider approaching. Despite having a Nashville office, Third Man Records isn\u2019t widely known for producing country music (though Jack White produced a comeback album for Loretta Lynn in 2004). But Price\u2019s habit of putting vocal soul shadings into even the most straight-ahead country songs makes her an impure traditionalist, and therefore a surprisingly good fit for Third Man. Ben Swank, who runs the company with White and Ben Blackwell, says, \u201cWe\u2019re coming from a punk-rock, indie-rock background that discovered blues and American music in reverse,\u201d an aesthetic that tends to value emotional power over stylistic orthodoxy.Swank believes that Price\u2019s career travails might have fortuitously delayed her album just long enough to allow Third Man to take advantage of a new openness to \u201ca classical sound\u201d in country music. Another name for that sound is Americana: high-gloss corporate country\u2019s earthier foil and partner, which embraces not only folk traditions but also vintage commercial styles drawn magpie-fashion from bygone eras. Pointing in particular to the career of Stapleton \u2014 who went from writing pop-flavored radio fare for established stars to become a major-label juggernaut singing spare, bluesy songs in the outlaw country mold \u2014 Swank says: \u201cNow there are others who have knocked on the door. If she had come along two years earlier, maybe it\u201d \u2014 the next-big-thing buzz \u2014 \u201cwouldn\u2019t have happened.\u201dPrice\u2019s son, Judah, climbed on and off her lap as a stylist enlarged her blond hair. Friends and family were temporarily shooed away as she put on something tight and fringed. Foot traffic milled in and out of other dressing rooms along the hall, and from one came a furious burst of picking as a bluegrass band warmed up.Out on the main stage, Price sang her allotted two songs, ending with \u201cHurtin.\u2019 \u201c The band came to a full stop for her honky-tonk cadenza: \u201cThat don\u2019t touch . . . the paiiiinnnnn . . . you put . . . on . . . meeeeee,\u201d with a slow-rising two-note flourish on the final word. Robust applause followed, and then Mike Snider, the banjo player who serves as one of the Opry\u2019s chief traditionalist voices, said: \u201cGood job, Margo, you sweet little old thing. Good to have somebody come out here and sing country again.\u201d There was laughter, some knowing and some a little too hearty, in the crowd and among the house musicians onstage and the insiders thronging the wings. \u201cBy golly,\u201d Snider said, \u201cthat was stronger than new rope.\u201d \u2666The world\u2019s greatest session drummer confronts the machine age.By Jeff HimmelmanChamberlain, 48, is a session player paid by the project, a below-the-radar rock star who often shows up only in the liner notes. If you watched MTV in the \u201990s, you heard him drumming with Pearl Jam in their \u201cAlive\u201d video or with Fiona Apple or Tori Amos or the Wallflowers. He has appeared on records by everyone from Bruce Springsteen and David Bowie to Frank Ocean and Kanye West, toured with the Indigo Girls and Soundgarden, spent a season as the drummer for the \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d band. He played drums on the \u201cFrozen\u201d soundtrack for Disney. In a world of dwindling recording budgets and increased automation, he could well be the last one drumming before software takes over completely.At Blackbird Studio in Nashville, Urban told Chamberlain that he had \u201cJohn Cougar\u201d down on his acoustic guitar, but it felt too formulaic. He\u2019d been listening to the rapper Kendrick Lamar and wanted a groove that could not only propel the song but inspire an altogether new sound for it. Chamberlain assembled a drum loop \u2014 a small-scale mechanical repetition born more of hip-hop than country \u2014 and then played live drums over the loop, deepening the timbre and also providing accents and fills when the movement of the verses seemed to require it. Urban pronounced the whole package \u201csexy\u201d; in the sought-for moment of inspiration, he would put down his acoustic guitar in favor of an electric bass. Within a couple of hours, the drums-bass-and-voice opening and the entire vibe of the song were effectively complete. The catchy arrangement and on-the-nose country twang of the title and chorus eventually sent \u201cJohn Cougar\u201d to the second spot on Billboard\u2019s U.S. Country Airplay chart.This is the work of the modern session drummer, and it is why, when a major-label project needs drums, Chamberlain is often the first person producers call. When we met in Los Angeles in February, he posed his value proposition as a question: \u201cWhat can you add to a situation that\u2019s totally out of context but works?\u201d Chamberlain is good enough at playing his instruments \u2014 and at reading what producers and artists want \u2014 that they\u2019re willing to pay him well to make that kind of determination for them. And so he lives at an odd intersection, or perhaps a vanishing point; part virtuoso whose skills have never been more relevant, part John Henry figure, hammering away as music is increasingly composed and performed by machines.\u201cI do more and more work out of my studio because nobody has a budget anymore,\u201d he told me. \u201cThe Keith Urbans of the world can fly me to the studio because people still go to Walmart and buy country records.\u201d For the people who can\u2019t afford to fly him out, Chamberlain offers his services remotely from Van Nuys. He has a full recording studio set up: a control room stocked with vintage gear and a large soundproof tracking room where two drum kits sit miked and ready to go. There are drums everywhere, more than anybody should rightly own, stacked on top of each other and hanging from racks: multiple rock kits, a Brazilian pandeiro, Tibetan bells, a 40-gallon oil can rigged with a spring that Chamberlain pounded with evident joy and a built-in cupboard with 20 slots for different snares, each of which is filled. He has a vintage Ludwig Supraphonic (\u201cWhat John Bonham would have played\u201d), a 1930s Slingerland Radio King (\u201cFat and dead\u201d), a 1900s snare with a calfskin head. As he finished giving me a tour, he said: \u201cYou know sample libraries? These are the physical versions of the samples.\u201dWhen I stopped by, Chamberlain was tracking drums for a British singer named Hattie Webb. The first track had some programmed electronic drums already attached as a guide; Webb\u2019s producer had asked Chamberlain, via email, to \u201cbuild it, make it electronic-y with some acoustic elements.\u201d Chamberlain listened to the song twice, charting out its structure on a legal pad, and then he went into the tracking room, where he had a little setup that he called his \u201celectronic/analog kit\u201d \u2014 a small kick drum, a tiny snare that he had purpose-made for work like this and a cymbal with holes in it to sharpen the sound.He cued up the track and then, without any practice, played along with it, sounding so much like the programming that it was almost hard to believe it could be a live performance. And yet his playing also ebbed and flowed in ways that the programmed drums didn\u2019t, or couldn\u2019t. After that single immaculate take, Chamberlain returned to the control room, listened for about 30 seconds and said, \u201cThat sounds cool.\u201d He then set about making a drum loop to go along with the part he had just played. Within an hour or two, the track acquired shaker, tambourine and four flourish-filled runs on a full drum kit, just to give the production team some different options.Chamberlain is an elegant player; no movement is wasted. He plays with a traditional underhand grip, which is more often associated with jazz than rock. Sometimes, looking at him, you can\u2019t believe the range and sheer volume of sound he\u2019s producing. By 6:30 p.m., Chamberlain finished the second of the tracks Webb had sent to him and uploaded both to his Dropbox account to be accessed by the producers in England. Then he went home to make pasta with his wife.North Texas State (now the University of North Texas) accepted him into its music program on a scholarship, but he lasted less than a year. One of the percussion teachers threw a plastic piece of excrement at him while he was performing; another banged a gong in the middle of a piece and yelled, \u201cGo practice!\u201d It wasn\u2019t exactly the atmosphere he had imagined. \u201cI just wanted to play drums,\u201d he says. He didn\u2019t help matters by getting himself thrown out of his dorm for smoking pot. For a while he slept in his practice room with his head on the pillow in his kick drum.After he left school, Chamberlain moved to the Deep Ellum neighborhood of Dallas, about 40 miles away, where he played in several bands, often just for food or enough cash to put gas in his car. He eventually found himself living next door to Brad Houser, the bass player for Edie Brickell & New Bohemians, and after some problems with their original drummer during the recording of their first album, the band hired Chamberlain to tour with them. \u201cWhat I Am,\u201d the first single off \u201cShooting Rubberbands at the Stars,\u201d blew up so fast that his first major gig with the band outside Dallas was on \u201cSaturday Night Live.\u201d Chamberlain had just turned 21. He toured with Brickell for a couple of years and recorded a second record, \u201cGhost of a Dog,\u201d with the band, which broke up around the time Brickell married Paul Simon. (The band, without Chamberlain, has since reunited.)Chamberlain spent a summer touring with Pearl Jam, then returned to \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d as drummer for the house band \u2014 a job that for many musicians would be a career capper. TV gigs in general, and the \u201cS.N.L.\u201d gig in particular, offer the kind of steady, high-paying work that is pretty much impossible for musicians to find anywhere else. After a year, though, Chamberlain decided to move to Seattle. \u201cI had a whole house with a buddy of mine in a decent part of town, we could play music in it all day long and we each paid $250 rent,\u201d he told me, laughing. \u201cHow do you beat that?\u201dIn 1994, Chamberlain got a call from a little-known band called the Wallflowers, fronted by Bob Dylan\u2019s son Jakob. The band liked Chamberlain\u2019s drumming on \u201cGhost of a Dog\u201d and wondered if he\u2019d help them out in the studio. That work resulted in a single called \u201cOne Headlight\u201d that helped the band sell several million records. The Wallflowers\u2019 manager also represented a new and promising artist named Fiona Apple, and he asked if Chamberlain would play the drums for her too. Both albums \u201cdid really well,\u201d he told me, in characteristically understated fashion. \u201cSo that\u2019s kind of how you end up being a session musician. If you\u2019re not in a band, you\u2019re the guy who played on those records.\u201dChamberlain\u2019s network of producers and friends has continued to expand, and that\u2019s mostly how he gets his work. Over the last 15 years, he has played hundreds of sessions with some of music\u2019s biggest names, put out several side-project records and toured with Tori Amos and others whenever he could. A high-level studio musician in Los Angeles like Chamberlain can pull in as much as $2,000 for a day of work, though Chamberlain\u2019s rates fluctuate widely, depending on whom he\u2019s working with. He acknowledged that, with changes in the music business brought on by streaming and other technological innovations, \u201cthe herd is getting thinned\u201d in terms of the number of artists with sizable recording budgets. But demand for his services remains strong. In a poll to be published later this year, the readers of Modern Drummer have named him the best studio player in the business.Ryan Gruss, the Loop Loft\u2019s chief executive, showed me the sheet he had prepared for a previous session with the legendary drummer Omar Hakim, who has played for the likes of Michael Jackson, Madonna and Miles Davis. For Hakim, Gruss had typed out descriptions of beats and suggested tempos to go along with them, but there was no such list for Chamberlain. As an engineer got the kit sounding right in the control room, Chamberlain roamed over the drums and settled into a rhythm that Gruss liked. They set up a click track \u2014 a metronome that plays in Chamberlain\u2019s headphones \u2014 at the same tempo, then Chamberlain let loose for about five minutes, cycling through grooves, chorus feels, different patterns of the same basic beat.Over the next four hours, Chamberlain would roll through nine other grooves and five different setups, swapping out drums and cymbals in search of new sounds and textures. For one set of beats, he moved to the small \u201celectronic/analog kit\u201d and played it with Brazilian shakers instead of sticks. The 1900s snare with the calfskin head made an appearance and, somehow, sounded almost entirely synthetic and computerized, which Chamberlain hadn\u2019t anticipated. The Loop Loft team was happy just to sit back and watch, one of them muttering \u201cJesus\u201d under his breath whenever Chamberlain really let fly.\u201cI\u2019m a working musician,\u201d Chamberlain said to me at one point, with an emphasis on \u201cworking.\u201d Because he\u2019s not a songwriter or a member of a band, he doesn\u2019t get many residual checks or royalty payments \u2014 what musicians refer to as \u201cmailbox money.\u201d Even when times are good, he has to hustle. Sometimes he\u2019s in the studio with the Loop Loft; sometimes he\u2019s the guy Adele\u2019s producers call when she\u2019s writing in Los Angeles (for a track that didn\u2019t make her latest record); sometimes he\u2019s the guy the billionaire Paul Allen hires for a vanity rock project featuring, among other top-tier musicians, the Eagles guitarist Joe Walsh. (Sample song title: \u201cSix Strings From Hell.\u201d) Even on days off, Chamberlain goes into his studio and practices for a couple of hours.When the Loop Loft session was over, Chamberlain wandered in and out of the control room, packing up his gear for another recording stint with Keith Urban. This time the sessions would include the Welsh bassist Pino Palladino, one of the most respected players around. Instead of adding drums to a previously recorded track, Chamberlain would be playing live with Palladino in the studio. Chamberlain loves playing live above all else, for those moments when the music takes an inexplicable turn but somehow everybody stays together. No machine could match it. \u201cWith great musicians,\u201d he said, \u201cyou feel like you can\u2019t do anything wrong.\u201d \u2666A pop star claims a little time for herself.By Doreen St. F\u00e9lixMusical duets are usually ordered by heterosexual difference and its various dramas. As in: She gives, he takes. He pleads, she refuses. They may reconcile, but the performers always observe the classic sex distinction \u2014 making the circumstances of the female vocalist a good barometer for the circumstances of female speech in general.But Rihanna, pop\u2019s great maven of self-gratification, is a known loner, and she flouts that kind of reciprocal identity all the time. So it follows that even on her latest album\u2019s true duet, she would choose a vocal mirror, not a vocal foil. On \u201cConsideration,\u201d the first track on \u201cAnti,\u201d Rihanna and the genre-fluid singer SZA are two branches of the same river, braiding in and out. The women put on their respective versions of a placid attitude \u2014 Rihanna sings with cheek, SZA cheerlessly. Each is calm but, you suspect, coursing toward some possible furor. They sing into each other; their vocal registers match so closely that on first listen, you might even miss that Rihanna isn\u2019t singing by herself. The closeness approaches uncanny, suggests an erotics of the self. Rihanna\u2019s voice sinks into SZA\u2019s, which rises back into Rihanna\u2019s, the voices first crossing on these: \u201cWhy you ain\u2019t ever let me grow?/When I look outside my window/I can\u2019t get no peace of mind.\u201d If \u201dAnti\u201d has a thesis, it\u2019s this declaration of insolence.I almost used the usual expression \u2014 a \u201cdeclaration of independence.\u201d Then I remembered how secretive the two women sound, the complete disinterest the lyrics communicate. The way Rihanna likens herself to our most uncivil cultural child, Peter Pan: \u201cI came fluttering in from Neverland/Time can never stop me.\u201d I hear her indignation; I hear a clear defection from the typical girl-power conceit. \u201cConsideration\u201d could not care less about sounding like a feminist anthem in the proper way, one that telegraphs passive misandry in the service of forcing female communion. It\u2019s an anti-anthem, a song for the individual in a world full of cheap calls to solidarity \u2014 a misanthrope\u2019s chorus, built for people who would rather be alone, unseen and isolated from the work of being a girl. (\u201cWould you mind giving my reflection a break/from the pain it\u2019s feeling now?\u201d) Michael Jackson, long reviled for his identification with the boy Peter Pan, might have originated this kind of audacity, refusing to relate to society as much as society wanted to relate to him.Rihanna often returns to Barbados, the landmass that bore her. Like that island country, \u201cConsideration\u201d connects to nothing outside itself; it\u2019s a salve for those of us seeking mental and political quiet, an adult lullaby castigating the spectacle of public life. The song is haughtily against the \u201coutside\u201d; it invokes the private air of an enclosed room. I\u2019d like to stay inside, too, looking out the window, listening to the echo of my own voice. \u2666Riding a lo-fi sound to semifame.By John Wray\u201cI\u2019ll see discussions sometimes, on message boards online, about the sound I get from my guitar,\u201d Mac DeMarco said one overcast February afternoon as we drove around Far Rockaway, Queens. \u201cIt\u2019s kids, mostly, trying to figure it out: \u2018How does he get that freaky tone? What kind of pedals? What amp?\u2019\u201d He turned to me and grinned, showing the gap between his teeth. \u201cWhat they don\u2019t realize is that the guitar I\u2019ve played since I was 16 is a no-name piece of garbage that I bought at a pawnshop for about 30 bucks. It\u2019s got a loose neck, its pickup magnet is broken into tiny pieces and the pick guard is a piece of siding that I got from my Hasidic neighbor\u2019s house in Montreal.\u201d He laughed. \u201cFor a while there were bugs living in it. Actual bugs. It was cute.\u201dWe were driving along Rockaway Beach Boulevard in a borrowed car, because DeMarco\u2019s station wagon wouldn\u2019t start. At the owner\u2019s request, DeMarco was grading the CDs in the glove compartment with a pen: B+ for Morrissey, C- for Belle and Sebastian, an enthusiastic A+ for the Grateful Dead. \u201cMy life is stupid right now,\u201d he told me. \u201cI put a pair of my sneakers on eBay a while ago \u2014 partly to raise money for this girls\u2019 rock camp in Brooklyn, but mostly just as a joke \u2014 and some dude pushed the bidding up to 21 grand.\u201d He grinned again. \u201cIt turned out he didn\u2019t have the money, because he was, like, 13 years old. But that\u2019s still pretty sick.\u201dGiven the turn DeMarco\u2019s career has taken, his attitude of giddy disbelief makes perfect sense. In the course of four albums in as many years \u2014 \u201cRock and Roll Night Club,\u201d \u201c2,\u201d \u201cSalad Days\u201d and \u201cAnother One,\u201d all released by the pint-size Brooklyn label Captured Tracks \u2014 DeMarco has progressed from quasi squatter to bona fide indie-rock star, playing sold-out shows from New York to Los Angeles and basking in a degree of Internet fame that he finds hard to comprehend. In \u201cBacker,\u201d a bleakly hilarious clip, featuring none of his music whatsoever, DeMarco impersonates a depressed loser from Edmonton who guides cars into parking spots for a living. It has received around 400,000 views on YouTube. \u201cSalad Days,\u201d his 2014 breakout album, has been played more than five million times on YouTube, more than the Wu-Tang Clan album \u201cA Better Tomorrow,\u201d released the same year. DeMarco\u2019s brand of fame, however, is far from the rarefied, untouchable variety that stars like the RZA or Jack White enjoy: The more famous DeMarco gets, the more accessible he seems to become. \u201cKids think of me as a guy who\u2019d hang out with them and actually enjoy myself,\u201d he told me. \u201cAnd they\u2019re basically right.\u201dThe house he rents in Arverne, Queens, is an unprepossessing four-bedroom cottage in a lower-middle-class neighborhood, with cigarette butts peppering the lawn. When I rang his bell, he came to the door in boxers and a rumpled Hugo Boss T-shirt, greeted me with slightly bleary-eyed politeness, then led me past guitar cases and piles of laundry and a cluster of half-inflated party balloons to the kitchen, where Kiera McNally, his girlfriend of five years, was baking gluten-free banana bread. Over a cup of diner-style coffee \u2014 from an industrial steady-drip machine that DeMarco pointed out to me with pride \u2014 I asked what the repercussions of inviting hundreds of thousands of fans to his house had been.\u201cIt\u2019s cold outside now, so it isn\u2019t too bad,\u201d DeMarco said. \u201cRight after the EP came out, in August, we were averaging maybe 50 kids a day.\u201d He glanced toward McNally, who was diplomatically focusing on the banana bread. \u201cThe only thing that bugged me about it, personally, was the feeling I got that some of them hadn\u2019t even heard my music. I\u2019m basically a meme to a lot of these kids. It can get a bit weird.\u201dThe music DeMarco makes has been enthusiastically received by critics, but reviews of his albums can be frustrating to read: They tend to lean heavily on labels like \u201cslacker rock,\u201d \u201cchill wave\u201d and \u201cblue wave,\u201d to name only a few. \u201cWhat the hell does \u2018blue wave\u2019 even mean?\u201d DeMarco said. \u201cI have no idea.\u201dThe first song of his that I heard, \u201cBlue Boy,\u201d from \u201cSalad Days,\u201d is a bright, airy trifle, almost a lullaby, in which heartfelt advice to an insecure friend \u2014 \u201cNo use acting so tough/come down, sweetheart, and grow up\u201d \u2014 is subtly undercut by the ever-so-slightly camp vocals and even more so by the lead guitar, which seems to drift woozily in and out of tune. King Sunny Ade came to mind as I listened, as did Jerry Garcia, an acknowledged influence, but I found it nearly impossible to pin down the music I was hearing, or even to date it. Like many of DeMarco\u2019s best songs, \u201cBlue Boy\u201d sounds like the work of someone who spent his formative years combing through record-store bargain bins, carefully discarding anything that might conceivably be characterized as tasteful. It\u2019s an approach that has yielded dividends for musicians in the Internet age before \u2014 Washed Out comes to mind, as does Ariel Pink \u2014 but none of those artists\u2019 albums can claim five million YouTube plays.The family has musicians on both sides: a lyric soprano, a jazz saxophonist, an uncle who lives in London and sings standards. Agnes herself had a stint, as a teenager, singing at parties and weddings around Edmonton.At 16, Mac started recording songs in his room, by himself \u2014 the way he still records all his music \u2014 and playing in a band called Belgium with two friends from high school, Alec Meen and Peter Sagar. \u201cWe were trying to sound melodic and indie, like Pavement or Dinosaur Jr., even though all I knew how to play were Jeff Beck-style blues riffs,\u201d he told me. \u201cThey kept the band going after I moved to Vancouver, which was fine with me; it was pretty much their thing, anyway. I always hated the name Belgium.\u201dIn Vancouver, where he lived for a time in the boiler room of a printmaking studio for 200 Canadian dollars a month, DeMarco continued recording songs, posting them on Myspace under the name Makeout Videotape. \u201cThe first time you\u2019re out somewhere and some guy comes up to you and says: \u2018I heard that song you put up online. Pretty cool,\u2019 it\u2019s the weirdest thing,\u201d he told me, shaking his head. \u201cI got to be part of a scene that had started around this club called the Emergency Room, with bands who were already touring in the U.S. They were all these great, noisy, lo-fi bands, and I halfway fit in, mainly because I had no idea how to record. But I was trying to write Beatles songs the whole time.\u201dWhile performing at a music festival in Calgary, DeMarco reconnected with McNally, whom he knew in high school, and within the year they moved to Montreal together. \u201cWe had a hard time in Montreal,\u201d he told me. \u201cI worked the night shift at this cheap grocery store called Segal\u2019s, a 50-cents-for-a-wheel-of-brie kind of place.\u201d The job at Segal\u2019s, joyless though it was, provided a pivotal ingredient in his evolving aesthetic: a daily dose of schmaltzy classic rock. \u201cHearing that kind of music all the time \u2014 Dire Straits, Toto, Van Halen \u2014 it affected me,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can either embrace that stuff or let it drive you insane.\u201d He paused for a moment. \u201cTo tell you the truth, I\u2019m not a big Dire Straits fan, even now. But I found something in those songs that I could use.\u201dAfter a barely perceptible hesitation, he played the songs gently, sincerely and with a devotion and skill that were never entirely obscured by the grin on his face or the jokes he cracked. (\u201cA D.U.I.? I don\u2019t think so. I take a helicopter to work. I\u2019m Billy Joel!\u201d) Before his third and final song \u2014 \u201cStill Together,\u201d the closing track on \u201c2\u201d \u2014 he brought McNally out onstage to join him, beaming like a schoolboy, and kissed her lovingly but chastely on the cheek. I was reminded, watching them together, of something DeMarco told me on our drive. \u201cGrowing up in Edmonton, the horizon is so far away, you don\u2019t even realize it\u2019s there,\u201d he said. \u201cThis might all be over in six months, but there\u2019s nothing wrong with my life now. Not a thing.\u201d He nodded to himself for a moment. \u201cThe only thing I\u2019ve got to do is fix my car.\u201d \u2666Let\u2019s get it on. Or not.By Jia TolentinoCharlie Puth\u2019s brand is blandness: he\u2019s a pop star for the age of sponsored content. A fresh-faced, vanilla-flavored, Berklee-trained 24-year-old, Puth landed three singles on Top 40 radio in the year before he released his 2016 debut album, \u201cNine Track Mind.\u201d His style is marked by retro aesthetics and an almost haunting level of glibness, as encapsulated by his first single, the recent radio smash \u201cMarvin Gaye.\u201dYou may think you\u2019ve never heard \u201cMarvin Gaye,\u201d but it\u2019s possible you just haven\u2019t listened to it. It\u2019s a song that tends to register via alternate senses, a clamminess on the nape of your neck or a cloying taste, like children\u2019s cough syrup, in the back of your mouth. The platinum-selling doo-wop duet features the artist Meghan Trainor (who, like Puth, has thus far used her considerable songwriting talent to create songs so depthless they feel like waxworks).It\u2019s a song about sex that induces not lust but a feeling of desolation. \u201cLet\u2019s Marvin Gaye and get it on,\u201d sing Puth and Trainor brightly. \u201cYou got that healing that I want. Just like they say it in the song: until the dawn, let\u2019s Marvin Gaye and get it on.\u201dThe chorus feels like a bouncy castle inflated with hot air and ghosts, but in a technical sense, it\u2019s perfect. Its phrasing follows the classic AABA doo-wop format, and its four-chord progression (I, vi, IV, V) is emblematic of the genre: These are the ice-cream chords of \u201cHeart and Soul,\u201d \u201cBlue Moon\u201d and \u201cPlease Mr. Postman.\u201d Tweaked, the same progression can take on depth and winsomeness \u2014 with a 7th thrown in, you get \u201cUnchained Melody\u201d and with a 9th, \u201cEvery Breath You Take.\u201d But with the exception of a verse that has Trainor singing over a beat Puth describes (inaccurately) as a \u201chard-ass distorted 808\u201d drum machine, the track replicates the late \u201950s with unimaginative servility. Sonically, it lives a decade and a half before the song it\u2019s referencing; Marvin Gaye released \u201cLet\u2019s Get It On\u201d in 1973.In 1965, Gaye recalled to his biographer, he was listening to one of his songs playing on the radio when it was interrupted by a news bulletin about the riots in Watts. \u201cWith the world exploding around me, how am I supposed to keep singing love songs?\u201d No such scruples trouble Puth, who wrote his track as a \u201cmusical icebreaker,\u201d he told Billboard. \u201cIf you hear it on the radio or at a bar, it\u2019s a way to say: \u2018Hey! Let\u2019s Marvin Gaye and get it on.\u2019\u201d And so \u201cMarvin Gaye\u201d got its new use and meaning as a pickup line, dreamed up by an artist whose means is glibness and end is comfort, who can\u2019t imagine the fight that Gaye\u2019s love was built on, who sings about sex as if it\u2019s his due rather than a port of call in a storm. \u2666Who gets to say how black people see themselves?By Marlon James \u201cButterfly\u201d arrived at an unprecedented moment in pop. Black artists, as they conquered the mainstream, were getting even blacker. Kanye might have gotten there first (at least he probably thinks so) with \u201cNew Slaves\u201d and \u201cBlack Skinhead,\u201d and now even Beyonc\u00e9 is place-checking New Orleans and image-checking the Black Panthers. But Kanye was still speaking to the white gaze, the hatred and desire in it, and taking revenge by getting all black-sex-machine on somebody\u2019s white wife. \u201cButterfly\u201d is instead Toni Morrison circa \u201cSula\u201d: not looking outside for either validation or opposition. Black love, black empowerment, black history and black wisdom are explored so deeply and intelligently that you assume that conservative media fetish, black-on-black crime, will never show up. But then, in the third verse of \u201cThe Blacker the Berry,\u201d when Kendrick is waxing lyrical on Trayvon Martin\u2019s death, it does. All of a sudden \u201cBlacker\u201d becomes a song about black accountability while black men are being murdered and the implausible logic of slamming two ideas into the same thought. I was right there with him until that third verse.You can\u2019t be a hip-hop head and not be hit by \u201cThe Blacker the Berry.\u201d It brings the boom-bap from the get-go, dropping funk on the one, like an update of the drum break that opens NWA\u2019s album \u201cStraight Outta Compton.\u201d And even though I was tired of people\u2019s mapping anger onto blackness, Lamar\u2019s detonation of rage and wit was (and is) unmatched in hip-hop. He grabs at stereotypes as if they\u2019re slipping out of his fingers (\u201cMy hair is nappy,\u201d he says. \u201cMy nose is round and wide\u201d) and throws them right back at whoever would deploy them. He\u2019s not even rapping so much as spitting fire, jumping on a line, retracing it, firing it back at you, like the boxer Jack Johnson when he said: \u201cI\u2019m black, they never let me forget it. I\u2019m black, all right, I\u2019ll never let them forget it.\u201d Kendrick fuels his \u201cI\u2019m black\u201d with the knowledge that ain\u2019t a damn thing changed. He leaves it to the Jamaican DJ Assassin to bring backup in the chorus, drawing the line from plantation to street corner and the switch in who controls black self-determination, from the \u201cwhips left scars \u2019pon me back\u201d to the \u201cthe big whip parked \u2019pon the block.\u201dThe last couplet on the second verse echoes the first, with a crucial change: \u201cYou sabotage my community, makin\u2019 a killin\u2019/you made me a killer,\u201d turns into, \u201cHow can I tell you I\u2019m making a killin\u2019?/You made me a killer\u201d \u2014 and the different spin on \u201ckilling\u201d weighs a ton. In the first instance, exploitation and indifference make him a killer. In the second, his success comes from America\u2019s obsession with his assuming he looks like one. It was almost unbearable to anticipate what this prophet of rage was going to drop next.And then he dropped it.I could feel the verse pulling away from me as soon as he got halfway into it. It turned into call-and-response, me and this third verse, which went a little something like this:\u201cIt\u2019s funny how Zulu and Xhosa might go to war. ...Remind me of these Compton Crip gangs that live next door.\u201dMe: Hold up, K-dot, what is this you\u2019re dropping? No, dude, those are two nations going to war. And fine, war is hell, but if Britain and France aren\u2019t called thugs for Waterloo, if Lancaster and York aren\u2019t called bangers despite literally being family killing family, then why do Zulu vs. Xhosa get compared to gang warfare? Because it weakened them both in the face of the real enemy? Either all war is hell, or all war is thuggery. I\u2019m fine with either, but not with a special distinction when Africans do it.Kendrick continues:\u201cSo don\u2019t matter how much I say I like to preach with the PanthersOr tell Georgia State \u2018Marcus Garvey got all the answers\u2019Or try to celebrate February like it\u2019s my B-DayOr eat watermelon, chicken and Kool-Aid on weekdaysOr jump high enough to get Michael Jordan endorsementsOr watch BET cause urban support is importantSo why did I weep when Trayvon Martin was in the streetWhen gangbanging make me kill a nigga blacker than me?Hypocrite!\u201dMe: No, brother, no! Here was a black man invoking the detestable slogan of black-on-black crime to prevent himself from mourning the unjustifiable homicide of a black boy by a Neighborhood Watch vigilante. All I could think was: Where the hell was Kendrick going?\u201cWhat happened to [Michael Brown] should\u2019ve never happened,\u201d he said. \u201cNever. But when we don\u2019t have respect for ourselves, how do we expect them to respect us? It starts from within. Don\u2019t start with just a rally, don\u2019t start from looting. It starts from within.\u201dKendrick wasn\u2019t the first, and he won\u2019t be the last, to make the statement that black deaths are in some way blacks\u2019 fault and that black lives might be a matter of personal responsibility, right down to clothing choice. The idea that a sudden dose of self-respect is part of what is needed to stop the police from killing us is not only ludicrous \u2014 Amadou Diallo wasn\u2019t a gangbanger, but he was shot at 41 times anyway; I think we can assume that the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. had it all right within, but that didn\u2019t protect him from being brutalized by all sorts of authority, nor did his dressing impeccably prevent him from arrest \u2014 it is also old. It\u2019s a belief that the black person has a role to play in the erasure of hate toward herself. That kind of thinking almost suggests that racism makes sense.But racism makes no sense. It is perverse and aberrant yet such a constituent part of the American make up, so normalized in all its forms, that it\u2019s no surprise that the black person would scramble for answers as to why it exists. And in scrambling for answers, you look everywhere, even within: Did I do something to bring this on? Was a part of this outcome in even the slightest way my fault?Fact is, black people have always believed in respectability politics. It\u2019s also at the core of the non-American black\u2019s perspective on race, and I should know, because as a non-American black, I\u2019ve traded in that belief for years. It\u2019s particularly acute with us Jamaicans. Our stories are everywhere: How despite racism, or rather the black American\u2019s self-destructive perception of it, we worked hard to excel and gain respect. We achieved. Everybody knows how hard we Jamaicans work. That\u2019s why I have that job and you, black American, do not. Maybe you should stop whining about your troubles and own up to your laziness. Maybe if you do what I did, you would be manager of that Chase branch on the corner, just like me.Bootstrappism is the chocolate echo of white racism. You can find it in black self-help and how-I-became-a-millionaire books. Prince with \u201cAmerica,\u201d Ice Cube with \u201cLook Who\u2019s Burning.\u201d Lauryn Hill berating black girls who get hair weaves to look like Europeans. Nearly every time Steve Harvey addresses black people. President Barack Obama telling Morehouse College students at their 2013 commencement that there\u2019s \u201cno time for excuses,\u201d a lesson that the fact of their existence proved they didn\u2019t need. It\u2019s a road that leads to the granddaddy of the bootstrap, Bill Cosby, who declared in a 2004 speech that black kids were being shot because they were going around stealing Coca-Cola and poundcake.But Kendrick\u2019s conclusion is far more sophisticated than anything Cosby has ever said. In fact, it\u2019s not a conclusion at all. It was Kendrick doing what he does better than anybody else: complicating a discussion at exactly the point where everybody, including me, tries to simplify it. And this is what he was aiming for all along, questioning what even many black people would never dare question, arguing that yes, every argument, even this one, has two sides. More sides. Adding layers we might need but don\u2019t want. And that\u2019s what he did next, not on wax, but on MTV.\u201cKnow who I am first,\u201d he said. And then he said more than that:\u201cWhen I say, \u2018Gangbanging made me kill a nigga blacker than me,\u2019 this is my life that I\u2019m talking about. I\u2019m not saying you; you might not even be from the streets. I\u2019m not speaking to the community, I\u2019m not speaking of the community,\u201d he continued. \u201cI am the community.\u201dFast-forward to near the end of 2015, and I\u2019m on a flight to New York. Thirty thousand feet above everything, I put on \u201cButterfly,\u201d and something that never happened before happens. This incredible clarity, as if I\u2019d been listening to the soul brother all year but only now was finally hearing him. And then I got to that song, No. 13, the sticking point, the one reason I hadn\u2019t been able to join the best-of-the-year showering of praise, and I realized something that felt sudden yet inevitable. That this song, with its booming beat, the loudest on the record, that seemed to herald it as some global political statement, was in fact Kendrick\u2019s most deeply personal. Almost implosive. That the moment wasn\u2019t about we at all, it just sounded that way. It\u2019s his most \u201cI\u201d moment, reflecting a reality that I couldn\u2019t possibly connect to, only witness and try to understand. It\u2019s as personal as Ice Cube\u2019s \u201cDead Homiez.\u201d He\u2019s not speaking to the community or for the community. He\u2019s speaking for himself or, rather, a version of himself. The smarter me looked in the mirror and asked: \u201cWell, who\u2019s the one playing representational politics here? Who is the one expecting the black man to be Everyman, black man to reflect the universal good will, or at the very least a carefully curated black rage directed at a carefully identified target?\u201dHip-hop has always been about spinning clever fictions, doing what great narratives do: inventing stories that tell the real truth. But post-Biggie and Tupac, it\u2019s so easy to fall hard for hip-hop\u2019s insistence on keeping it real that I\u2019m surprised how easily I still fall for it, thinking that \u201cButterfly\u201d is either confessional or reportage, when it\u2019s neither. We do this over and over, judging artists of color based on a warped idea that legitimacy can come only from experience. You would think I would know better, given that as a novelist, I deal with the same assumption in nearly every interview. One journalist even congratulated me for escaping the ghetto through \u201cthe power of the pen and not the gun.\u201dMy last novel was about Jamaican gang members manipulated by politicians into an attempt on Bob Marley\u2019s life. Young men, murderers before 15, murdered before 18. Nearly everybody assumed that I had experienced some of this. In fact, the first time I heard a live gunshot was watching Martin McDonagh\u2019s play \u201cA Behanding in Spokane.\u201d And once each interviewer was convinced that there was no blood on my hands, then came the skepticism, the disbelief, the doubting: By what authority was I telling these stories? As if knowledge, talent and imagination weren\u2019t enough for a writer of color to make art; as if a work of art can\u2019t be personal and fictitious at the same time, invented and meaningful.And here I was doing the same thing to Kendrick. He was just a man wondering how someone gets to be part of the Black Lives Matter conversation when black lives don\u2019t matter to him. How someone can feel rage at murder while being fine with suicide. He was exploring these themes as concepts \u2014 you know, that thing that artists do. He was posing tricky, difficult questions, for which there were no answers, getting into the middle of his song, feeling it, breathing it, but still inventing. I wonder how much of what I thought my problem was with \u201cThe Blacker the Berry\u201d stemmed from me doing what is still being done to me: Questioning the black gaze, assuming that it must have sprung from something other than the storyteller\u2019s gift. That it must be autobiography or documentary. I\u2019ve never listened to Radiohead\u2019s \u201cA Wolf at the Door\u201d and wondered if Thom Yorke ever paid ransom money for his kidnapped children. Or thought Johnny Cash ever murdered anybody or knew anyone who did. Just like those songs, \u201cThe Blacker the Berry\u201d is several things at once, but mostly, at its essence, it\u2019s just that thing we call art. \u2666Rap and politics, inseparable as ever.By Bijan StephenRap is rooted as much in place and time as it is in rhythm and bass; it\u2019s hyperlocal and organic, if not always cage-free. (Free Max B!) You can tell a song\u2019s provenance from its sound; you can hear what was happening when the record was pressed. A cultural ferment, frozen in amber.Killer Mike & El-P, a.k.a. Run the Jewels, continue to push boundaries with their latest music video. Watch it in virtual reality. Download our NYT VR app.Earlier on the album, on \u201cClose Your Eyes,\u201d Killer Mike, El-P and Zack de la Rocha \u2014 former frontman of Rage Against the Machine \u2014 rap about a prison riot. Listening makes the blood rush to your cheeks, your heartbeat pulse behind your eyes. The value of the album is held between those two songs: It captures the variegated sides of black life in America and its specific feeling, a dizzying mix of frustrated helplessness and joyous survival.Perhaps it\u2019s not surprising that the group\u2019s aesthetic choices are very Public Enemy, which is to say, pretty \u201cretro.\u201d Public Enemy was among the first acts to grasp that for all its durability as an art form, rap is inescapably tied to the black experience. It\u2019s always political, because to live as a black person in America is to be politicized. Run the Jewels gets this. If you listen closely, through their artful grandstanding, you can hear a radical politics. Which is another way of saying the truth; listen, and hear the world change. \u2666A sound like the music on a holistic-medicine website \u2014 but cool.By Max ReadIt used to be, if you wanted to vibrate at the same frequency as the Mayan spacemen, you needed to move to a Southwestern city that specialized in horse art. It used to be, if you wanted your aura photographed, you had to go to a cramped Chinatown crystal shop. These days, there\u2019s a boutique around the corner from my apartment in Brooklyn with a pop-up aura-photography tepee. On a whim, I went to have my aura\u2019s picture taken, only to learn the photographer was fully booked days in advance. New Age is back, and turning up where you wouldn\u2019t have expected it a few years ago \u2014 in places where the young and culturally sophisticated congregate. Places that are, for lack of a better word, hip.It used to be, if you bought an album from a small Vancouver electronic-music label, you could expect some kind of weird minimal techno. These days? You get CFCF\u2019s \u201cThe Colours of Life,\u201d a 40-minute instrumental suite that layers airy synths, noodling guitars, marimbas and, God help us, panpipes over simple, propulsive rhythms. You could talk about it in terms of record-nerd touchstones \u2014 \u201cThe Colours of Life\u201d sounds a bit like the minimalist composer Steve Reich in places, or the Krautrock god Manuel G\u00f6ttsching in others \u2014 but really, it sounds as if it should be advertised on basic cable with stock footage of candles. Or like a cassette tape you would buy from a bookstore with an entire section devoted to \u201cAngels.\u201d Or like seduction music played by a barefoot European man with a soul patch. Do you catch my drift? It\u2019s cool, but it sounds as if it were recorded using a dreamcatcher as a pop filter. It sounds like the music for a 40-minute director\u2019s cut of an airline commercial. It sounds like a poster of a wolf. It sounds like a hologram sticker of a dolphin. It sounds like a tattoo of an open eye. It sounds like the font Papyrus. It\u2019s also really, really good.The assumption always seems to be that the New Age revival is weird, if not insincere in some unspecified, \u201cironic\u201d way. Why would urban-dwelling gentrified-Brooklyn types embrace the atavistic philosophies of conspiracy theorists and mononymous zither players? One answer is that this is how cool works: Things that used to be uncool become cool, and vice versa.But I think maybe it\u2019s the wrong question in the first place. We live in an age of aggressive positivism, a world overtaken by metrics and markets. To accuse New Age revivalism of insincerity \u2014 reducing the possibilities of belief to a binary \u2014 is to miss the point. The gentle woo-woo spirituality of New Age is attractive because it refuses the grinding realities of life spent in the shadow of Wall Street and Hollywood and Silicon Valley. Why wouldn\u2019t people overwhelmed by a slick and well-capitalized culture machine seek their pleasure in something defiantly corny? You can lie, and you can cook the books, but you can\u2019t fake a vibe. If a 40-minute New Age symphony can make you feel good \u2014 instead of harried or judged or pandered to \u2014 why should you care that it sounds like the soundtrack to a 1980s nature documentary? \u2666Is Coldplay bland? The future won\u2019t care.By Jeremy GordonA band that signs up to play the Super Bowl halftime show is making a declaration of immense confidence in its ability to hold a spotlight. It would seem contradictory for that band to then immediately cede that spotlight, but that\u2019s just what Coldplay did. They were contracted as the headliners at this year\u2019s game, but they wisely let Beyonc\u00e9 and Bruno Mars \u2014 both infinitely more charismatic \u2014 take control. As those two stars hit the stage, ready to trade hits and dance moves, the band\u2019s singer, Chris Martin, clung to the background, as if worried he might burst into flames if everyone appeared in the same frame.Coldplay\u2019s deference masks a steady success: For nearly two decades, they\u2019ve written a great many memorable songs, combining earnest Hallmark sentiments with anthemic melodies, worming their way into impressionable hearts and onto the charts. They\u2019re successors to U2, another band that crystallized the ineffable grandeur of the human experience into countless four-minute, radio-ready rock songs. Millions of Super Bowl viewers knew what it meant when Martin sat down at his piano, preparing to bang out the opening chords to \u201cClocks.\u201d As the rapper Future put it in a widely circulated tweet: \u201c#Coldplay legendary forever.\u201dThis brand of wide-screen pop attracts easy put-downs: edgeless, corny, white. But music has never lacked anodyne cornballs who didn\u2019t get their props until years later. Phil Collins used to symbolize the worst of slick \u201980s excess, but over time he has been recognized for his pop craftsmanship and technical innovations (especially the big drum sounds \u2014 you know, that fill in the middle of \u201cIn the Air Tonight\u201d \u2014 that blew a million rappers\u2019 minds). Jokes about how mawkish he seemed in the \u201980s are increasingly irrelevant to young people, who can care only so much about what anything seemed like before they were born.This is likely to be Coldplay\u2019s trajectory, too. Like Phil Collins, Michael McDonald, Abba or any number of desperately unhip artists, their \u201cimage\u201d will evaporate, while their songs will weather the years. In 2009, the Brooklyn band Grizzly Bear conscripted McDonald to sing a version of one of their singles, \u201cWhile You Wait for the Others,\u201d at the peak of their own rarified cool. Chris Martin might be asked to fill a similar role for tomorrow\u2019s Grizzly Bear. Imagine it: Sincerity will once again be on its way out of music, only for a familiar and tender voice to ring throughout the future blogosphere. Because when it\u2019s no longer certain what\u2019s cool, what will be more comforting than an elder statesman who never worried about it to begin with?A few weeks before the Super Bowl, Coldplay and Beyonc\u00e9 released a music video for \u201cHymn for the Weekend,\u201d a collaboration from the band\u2019s most recent and potentially final album. High-profile pop songs like this are conceived as nothing less than events, ready to be performed at mega-happenings like the Super Bowl halftime show. The actual Super Bowl halftime show featured both Coldplay and Beyonc\u00e9 but not the song. Martin said \u201cHymn\u201d was too new and wouldn\u2019t have been \u201cquite right.\u201dWhat his audience wanted was the warmth of familiarity. They wanted \u201cClocks.\u201d The live performance would have been an event, but Martin knows there will be plenty of opportunities in the future. The band is built to endure. \u2666Jeremy Gordon is deputy news editor for Pitchfork.Yes, darling, but is it feminist?By Jamie Lauren KeilesAs good-and-evil Christian morality falls out of fashion among the women in my social universe, a new binary has arisen to organize our outlook. In the heavens, there is all that is feminist: Beyonc\u00e9 singles, the selfie, menstruation ads on the subway and the dream of a woman in the White House. In hell, there is everything else. There are no nonbelievers, and there is no limbo. As new things come into being, we sort them accordingly by asking ourselves, \u201cIs this feminist?\u201dBy June 2015, Fetty Wap\u2019s \u201cTrap Queen\u201d had already claimed its place as the hot song of the summer. Beyond just the pleasures of a classic party anthem \u2014 an infectious hook, synth chords to ramp up your heart rate \u2014 the song offers an American love story for the ages. Fetty is a drug dealer weak-kneed for the girl who can match his hustle. When he cooks crack, she cooks crack with him. When he dreams of Lamborghinis, he dreams in matching pairs. Fetty\u2019s queen doesn\u2019t ride in the passenger seat. The couple make money together, and they spend it together too \u2014 at strip clubs, on weed, on gifts for each other. It\u2019s a vision of a love we can believe in, even outside the dreamland bubble of a rom-com plot. What could be more romantic than two equals teaming up to build their fantasy in a difficult and unjust world?For a summer, \u201cTrap Queen\u201d was everywhere. It would ultimately spend 25 weeks in Billboard\u2019s Top 3. We sang about cooking crack with our babies in the aisles of Duane Reade and on the dance floors of bat mitzvahs. Like Fetty himself, we landed seasonal crushes with \u201cHey, what\u2019s up? Hello!\u201d as our deceptively simple opening line. Rattling trap snares drowned out the sound of ice-cream-truck jingles, and summertime was better for it. But eventually it came time to ask the inevitable: Is \u201cTrap Queen\u201d feminist?I wonder about the purpose of this exercise. Why, in order for \u201cTrap Queen\u201d to be good, must we find a way to wedge it inside the narrow boundaries of white women\u2019s feminism? Is it not good enough on its own? Feminism and \u201cTrap Queen\u201d both spent the last year exploding ever further into the mainstream, and in both cases, we\u2019re still struggling to nail down exactly what they mean. Is the gutted, feel-good pop feminism of that Bustle post the same one that moves a panel of black women to declare Fetty Wap a feminist? Or perhaps the more important question is this: If \u201cTrap Queen\u201d is declared feminist in one system, does it suddenly belong to all feminists, regardless of race, of class or of circumstance?In the year that conversations about identity finally entered the small-talk realm of white folks, we seem to have lost sight of the fact that not everything is created for us \u2014 not even all feminist things. Identity politics is not always about identifying. \u201cTrap Queen\u201d is an immaculate song \u2014 a compelling love story and a true club banger. Perhaps, in the future, we can find a way to say so without needing to claim it for ourselves. \u2666A magnificently cheesy ballad that we\u2019ll never stop listening to.By Jody RosenLionel Richie\u2019s \u201cHello\u201d begins discreetly, almost sneakily, floating a sour little synthesizer melody over tiptoeing piano chords. The song crept into the collective consciousness in similarly stealthy fashion. It arrived in late 1983, buried on Richie\u2019s \u201cCan\u2019t Slow Down,\u201d the second solo album by the former Commodores singer. Reviewers took little notice of \u201dHello\u201d; Richie was ambivalent, cutting the song from \u201cCan\u2019t Slow Down\u201d at one point during the recording sessions before reinstating it. But when \u201cHello\u201d was released as a single in February 1984, it shot to No.1 on Billboard\u2019s Hot 100 and topped charts across the globe.In the decades since, \u201cHello\u201d has never said goodbye. It\u2019s one of those adult-contemporary ballads that has taken up residency in the ether, seeping from the walls of dentists\u2019 offices and tinkling on the phone line while you await a customer-service representative. It\u2019s a song, in other words, that has been judged soothing and innocuous enough to serve as Muzak \u2014 not necessarily an insult, but definitely a misapprehension of the fearsome beast that \u201cHello\u201d is. The song\u2019s narrator is a lovelorn weirdo who is both hapless \u2014 \u201cTell me how to win your heart/For I haven\u2019t got a clue/But let me start by saying/\u2018I love you\u2019\u201d \u2014 and vaguely sinister. The refrain, \u201cHello? Is it me you\u2019re looking for?\u201d sounds benign, but in the video, a dazed-looking Richie stalks the halls of an art school, mooning over a blind sculptor at least 15 years his junior.The revival of \u201dHello\u201d is a curiosity \u2014 a piece of pop flotsam borne back into the mainstream by the Internet\u2019s swirling surf. But it\u2019s also a testament to the magnetism of Lionel Richie, 66, a more durable presence, and a finer musician, than many have cared to admit. The meme-ing of \u201dHello\u201d has coincided with a wider Richie resurgence. \u201cTuskegee\u201d (2012), Richie\u2019s 10th studio album, was a surprise hit that paired the singer with country stars in new renditions of \u201dEasy,\u201d \u201cSay You, Say Me\u201d and other chestnuts. Richie has spent several years barnstorming arenas, quietly re-emerging as a top-grossing touring act. Last June, he played the Glastonbury music festival in England, drawing raves and a crowd of nearly 200,000, the festival\u2019s largest.Back in the \u201980s, I had mixed feelings about Richie: affection for his inescapable hits and regard for his craftsmanship, tinged with disdain I had absorbed from rock critics. He had been the Commodores\u2019 resident softy, the maudlin voice of \u201cThree Times a Lady,\u201d almost too genteel for the band\u2019s tame brand of funk-soul. Critics offered respect, but scorn leaked through: \u201cunctuous,\u201d \u201cmilquetoast,\u201d \u201cwhite-bread.\u201d The bottom line: Richie was talented, but too slight and sappy to be taken seriously.Today he stands as the biggest \u201980s pop star who is not quite canonized. He has sold tens of millions of records worldwide, most of them in the \u201980s, when he strode lofty heights alongside Michael Jackson, Madonna and Prince. But Richie couldn\u2019t match the charisma of those dynamos, and unlike all of them, he has gotten nowhere near the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. The industry celebrates his hit-making: There was an all-star Richie tribute at last month\u2019s Grammys. Still, the highest sort of esteem is denied him.A reappraisal may be in order. What hits me hardest is the robust beauty of Richie\u2019s voice \u2014 a smooth baritone roughened by hints of grit \u2014 and the casual virtuosity with which he puts it to use. Listen to the 1981 Diana Ross duet \u201cEndless Love,\u201d in which Richie enfolds his partner\u2019s rather colorless singing in plush, precise harmony vocals, airlifting the song to its rightful place: the honeymoon suite of a very posh hotel. That mix of understated and overwrought is pure Richie. He deploys one of pop\u2019s subtlest skill sets in the service of ferociously corny songs.The miracle is that Richie makes such sentiments stick. Credit his melodic gift and his knack for arrangements that wash over listeners in cresting, tumbling waves. \u201cHello\u201d is typical, with stately verses that open into a wind-whipped chorus. When the song rears up into its final refrain (\u201c\u2019Cause I wonder where you are ... \u201c), the effect is that of a unicorn rising on its hind legs, mane flashing, to meet the purple dawn.In short, Richie is a great singer-songwriter and a world-historical cheeseball. A century-plus of pop history has not erased the squeamishness we feel when faced with ballads like Richie\u2019s. Today\u2019s music critics have largely abandoned old snobberies, embracing commercial pop in all its gaudy splendor. Yet songs like \u201cHello\u201d remain for many a bridge too far, a musical pleasure we still take with a side helping of guilt.But pop culture has evolved a nifty system, allowing us to luxuriate in music we pretend to hold at arm\u2019s length. The campy karaoke performance, the TV comedy sketch, the \u201cRickroll\u201d \u2014 these bring songs back to us under the cover of irony. It\u2019s canon-making, 2016 style: We mock-venerate old records as kitsch and, lo and behold, they get inscribed in the Celestial Songbook.Richie knows how this game is played \u2014 how to laugh at himself, politely, and all the way to the bank. Last fall, he appeared on \u201cThe Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon,\u201d or rather, his disembodied head did: Richie played the role of the Lionel Richie bust, duetting with Fallon in a \u201cHello\u201d spoof. When Richie performs, though, the irony melts away.That\u2019s what happened at Glastonbury, where a crowd of mostly white rock fans greeted Richie in high tongue-in-cheek mode, waving banners with slogans lifted from memes. But when the opening strains of \u201dHello\u201d sounded, the throng erupted, joining Richie in a singalong as joyously cathartic as any you will hear. Suddenly, \u201cHello\u201d wasn\u2019t a tacky \u201980s artifact \u2014 the song was a communal hearth fire, casting a rosy glow over 200,000 souls. It was an example of pop\u2019s mysterious sorcery, the way that certain alchemical blends of music and words strike us right in the gut, circumnavigating our high-minded aesthetic ideals and studied postures. It was a reminder that some of the most powerful songs are the most gauche, scrambling together beauty and vulgarity, exquisite craftsmanship and appalling taste, exalted chivalric love-oaths and the queasy come-ons of a dork with a mullet. As for that Clay Head From the Lionel Richie \u201cHello\u201d Video: It works equally well as a platter for your cream-cheese dip and a bust on pop\u2019s Mount Rushmore. \u2666The master producer opens up his workshop.Photographs by JRA \u2018classical\u2019 musician with legions of unclassical admirers \u2014 including Kanye West.By Mark LevineA few years ago, Shaw, then 30, shocked the classical-music world by becoming the youngest-ever winner of a Pulitzer Prize in music. Shaw won for a piece she wrote for the cultish vocal group Roomful of Teeth, which specializes in otherworldly sounds that hardly suggest the word \u201cclassical,\u201d and which she is a member of. In swift fashion, Shaw emerged as the face of a flourishing scene of young composers \u2014 people like Nico Muhly, Gabriel Kahane and Missy Mazzoli \u2014 who were blurring the lines between classical and indie music. For the previous month or two, raw video footage from a fund-raiser held by the Democratic National Committee in San Francisco, and attended by President Obama, had been circulating online, showing Shaw singing a long, hypnotic, wordless introduction to Kanye West\u2019s performance of his song \u201cPower.\u201dIn Iowa, Shaw came onstage and sat cross-legged on her chair among the string players. Small and pixieish, she could easily have passed for a college student. She prefaced her work \u201cBy & By,\u201d a setting of three gospel songs, by saying that she was hoping to restore some authenticity to commercialized old-time music, and then began singing in an unadorned, incantatory alto shaded with both sorrow and fervor. Her slow, ribbonlike phrases, hovering just this side of harmonic resolution, might have risen from the Middle Ages as much as from the middle of Appalachia. The players plucked their instruments with picks, banjo-style, and occasionally broke into odd, agitated strumming or sawed away at their strings with the wooden part of the bow. Shaw and JACK could seem to be drifting into different songs, Shaw\u2019s vocals lost in plaintiveness while the quartet fought through bouts of improvisatory chaos. But the strewn-out pieces of sound kept finding their way back to one another. For all the hints of disruptiveness in the music, this was crowd-pleasing stuff, and the young members of the audience responded with shouts.Not long after the concert, Shaw and I struck up a phone and email correspondence. She grew up in Greenville, N.C., where her mother, a violin teacher, started her on the instrument at 2. \u201cI was a straight-up suburban Suzuki kid,\u201d she told me, reared on a strict diet of classical music. \u201cI lived under a rock for many years.\u201d She went to Rice University to study violin, then moved on to Yale for a master\u2019s in performance. While there, she sang in church choirs for $15 an hour to help pay the bills and got a job as an accompanist for dance classes, work that required her to improvise music on demand for a variety of rhythms, tempos and styles of movement. \u201cIf you\u2019re a good accompanist,\u201d she says, \u201cno one notices you. It\u2019s a way of making music to serve something that\u2019s larger than you, but something that\u2019s very human and simple, which is dance.\u201dAfter Yale, she moved to New York and gravitated toward the edges of the classical-music scene. She played a lot of thorny contemporary music, which often left her yearning for the full-bodied pleasures of traditional harmony, and which set her to wondering what she might have done differently had she written the score herself. She had also developed into a specialist in Baroque violin and sang early music in the choir of Trinity Church in Lower Manhattan. In 2009, she heard about an a cappella group that was being put together to explore vocal practices rarely found in standard classical music. \u201cIt was a gig, yes, but what a crazy adventure to learn things like throat singing and yodeling,\u201d she says.That summer, the group, Roomful of Teeth, met for the first time in a three-week residency at Mass MoCA, the contemporary art museum in North Adams, Mass. The eight young members settled in to study with a master throat singer from Tuva, a region of southern Siberia. The group\u2019s director, Brad Wells, invited them to write music for their first performance. Shaw worked late into the night after each day\u2019s rehearsal, \u201ctrying out these chords,\u201d as she puts it, \u201cand moving things around. I had it in my mind that I wanted to hear a mass of people talking, saying things that didn\u2019t have any particular content. Then I wanted to hear the talk break down into a guttural sound, \u2018vocal fry,\u2019 with no words, just vowels \u2014 the kind of thing kids do, just play with sound. And then I wanted to hear that strange sound turn into a big, beautiful chord, sung by all eight of us, a split second later.\u201dAfter 10 days, Shaw had a draft of a piece, \u201cPassacaglia,\u201d to take to rehearsal. It gave the group a chance to practice some of the effects they had been working on, like the lawnmowerish textures of throat singing and the sudden transition between head and chest voice that characterizes yodeling. There was a spoken text \u2014 from \u201cWall Drawing 305,\u201d by Sol LeWitt, on display at Mass MoCA \u2014 which, torn from context, came across as surreal and vaguely menacing. The work\u2019s opening harmonies, though, were straight from classical tradition. The audience at the first concert cheered and applauded when the swarming, crackling sounds of the vocal meltdown in \u201cPassacaglia\u201d resolved, suddenly and triumphantly, by returning to the piece\u2019s opening D-major chord.The following two summers, Roomful of Teeth returned to Mass MoCA, and Shaw wrote three more pieces, which she put together as a four-movement work called \u201cPartita for Eight Voices.\u201d The range of vocalizations expanded to include whispers, sighs, grunts, gasps, murmurs, whoops, heavy breathing. For a work written by a relative novice, \u201cPartita\u201d bristled with assurance. On a lark, Shaw wrote a check for $50 and submitted \u201cPartita\u201d to the Pulitzer committee, thinking it a useful way to get the high-profile judges to listen to Roomful of Teeth. She was walking along the Hudson on a spring afternoon when a friend called to tell her she had won the prize. Nine months later, Roomful of Teeth, which had mounted a Kickstarter campaign to help finance its first recording, which included \u201cPartita,\u201d won a Grammy. The group now has bookings for close to 75 performances this year.Last May, Kanye West heard Roomful of Teeth perform \u201cPartita for Eight Voices\u201d at Walt Disney Concert Hall in Los Angeles and came backstage afterward to meet the group. \u201cHe just seemed like someone who is honestly curious and interested in finding something new,\u201d Shaw recalls. \u201cWe exchanged phone numbers and started talking.\u201d West asked Shaw to produce a new version of his song \u201cSay You Will,\u201d a track from his 2008 album \u201c808s & Heartbreak.\u201d \u201cThere was no assignment given,\u201d Shaw says. \u201cI just did what I wanted to, and he really liked it.\u201d West released the remix on SoundCloud and added Shaw to the legion of collaborators on his new project, \u201cThe Life of Pablo,\u201d bringing her to Los Angeles for three weeks of studio work. She ended up co-writing, co-producing or contributing vocals to several songs.\u201cI\u2019m not really allowed to talk about it,\u201d Shaw told me. But she went on: \u201cThe work was really fun. It was like being given an amazing coloring book and being told to use all your crayons, use your paint and scissors, anything at all.\u201d At first, Shaw had little familiarity with West\u2019s music. She recognized an affinity, though. \u201cEverything is tightly, tightly controlled, held back, held onto. And then the moment comes and it just breaks out, everything explodes.\u201d Shaw paused seriously for a moment, then laughed. \u201cI kinda love that.\u201d \u2666\u2018Mr. Worldwide\u2019 speaks in pan-Caribbean code.By Julianne Escobedo ShepherdThere\u2019s a reason Pitbull christened himself \u201cMr. Worldwide\u201d: The bombastic party rapper is a global phenomenon. He also tends to be served a global helping of ire. In February, he closed out the Grammy Awards with his reggaeton single \u201cEl Taxi,\u201d in a slot normally reserved for rock music (and, occasionally, rock-rap hybrids); by the song\u2019s end, several Twitter users, including the \u201cBroad City\u201d comedy writer Chris Kelly, had likened the performance to the Zika virus.Jamaica and Cuba have enjoyed a friendly relationship since the early 1970s, when the former lobbied the Organization of American States in support of the latter. More important, though, there\u2019s Miami, the spiritual home of the \u201cEl Taxi\u201d sensibilities \u2014 where Caribbean immigrants have for decades melded and commingled culture and influence, with itinerant communities cross-pollinating and building off one another. Chaka Demus certainly approved of \u201cEl Taxi\u201d building on his original, \u201cthe biggest dancehall song of all time,\u201d as he told The Jamaica Star. (Besides, he said, \u201cI have lost track of the amount of persons who have copied the song already.\u201d)Diasporas live and thrive in these sonic interchanges, which work almost like a code among the communities that create them \u2014 a point of conversation among very different peoples whom the mainstream holds equally at arm\u2019s length. Pitbull described himself, in a 2015 Billboard interview, as \u201cthe epitome of the American dream, the underdog, the fighter, the forever hungry, forever appreciative.\u201d Some may be reasonably allergic to the strobe-light pulse of his Miami party zone. But every beat clearly illustrates the way immigrants have learned to flip that disdain to their advantage. \u2666The return of perfectly imperfect soul.By Amanda PetrusichThe R.&B. singer D\u2019Angelo once took a 14-year retreat from his public. After a tour for the 2000 platinum-selling \u201cVoodoo\u201d \u2014 during which grown women were reportedly shrieking, nightly, for D\u2019Angelo to reveal his carved abdomen, then so acutely defined that it seemed unreal, phantasmagoric \u2014 he split, using booze, drugs and solitude to numb his disappointment with a business that seemed to have everything backward. \u201cI\u2019m going to go in the woods, drink some hooch, grow a beard and get fat,\u201d is how he put it to his friend and collaborator Questlove.The decade-plus of pop music that D\u2019Angelo sat out was driven, in large part, by neurotic precision. Some of this is surely attributable to the Swedish superproducer Max Martin, who favors a punchy, airless, symmetrical approach to rhythm. You hit the beat and hit it squarely. Martin\u2019s aesthetic is ubiquitous \u2014 he has worked with Taylor Swift, Katy Perry, Adele, Maroon 5 and dozens of others \u2014 and doesn\u2019t allow for much creative meandering. In the Martin era, so much pop music has been violent in its fastidiousness: no stumbling, no retreat, no lackadaisical exhalations.It\u2019s not that \u201cReally Love\u201d is muddy or inexact \u2014 although by Martin\u2019s yardstick, it probably is \u2014 but that it\u2019s gentle, unstressed, forgiving of itself. This is not so unusual in R.&B. and soul, formative genres for D\u2019Angelo, but it has become anomalous within pop. While a listener might find it easier, at first, to holler along with a more fastidious singer like Taylor Swift (It is extraordinarily satisfying! Shouting each fixed syllable! Participating in the one! And only! Way! The song! Allows for!), D\u2019Angelo\u2019s vocal performance encourages something softer and less preordained. Even the few seconds of gritty crackle included at the end \u2014 a turntable\u2019s needle jerking into a run-out groove \u2014 suggest a way to quiet the mind, let the edges blur a little, like when you accidentally fall asleep in a poolside chaise, drink still in hand. It is hard, now, not to read D\u2019Angelo\u2019s departure as a reiteration of a creative ethos, writ larger; slowness, here, is not ignoble or archaic. It feels, instead, like a subversive act: a revolution of patience. \u2666From a jailed star, a soundtrack for Jamaica\u2019s cynical politics.By Miriam MarkowitzThat is, the party\u2019s political opposition, the Jamaica Labour Party, was too weak to have committed the crime. Riffing on another line from \u201cWeh Dem Feel Like,\u201d Vaz exhorted his listeners to \u201cload up the guns,\u201d before a D.J. played a few bars of the song. In newspapers for days afterward, politicians and private citizens denounced Vaz for his carelessness: On the eve of an election, a time when Jamaica\u2019s fragile political peace has historically been rived by violence, Vaz had channeled the menace of Vybz Kartel.Jailed on suspicion of murder in 2011 and convicted in 2014, Kartel is Jamaica\u2019s pre-eminent entertainer and a quandary for the political class, which has long defined itself in opposition to the nation\u2019s popular music \u2014 first reggae and now dancehall, its rude, raucous up-tempo successor. Jamaican artists like Buju Banton, Bounty Killer and Beenie Man popularized dancehall abroad in the \u201990s, and later crossover stars like Sean Paul and Shaggy scored stateside hits with \u201cGimme the Light\u201d and \u201cBoombastic.\u201d But dancehall\u2019s influence is even more profound, having grown from an indigenous genre into the ghost in the pop-music machine. It seeded the evolution of rap, drum and bass and electronic dance music, and has infiltrated American pop from Justin Bieber to Beyonc\u00e9. \u201cWork,\u201d the newest single from the Barbadian superstar Rihanna, is effectively dancehall, as was her first hit, \u201cPon de Replay\u201d in 2005.Here in Jamaica \u2014 where dancehall is the soundtrack to life, blasting every day and late into the night from car stereos and jury-rigged home speakers, in rum bars and barbershops \u2014 Kartel remains the genre\u2019s reigning monarch, despite having spent the last five years in prison. Born Adidja Palmer, Kartel built his reputation with graphic songs about guns, sex and unapologetic social transgressions, like bleaching his skin. His empire has extended beyond music to products, including a line of cake soap and \u201cdaggering\u201d condoms, named after a dance move in which a couple simulates rough sex on the dance floor. In 2014, he was convicted of murdering an associate, Clyde (Lizard) Williams, who disappeared in 2011 and whose body was never recovered. Kartel, who maintains his innocence, has continued to dominate the airwaves and awards circuit and somehow seems to be recording music in prison; a new album, \u201cViking (Vybz Is King),\u201d appeared last year.As the two political parties fought to form the next government, Vaz was not the only politician to take his cues from Kartel and dancehall. In November, Andrew Holness, the Jamaica Labour Party leader, toured Montego Bay wearing Clarks, Jamaica\u2019s most fashionable footwear, whose prices doubled on the island in 2010 after Kartel penned an ode to the British brand. Holness tweeted a picture of himself dusting off a brown shoe in Kartel\u2019s preferred style, the \u201cdesert boot,\u201d and Twitter went wild. \u201cA weh yuh get dah new Clarks deh daadi?\u201d Holness wrote, echoing the question posed to Kartel by Popcaan, another dancehall superstar and Kartel\u2019s now-estranged prot\u00e9g\u00e9.The People\u2019s National Party, meanwhile, has its own house D.J., Foota Hype. In January, Lisa Hanna, the party\u2019s minister for youth and culture and a former Miss Jamaica, posted lyrics on Instagram from \u201cSchool,\u201d one of Kartel\u2019s newer songs, in which he implores students to study hard and to refrain from bleaching their skin. Hanna might have been returning a compliment paid to her by Kartel, who late last year released a song, \u201cBoss Lady,\u201d that praised Hanna and also Portia Simpson Miller, then the prime minister.In their appeals to dancehall fandom, these politicians hoped to inspire an electorate exhausted by empty promises. Since 1989, when the previously socialist-leaning People\u2019s National Party embraced economic neoliberalism, the ideological gap between the two parties has collapsed. Jamaica\u2019s debt-to-G.D.P. ratio has reached 125 percent, making it one of the world\u2019s premier debtor states; I.M.F.-imposed austerity measures have yielded high unemployment rates and a declining standard of living. For young people \u2014 almost half of whom would, according to a recent poll, relinquish their Jamaican citizenship to live abroad \u2014 party politics is increasingly dispiriting. Dancehall is the perfect accompaniment to their mood: a jaded and bacchanalian lament for the Jamaican future as envisioned by its young.In \u201cWeh Dem Feel Like,\u201d Kartel asks about his enemies, \u201cDem skin too tough fi bleed?\u201d \u2014 a fitting question, too, regarding Jamaica\u2019s frequently violent politics. All told, before the voting, at least four people were shot to death at campaign events, and dozens more were injured in a stampede. When the votes were tallied last month, the nation got what it expected: a virtual tie between two nearly identical parties, with the Jamaica Labour Party eking out a slim majority. Vaz, Holness and Hanna won their seats handily. It was considered, by Jamaican standards, a peaceful election. \u2666110 million views and counting.By Jayson GreeneWhere on earth is the monoculture in 2016? It\u2019s clearly not dead. There is a song out right now: It\u2019s called \u201cStressed Out,\u201d and it is by a group called Twenty One Pilots. I discovered it recently, while poking around online during an office lunch break. As I watched the video play in its tiny YouTube window, I was dismayed to discover something. This song, by this group, of whose existence I had not been even dimly aware, had been viewed 110 million times.Bowled over, I consulted the Billboard charts and saw that \u201cStressed Out\u201d by Twenty One Pilots was the No. 3 song in the nation. (And seriously: Twenty One Pilots? Was this name invented by a spambot? Was their Twitter icon an egg?) A sense of the uncanny crept in: What else didn\u2019t I know about? Where was I, in relation to everyone else? Digging around more, I learned that the duo used to loiter outside a Chick-fil-A in their hometown, Columbus, Ohio, hawking tickets to their shows. Now, just a few years later, they\u2019re scheduled to play 75 arenas and counting in 2016. Their success has a certain \u201cAlex from Target\u201d feel to it, in which incomprehensible unseen forces conspire to lift an arbitrary phenomenon up into the national spotlight.In pop culture, \u201cincomprehensible unseen forces\u201d can reliably be shortened to just \u201cteenagers.\u201d And sure enough, dipping into Tumblr and Vine and Twitter \u2014 alone, again, on my office lunch break \u2014 reveals the band has a deep and devoted learner\u2019s-permit fan base. The appeal of \u201cStressed Out\u201d for teenagers is easy enough to grasp: It sounds like a cheery telegram from turn-of-the-century MTV \u2014 a kind of singsong rap that transforms, in the chorus, into emo pop. The backbeat instantly recalls Eminem\u2019s \u201cMy Name Is,\u201d and the verses take you back to Crazy Town\u2019s \u201cButterfly.\u201d Sometimes Tyler Joseph, their singer, picks up a ukulele, in the manner of so many YouTube stars. The whole thing is like a microhistory of the last 20 years of suburban white people.Music can take you to unexpected places.By Jazmine HughesI\u2019ve held onto that idea \u2014 a song as a route \u2014 ever since. The trick to music, though, is that it doesn\u2019t really take you anywhere; you take yourself. The song is just the ticket, the map, the conduit. You arrive at the destination entirely on your own.That sound brings me directly to my grandmother\u2019s church in Roanoke, Va., where I received my first blessing as a human baby (I don\u2019t remember), learned my first proper hymn (I don\u2019t remember) and, as a toddler, stood up on the pew and interrupted the service in which my Mema received special accolades from the pastor (I don\u2019t remember, but I wish I did). Hearing an organ is my own vibrant Sunday morning: slicing the thick air with a paper fan, tightening my stomach muscles to quiet any rumbling until lunch, trying not to sweat out my freshly pressed hair, searching for a lesson within the sermon that I could believe in. The song made me 2 again, then 5, then 12 and then (and now) 24, in the room but ever-so-slightly out of place, seeing love and trying to feel it. \u201cSunday Candy\u201d took me down South, took me back, put me back into my grandmother\u2019s lap for four generous, holy minutes. Church, still, is a strange sort of refuge: I never want to go, but I\u2019m always glad I went. I really go only whenever I visit my grandma.\u201cSunday Candy\u201d ends the way my grandma\u2019s church service always began: with the choir. The superb, slowed-down version Chance performed on \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d in late 2015 is as close to a hip-hop gospel song as I\u2019ve ever heard, due mostly to the outsize presence of that choir with its call-and-response approach to repetition. Chance ends the performance with a breathless, ecclesiastical freestyle not unlike the climax of a sermon, marrying the spiritual transcendence of a Sunday service with his artistic one.In buttoned-up Bulgaria, a viral sensation who plows through every taboo.By Mac McClellandBorn in Bulgaria\u2019s only women\u2019s prison (his mother was arrested for selling imported clothes before the fall of Communism), Azis was, he says, marked since birth \u201cto be different.\u201d He was gay in a culture that rejects homosexuality and Roma in a country \u2014 one of several \u2014 that continues to persecute the group. \u201cBeing gay and being Roma are highly discriminated against in Bulgaria,\u201d Azis continued. \u201cThey\u2019re both words that people here hate. For me, I\u2019m carrying the burden of the two.\u201dNonetheless, Azis\u2019s mother was determined to make her son a star, and after she got out of prison, she dragged him to endless auditions. But \u201cnobody wanted a Gypsy kid,\u201d Azis went on. \u201cThey just didn\u2019t want a Gypsy in their choir, a Gypsy standing in front, on TV, anywhere; it was beyond imagination to have somebody like me there.\u201d Eventually, this string of humiliations \u201ccrushed\u201d his mother. They moved to West Germany when Azis was 8. He returned to Bulgaria a few years later, after the wall came down; his mother\u2019s dream became his own the night he sang in a restaurant with live accompaniment. \u201cI felt really intoxicated by performing,\u201d he recalled. In his early 20s, he signed with a music agency in Sofia and a year later won best artist at a Bulgarian music festival. Within two years, he sold out the country\u2019s biggest stadium, where, with Communism more than a decade gone, he took the stage wearing high-heeled red leather boots that went up to his crotch.Now 38, Azis has dropped what he calls his \u201cdiva\u201d look. This is partly because he\u2019s \u201ctired and too old for everything\u201d \u2014 it takes him three hours to get into drag \u2014 but also because he no longer feels the need to make statements. \u201cNowadays, you can see boys in tight jeans holding hands on the street. And there is a street in Sofia where you can have sex with a transsexual.\u201d He laughed, a full throaty chuckle like a glamorous Disney villain. \u201cI\u2019ve done what I could to change people\u2019s perceptions,\u201d he later added. \u201cI showed that you can be Gypsy and you can be intelligent, you could be gay and you can be cool. That\u2019s it. I cannot do the very same thing for 20 years.\u201d\u201cHabibi\u201d may take its name from an Arabic endearment, but he insists he\u2019s not trying to imply that, in Bulgaria, Arabs may suffer a fate similar to the Roma. (A recent Amnesty International report noted that migrants live in terror of \u201cxenophobic hate crimes\u201d and admonished Bulgaria to address this climate of fear.) Rather, he explains, it\u2019s that Arab barbershops are trendy in Bulgaria. He has seen young people talking about them on Facebook.One day, the diva look will be back, he promises. In the meantime, he\u2019s considering recording a song entirely in English for American audiences, for whom he does have a message, however apolitical. \u201cI want them to know about Bulgaria,\u201d he said. \u201cI want to tell them that it\u2019s a small but very beautiful country, the nature here is amazing, the people are very friendly, especially in the countryside, and we have the most delicious feta cheese.\u201d \u2666On composing music, and your death, while dying.By Will HermesThere\u2019s a tradition of \u201cdeath poems\u201d in some Asian countries, and as a generation of outspoken musicians shuffles off our coil, the farewell album has become a Western equivalent. John Coltrane\u2019s \u201cExpression\u201d might be considered a forerunner. Warren Zevon made \u201cThe Wind\u201d after a diagnosis of inoperable cancer. On the last of Johnny Cash\u2019s \u201cAmerican Recordings\u201d series released during his lifetime, he performed Trent Reznor\u2019s \u201cHurt\u201d as a sort of deathbed confessional, then closed with \u201cWe\u2019ll Meet Again,\u201d a World War II-era send-off that was the smirking existential finale of \u201cDr. Strangelove.\u201dOther late works tilt toward consecrating summary, like Bach\u2019s \u201cMass in B Minor\u201d \u2014 or the new album by Loretta Lynn, still hale at 83, which reprises pointed favorites like \u201cEverybody Wants to Go to Heaven\u201d (\u201cbut nobody wants to die\u201d). Lou Reed\u2019s parting shot was extreme, even for him: a harsh art-metal collaboration with Metallica that reimagines Frank Wedekind\u2019s violently sexual \u201cLulu\u201d plays. But Reed was always a button-pusher. \u201cThe greatest disappointment/Age withered him and changed him,\u201d he snarled on \u201cJunior Dad,\u201d a song as mercilessly cleareyed as Reed\u2019s signature \u201cHeroin.\u201d Bowie is said to have called \u201cLulu\u201d his friend\u2019s \u201cgreatest work,\u201d a judgment colored, perhaps, by his own exit-music plans.In an era when our deaths are generally scripted by a profit-driven medical establishment, these conscious farewells are inspiring. Death is one of life\u2019s main events: Shouldn\u2019t it be our own composition? Reed died at home, surrounded by friends and family, with a posthumous, invite-only tribute at the Apollo Theater. There was no public funeral service for Bowie, only a final photo left on Instagram taken shortly before he died \u2014 the former and eternal Ziggy Stardust looking dapper in a designer suit, rakish hat and no socks, grinning widely, ready for his next act. \u2666Digital Design: Rodrigo de Benito Sanz and Linsey Fields.A picture caption on March 13 with an article about Sydney Bennett, leader of the band the Internet, misspelled the surname of the band\u2019s bassist. He is Patrick Paige II, not Page.An article on March 13 about the rapper Kendrick Lamar and his song \u2018\u2018The Blacker the Berry\u2019\u2019 paraphrased incorrectly the lyrics of a song by Lauryn Hill. She criticized black women who wear hair weaves that look European; she did not say that they got the weaves from Koreans.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "At Dizzying Heights, Prices of Luxury Apartments May Have Found Ceiling", "Date": "2016-03-15", "News": "Supported byIt\u2019s a question of supply and demand.On a seven-block stretch of 57th Street and nearby, there are at least 300 apartments in seven buildings priced at a billionaire-friendly $5,000 a square foot either for sale or scheduled to go on the market in the next 24 months.That imbalance is one of a growing number of signs that New York may be facing a luxury glut. Prices for land, apartments, Madison Avenue storefronts and hotel rooms, all of which have skyrocketed in recent years, may have finally gotten too high.But the market Cornerstone focuses on has not felt the pinch. \u201cSo far, the rental market\u2019s fine,\u201d Mr. Elghanayan said. \u201cWe\u2019re still running a 1 percent vacancy rate in our buildings, though we haven\u2019t been able to buy land or put together any new projects.\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s clearly some frothiness in the high-end residential market,\u201d said Alicia Glen, the deputy mayor for housing and economic development. \u201cIn some respects it\u2019s not the worst news for us. Land prices have gotten so out of control that it had a substantial impact on residential developers in making rental housing work.\u201dWhich is not to say the supply of the world\u2019s billionaires who want to invest in a New York apartment with lofty views has been exhausted. Nancy Packes, a high-end real estate consultant, contends that is not the case.Billionaires, Ms. Packes said, shrewdly anticipated the worldwide economic downturn and left the market in 2014 expecting that the slowdown in China and the sharp drop in the price of oil and other commodities would affect real estate.\u201cWe did not run out of wealthy people,\u201d she said.That may be. But there are also plenty of high-priced apartments going begging.But despite the inordinate amount of attention that the superluxury towers of Billionaires\u2019 Row have garnered, apartments selling in the $5,000-a-square-foot range represented less than 1 percent of condo sales in New York, according to CityRealty.And on Central Park South, the developer Steven Witkoff recently mothballed his plan to convert the Park Lane hotel to condominiums or demolish the building so he can build a luxury tower.The pursuit of oversize profits has also had an effect on high-end retail shops along Madison and Fifth Avenues and in SoHo in the form of empty stores. Coach and Bulgari recently announced deals for record rents on Fifth Avenue. But many retailers are refusing to go along as landlords boosted rents to $2,000 a square foot, a number many retailers found prohibitive, brokers said.\u201cRetailers are stepping back and saying, \u2018We can\u2019t live with those kind of occupancy costs and still make money,\u2019\u201d Robert K. Futterman, a retail broker, said. \u201cSo you\u2019re seeing rents on Madison Avenue come down.\u201d\u201cThere are crazy numbers all over the place,\u201d added another veteran broker, C. Bradley Mendelson of Cushman & Wakefield. But \u201ca lot of the luxury purchasers aren\u2019t there anymore,\u201d Mr. Mendelson added. \u201cThe middle market is doing very well.\u201d\u201cThe hallmark of the city\u2019s economy in recent years has been the sustained, diversified job growth, strong enough to keep drawing people here and to lift wages across the board,\u201d said James A. Parrott, chief economist of the Fiscal Policy Institute, a union-backed research group. \u201cBarring a global slowdown, that diversified growth will continue.\u201dThere are more people living in New York City than ever before, 8.5 million, and the population continues to swell. There are a record number of jobs and with the growth in advertising, the media and tech sectors, the economy is less dependent on Wall Street.The city\u2019s soaring supply of rooms for visitors may have something to do with that, as the construction of new hotels outpaced even that of superluxury towers. New York added 20,000 hotel rooms in the last five years, according to CBRE Hotels, a market data firm, bringing the total to 117,000 rooms, and there are another 13,000 under construction. Airbnb, a competitor, has added another 20,000 rooms for visitors to choose from.\u201cPeople are still coming to New York City,\u201d said Mark Van Stekelenburg, managing director of CBRE Hotels valuation and advisory services in New York. \u201cThey\u2019re just more sensitive to rates. We\u2019ve added 100 new hotels in the past five years, plus Airbnb, giving people a lot of options.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Indian Point Nuclear Plant: Scourge or Savior?", "Date": "2016-03-14", "News": "Supported byLetterTo the Editor:Paul Gallay and Michael Shank make a strong case for the immediate retirement of the Indian Point nuclear power plant. In addition to the recent major malfunctions the plant has suffered, the continuing ecological effects the plant\u2019s antiquated cooling water intake system has on the Hudson River estuary and the high radiation levels observed in groundwater testing, the aging facility poses a threat to the regional food shed.That threat comes in the form of land contamination from a large radioactive release, a factor that Victor Gilinsky, a former member of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, said should be carefully considered during the license renewal proceedings.Long-term contamination should be a major concern for a state that has a growing local food economy and is among the country\u2019s top agricultural producers for commodities like apples, grapes and dairy. According to the Office of the New York State Comptroller, the Hudson Valley region has about 2,400 farms and 340,000 acres of farmland.KYLE RABINDirector of ProgramsGrace Communications FoundationNew YorkTo the Editor:While nuclear plant license renewal applications historically take 24 to 30 months for the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to review, Entergy\u2019s license renewal application for Indian Point 2 and 3 has been under review for nine years, including more than 37,000 hours of inspection and review by the N.R.C. This is due in part to the state\u2019s delay in considering water use permits. As part of this process, the facility produces needed electricity under daily independent oversight by the commission.The writers ignore the fact that tritium is a naturally occurring radioisotope that, in the words of the Environmental Protection Agency, \u201cis one of the least dangerous radionuclides because it emits very weak radiation and leaves the body relatively quickly.\u201dTritium is regulated by the federal government, and it is widely recognized that the recent tritium release at Indian Point will not pose a public health concern.As a former site vice president at Indian Point, I know from experience that the plant\u2019s value as a reliable provider of carbon-free electricity can\u2019t be erased by unmerited criticism.JOSEPH E.

{"Headline": "Economists Go Negative on Negative Interest Rates", "Date": "2016-03-07", "News": "When the European Central Bank meets on Thursday, policymakers are expected to push its deposit rate deeper into negative territory, to minus 0.4 percent. The stated aim is to head off deflation.An interest rate below zero means that European banks are paying the central bank to hold their reserves, rather than earning interest on those reserves. If the negative interest rates were applied to customer deposits at banks, then customers would actually pay the banks to park cash in bank accounts, rather than earning interest on those deposits.Theoretically, negative interest rates should help to stimulate the economy by encouraging banks to lend. But they could also backfire. For instance, if negative rates caused depositors to stuff money in the mattress instead of putting it in a savings account, the outflow of cash from the banking system could cause rates to rise.But that is not the only way that negative interest rates could badly backfire. Even if they helped the euro area, they could harm other economies, including the United States economy. That would occur if negative interest rates are used as a tool for devaluing the euro \u00e2\u0080\u0093 a move that would make the dollar relatively stronger and, in the process, hurt American exports.Alternatively, negative interest rates could weaken the euro area\u00e2\u0080\u0099s banks, which have a hard time being profitable when interest rates are negative. Weak banks imply weak economies.Why then, would policymakers continue down this path?The overarching answer is that all of the advanced economies have become over-reliant on central banks and monetary policy to cure what ails them. That includes the United States, which relies too heavily on the Federal Reserve to steward the economy even as Congress refuses to use its fiscal spending powers to boost demand.Post-crisis economic policy \u00e2\u0080\u0094 globally and domestically \u00e2\u0080\u0094 has long been lopsided. In the United States, for example, aggressive monetary policy and large fiscal stimulus went hand in hand only briefly, in 2009, just after the crisis. But after that, Congress turned away from stimulus and toward deficit reduction \u00e2\u0080\u0094 a policy that has helped to entrench conservative ideology about \u00e2\u0080\u009csmall government,\u00e2\u0080\u009d but is precisely the wrong prescription for a global economy critically wounded by recession and financial chaos.Republicans, in particular, have managed to demonize the very idea of government spending as a solution to economic problems. In fact, the lack of spending, especially during the present long period of low interest rates, is a grave sin of omission that will indelibly stain the American economy in terms of unemployment and underemployment, crumbling highways and outmoded grids, dilapidated schools and deteriorating parks, to name only a few of the outcomes that could have been avoided with reasonable fiscal policy.Instead, lawmakers and policymakers the world over continue to sit back and pretend that central banks can fix the global economy. They can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t.The real reason to be negative on negative interest rates is that policy should never have come to this point.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Texas Voters Are Mellower Than the Candidates", "Date": "2016-03-01", "News": "Supported byEditorial ObserverOne state, sure, but huge, with many parts, spackled together by myth and (selective) memory. In the presidential primary on Tuesday, Texas Republicans seem set to throw themselves behind the two candidates who are doing all they can to stress the seams, pop the rivets, blow apart whatever counts as unity in 21st-century Texas.Ted Cruz is the Super Tuesday favorite in Texas. Donald Trump, polling second, is the first choice of one of the most virulent anti-immigrants in Congress, Senator Jeff Sessions, and the Ku Klux Klan. One way or another, it looks as if white grievance will finish first and second with the Texas G.O.P.But on a trip across southeast Texas on the eve of the primary, I met voters who \u2014 with an exception or two \u2014 did not seem to think they were near any abyss, as Mr. Cruz has warned. At a nostalgically 19th-century event \u2014 a rodeo parade on Saturday in Houston \u2014 Texans seemed perfectly at ease with the times. Trail riders by the thousands had converged on the downtown. They clopped through the skyscraper streets, in the shadow of what used to be the Enron towers, along with covered wagons and floats and marching bands. Not a politician was in sight.I watched for a while with Kemal Anbarci, a 52-year-old petroleum engineer, born in Turkey, who loves Houston. \u201cI really feel American,\u201d he said. \u201cI feel like I belong here.\u201d He said he voted Republican when he lived in California, but was waiting until after the primary to see who is the most unifying candidate. He called Houston \u201ca wonderful place to be if you are not native-born.\u201d He observed that the riders in the parade were ethnically diverse, but rode in segregated groups. \u201cIt\u2019s wonderful,\u201d he said, \u201cbut they are in chunks.\u201d He laughed.Richard Boucher, standing nearby, had voted early for Mr. Trump, but only because he thinks Mr. Cruz is unelectable and he prefers Mr. Cruz for the Supreme Court. Mr. Boucher, a gunsmith, agreed with both candidates on immigration \u2014 he said \u201cillegals\u201d are \u201ccriminals\u201d and should all be deported, even though he knows lots of them and knows they are hard-working people, and removing them would hurt the economy. And he said if he were in their position, he\u2019d be a criminal, too.Voters in Vidor, a town near the Louisiana border with a notorious racist history, were no easier to figure out. A white man I met in a flea market there said he had voted early for Mr. Trump because he fears Hillary Clinton. \u201cI\u2019m afraid it\u2019s gonna happen \u2014 I\u2019m afraid if she gets in we are going to be in deep, deep, deep manure.\u201d He didn\u2019t want to be named or recorded, given the town\u2019s reputation. Yet this man voted for President Obama in 2012 because he had a similar bad feeling about Mitt Romney. He told me he lost an old friend over that. The minute he told him he had voted for a black man, the guy hung up the phone. They haven\u2019t talked since.David Smith, a sheriff candidate who was waving to cars beside Main Street, said he was trying to form a citizen militia because of the coming societal collapse and revolution of the have-nots (see: Katrina). He said he was voting for Mr. Trump because Mr. Cruz is ineligible (Canada). A few feet away, a Latino man sold homemade tamales from the back of his pickup. He gave me his card and said he was undecided.In nearby Beaumont, I spoke outside a downtown theater with Michael Mason, who runs a theater group that brings the arts to an oil-and-gas town and is Bernie all the way, like a lot of young people I met. So was a musician I met in San Antonio, Rodolfo Lopez, who is about to turn 76.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Automakers Expanding in China May Soon Face Weakening Demand", "Date": "2016-03-28", "News": "Supported bySHANGHAI \u2014 The new $1.3 billion Cadillac factory on the outskirts of Shanghai is a shrine to modern manufacturing, the kind of facility that automakers all over the world dream of building but can seldom afford.Hundreds of robots bend, arch and twist to assemble the body of Cadillac\u2019s new flagship CT6. Lasers seal the car\u2019s lightweight aluminum exterior using techniques that the carmaker, General Motors, has only just introduced in the United States. Yardlong, bright yellow robots like mechanical Alaskan huskies tow five-foot-tall carts of auto parts to the assembly line.\u201cIt\u2019s more along the lines of aircraft technology than traditional, spot-welded steel bodies,\u201d said Paul Buetow, G.M.\u2019s head of manufacturing in China, as he strode along the assembly line.The factory is part of an aggressive expansion by automakers in China, the world\u2019s largest market for new cars and the industry\u2019s brightest hope for the last 15 years. But the country\u2019s economy is now cooling, which could leave carmakers with too many factories and not enough buyers.G.M. will open a second, $1 billion factory in Wuhan next year. G.M.\u2019s main rival in the Chinese market, Volkswagen, plans to open large assembly plants next year alongside its existing factories in the cities of Foshan, Ningbo and Yizheng and build one in Qingdao by 2018. Hyundai plans to complete a factory south of Beijing by October and another in Chongqing next year, while Chinese automakers like Great Wall and Changan are aggressively adding capacity.The research firm Sanford Bernstein estimates that auto manufacturing capacity in China will rise 22 percent over the next two years, bringing it to 28.8 million cars, minivans and sport utility vehicles annually. That is almost equal to the American and European markets combined, and greater than even the most optimistic forecasts: that sales in China will reach about 25 million next year.Automakers are expanding at a time when China\u2019s economic growth has slowed to its lowest level in more than a quarter-century. China is closing coal mines across the country and plans to shutter steel mills. Exports are falling. Many Chinese cities are dotted with empty apartment buildings. Worried about pollution and traffic jams, China\u2019s wealthiest metropolises have begun limiting the number of new cars that may be registered.On the surface, auto sales in China seem strong. More Chinese families can afford cars and are flocking to showrooms. Sales of cars, minivans and sport utility vehicles jumped 8 percent last year from 2014.Automakers have been expanding manufacturing in China as the market there has been booming. Although car sales are projected to rise again this year, the Chinese economy has been slowing down, which could extend to a slowdown in the car market.The buyers are not just China\u2019s college-educated, white-collar elite, but also the beneficiaries of the country\u2019s roughly eightfold growth in blue-collar wages in the last dozen years. Zhou Genkou, a burly truck driver, recently waited in a Volkswagen dealership to pay $12,300 for a new white Santana sedan. He explained that he could not tolerate life without a car.\u201cIt\u2019s so that we don\u2019t have to walk,\u201d he said.But there are signs that China\u2019s yearslong auto boom is easing.After car sales fell three months in a row, the Chinese government decided last September to halve the sales tax on cars with engines of 1.6 liters or less, to 5 percent through the end of 2016. The main beneficiaries have been domestic Chinese automakers, mostly affiliated with municipal or provincial governments, that churn out cheap subcompacts with small engines.A similar tax reduction produced strong sales in 2009 and 2010. But it mainly encouraged consumers to buy sooner. When the tax cut expired, sales essentially leveled off for the next two years.With the current tax reduction scheduled to end, \u201c2017 will be a very difficult year for the auto industry, probably no growth,\u201d said Yale Zhang, the managing director of Automotive Foresight, a Shanghai consulting firm.Multinationals are focusing more on higher-profit segments that are growing without help from such incentives. But they are also finishing up a factory-building spree that started three years ago, when the economy was healthier.\u201cWe see China moving to a pace of what I would call moderate growth,\u201d said Matthew Tsien, the G.M. executive vice president who oversees the company\u2019s China business.Volkswagen forecasts that China\u2019s auto market will grow slightly faster than the overall economy this year and slightly slower than the overall economy for the rest of the decade. G.M. is forecasting that the market will grow a little less than 5 percent a year through the end of the decade, the equivalent of adding the entire auto market of Japan, or five Australias.Both automakers are planning to meet much of that growth with factories they have already commissioned or will soon finish. But if the economy weakens significantly, the industry could get stuck with a large amount of excess capacity.\u201cAre manufacturers going to keep the rose-colored glasses or get real? Most of the multinationals are going to get real and slow down the new capacity,\u201d said Bill Russo, former chief executive of Chrysler China and now a consultant. \u201cI\u2019m not sure about the local manufacturers. They have a \u2018Field of Dreams\u2019 and \u2018build it and they will come\u2019 mentality.\u201dChinese auto industry leaders shrug off such concerns. \u201cThey see the small-car market as having a lot of potential,\u201d said Cui Dongshu, the secretary general of the China Passenger Car Association.The Chinese economy needs continued strength in the auto market. The government wants to shift to a new, more sustainable model for growth based on consumer spending.Since 2009, China has depended heavily on a loan-fed surge in construction of ever more highways, rail lines, factories and other investments. But that has produced a mountain of debt, particularly at state-owned enterprises.Strong auto sales helped China attain a little-noticed milestone in recent months. Overall retail sales of consumer goods in China surpassed such sales in the United States, according to official data.If sales do slow sharply, the question is whether multinationals and domestic automakers will try to start exporting more from their Chinese factories. The facilities are among the most advanced in the world, not least because they are also the newest.G.M. and other automakers could in theory try to export more cars to the United States, which is also a relatively healthy market. One potential obstacle, however, is that China\u2019s surplus capacity is mainly in subcompact cars, for which Americans have little appetite.G.M. is already preparing to start shipping a new car-based sport utility vehicle, the Buick Envision, from China to the United States, from a factory in northeastern China. The arrival of the Envision, which is being built only in China, Buick\u2019s biggest market by far, will be the mass market debut of Chinese-built cars in Big Three showrooms in the United States.The preferences of Chinese consumers tend to be different from those of American buyers. Chinese customers, for example, are highly prone to complain if fabrics and other materials in a car\u2019s interior do not smell quite right, according to surveys by J. D. Power & Associates. Many in the auto industry have said they will be watching how American buyers respond to Chinese-built Envisions.\u201cSo will we,\u201d said Mr. Buetow of G.M.Jack Ewing contributed reporting from Geneva.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": null, "Date": "2016-03-02", "News": "Mr. McClendon is accused of orchestrating a conspiracy in which two oil and gas companies colluded not to bid against each other for the purchase of leases in northwestern Oklahoma from late 2007 to early 2012. The Justice Department said the companies decided who would win the leases and the winner would allot an interest in the leases to the other company. \u00e2\u0080\u009cHis actions put company profits ahead of the interests of leaseholders entitled to competitive bids for oil and gas rights on their land,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said William J. Baer, assistant attorney general for the antitrust division. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe charge that has been filed against me today is wrong and unprecedented,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. Mr. McClendon, an audacious chief executive at Chesapeake until he was forced to step down three years ago, became a billionaire as the company aggressively outbid competitors for land leases and drilled highly productive wells in virtually every major shale gas field in the country. Chesapeake\u00e2\u0080\u0099s stock price has been sinking for five years now, especially since it was revealed that Mr. McClendon had taken a personal stake in Chesapeake wells and used it as collateral for up to $1.1 billion in loans used mostly to pay for his share of the cost of drilling those wells. Gordon Pennoyer, a spokesman for Chesapeake, said the company was cooperating with the antitrust investigation and did not expect to face prosecution or fines related to the matter.This creates a culture of \u00e2\u0080\u009chaves\u00e2\u0080\u009d and \u00e2\u0080\u009chave-nots,\u00e2\u0080\u009d where a vote is worth everything or nothing. The founders control the company and wield influence more or less with impunity. The idea can work well in principle, allowing the founders to look to the long term. And when one share counts for one vote, too often the vote doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t count. There are indications that shareholders value the power to vote too. Google\u00e2\u0080\u0099s \u00e2\u0080\u009cno vote\u00e2\u0080\u009d shares, for example, trade at a small discount to its one-vote shares.SABMiller agreed to sell its stake in MillerCoors in the United States for about $12 billion in November. Asahi Group Holdings of Japan has also agreed to buy Peroni and Grolsch, as well as parts of SABMiller\u00e2\u0080\u0099s European operations, for about $2.8 billion. The complexity is a result, in part, of the constant jockeying among exchanges to win business from the biggest traders, many of which are so-called high-frequency trading firms that make money by capitalizing on small changes in prices. RBC Capital Markets, found that the New York Stock Exchange, Nasdaq and other exchanges make frequent small tweaks to their prices, influencing trading behavior in ways that are hard for even sophisticated investors to understand. At one exchange highlighted in the research, EDGX, the pricing tiers, for example, include the \u00e2\u0080\u009cInvestor Tier,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the \u00e2\u0080\u009cUltra Tier,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the \u00e2\u0080\u009cMega-Step-Up Tier 1\u00e2\u0080\u009d and the \u00e2\u0080\u009cMega-Step-Up Tier 2,\u00e2\u0080\u009d among others. These tiers, though, were just the first layer of complication that big investors have to navigate to determine the price of buying or selling a stock. The research is likely to strengthen the hand of IEX, a company that is  asking regulators for approval to become an official stock exchange. The founders of IEX were the protagonists in the Michael Lewis book \u00e2\u0080\u009cFlash Boys\u00e2\u0080\u009d and are hoping to provide a more straightforward way to trade stocks.

Trump on the verge of running away with the Republican nomination, there will be no shortage of drama. As he continues to win primary contests, the pressure on Mr. Trump has been rising, and if the most recent debate was any guide, Senators Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz will be attacking him from all angles in an effort to show that he lacks the knowledge and temperament to be president.Since their last meeting, Mr. Trump has mocked Mr. Rubio for sweating and repeatedly called him a \u201clightweight.\u201d Mr. Rubio has poked fun at Mr. Trump as having small hands and using spray tan that is overly orange. Few pleasantries are expected when they meet on stage.Recent polls show Mr. Trump holding a double-digit lead in Michigan, but his opponents are hopeful that greater scrutiny will erode his advantage.

{"Headline": "Fidel Castro Is Out of Sight as Obama Visits Cuba", "Date": "2016-03-21", "News": "This is not how they imagined it. For years, Cuban exiles in the United States dreamed that the island\u00e2\u0080\u0099s longtime dictator would drop dead one day, ushering a transformational era of greater freedoms on the island and reconciliation among its citizens on both sides of the Florida straits. Fidel Castro remains alive. Yet, as President Obama visits the island, transfixing Cubans and resetting their expectations about the future, Mr. Castro is tucked away, out of sight and largely out of mind. A once towering figure in hemispheric politics is gradually fading into irrelevance. His mixed legacy, to be sure, remains embedded in today\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Cuba. The repressive apparatus Mr. Castro established to clamp down on dissent was on display hours before Air Force One touched down in Havana on Sunday, as state police officers swiftly roughed up and hauled away protesters. Members of the Cuban power structure\u00e2\u0080\u0099s old guard, who remain lodged in Cold War ideological trenches, warned that Mr. Obama\u00e2\u0080\u0099s delegation would include Trojan horses.The Cuban government still strenuously defends the principles of egalitarianism that Mr. Castro imposed on Cubans, and argues that warming relations with the United States will have no bearing on the shape Cuba\u00e2\u0080\u0099s socialism takes in the years ahead. Many Cubans are proud, to this day, of the values of a Socialist system that gave rise to one of the most literate and healthy societies in a region of rampant inequality.And yet, the Obama administration\u00e2\u0080\u0099s opening with Cuba has unleashed a desire for change that seems certain to continue growing long after a new American president is sworn in and the octogenarian Castro brothers are buried. On Monday night, Ra\u00c3\u00bal Castro, the younger brother who took the reins from Fidel Castro in 2008, will host Mr. Obama at a state dinner. After that meeting, the anti-imperialist chants that Cuban children have been taught to recite at school for decades will ring increasingly hollow. The long tentacles of the police state will feel ever more intrusive. The rigidity of the centrally planned economy will seem utterly unjustifiable.On Tuesday, Mr. Obama, who is months away from leaving office, will deliver a speech that will be broadcast live on Cuban television. He is expected to speak about human rights, political freedoms and reconciliation. Prominent Cuban exiles \u00e2\u0080\u0094 the people Fidel Castro once branded as worms and traitors \u00e2\u0080\u0094 will be in attendance, sitting alongside Cubans who chose to stay put. If Mr. Obama succeeds in encouraging economic and political reforms in the short term, it will be through persuasion, rather than the failed policy of subterfuge that did more to tighten than undermine the Castros\u00e2\u0080\u0099 grasp on power. Wisely, Mr. Obama is not attempting to dictate exactly how Cuba ought to change, or how quickly. That is a course that only Cubans should chart out. Instead, Mr. Obama has recognized that the key to greater freedoms and more prosperity in Cuba lies in building bridges between the Cubans who stayed and the millions who left. Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Narendra Modi Struggles to Fulfill His Plan to Rejuvenate India", "Date": "2016-02-29", "News": "Supported byThe arrest, and the government\u2019s ensuing campaign against people deemed unpatriotic, dominated the headlines, once again distracting attention from the promise of economic rejuvenation that lay at the core of the electrifying campaign that won Mr. Modi overwhelming support in elections nearly two years ago.That has largely been the story of Mr. Modi\u2019s administration. His promise to shake things up and create jobs for the one million people who enter India\u2019s work force each month has become subsumed in political turmoil, often stirred up by radicals in his party pushing a Hindu fundamentalist agenda.And so, as his administration on Monday presented a $287 billion spending plan for the coming year, it did so amid growing disappointment with Mr. Modi and with Asia\u2019s third-largest economy.\u201cHe came to power with high expectations that have not been met,\u201d said Harsh V. Pant, who teaches international relations at King\u2019s College London.China\u2019s weakness and a sluggish global economy have given India a rare opportunity to draw foreign investment, but \u201cwhen you don\u2019t use it, you lose it,\u201d Mr. Pant said.He and other experts say India missed the boat because Mr. Modi\u2019s third budget, like his first two, did not call for major structural reforms. They blame the prime minister\u2019s reluctance to wage those battles on political struggles at home as well as on his party\u2019s losses in local elections last year.\u201cUnless he reins in the Tea Party elements of his party, he\u2019s not going to be able to take India where it has the potential to go,\u201d said Surjit Bhalla, a New Delhi-based columnist and macroeconomic adviser on India to the Observatory Group, a consultancy in New York.India\u2019s economy is performing well, with 7.6 percent growth and the lowest inflation in decades, but even by the government\u2019s own admission, growth is below the 8 to 10 percent needed to provide jobs to India\u2019s rapidly growing population of young people.India faces huge hurdles to growth, including widespread corruption, a suffocating bureaucracy, enormous social spending, a stifling business environment and woeful infrastructure. But Mr. Modi\u2019s spending plan focused mainly on rural India, which has been suffering from two years of drought. The plan called for a raft of new policies, including crop insurance and credit programs for farmers, even as Mr. Modi put $5.6 billion into a program started under the previous government guaranteeing 100 days of work to every rural household.The budget stuck with the government\u2019s plan to lower the fiscal deficit to 3.5 percent of India\u2019s gross domestic product in the next year, as urged by Raghuram Rajan, the widely respected governor of the Reserve Bank of India, the central bank.The austerity measures, combined with increased social spending, were accomplished by allocating far less money than needed to recapitalize government banks, which are struggling with bad loans and are less able to lend to India\u2019s cash-starved corporate sector. Infrastructure spending was higher in the proposed budget but fell far short of the infusion needed to spur growth, experts said.Mr. Modi came to power in May 2014 on the promise of bringing more growth and jobs, with his government pledging to make the economic changes needed to lure private investment.He tried to change the investment climate, raising foreign investment caps for military contractors and insurance companies to 49 percent, from 26 percent. But the refusal to allow outsiders to gain majority stakes remains a disincentive for foreign investors.Mr. Modi ran into political trouble when he tried to ease India\u2019s strict land-use laws to make it easier for the government and private companies to build industrial plants and infrastructure. Opposition parties used a Hindi phrase to cast him as running a \u201csuit and boot\u201d government, working only in the interests of the rich, and Mr. Modi pulled back.He also proposed a constitutional amendment aimed at creating a more business-friendly environment by putting in a simplified nationwide tax system, but that stalled in Parliament last year.Adding to Mr. Modi\u2019s woes, he has found himself on the defensive as the radical right wing of his party and offshoots have adopted an aggressive agenda that has sometimes spilled over into violence.There was also a series of attacks on Christian schools and churches.\u201cThe people who supported the B.J.P. were voting for Mr. Modi, overlooking the radical right wing of his party, because he promised to focus on jobs and growth,\u201d Mr. Bhalla said. \u201cIt\u2019s a mystery as to why he hasn\u2019t acted more strongly to rein in the Neanderthals.\u201dDespite widespread criticism, the Modi government has gone on the offensive, with the education minister denouncing the student last week. Parliament was adjourned in the ensuing mayhem.Tarun Das, a former director general of the Confederation of Indian Industry, said that Mr. Modi had worked behind the scenes to stop the radical right-wingers in his party, and that the prime minister would do so again.\u201cHe will take action, just give him some time,\u201d Mr. Das said.Nonetheless, Mr. Modi\u2019s popularity has diminished as observers question his desire or ability to implement economic changes.\u201cThe economic and the political cannot be separated,\u201d Mr. Bhalla said. \u201cThe prime minister needs public opinion on his side to get bills through Parliament. How can he have public opinion on his side if he\u2019s arresting students?\u201d\u201cIt will make economic progress impossible,\u201d he added.Hari Kumar contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

Even with the country\u2019s new restaurateurs and innkeepers, more beauticians have put down their clippers and more farmers have left their crops behind.\u201cI think some people suffer from a lack of vision,\u201d Mr. Camacho said. \u201cMany people also live in a precarious situation, in humble surroundings or even extreme poverty.\u201dRecent migration patterns cast doubt on how much faith Cubans have in private-sector reforms. Last week, after Costa Rica cleared out dozens of shelters filled with Cuban migrants, sending them on the United States, 1,000 more showed up at its border with Panama.\u201cIf you take a census of Cuba now, I\u2019m not sure what would be left,\u201d said Jenny Heredia Oca\u00f1a, 33, a former hospital administrator who recently closed her beauty salon in Havana and left for the United States.On her way she was marooned for months in Costa Rica, shuffling between migrant shelters where she encountered thousands of fellow Cubans.Federal figures show that at least 63,000 Cubans moved to the United States last year, the bulk of them crossing the southwestern border on foot. More than 250,000 Cubans have been granted residency during the Obama administration alone \u2014 enough to populate a city almost the size of Orlando, Fla.In 2014, 122,000 Cubans were on the waiting list to join their families, one of the longest lists for American visas in the world.\u201cIf the Cuban economy continues to falter, many Cubans will vote with their feet,\u201d said Richard E. Feinberg, the author of \u201cOpen for Business,\u201d a book about Cuba\u2019s new economy.Yet even as tens of thousands of Cubans have given up on their homeland, millions have opted to stay.\u201cMaybe 50,000 or 75,000 people left \u2014 that still means 11.2 million are still there,\u201d said Mr. Feinberg, whose book includes a chapter on millennials who have chosen to remain in Cuba.Under new rules that allow private enterprise, the Cuban government had issued about 496,000 small business licenses by the end of last year. Nearly one-third of those business owners are young people.\u201cWhen people started to travel and could do so without being forced to stay abroad, it changed life here \u2014 the way people lived, the way they dressed,\u201d said Emisleidy Maza Ramos, 27, who holds a number of jobs, including at her boyfriend\u2019s food delivery business. \u201cThere\u2019s a difference in the air.\u201dAlvin Pino Estrada, the owner of D\u2019Abuela (\u201cGrandma\u2019s\u201d), opened his business a month ago and employs 12 people. He said he struggled to find supplies like napkins and plastic forks, raw materials like potatoes, and industrial equipment.\u201cIt has to work,\u201d said Mr. Pino Estrada, a former musician who returned to Cuba after living in Spain for three years. \u201cI\u2019m not motivated to leave.\u201dCharles Shapiro, a former American ambassador to Venezuela who heads the World Affairs Council of Atlanta and travels frequently to Cuba, said people who stayed were increasingly able to live comfortably, particularly in contrast to neighbors who earn $25 a month in state jobs.\u201cI met a tour guide who was recently offered a scholarship to get a master\u2019s in Washington, who makes $1,000 a week in tips,\u201d Mr. Shapiro said. \u201cHe\u2019s staying.\u201dThe biggest problem in growing entrepreneurship, he added, is the stranglehold on the supply chain.\u201cThe supply of spare parts, for food, for toilet paper, it\u2019s in the hands of the government,\u201d he said.Igor Thondike, who worked as a glassmaker in Cuba and recently moved to Tampa, Fla., said many new business owners back home could not get materials. Shoemakers, he said, could not find leather and \u201clost their investments.\u201dIhosvany Oscar Artiles Ferrer, 44, a veterinarian who worked in Camag\u00fcey but recently moved to Queens, said the lack of wholesalers to buy supplies from made it difficult to eke out a profit.Photographs from a land of endless waiting and palpable erosion \u2014 but also, an uncanny openness among everyday people.\u201cIn the beginning, almost all of us were revolutionaries,\u201d he added. \u201cBut now, we quit all that because we don\u2019t believe in Fidel, in the revolution, in socialism or anything.\u201dThe Obama administration clearly hopes that as the Castro government moves toward economic reform and Washington permits more commerce and travel, more Cubans will stay put, slowing the steady stream of exits that has contributed to a broader migration crisis.But Cuba also benefits from those who leave. Many businesses on the island begin with the remittances \u00e9migr\u00e9s send back from the United States. The Camachos said that it took about $25,000 to start a business like their cookie company, and that they were fortunate to count on American citizens in their immediate family.Benjamin J.

Many Cubans have said they have rushed to leave because they fear that after normalizing relations, Mr. Obama will do away with migratory policies that give Cubans special status in the United States.Such American laws are \u201cselective, politically motivated and encourage illegal, unsafe and disorderly migration,\u201d Mr. Rodr\u00edguez said at a news conference on Thursday.Holly Ackerman, who studies Cuban migration at Duke University, said this recent wave of migration was still smaller than other episodes, like the rafter exodus in 1994 and the Mariel boatlift in 1980, which were directly prompted by the Cuban government.\u201cThis is a self-initiated surge,\u201d Ms. Ackerman said. \u201cIf it were government-initiated surge, it would be a stampede at this point.\u201dBecause of an editing error, an earlier version of this article referred incorrectly to the owner of D\u2019Abuela (\u201cGrandma\u2019s\u201d).

{"Headline": "For China Banks, Swapping Stock for Debt Is a Stopgap With Pitfalls", "Date": "2016-03-10", "News": "Supported byHONG KONG \u2014 A new approach to managing China\u2019s corporate debt burden may offer temporary relief for banks but spell further difficulties for the country\u2019s economy: having deeply troubled companies use stock to pay overdue loans.Early evidence of the strategy emerged late Thursday, when a heavily indebted Chinese shipbuilder disclosed that it would issue equity to its creditors, instead of repaying $2.17 billion in bank loans.If Chinese companies were to broadly adopt the approach for their debt issues, banks could temporarily shore up their balance sheets by replacing troubled loans with shares that have at least some value. But accepting stakes in highly indebted companies is likely to make banks even more reluctant to shut them down.And that could mean China will be stuck with enormous overcapacity in industrial sectors including shipbuilding, steel and cement, hampering economic growth for years to come.\u201cThe program amounts to a sleight of hand that beautifies bank balance sheets but hardly comes to grips with the basic problems of bad loans, distorted incentives in the banking and state enterprise systems, and weak financial regulation,\u201d said Eswar S. Prasad, an economist at Cornell University who used to lead the China division at the International Monetary Fund. \u201cThis is a classic case of putting lipstick on a pig. Bank balance sheets may look prettier but nothing fundamental changes.\u201dThis latest strategy has some advantages. It would allow companies to cut their debt loads. In doing so, they could potentially improve their credit profiles, borrow more from banks, and keep their businesses running.It also makes banks\u2019 loan books appear healthier, since they can reduce the amount of past-due loans. Financial markets have been fixated on Chinese banks\u2019 portfolios of so-called nonperforming loans. And halting the recent expansion of these loans has become a high priority for Chinese bank executives.While repaying loans with shares might seem a quick solution to China\u2019s enormous debt overhang, it could make the problems more pernicious.In effect, it is just another way for troubled Chinese companies to put off making hard choices, like laying off employees or closing operations. Rather, businesses can continue to limp along, even when their underlying operations are not making money and customer demand has evaporated.Such problems have been at the root of China\u2019s economic issues, as many state-owned enterprises, or S.O.E.s, and private companies have continued to roll over the debt and keep their operations going. The government has supported the tactic, in an effort to avert mass layoffs and maintain social stability.The new approach is \u201cin a nutshell, very bad news for S.O.E. reform and, more specifically, for the solvency of Chinese banks,\u201d said Alicia Garcia Herrero, the chief economist for Asia at Natixis, a French investment bank.At this point, it is unclear how widespread this strategy has become among Chinese companies. The shipbuilder, China Huarong Energy Company Limited, had to disclose the move only because it is listed on the Hong Kong stock market. Mainland companies not listed overseas do not face the same stringent rules.Officials at the People\u2019s Bank of China, the country\u2019s central bank, and the China Banking Regulatory Commission could not be reached for comment late Thursday night. Zhou Xiaochuan, the central bank\u2019s governor, and three of his deputies are scheduled to hold a news conference on Saturday morning in Beijing, near the session of the National People\u2019s Congress.The debt issue is core to the debate over where China\u2019s economy is headed.China avoided most of the ill effects of the global financial crisis by ordering the state-controlled banking system to engineer a major increase in the money supply. Those banks channeled huge loans to companies and to government construction projects.China\u2019s economy is faltering, prompting concerns that are now shaking global stock markets.While the stimulus helped stoke growth, the country\u2019s debt burden ballooned.Overall debt in China was equal to slightly more than one year\u2019s economic output as recently as 2008. It now stands at 2.5 years\u2019 economic output \u2014 above levels considered dangerous in other countries. The debt is still rising, and most of it is owed by companies.The stock-for-debt strategy speaks to the underlying trouble at many companies.China Huarong Energy has been a dismal performer on the Hong Kong stock market. Its shares have tumbled even more steeply than broad mainland Chinese stock indexes, falling 83 percent since late April 2015.The stock-for-debt swap is taking shape as Hong Kong financiers say that China\u2019s bad debt problem has worsened appreciably in recent weeks. The problem, they said in recent interviews, is that more companies are stopping payments on their loans from mainland Chinese banks with the country\u2019s economy continuing to slow.That has begun to produce ripples in China\u2019s financial system. Desperate borrowers have pledged in recent weeks to pay several percentage points in extra interest to borrow in Hong Kong, after finding that banks and other financial institutions on the mainland were reluctant to lend.HSBC warned on Thursday that allowing borrowers to pay in shares was a limited solution to bad debt problems. International bank standards on capital assign a large penalty to holdings of shares, meaning banks must hold extra money against the stock.But China\u2019s five biggest banks have somewhat more capital than the standards require. So they may be able to swap some loans for shares without falling below the required minimums for capital, but are unlikely to resolve large portions of their portfolios of troubled loans through this method.\u201cWe think it is unlikely to be of significant scale given there are limited ways of replenishing\u201d capital once it has been allocated to offset equity holdings, HSBC said in a research note.Advertisement"}

They control fuel companies, television stations and public construction projects, which has many critics comparing his family to the right-wing Somoza dynasty that Mr. Ortega helped topple in 1979.And now rebels are vowing to do the same to him.\u201cDaniel Ortega wasn\u2019t anything, and now he owns half of Nicaragua,\u201d Tyson said.The contras of today, often nicknamed \u201cthe rearmed,\u201d are a shadow of what they once were. They complain they are broke and say the reason they are not more successful is that they do not have international aid, as they did during the Reagan administration.Still, skirmishes in rural areas around the country as recently as last week have left police officers, civilians and soldiers dead, a violent expression of the broader anger brewing against the government.\u201cIt\u2019s a legitimate social cause,\u201d Gonzalo Carri\u00f3n, the director of the Nicaraguan Center for Human Rights, said of the protests against Mr. Ortega.The government denies that politically motivated rebels in the country still exist, despite occasional attacks on police stations and the killings of Sandinistas and known contras. Even when a caravan of Sandinistas was attacked by gunmen after an anniversary celebration in 2014, leaving five dead and 19 wounded, the authorities blamed \u201ccriminal groups\u201d for the massacre.\u201cThere are no armed groups in this country,\u201d Julio C\u00e9sar Avil\u00e9s, the army chief, was widely quoted as saying last year. \u201cI have said it on multiple occasions.\u201dHuman rights organizations accuse the armed forces of a secret assassination campaign. Last summer, a man known as a rebel leader was ambushed and killed in his house. Two people were also killed last year when a backpack sent to rebels by a trusted courier exploded. The most notorious contra leader was gunned down in 2011, and his successor was found full of bullets in a ditch in Honduras a year later.\u201cIt is a silent, dirty war that is not recognized,\u201d said Bishop Abelardo Mata, a Roman Catholic leader who has served as something of a mediator between the two sides. Without any nations backing the rebels, he added, some of them \u201chave resorted\u201d to raising money by working for drug trafficking organizations.\u201cThe army is killing people who were contras in the past,\u201d said Jos\u00e9 N. Rodr\u00edguez, 38, who was injured in the backpack bombing last year. \u201cThey are mounting operations against us by paying off civilians. It is very difficult to win if they pay people off.\u201dRafael Antonio Lanzas, a contra rebel who lost his right eye in the bombing, agreed, saying, \u201cThere are not so many fighters, because they are killing them.\u201dRecovering in a hide-out, the men said they had joined the rebels because they felt targeted for their conservative political beliefs, so they dug up rifles that had been buried for decades.Their mission, Mr. Lanzas said, often involves proselytizing about the newfound riches of the Ortega family and its associates.Venezuela has provided Nicaragua with hundreds of millions of dollars\u2019 worth of oil a year on preferential terms, and the government acknowledges that much of it is invested in private companies closely tied to the Ortega family and its allies.\u201cTo me, it seems they are stealing from the Venezuelans,\u201d said Mr. Carri\u00f3n, the human rights advocate. \u201cThey did not struggle to be chumps.\u201dThe economic turmoil battering Venezuela may prove to be a much bigger threat to the Ortegas than the fledgling rebels. Even so, the oil that Nicaragua has already received in recent years has reshaped the image, and the lifestyles, of the leftist Sandinistas who overthrew a dictatorship in the 1970s.\u201cWe started seeing people in the hierarchy of the ruling party buying luxury cars and $350,000 houses in cash,\u201d said Octavio Enr\u00edquez, an award-winning reporter at Confidencial, a newsmagazine. \u201cWe started to see a new social class.\u201dMr. Ortega\u2019s children and some of their spouses hold top leadership posts at television stations acquired by the government under murky circumstances. His daughter-in-law runs the national chain of gas stations that receives Venezuelan oil. One of Mr. Ortega\u2019s sons, Laureano, who works for the government\u2019s investment promotion agency, was photographed wearing a $47,000 Rolex.The Sandinista party treasurer, Francisco L\u00f3pez, runs the state-owned oil company and a quasi-public entity that has doled out contracts to his own family company to build houses for the poor, Confidencial has reported. Like several other officials, Mr. L\u00f3pez did not respond to requests for an interview.\u201cI would see him coming in from his trips to Venezuela with a diplomatic valise filled with cash,\u201d said Rodrigo Obreg\u00f3n, who worked as a manager at the quasi-public company and attended high school with Mr. L\u00f3pez. \u201cHe and members of his family would close the door and count all night.\u201dMr. Obreg\u00f3n said he lost his job when he refused to sign a rosy audit of the company\u2019s finances.\u201cThe Ortega-Murillo family is getting richer while the country people starve,\u201d a rebel who calls himself Commander Rafael said about the president and his wife, Rosario Murillo. \u201cThey don\u2019t understand resolving things the nice way. They understand weapons.\u201dThe president\u2019s office did not respond to repeated requests for comment. But Bayardo Arce, the president\u2019s economic adviser, who was an original member of the Sandinista directorate during its first time in power, dismissed the issue of Sandinista wealth as a controversy manufactured by the opposition.Mr. Arce defended the use of Venezuelan oil money to fund private companies as a new way of using international development funds, no more improper than the millions of dollars in aid that the United States gives to Nicaraguan civic groups to promote democracy, human rights and governance.He said the Ortega administration must be doing something right. In January, the World Bank projected Nicaragua\u2019s economy to grow by 4.2 percent in 2016, one of the highest rates in Latin America.\u201cOur No. 1 goal is to take this country out of poverty,\u201d Mr. Arce said. \u201cWho decided that the person who believes in social justice has to be barefoot?\u201dMr. Arce, a successful businessman, lives in a handsome home recently built on a 12-acre property confiscated during the war. Though middle-class protesters in the city and contras in the countryside are deeply skeptical of the wealth that has revolved around Mr. Ortega, polls show that the president enjoys strong support.It is no wonder: 38 percent of the Venezuelan oil is used to fund social projects. More than 35,000 houses have been distributed among the poor in the past two years, according to a government website. World Bank statistics show that the poverty level dropped six percentage points from 2005 to 2009.\u201cHe might have an expensive car, but the other presidents before him had their luxuries but did not help the people,\u201d Veronica Aguilar, 55, said of Mr. Ortega.Ms. Aguilar said she met Mr. Ortega in person when she signed up for Houses for the People, a government program that distributes houses to the poor at favorable prices.\u201cHe came over and said \u2018Hello,\u2019 like he knew me!\u201d she said.Her experience underscores the difficulty the rebels face. Few people have a stomach for more war. Many low-income people have benefited from Mr. Ortega\u2019s administration and are hardly bothered by complaints about its excesses.\u201cI won the lottery!\u201d said Ileana Rivas, 62, Ms. Aguilar\u2019s neighbor. She said she got her house by calling a government agency \u2014 and the first lady called her back personally.\u201cYou don\u2019t see those pathetic cases of desperate people in the street that you saw 10, 15 years ago,\u201d said Alejandro Mart\u00ednez, a successful Sandinista businessman who is also an economist. \u201cThere is a distribution of wealth to people who were marginalized before.\u201dThe rebels are not buying it. In a sign of the new allegiance the socialist administration has to the country\u2019s richest people, the government has lifted import taxes for luxury items like yachts and helicopters.\u201cNobody goes to war because they like it,\u201d said Tyson, the rebel. \u201cThe Nicaraguan people are getting robbed.\u201dAdvertisement"}
