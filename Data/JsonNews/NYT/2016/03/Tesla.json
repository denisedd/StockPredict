But as of late, such malfunctions seem to be happening every week or so.There have been hundreds of similar reports in recent months, with homes catching fire and e-cigarettes exploding in people\u2019s pockets (and sometimes in their faces while smoking).But these instances can happen while airborne, too.Battery specialists have warned about explosions for a long time.So what can consumers do to protect themselves?First, they should hold manufacturers accountable for fixing defects, as the carmaker Tesla did with its battery problem.In general, though, the most important step for consumers is not to buy inexpensive gadgets.Most cases of exploding hoverboards and e-cigarettes have occurred with knockoffs made in unregulated factories in China.So don\u2019t try to save money with a cheap e-cigarette. It could blow up in your face.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Why Vinyl Records and Other \u2018Old\u2019 Technologies Die Hard", "Date": "2016-03-16", "News": "Supported byDisruptionsYet one of the most popular destinations for these teenagers is a white, single-story building with big pink letters on the roof that spell \u201cVnyl.\u201d The store sells vinyl records, and the kids who gather there are often in awe.But what I\u2019ve come to realize is that while the new thing gets people excited, the old thing often doesn\u2019t go away. And if it does, it takes a very long time to meet its demise.Just look at film cameras. You would think they have been vanquished from the planet, but millions of people still use them. In 2012, more than 35 million rolls of camera film were sold, compared with 20 million the year before.Other types of physical media have also held on.So why does old tech survive and, in some cases, undergo a revival? For some consumers, it\u2019s about familiarity (e.g., newspapers and print books), while for others, it\u2019s about nostalgia (e.g., record players and film cameras).For example, I\u2019ve been taking photos for over 25 years, and what made me fall in love with photography was the dirt, grit and grime of film (I used to shoot with Tri-X 3200 for the film nerds out there). And as much as I love my digital cameras, I\u2019ve been shooting with film again to capture some of that visceral quality I no longer get with pixels.The resurgence of old tech doesn\u2019t stop with physical media.Of course, there are some outdated technologies that die a fateful death and never return. I don\u2019t know many people with a dedicated car phone, for example. (Though I\u2019m sure some hipster just posted one to Instagram.)Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Field Guide to Male Intimacy", "Date": "2016-03-25", "News": "Supported byModern LoveWhen my car\u2019s battery died on a bitterly cold January day, my father refused to come to my apartment in south Minneapolis to give me a jump.He drives a Tesla and claimed (not quite accurately) that using it to power a regular car would cause it to short-circuit. \u201cPlus, it\u2019s nasty outside,\u201d he said, \u201cand, as you know, your father is a wuss.\u201dLuckily my stepfather, Kevin, agreed to help. He is bald, clean-shaven, slender, friendly and handy. An agricultural engineer, he has a master\u2019s degree in weed science and subscribes to journals such as \u201cWheat Life.\u201d He always knows what time it is. \u201cI\u2019ll be there in 15 minutes,\u201d he said. He arrived at my apartment in 15 minutes.I thought this would be my chance, finally, to impress him. The winter before, I had called him in distress when my car had blown a tire. I didn\u2019t know how to change it, and he had to do it for me, kneeling in the cold on the side of a busy street.He had also, at various points, fixed leaks in my kitchen and helped me assemble (that is, he assembled) a desk from Ikea. Around him I felt inept, and although we are polite to each other (kind, even), my sense is that he views me as his wife\u2019s hapless son, part of the bargain of marrying her.I did know how to jump a car, however, and now made a demonstration of setting the cables in place. \u201cThe red clamp\u2019s on the positive terminal,\u201d I said with authority.Kevin fixed the corresponding clamps to his truck\u2019s battery and said, \u201cLet\u2019s give it a go.\u201dI prayed that the jump would work and that my competence would be established evermore. Outside my window, Kevin gave a rather solemn thumbs-up.I turned the key. The engine sputtered, didn\u2019t engage. I tried again. Nothing.\u201cLooks like you\u2019ll need a new battery,\u201d Kevin said.He and my mother met seven years ago through a dating service called It\u2019s Just Lunch. They discovered common interests in hiking and wine. They went on trips to vineyards, first in rural Minnesota, then to Napa Valley and the Oregon coast. On their hikes, they wore clothes with many pockets and zippers. In the evenings, they visited wineries. Within a year, they were engaged.I was relieved when they married. My mother had spent the previous several years in a muddle. A decade before, without warning, my father had informed her that he was gay, and their marriage dissolved. The future she had expected (simply, to be with him) also dissolved. In its place was nothing.I was 16 at the time, and for my last two years of high school, we lived alone. For her, it was an era of bathrobes, insomnia, Sleepytime tea, Kleenex, rationalization (\u201ceverything happens for a reason\u201d), reheated leftovers and worry.Kevin appeared as a steady arm.My relationship with him has evolved slowly and sometimes awkwardly. We\u2019re members of the same gym and sometimes see each other in the locker room. If we\u2019re both naked, we make a point of speaking, as if doing so will shield us from the mild embarrassment of our nudity, from the Oedipal drama once removed. Our talk is stilted, crisp: \u201cHey! How are you?\u201d \u201cGood.\u201d \u201cGood!\u201d \u201cO.K. Good to see you.\u201d \u201cYes!\u201d (Exclamations are mine.) But in truth, this is how we always are. If we\u2019re out to dinner or happen to meet in the grocery store, we still act as if we\u2019re naked in the locker room.Now, I wondered how we might get my car to a repair shop to have the battery replaced. Kevin made it known we would be changing it ourselves.From the back of his truck he took out his toolbox. \u201cYup, it\u2019s always with me,\u201d he said. The heads of wrenches and screwdrivers shone inside as if they had never been used. No, it was as if they had been used often but cleaned extremely well.We took off our gloves and set to work. The temperature was below zero. Snot froze in our noses. Our breath huffed up above us.Kevin loosened the bolts that held the battery in place. So we wouldn\u2019t lose them, I placed the nuts in a ceramic coffee mug that had been in my car. This was my job, to hold the mug. Our hands quickly became achy with numbness. When Kevin could no longer feel his fingers, he suggested we warm up in his truck.The truck\u2019s interior, like Kevin\u2019s toolbox, was spotless. In the years he\u2019d owned it, he had made zero imprint upon the inside of the truck. But then I thought: No, tidiness was his mark. He is an orderly man and maintains his truck to his fullest expression. The radio was tuned to the Vikings-Seahawks playoff game. Teddy Bridgewater threw an incomplete pass. The Vikings, as ever, punted.\u201cNot looking good,\u201d I said. \u201cI mean, not sounding good. Ha.\u201d\u201cNope,\u201d Kevin said.Thus, our conversation reached its terminus.My phone buzzed in my pocket \u2014 my father. His message said: \u201cPicture\u2019s ready. Plz pick up.\u201dWe had recently spent two hours in a picture frame shop consulting each other on how best to frame an illustration of a Dutch trade ship. (\u201cSee, Son, you don\u2019t want the frame to overpower the picture. And the backing should have a little color to it, but again, you don\u2019t want it to overwhelm.\u201d)My father and I could have a picture framed artfully, but we couldn\u2019t replace a car battery. If left to our own devices, those devices would break and would stay broken until we paid people to fix them. My inheritance was a moderate streak of dandyism and a set of deficient motor skills. As I typed him a reminder that I was momentarily without transportation, my phone\u2019s screen went black. Its battery, too, had died.The battery store, a rectangular building with a pair of chimneys on top, resembled a battery. When my eyeglasses defogged, I saw batteries of all sizes gleaming on the shelves. I carried my dead battery in my hands feeling a little silly about it, as if I were taking my own half-eaten croissant into a pastry shop.The Vikings game was on the radio here, too. Six clerks stood around a counter, looking upward toward a ceiling speaker. One of them mentioned how many rushing yards the Vikings\u2019 running back had accumulated during the season. Another mentioned how many he had two years ago. A third added how close he was to breaking the season record.They were playing a game of their own, as men often do: a game of information, to see who knew the most. Eventually one of the clerks saw us and approached.I explained, holding my dead battery, that I needed a new battery. The clerk led us to a shelf and showed us three that looked the same. He explained how they weren\u2019t. All I understood was that their prices were different. Kevin suggested I get the second-cheapest one \u2014 just as I would have done, applying the wine theory I use in restaurants.As I paid, the Vikings missed a field goal that would have won the game, so they lost. Many knowledgeable Minnesotans had predicted this, and in predicting it had secretly hoped it would happen, which made the loss, in a backward way, a win. The clerk looked up at the speaker. \u201cJust like \u201898,\u201d he said.\u201cThe Atlanta Falcons,\u201d Kevin said. \u201cGary Anderson.\u201d\u201cFirst field goal he missed all year.\u201dI understood the game\u2019s rules but couldn\u2019t participate. I was a spectator of my gender.As we installed the new battery, the dynamic between Kevin and me didn\u2019t shift. I stood beside him, holding the mug of nuts and screws. Now and then he pointed, directing me to shine a flashlight under the hood. He worked quickly, seldom speaking. He spoke so little, in fact, that he never spoke. But our quiet was relaxed; we were united by our task.When Kevin\u2019s fingers went numb, he handed me the wrench. Without a word, he nodded his head. My hands were cold as well, nearly useless. But I saw it was important to him that I finish the work on my own car. My brain told my fist to close around the wrench and not let go, lest my incompetence reveal itself. Soon the new battery was in place.I stepped into my car. Outside my window, Kevin gave a rather solemn thumbs-up. He didn\u2019t smile when the engine started, but by not smiling, he did.\u201cYou\u2019re all set,\u201d he said.We removed our gloves and shook hands. Our hands were chilly and blocky, but we had put them to good use. Through them, we had communed and communicated. And our handshake, I sensed, had completed our conversation in the secret language of male intimacy, a language in which I am still struggling to gain fluency.Max Ross is a writer who lives in Minneapolis.Modernlove@nytimes.comAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Streetcar Not Desired by Everyone in Brooklyn", "Date": "2016-03-27", "News": "Supported byNot Nick Defonte. \u201cI think it\u2019s a great idea,\u201d Mr. Defonte, 61, said from a table in the back of Defonte\u2019s Sandwich Shop, which his family has owned since 1922. Mr. Defonte said he would welcome the development and the new residents that a streetcar could bring to the area.\u201cThis neighborhood was rough,\u201d he said, recalling the violence and the drug traffic that plagued the Red Hook area throughout the 1980s and 1990s. \u201cIt\u2019s a long time coming.\u201dMany of the more than 10,000 residents of Red Hook credit its isolation \u2014 it is surrounded on three sides by water and cut off from the nearest subway by the Gowanus Expressway \u2014 with keeping housing costs lower, the streets quieter and gentrification slower than in other parts of Brooklyn.However, that does not mean that the postindustrial district of crumbling brick warehouses, public housing blocks and quaint row homes has been untouched by development. Upscale boutiques now line Van Brunt Street, shells of luxury condominiums under construction dot the sleepy neighborhood, and major businesses like Tesla Motors and Ikea have moved in.Another resident worried that the streetcar, proposed by Mayor Bill de Blasio, a Democrat, in his State of the City address last month, might further drive up housing prices and threaten the shabby charm of the district, which saw its first traffic light installed in 2006. \u201cRed Hook is one of the few neighborhoods that\u2019s still affordable,\u201d said Martha Wollner, 65, who moved there in 2009. \u201cWe\u2019re going to have a very different profile down here.\u201dTom Angotti, a professor of urban planning at Hunter College, said Ms. Wollner\u2019s fears were justified. A streetcar line \u201cwould accelerate gentrification and accelerate the displacement of industry, low-income renters and property owners,\u201d he said. \u201cIn fact, that\u2019s the stated objective of the proposal,\u201d Professor Angotti said of New York City leaders\u2019 claim that rising property tax revenues along the route could defray the estimated $2.5 billion cost of the project.While calling the streetcar proposal \u201cvisionary,\u201d Assemblyman F\u00e9lix W. Ortiz, a Democrat whose district includes Red Hook, urged residents to get involved in the planning process to minimize the risk of displacement. \u201cThat way the community doesn\u2019t feel that they\u2019ve been left out,\u201d he said.Councilman Carlos Menchaca, a Democrat who represents the neighborhood, agreed, writing in an email that the streetcar could \u201coffer relief to historic transit deserts like Red Hook.\u201d But the possibility of the line accelerating gentrification is \u201ca very real risk,\u201d he added. \u201cThat is why a local community-driven design approach at the beginning of the process is so important.\u201dThe streetcar would travel 16 miles between Sunset Park, Brooklyn, and Astoria, Queens. Though the plan is far from finalized, city officials said service could begin as soon as 2024.The Defontes were not the only members of Red Hook\u2019s old guard to support the streetcar.\u201cWe all want it,\u201d said Lillie Marshall, the tenant association president of Red Hook West, one wing of the area\u2019s public housing complex. Ms. Marshall, 73, who claimed to speak on behalf of the 6,500 public housing residents in the complex, has lived in the neighborhood since 1966.Ms. Marshall chalked up opposition to the plan to some newer residents who were resistant to change. \u201cThey groan and moan for every little doggone thing,\u201d she said, citing previous battles over Ikea, Fairway Market and other developments.During the 19th and early 20th centuries, Red Hook was one of the most active shipping hubs in New York, according to Marcia Reiss, who has written several books on the history of the city. \u201cIt became a massive port,\u201d she said. But most of the shipping industry \u2014 and its jobs \u2014 moved to New Jersey in the 1960s.In the 1980s, outsiders took notice of Red Hook\u2019s lower cost of living, cobblestone streets and sweeping views of Manhattan and began moving in.John McGettrick, co-chairman of the Red Hook Civic Association, bought his house there in 1988. He said he was cautiously optimistic about the streetcar proposal and hoped that any construction it spurs would be moderate and scaled to the neighborhood. \u201cIt will happen to some degree, inevitably,\u201d he said of new development. \u201cTo the extent that you can slow it down and limit its extent, that may be as much as the people in one community can do.\u201dvideoAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "General Motors to Buy Cruise Automation in Push for Self-Driving Cars", "Date": "2016-03-11", "News": "Supported byG.M., the largest automaker in the United States, has been aggressively expanding its portfolio of new businesses dedicated to driverless cars and other personal mobility options like ride-hailing services.It would be a rich payday for Cruise and its investors, which include venture firms such as Spark Capital and Felicis Ventures. Cruise was valued at $90 million in a fund-raising round late last year before the acquisition, the people said.Founded in 2013, Cruise has been successful in adapting conventional cars to operate on highways with self-driving features. The company installs sensors, computer equipment and other devices that can control steering, braking and acceleration.Other automakers, including Tesla, Audi and Mercedes-Benz, are also rapidly adding equipment that allows vehicles to partly drive themselves. And the technology giant Google is in advanced stages of developing cars that function without any driver involvement.Industry analysts said the G.M. deal underscored how competitive the race toward autonomous vehicles had become.\u201cLike it or not, autonomous cars are coming, and coming fast,\u201d said Akshay Anand, an analyst with the auto research firm Kelley Blue Book.G.M. executives said the acquisition of Cruise was a critical building block in its autonomous-driving efforts. \u201cWe intend to invest significantly to further grow the talent base and capabilities,\u201d said Mark L. Reuss, G.M.\u2019s chief of global product development.Kyle Vogt, the founder of Cruise, said that joining G.M. would accelerate development of his company\u2019s technology. \u201cThis is a groundbreaking step toward rapidly commercializing autonomous vehicle technology,\u201d said Mr. Vogt.While automakers press forward with new technology, federal officials are also stepping up their efforts to regulate driverless cars and set appropriate safety standards.Transportation Secretary Anthony Foxx said on Friday that regulators would hold public meetings this spring in California and Washington to gather information on potential guidelines for autonomous vehicles.\u201cWe are witnessing a revolution in auto technology that has the potential to save thousands of lives,\u201d said Mr. Foxx. \u201cIn order to achieve that potential, we need to establish guidelines for manufacturers that clearly outline how we expect autonomous vehicles to function.\u201dA recent report prepared for the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration found few existing regulatory hurdles to conventional cars equipped with autonomous technology.However, the agency said it needed guidelines for more advanced vehicle designs that, for example, may eliminate steering wheels and brake pedals from autonomous models.Bill Vlasic reported from Detroit and Mike Isaac from New York.Advertisement"}
