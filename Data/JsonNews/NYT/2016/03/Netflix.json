{"Headline": "Letter of Recommendation: Segmented Sleep", "Date": "2016-03-31", "News": "Supported byLetter of RecommendationLate last year, an edgy, blanked-\u00adout feeling nestled in with me and wouldn\u2019t leave. I\u2019d find myself sitting at my desk, facing emails that I couldn\u2019t remember sending and deeply wished to retract. How had my life been put in the hands of someone like me? I had no attention, no patience; whatever I did, I was bored 10 seconds later. I closed my eyes and saw browser tabs on the inside of my lids.Soon insomnia knocked me totally out of sync, and I compensated one night by nodding off at 8 p.m. That caused me to wake up at 2 a.m., disoriented. I spent a few hours brooding, then slept again until 6, when I got up, had coffee and showered. Tired again at 8 p.m., I repeated the pattern the following night. And the next, and the next, until I was regularly entering the forgotten, ancient tunnel to the other side of midnight: segmented sleep. It looked embarrassing in a modern context, but it was once the most normal thing in the world.We tend to view our basic patterns, like spending the evening out and then lying unconscious for eight hours straight, as belonging to a natural order. But until streetlights, being up late meant wandering town in butt-\u00adclenching terror, tripping over stray animals until the wind blew out your lantern and you were set upon by armed bandits. So you went home before dark and went to bed early, waking after midnight. Much of this was forgotten until 2001, when the historian Roger Ekirch unearthed segmented sleep in the cultural history of pre-\u00ad19th-\u00adcentury Europe, supporting the research of an American chronobiologist who, in a 1992 study, asserted that segmented sleep is more natural than the monophasic variety we now aspire to. Exposed over several weeks to preindustrial light conditions, most of us will gradually start sleeping twice a night, hooked to the Ur-\u00adrhythm of our internal clock.Jesse Barron is a writer in New York.Advertisement"}

A trip to South by Southwest.It has been 28 years since the last Pee-Wee Herman film, \u201cBig Top Pee-wee,\u201d and the new one, \u201cPee-wee\u2019s Big Holiday,\u201d has finally arrived. The movie, which is being unveiled at the South by Southwest film festival ahead of its Friday release on Netflix, has the gray-suited, red-bow-tied character up to a few tricks fans will recognize, along with a few surprises that will help introduce younger audiences to the character.What got you interested in bringing back Pee-wee?I guess just time. I\u2019d been trying to get a new Pee-wee movie made for several years. I stopped doing it for a while because I really felt like I had enough of it. And then I started to feel like there was more to do. It just turned out to take longer than I thought it would.You wrote two other unproduced scripts before \u201cPee-wee\u2019s Big Holiday\u201d was made. Would you tell me about those?One is the movie version of my children\u2019s show, \u201cPee-wee\u2019s Playhouse: The Movie.\u201d In that television show, we almost never left the playhouse. This is an epic adventure that takes place outside the playhouse. The other one is kind of a black comedy about fame. I\u2019ve often referred to it as my \u201cValley of the Dolls\u201d Pee-wee script.And how did the new script come to be?There was a little bit of a lull after we wrote it where the project was in limbo. [But] Netflix agreed to have a meeting with me and Judd. They wanted to make the movie.How did it go making this one?What we got with Netflix was an extraordinarily generous budget and complete artistic freedom. For me, it\u2019s an incredible experience and one I\u2019ve been lucky to have more than once in my career. \u201cPee-wee\u2019s Playhouse\u201d was a situation of complete artistic freedom from CBS. And even \u201cBig Adventure\u201d and \u201cBig Top,\u201d Warner Bros. and Paramount let us shoot those movies first draft.These three Pee-wee movies don\u2019t connect together narratively. Could you talk about why you didn\u2019t want to make movies that would tell a continued story?I always wanted each to be self-contained. I always thought that what they would have in common is that they would all open with a dream that I would wake up from, and that each one would have the word \u201cbig\u201d in the title. Other than that, I\u2019ve never felt hampered by one single rule. It could be anything. Maybe it\u2019s confusing, but it doesn\u2019t bother me. But we did make one change. One day during the shoot, when I got on the back of [another character\u2019s] motorcycle, the line I originally said was, \u201cI\u2019ve never been on a motorcycle.\u201d And one of the crew guys said, \u201cExcuse me, Mr. Reubens, but that\u2019s my favorite part of \u2018Big Adventure,\u2019 when you\u2019re on the motorcycle.\u201d So we changed it to \u201cI have very little experience.\u201dHow do you feel about taking the movie to Austin?It\u2019s a phenomenal place. I\u2019m super-excited about the barbecue. And if you know \u201cBig Adventure\u201d at all, you know I\u2019m somebody who loves Texas. I think Texas likes Pee-wee Herman as a result of all of that. And it\u2019s an interesting, quirky way to open a movie.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "As a Data Deluge Grows, Companies Rethink Storage", "Date": "2016-03-14", "News": "Supported byMOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif. \u2014 John Hayes, cleareyed and wild-haired, stood before his silent creation. Big as a slim refrigerator, it held 16 petabytes of data, roughly equal to 16 billion thick books.\u201cPeople are going to have to think about things to put into this,\u201d he said, surrounded by the clutter of his office at a Silicon Valley company called Pure Storage. \u201cBut that won\u2019t take long \u2014 there\u2019s a demand for data that nobody was ready for.\u201dEach month, the world\u2019s one billion cellphones throw out 18 exabytes of data, equal to 1,100 of Mr. Hayes\u2019s boxes. There are also millions of sensors in things ranging from cars and appliances to personal fitness trackers and cameras.IBM estimates that by 2020 we will have 44 zettabytes \u2014 the thousandfold number next up from exabytes \u2014 generated by all those devices. It is so much information that Big Blue is staking its future on so-called machine learning and artificial intelligence, two kinds of pattern-finding software built to cope with all that information.Making storage products has long been a major part of the tech industry. It has also been one of the dullest, with little in the way of innovation. Now the surge in data is leading both start-ups and some of tech\u2019s biggest companies to rethink how they approach the problem.Pure, co-founded by Mr. Hayes, a 38-year-old former video karaoke engineer, is one of several companies trying new approaches.Mr. Hayes\u2019s box, which was unveiled on Monday, holds five times as much data as a conventional storage device, thanks to a combination of so-called flash storage technology and clever engineering. Sometime in 2017, he said, it will hold twice that much, as Pure tweaks the product. Power consumption, the company says, is 4 percent of the current standard.While traditional storage works much like a record player, with data stored on and fetched from spinning disks, flash storage gets data directly on and off a semiconductor. Flash storage has become common in consumer tech products like smartphones.The new Pure system is also built in blades, which act like building blocks. Add a blade, and the overall system reconfigures to raise efficiency. There is space on the device for additional processing, so a blade could easily be added.\u201cIt\u2019s not just about Google and Facebook,\u201d said Joe Unsworth, an analyst with Gartner. \u201cHealth care, manufacturing and natural resources companies can all justify owning this much storage. In 10 years, a big sanitation company with sensors on its Dumpsters to manage pickups could have tens of petabytes.\u201dPure is hardly alone in working on new ways to handle the world\u2019s immense data deluge. The industry leader, EMC, has both traditional and advanced storage, including flash. EMC was bought by Dell in October for $67 billion. \u201cIf Dell hadn\u2019t bought them, I\u2019d wonder what Dell was going to do,\u201d Mr. Unsworth said.Netflix, which offers streaming video to 75 million people in 190 countries, ships dozens of custom-built appliances a week to hundreds of local Internet service providers. The newest, a mix of flash and traditional storage, can store five petabytes \u2014 enough, the company figures, to hold almost anything from its catalog that anyone, anywhere would want to watch, for now.The company analyzes data to figure out both the kind of content it should offer next, and the Internet\u2019s capacity to stream all that entertainment. \u201cWe arguably have the most insight of anybody,\u201d said Ken Florance, vice president of content delivery at Netflix. \u201cThere are networks in Kenya that are better than some networks in the U.S.\u201dCapturing and analyzing masses of data already touches improbable corners, like championship auto racing. Mercedes AMG Petronas, the racing arm of the Daimler car company, is an early customer of the new Pure blades.Mercedes AMG has about 300 sensors on each high-performance car. Much the way human athletes are regulated for substances, racing officials now limit the amount of computation cars can use, including wind tunnel simulations between races, so it pays to move data quickly.\u201cThey audit the amount of processing we use,\u201d said Matt Harris, the head of information technology for Mercedes AMG. \u201cIf we can cut a few seconds off each job with faster storage, that\u2019s an extra simulation a month.\u201dPure is in a race of its own. The company went public in October, and since then its stock has fallen one-third from the highs reached soon after. The new flash blade product line will not be important for revenue this year, but the company\u2019s chief executive, Scott Dietzen, hopes it will calm disappointed investors.\u201cNo one can look at all their data anymore; they need algorithms just to decide what to look at,\u201d he said, adding that he planned to offer 10 times the performance of competing products, at a lower cost. \u201cThis market is at least as large as our original storage business, and a lot bigger over time.\u201dMr. Hayes didn\u2019t set out to shake up a once-staid storage world. In 2006, he was a software engineer at a company that did online karaoke talent searches, when it was purchased by Yahoo.When Yahoo killed the product, he became a promoter of Yahoo\u2019s social networks, then quit in 2009. His old bosses at the karaoke company, backed by venture capitalists, were looking at a way to use flash and needed a good coder.The first Pure Storage product came out in 2012.By mid-2013, he was thinking about how he would build his product for a world of falling memory prices, and rapidly rising amounts of data inside cloud computing systems.Working with Mr. Dietzen and investors, he set up a venture inside Pure but away from the rest of the company, hiring a team of experienced people from places like Oracle, Microsoft Research and Facebook. Mr. Dietzen hopes investors will now see where some formerly unexplained research and development money has gone.\u201cHe got people you couldn\u2019t recruit if you were a start-up \u2014 midcareer \u2014 who wouldn\u2019t work at a place that was going to run out of money, but wanted to be in something small and challenging,\u201d said Par Botes, an early hire who was chief technology officer at EMC. Like others in the effort, Mr. Botes has a LinkedIn profile that says only that he is at a \u201cstealth mode start-up technology company.\u201dFrom an original group of five people, the quiet project inside Pure has grown to 80, and Mr. Hayes sees a need for many more.\u201cI\u2019ve talked to companies planning for hundreds of petabytes,\u201d he said. \u201cEven a body camera on a cop adds up data pretty quickly.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Sketch Comedy\u2019s New Faces on TV", "Date": "2016-03-13", "News": "Supported byCritic\u2019s NotebookEndless supply of young, funny people; endless need for small-screen content: Yeah, it makes perfect sense that sketch comedy is suddenly turning up across the TV landscape. Some of it is kind of lazy, like Fox\u2019s new \u201cParty Over Here.\u201d But some of it is enlivening usually drab corners, like \u201cNight Class\u201d on \u2014 what? \u2014 the History channel. And, best of all, some of it is brashly experimental.That last category describes \u201cThe Characters,\u201d an eight-part offering that went up Friday on Netflix. It\u2019s a sort of long-form variation of the usual mishmash of short skits. Eight comics have each been given a full show \u2014 roughly a half-hour each \u2014 to do whatever they want, and the best results are comedic tapestries full of interconnected characters and sharp satire.At the courthouse, there is an outlandish collection of other jurors. Best of all is a devastating side trip to a doctor\u2019s office, where a white patient is treated by another of Ms. Rothwell\u2019s characters for chigger bites. White people are scared of chiggers.Ms. Rothwell plays most of the main characters, and by the half-hour\u2019s end she has created a microcosm of American society and its problems.\u201cI don\u2019t relate to the title of artist,\u201d Denise says. \u201cI don\u2019t like it when people force that on me. It brutalizes me into a genre, and that\u2019s an act of violence.\u201dYes, this world is an easy target, but Ms. Berlant bores into it with an admirable relentlessness. A few of the \u201cCharacters\u201d episodes are a bit too much like audition reels, but for the most part these comics have made good use of the opportunity.There was a sketch in which Ms. Rich got excessively excited about yogurt; one in which a young suffragist (Ms. Rich again) didn\u2019t quite grasp the importance of the cause; a \u201cBeauty and the Beast\u201d parody in which Belle may have climbed into bed with the wrong beast. It was so-so stuff, which isn\u2019t enough to separate this series from \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d or the sketches that are all over the late-night talk shows these days. Yes, sketch comedy is an easy and cheap way to fill airtime, but the bar is getting higher.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "In \u2018The Path,\u2019 on Hulu, Losing Faith Means Losing Love", "Date": "2016-03-25", "News": "Supported byA religious movement \u2014 some call it a cult \u2014 Meyerism offers adherents the promise of leaving behind all their pain and suffering by climbing the rungs of a metaphorical ladder toward the Light and postapocalyptic immortality. In the spare cabins that dot the property, one can even find pamphlets promising guidance in overcoming domestic abuse, marital infidelities and other ills of modern existence.What kind of spiritual void draws people to such movements? What happens when a staunch believer (Mr. Paul of \u201cBreaking Bad\u201d) begins questioning everything he\u2019s bought into? And when those cracks appear, what are he and the people around him willing to do to uphold their convictions?\u201cEverything is started with this desire for beauty and for a better life and a better world,\u201d Ms. Goldberg said. \u201cBut then it doesn\u2019t work out that way.\u201dThe creative spark for \u201cThe Path\u201d came during one of the darkest times in Ms. Goldberg\u2019s life. Earlier this decade, her father died shortly after learning he had cancer, and her 10-year marriage (to the actor Hamish Linklater) crumbled into divorce.While Ms. Goldberg considers herself a \u201cdoubter\u201d when it comes to matters of religion, she found herself undergoing a crisis of faith. \u201cAnd that sort of emotional storm was really the idea for the show,\u201d she said.She knew she wanted to write about the fallout after one half of a couple stops believing in the marriage. The inspiration for the Meyerist Movement was slightly more mysterious.When she tackled writing the script a few years later during a break from \u201cParenthood,\u201d \u201cthere was a lot of stuff in the zeitgeist about ISIS, of extreme faith\u201d in the news at the time, she said. Informed by her growing up in among the countercultural seekers of Woodstock, N.Y., she sought to place that exploration in a more enticing environment.The Meyerist Movement has its unsavory \u2014 if not downright creepy \u2014 secrets and practices. But \u201cThe Path\u201d strives to show the group\u2019s purer motives and charitable impulses.\u201cWe didn\u2019t want to let the audience have moments where they could just easily dismiss this entire movement as a cult,\u201d said Jason Katims (the showrunner of \u201cFriday Night Lights\u201d and creator of \u201cParenthood\u201d), who quickly agreed to shepherd the project through his production company when Ms. Goldberg showed him the script.(Despite similarities to Scientology \u2014 for example, the believers on \u201cThe Path\u201d use a Meyer Machine to stimulate neurological growth and physical healing, while an E-Meter is used in Scientologists\u2019 spiritual training \u2014 Ms. Goldberg said that the group wasn\u2019t her inspiration.)Ms. Goldberg and Mr. Katims found an eager suitor in Hulu. Beatrice Springborn, head of originals at Hulu, has seen her share of pitches about cults during her career as an indie film and television executive.\u201cIt was always looked at from the outsider perspective or the freak-show perspective or the infiltrator perspective,\u201d she said. \u201cOr how a cult is tearing apart families.\u201dMs. Goldberg\u2019s offering was the first time she\u2019d read a script and understood why people would join.\u201cThe Path\u201d would become Hulu\u2019s first regular, hourlong dramatic series \u2014 \u201c11/22/63,\u201d based on Stephen King\u2019s time-traveling thriller involving the assassination of President Kennedy, is just eight episodes \u2014 joining its stable of comedies like \u201cCasual,\u201d \u201cDifficult People\u201d and \u201cThe Mindy Project.\u201d And Hulu plans to release two, possibly three, more dramas this year.\u201cWe need to establish ourselves as a premium network,\u201d said Ms. Springborn, one for which people will spend at least $7.99 a month and to which brand-name talent will bring ideas. Netflix and Amazon, with shows like \u201cHouse of Cards\u201d and \u201cTransparent,\u201d have quite a head start on Hulu and are rolling out more original programming at a rapid clip. (The competition in this era of peak TV has become so intense that on the one floor Hulu and HBO share in their offices in Santa Monica, Calif., a Do Not Talk About Projects sign is posted in the bathroom.)Hulu executives had a few suggestions, including ditching the helicopters that Ms. Goldberg had provided the Meyerist movement. They would have made for a visually arresting opening scene, as members rescue the survivors of a tornado in New Hampshire that had blown their lives apart. But a less wealthy operation would offer more storytelling possibilities.An integral question \u201cThe Path\u201d explores is how a fledgling religion makes it from a first generation to a second, so that it doesn\u2019t die along with its founder. A scrappier movement, one still relatively unknown and riven by conflict over just how much publicity, growth and money it should seek, would better convey the tensions at play.The crucial role of Sarah \u2014 who grew up in the movement, a member of one of its core families and a true believer \u2014 was cast first. In Ms. Monaghan, the producers and Hulu executives believed they found an actor who could embody the wholesomeness and seeming guilelessness the character needed, to help get viewers to buy into a thematically dark show.The attraction for Ms. Monaghan was a complicated character who finds her core beliefs tested as her marriage to Eddie (Mr. Paul) implodes, questions about the movement arise and her relationship with Cal (Mr. Dancy), the charismatic youngest member of the leadership group, becomes more complicated. How Sarah responds \u201creally intrigued me, because what people do in the name of religion is not necessarily all that holy,\u201d Ms. Monaghan said.\u201cHer family is second to her faith, that\u2019s certainly what we discover,\u201d she added, in contrast to Mr. Paul\u2019s Eddie, who will do almost anything to keep his family intact.The characters on \u201cThe Path\u201d straying from the righteous path may be members of a controversial movement. (The writers and actors refrain from using the word cult, preferring, Ms. Goldberg said, to remain \u201cnonjudgmental.\u201d) But Ms. Goldberg hopes audiences will see parallels to the everyday of more conventional society.After all, she said, \u201ceverything is corruptible by individuals and by individual ambition and people\u2019s wounds.\u201dAdvertisement"}

But apparently I don\u2019t get to decide this.\u201dMs. Wachowski thanked friends and family for their support, saying it had given her \u201cthe chance to actually survive this process.\u201dWith her announcement, Ms. Wachowski, previously known as Andy, joined a growing list of openly transgender people in Hollywood, including her sister and filmmaking partner, who was known as Larry before coming out in 2012; the reality stars Caitlyn Jenner and Chaz Bono; the writer and musician Our Lady J; and the actresses Laverne Cox, Alexandra Billings, Trace Lysette and Hari Nef.Lilly Wachowski recounted the exchange with The Daily Mail reporter in her statement to The Windy City Times, saying that he told her she \u201chad to sit down with him\u201d to tell her \u201cinspirational\u201d story and to have her picture taken \u2014 adding that she \u201cdidn\u2019t want to have someone from The National Enquirer following me around, did I?\u201dIn a statement Wednesday, The Daily Mail said it \u201ccategorically denies\u201d trying to \u201ccoerce\u201d Ms. Wachowski into revealing her transgender identity.\u201cOur reporter was extremely sympathetic and courteous at all times\u201d a spokesman for DailyMail.com said, referring to an unreleased transcript of the conversation with the director.\u201cWe wish Lilly Wachowski well with her journey, though we are surprised as to how she has reacted, given the courtesy and sensitivity with which the reporter approached her,\u201d he added.The Daily Mail was harshly criticized for its handling of transgender issues after it ran a column about Lucy Meadows, a British teacher who transitioned over Christmas break in 2012, under the headline \u201cHe\u2019s not only in the wrong body \u2026 he\u2019s in the wrong job.\u201dIn its statement, Wednesday, The Daily Mail rejected the argument that its coverage had played any role in the death of Ms. Meadows.Ms. Wachowski said Monday was not the first time that she had been approached by a reporter.Her agent called several times over the past year to tell her a media outlet was about to publish an article on her gender transition and had requested a comment, she said.She prepared a \u201cmega-sarcastic\u201d statement to release in the event that a publication wrote about her transition without her consent, Ms. Wachowski said, but each time, the media outlet backed down.\u201cAnd now here they were, at my front door, almost as if to say \u2014 \u2018There\u2019s another one! Let\u2019s drag \u2018em out in the open so we can all have a look!\u2019\u201d Ms. Wachowski wrote about her exchange with The Daily Mail reporter.Ms. Wachowski said she hoped the decision by other news media outlets to decline to publish articles before she came out reflected a growing awareness of the \u201cpotentially fatal effect\u201d of publicly outing someone.Faced with a reporter on her doorstep, however, she decided to take control of the information herself, she said.\u201cSo yeah, I\u2019m transgender,\u201d she wrote. \u201cAnd yeah, I\u2019ve transitioned.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Netflix Finds a Home With Younger and Wealthier Households", "Date": "2016-03-08", "News": "Supported byWhen a veteran industry analyst released a report last week stating that Netflix was to blame for half the decline in traditional TV viewing last year, he included a number of interesting assessments of how Netflix has changed the way we watch television.The biggest takeaway: The Netflix effect is more pronounced in younger, more affluent households.Here is a breakdown of some of the findings from Michael Nathanson of MoffettNathanson Research. His analysis was based on a combination of metrics from the media measurement firm Nielsen, company data and proprietary research.Is Netflix Killing TV?\u25a0 The time spent streaming Netflix in the United States added up to about 6 percent of viewing hours for traditional television in 2015, up from 4 percent in 2014.\u25a0 Traditional TV viewing tumbled 3 percent in 2015, with half of that because of Netflix.Takeaway: If you want to talk about killing and Netflix, start watching its original series, \u201cHouse of Cards.\u2019\u2019 Frank Underwood is probably doing more damage to traditional institutions. But while Netflix hasn\u2019t actually murdered conventional TV just yet, it\u2019s still a source of much distress.Young vs. Old\u25a0 CBS, the broadcaster with the oldest median age, had the biggest decline in viewership in Netflix homes compared with non-Netflix homes, with viewership down 42 percent in Netflix homes.\u25a0 The largest share of streaming subscribers for Netflix and other services in 2015 was among broadband households younger than 35, which is 81 percent, up from 72 percent last year.\u25a0 The age group with the largest increase in share was 45-to-54-year-olds, which rose to 68 percent in 2015, from 55 percent in 2014.Takeaway: For future growth in the United States, Netflix needs to focus on older audiences. Income Factor\u25a0 Sixty-four percent of households with annual incomes of at least $100,000 and broadband subscribed to a streaming service in 2015, up from 56 percent in 2014.\u25a0 Fifty-five percent of homes with household incomes less than $40,000 and broadband subscribed to a streaming service in 2015, up from 44 percent in 2014.Takeaway: Given the high proportion of low-income households without broadband, it will probably be difficult for Netflix to expand its subscriber base among that populationAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Jon Bernthal: From Walking Dead to Plain Deadly", "Date": "2016-03-25", "News": "Supported byBy this time, viewers have already seen Castle, a gun-toting vigilante, massacre a roomful of mobsters and blast his way through a hospital before opening fire on Daredevil himself with a one-syllable warning: \u201cBang.\u201dBeneath his intimidating physique, boxer\u2019s nose and seemingly impassive demeanor, Mr. Bernthal, 39, is a thoughtful, garrulous performer with an unexpected career path that took him from athletics to theater, and from Washington to Moscow to Hollywood.Though the people he plays are not often easy to like, Mr. Bernthal said he has learned to embrace these roles and to find an actor\u2019s compassion for some inhumane figures.\u201cThey\u2019re characters that build these walls around themselves, that say I\u2019m no longer going to concern myself with morality,\u201d he said.\u201cWithin these walls is a real human being,\u201d he added. \u201cThe other characters, you\u2019ve got to let them crack holes in the wall and let the humanity sink out.\u201d\u201cI had these radical ideas,\u201d Mr. Bernthal said, fondly recalling leaner times in the late 1990s and early 2000s. \u201cAnybody who would get in front of a camera to do TV or movies had sold their soul to the devil.\u201dHaving grown up in Washington, Mr. Bernthal went to Skidmore College in Saratoga Springs, N.Y., and played baseball, but came to the attention of a theater professor, Alma Becker, after delivering a deceptive monologue in her class.\u201cI opened up about how my mom had given me this catcher\u2019s glove on her deathbed,\u201d he recalled. \u201cMy mom\u2019s alive and well in D.C. I was totally hustling \u2014 I just thought that\u2019s what acting was.\u201dWith his classical training, Mr. Bernthal said he has felt uneasy about chasing a screen career that has made his stage appearances increasingly rare. \u201cGranted,\u201d he said through a grin, \u201cI didn\u2019t think that when I was auditioning for every rom-com on the CW. They\u2019re like, \u2018Get your giant nose out of this room.\u2019\u201dBut, ultimately, he said, he concluded that, \u201cit\u2019s not what you\u2019re doing, it\u2019s how you\u2019re doing it \u2014 how deep and dark the dive is into the characters that you play.\u201dGoing into the series knowing Shane would last a finite number of episodes \u2014 and before the show became synonymous with indiscriminate death \u2014 was a welcome change of pace for TV, Mr. Bernthal said.\u201cIt\u2019s so rare that you get a genuine beginning, middle and end,\u201d he said. \u201cOn \u2018The Walking Dead,\u2019 they just kill off these characters, completely at random, and that\u2019s part of the appeal of the show. But they really dedicated so much time to this one character\u2019s journey.\u201dThe show\u2019s continued runaway popularity since then has been bittersweet for Mr. Bernthal, but he also finds it a relief to follow other muses. \u201cI loved being on \u2018The Walking Dead,\u2019 and I love that I\u2019m off \u2018The Walking Dead,\u2019\u201d he said.As in the comics, Castle is a war veteran out to avenge the deaths of his wife and children. His single-minded pursuit of justice brings him into conflict with Daredevil (Charlie Cox).Mr. Bernthal, they said, was an ideal fit to play someone filled with both rage and hurt. \u201cJon can drive the car very fast in both directions,\u201d Mr. Petrie said. \u201cHe can physically threaten you while having pain inside his eyes. That made us like him so much.\u201dFor Mr. Bernthal, a certain reflexive amount of self-doubt preceded his decision to take the part. \u201cThe first time I did a TV show, I was like, \u2018Wow, am I totally selling out?\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cNow I\u2019m playing a Marvel superhero \u2014 believe me, I get that.\u201dBut he said that the potential offered by a 13-hour narrative \u2014 and the likelihood that Netflix viewers would binge-watch it in just a few sessions \u2014 made the challenges of the role irresistible.\u201cI like that you can fully abandon the audience, fully turn your back on them and be willing to lose people,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd know that two or three episodes down the line, you\u2019re going to get a chance to win them back.\u201dMr. Cox said he found in Mr. Bernthal a fellow actor with a similar dedication to immersing himself in his \u201cDaredevil\u201d role \u2014 \u201ca crazy, obsessive, unhealthy relationship is probably a more accurate way of describing it,\u201d he said with a laugh.On long nighttime shoots filled with stunts and fights, Mr. Cox said: \u201cWe would tease each other about, like, were we making it to the gym each day? It became a silly competition.\u201dMr. Cox admired Mr. Bernthal\u2019s lack of vanity about how Castle comes across. \u201cWhether you empathize with or are appalled by the character is none of his business,\u201d Mr. Cox said. \u201cHe just plays the truth of the character, and he lets the audience decide.\u201dWith his customary stoicism, Mr. Bernthal said that all these apparent burdens, whether absorbing another actor\u2019s fists or an audience\u2019s hostility, were just more chances to demonstrate his aptitude for job.\u201cI feel that if you go to work and, the next day, wake up and feel like you can\u2019t move,\u201d he said proudly, \u201cthat means you were working hard.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Q. and A. With Neve Campbell: Fiction Eclipsed by Truth", "Date": "2016-03-09", "News": "Supported bySnapshotEvery politician needs a henchperson. In Netflix\u2019s \u201cHouse of Cards,\u201d President Francis Underwood, who is running for re-election in the now-streaming Season 4, has Douglas Stamper. So it\u2019s only fitting that the equally Machiavellian first lady has her own: Leann Harvey, a take-no-prisoners campaign strategist played by Neve Campbell. Confronted by Stamper in her office, she pulls a gun and lets him know that she\u2019d use it.Ms. Campbell, of \u201cScream\u201d and \u201cParty of Five\u201d fame, kept a low profile after moving to London in the late 2000s. Upon returning to the United States, she had a son, Caspian, now 3, with her partner, the actor J. J. Feild.\u201cI knew that getting back into TV would be a good thing for me,\u201d she said, but \u201cI didn\u2019t want to do 17 hours a day, 10 months a year, and not be present for Caspian.\u201d The ideal, she decided, would be as part of an ensemble, where she wasn\u2019t shooting every scene.\u201cRarely are we perceived as strong, powerful people, so it\u2019s great to be able to play Leann,\u201d the fresh-faced, quietly commanding Ms. Campbell, 42, said of the dearth of roles for women over 40 in Hollywood. \u201cIt\u2019s wonderful and it\u2019s rare.\u201d Here are edited excerpts from the conversation.Q. What\u2019s it like being in a political drama when reality may be stranger than fiction?Is Leann as morally dark as Claire?We\u2019re still finding that [out]. She could go either way, which is fun about the character.Did you draw on any real-life political personality for Leann?No, honestly it\u2019s really come from witnessing certain females in my industry, directors or agents who have a certain energy to them because they\u2019ve had to really fight to be respected equally to their male counterparts.Who\u2019s your favorite political partnership?Well, Hillary and Bill have been fascinating to watch, the way that they\u2019ve had to navigate their drama was pretty intense. Harvey Weinstein had a gathering at his place on Martha\u2019s Vineyard for Bill Clinton, and I spent a very surreal evening with the Clintons [when he was in office]. I remember standing on the water and looking out, and Bill Clinton was somewhere playing the saxophone. I was like: \u201cWhat are those things out there? There are, like, heads bobbing.\u201d I guess the Secret Service has to be within a mile radius of the president, so there were SEALs out on the water.You\u2019ve said that, as a Canadian, you\u2019re comfortable being called a socialist.Yeah, I guess you would call me a democratic socialist.And your heart is with Senator Sanders but your head is with Hillary Clinton.That\u2019s not to say that I don\u2019t have heart with Hillary as well. It\u2019s just that if it were an ideal world, I\u2019d love to go with Bernie. I\u2019m just not sure that America is ready for him yet. I think America is fearful and can\u2019t quite understand how you could have free education or free medical. I\u2019ve grown up in that, so I see very clearly why that should be the case. With Hillary, I feel that because she\u2019s been in the political arena for as long as she has, at the capacity that she has, she might have enough relationships to be able to get some things done.Is there anything in the States that makes you shake your head?A lack of gun control. There is no excuse for not having better laws put in place.Leann has a gun.She\u2019s a Texan.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Tribune Chief Discusses Transforming a Mature Media Company", "Date": "2016-03-25", "News": "Supported byPeter Liguori, the longtime television executive, was appointed the new chief executive of the Tribune Company in 2013, just two and a half weeks after the newspaper and TV company emerged from an agonizing four-year bankruptcy process.Mr. Liguori swiftly moved to spin off the publishing business and rebrand the company \u2014 now called Tribune Media \u2014 as a kind of 167-year old start-up focused on television. His strategy is built on three pillars: local television, data and the conversion of WGN America, a onetime superstation, into a national entertainment network.Mr. Liguori discussed the transformation of Tribune and the broader media industry during a recent interview in his New York office, decorated with a photograph of Mike Tyson, a picture of the laundry business he ran at Yale and a coloring book with a box of Crayolas.Here are excerpts from that conversation:After the publishing side of the business was spun off, one of the top strategies was to focus on original programming at WGN America. Why?Originals are important because they brand your network. There is no tagline, there is no marketing campaign that will ever work for a network that is as good as showing your performance.The story lines of WGNA\u2019s four original programs span the Salem witch trials (\u201cSalem\u2019\u2019), the secret race to build the world\u2019s first atomic bomb (\u201cManhattan\u2019\u2019), a clan of outsiders living off the grid in Appalachia (\u201cOutsiders\u2019\u2019) and a group of slaves escaping a Georgia plantation (\u201cUnderground\u201d). Why these stories today?We want to go after American themes. Now, there is a marketer\u2019s reason for that, and that is, especially when you are our size, especially when you are trying to make a mark, you want to make sure that you are targeting the biggest cross section of people to go after.The number of scripted shows available is expected to pass 400 this year. Is there too much TV?There is too much mediocre TV, but there is never enough quality TV.The \u201cUnderground\u201d premiere ranked as the most-watched program in nearly 18 years on WGN America, with 5.7 million total viewers across the week. How did you attract such a large audience?We did screenings in black universities, megachurches and with the White House. We screened in certain museums. The most important thing that we needed to get going on the show was word of mouth and the approval of unbiased audiences, not a professional audience, not Hollywood premieres, not New York premieres, but premieres in Middle America.You recently announced that Tribune had hired financial advisers and is exploring a possible sale or strategic partnership for some or all of the company\u2019s assets to \u201cunlock value.\u201d What\u2019s the latest?Look, it is our job every day to maximize the value of the assets. It\u2019s early on in the process. There is no preconceived notions as to where it ends.Why now?The board and management was just looking at this wide discrepancy between the value that we saw in this company and the performance we\u2019ve shown and where the street was looking at us.We know this company is running well, and I think that at that moment in time when we made the announcement, there was a frustration with that discrepancy. I think this brings our assets into focus, it brings what we are doing into focus, and it kind of creates a process by which we think that value should get recognized.Tribune\u2019s stock has declined about 45 percent in the last year, amid broader fears about the role of traditional TV in a digital world. Major concerns include sharp ratings declines, a weak ad market and so-called cord cutting. What is the role for traditional television in a digital world?First, I would clearly categorize a lot of it as overreaction. Let\u2019s just deal with the facts. At the end of the year, cord cutting was less than 1 percent versus the year before. So if you have 99.5 percent or 99.4 percent of people staying with cable, it is pretty slow erosion. Two, when you look at what is going on with ratings, clearly ratings are changing.The businesses which are currently more vulnerable are the mature ones that have \u2018been there, done that,\u2019 whereas when you look at where we are, we are outsiders. In the first quarter, our ratings were up over 40 percent, so our trajectory is much higher.Is Netflix killing TV?No. No. No. Absolutely not. In some ways, maybe, it is growing TV.You look at their top shows, and the top ones will get between three and six million views over the course of 30 days. \u201cOutsiders\u201d and \u201cUnderground\u201d did between 5.5 and 5.7 million viewers in seven days [on traditional television.] God only knows what happens when someone decides to binge. So here we are, a nascent network, going toe-to-toe with the biggest show, the biggest behemoth, and we\u2019re able to get somewhat equal viewership. I think that says if you continue to put on provocative programming, broadcast and cable television will be quite healthy.Did you just call Netflix the biggest behemoth? That\u2019s interesting because until only recently, they were considered an upstart. I used that in quotes. Everyone is looking for a boogeyman in the media environment, and I just think we all need to stick to our knitting.On your watch, Tribune has made a big push into the data business. What is the power of that data?Without giving away too many trade secrets,the questions before everyone are: Is music a frontier for television? How do you get sports information out there in an effective, compelling manner? How do you create rock-solid, predictive recommendations?What will the television business look like in five years?I am so not a prognosticator, but so what I will do to answer your question and avoid prognosticating, I will go back to a turn of phrase which hasn\u2019t been used in a while: You will be able to watch what you want to watch, when you want to watch it, where you want to watch it. With all that being said, and \u201cUnderground\u201d proved it, it will still be a part of you that wants that shared experience.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "TiVo Said to Be in Merger Talks With Rovi", "Date": "2016-03-24", "News": "Supported byTiVo, the digital video recorder company that popularized the DVR and revolutionized \u201ctime shifting\u201d and fast-forwarding through advertising, is in advanced negotiations to be sold to Rovi, according to people briefed on the talks.The deal would merge TiVo and Rovi, which is one of the largest owners of patents for digital entertainment devices. Shareholders of TiVo would receive a combination of cash and stock, these people said, though the exact price was still being negotiated. After the deal, shareholders of TiVo, which has a market value of $750 million, would probably own about 30 percent of the combined company, these people said. Rovi\u2019s market value is about $1.7 billion.The transaction would end the independence of TiVo, a perennial takeover target whose suitors were said to have included Apple, Google and Microsoft.Rovi, a lesser-known company, may win the prize that is TiVo as a result of an activist investor, Glenn W. Welling of Engaged Capital. Mr. Welling successfully won two seats on the board of Rovi last year. Since then, he pushed the company to re-evaluate its strategy and pressed it to seek a merger with TiVo, these people said.A spokesman for TiVo declined to comment; a spokeswoman for Rovi did not respond to a request seeking comment after business hours. Mr. Welling\u2019s spokesman said he was unavailable.People briefed on the talks warned that the negotiations were at a sensitive stage and that it was still possible a deal could falter.TiVo\u2019s shares rose more than 23 percent on the report, while Rovi\u2019s stock fell 1.3 percent on Thursday.Together, the two companies have more than 6,000 issued or pending patents, which have become a critical defense for them against larger tech and media giants.TiVo is suing Samsung for patent infringement of its DVRs. To date, TiVo has received cash and future revenue of about $1.6 billion from this type of litigation, the company said in a filing this week.Rovi, on the other hand, lost to Netflix in a highly public lawsuit over five patents related to over-the-top video, which sent the stock plummeting last July.TiVo rose to prominence in the early 2000s, with its name becoming synonymous with the act of recording live television and watching it later. The number of stand-alone devices peaked at the end of 2007, when 1.74 million units represented 6 percent of the DVR market share, according to the Leichtman Research Group, which focuses on media data.But TiVo\u2019s dominance in DVR did not last long. Satellite and cable providers soon incorporated DVR capabilities as an option for their subscribers, and it became less popular to buy the TiVo stand-alone device. As a result, TiVo partnered with service providers, such as DirectTV, for additional sources of revenue. The rise of digital media companies like Netflix and Hulu have become yet another source of competition for TiVo.Today, TiVo\u2019s market share remains below 2 percent, Leichtman\u2019s data showed.\u201cThey set the fuse to DVR but in many ways, they were not the beneficiaries of it,\u201d said Bruce Leichtman, principal analyst at Leichtman Research. \u201cConsumers made their decision; they saw this as a feature but not as a product.\u201dRovi\u2019s shares have soared more recently after the company renewed several large licensing deals, but TiVo\u2019s has gone in the other direction. TiVo is trading at half the level it was in August, largely because of investor concerns about competition.TiVo is in the process of searching for a new chief executive, which appears to have been a catalyst for Mr. Welling and Rovi to pursue the deal. Tivo\u2019s 11-year chief executive, Thomas S. Rogers, stepped down from the post in November while remaining as nonexecutive chairman. The company\u2019s chief financial officer, Naveen Chopra, is acting as the company\u2019s chief executive on an interim basis.Mr. Welling had started Engaged in 2012 after working under Ralph V. Whitworth at Relational Investors, until that fund was wound down earlier in the year. Rovi caught Mr. Welling\u2019s eye shortly after he founded Engaged, building up his stake and then starting a proxy fight a year ago for director seats and strategic changes. He now owns a 2.7 percent of Rovi, or 2.25 million shares, according to data from S&P Capital IQ.Engaged focuses on medium-size companies with market valuations below $8 billion, and has focused on a range of companies, including the smoothie retailer Jamba and Outerwall, which owns RedBox, an inexpensive DVD rental provider.Advertisement"}

He first joined the Royal Shakespeare Company as a 25-year-old in 1996, playing Touchstone in \u201cAs You Like It\u201d and later Romeo in \u201cRomeo and Juliet.\u201d The performances at the Academy of Music commemorate the 400th anniversary of Shakespeare\u2019s death but also the 20th anniversary of Mr. Tennant\u2019s Royal Shakespeare debut.\u201cIt has a certain symmetry to it, doesn\u2019t it?\u201d he said. \u201cA company I\u2019m involved with on so many levels, really, and it\u2019s been such a huge part of my life.\u201dFilm and TV work increasingly pulled Mr. Tennant away from the stage in the early 2000s. But Gregory Doran, who had directed him in Tom Stoppard\u2019s \u201cThe Real Inspector Hound\u201d at the Royal Shakespeare in 1998, drew him back in 2008 with an offer he couldn\u2019t refuse.\u201cI said to him, \u2018Anyone who can play the romantic Romeo and the almost impenetrable Touchstone should be able to play Hamlet,\u2019\u201d Mr. Doran said recently by phone from Hong Kong, where the Henry plays were being performed before their visit to Brooklyn. That 2008 production \u2014 featuring another stage-and-TV star, Patrick Stewart \u2014 was a critical and popular success and paved the way for their collaboration on Mr. Doran\u2019s Henriad cycle, first performed in Britain in 2013.Joseph V. Melillo, the executive producer of the Brooklyn Academy of Music, saw Mr. Tennant\u2019s performance for the first time recently, on video. \u201cThere\u2019s a kind of gentleness in his acting, his interpretation, that you don\u2019t often see,\u201d he said by phone a few days later. \u201cIt\u2019s not the kind of bravura physicality, it\u2019s much more internalized and soft. It\u2019s fascinating.\u201dSheltered because he took the throne at the age of 10, Richard II was deposed at 32 and died in captivity the following year; Shakespeare\u2019s play covers the last two years of his life.\u201cIf you are in a world where the divine right of kings is a thing, and as a child you\u2019re told, \u2018God has chosen you to lead these people,\u2019 and you\u2019re then surrounded by acquiescence and adulation, what does that do to you?\u201d Mr. Tennant asked. \u201cHow does that form the man you become? That\u2019s what fascinates me about trying to find a center for who this character was.\u201d\u201cI liked the idea that he would alight on something he found rather beautiful,\u201d Mr. Tennant said. \u201cHe\u2019s an aesthete. If he found it rather glorious, there\u2019d be no one to challenge that it was wrong or unacceptable or not what men did. From that, we got the idea that he would have gold leaf on his fingernails. It was looking for a few things that would set him apart, because he could. Because no one would tell him he couldn\u2019t.\u201dSitting for an interview in a Manhattan hotel bar, a pot of tea at his elbow, Mr. Tennant was in town doing publicity for the Netflix series \u201cJessica Jones,\u201d which had been released a few days earlier. (His villainous character, Kilgrave, possesses powers of mind control and is obsessed with the heroine.) Just before that he had taken part in his first read-through for the revival of \u201cRichard II,\u201d nearly two years after the British production closed.\u201cBits of it are all there intact,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd other bits, it\u2019s like I\u2019ve never seen them before. My wife made a very good analogy, that it\u2019s like stripping wallpaper. Some bits just come off in a wonderful sort of pass, they just fall off the wall. And other bits, you have to pick away at for days.\u201dMr. Doran, who praised Mr. Tennant as \u201cthe most professional of actors\u201d \u2014 \u201cYou never catch David dropping a line, even\u201d \u2014 was not at all worried about his ability to slide back into the role. Asked what Mr. Tennant brought to the character of Richard II in particular, he said: \u201cHe was unafraid of, which I think was fantastic, the fact that for three acts of the play he\u2019s almost intolerable. He behaves in a capricious, vain way, and it isn\u2019t really until he gets to the abdication that the man\u2019s humanity comes through. And I thought David caught that particularly well.\u201dMr. Tennant\u2019s own selection of great Richards included Derek Jacobi\u2019s, Fiona Shaw\u2019s and, more recently, Ben Whishaw\u2019s, in the BBC-PBS series of filmed adaptations called \u201cThe Hollow Crown.\u201d\u201cJust before I was going to do it, someone gave me a copy, and I said, \u2018I\u2019ll watch this.\u2019 I should never have done that. Because Ben Whishaw is an extraordinary actor. And he does it beautifully, in ways I could never even aspire to.\u201dIn Brooklyn, appearing in just \u201cRichard II,\u201d Mr. Tennant will be doing only a couple of shows a week. But there\u2019s no rest for this international star: On April 23, between performances in Brooklyn, he\u2019ll fly back to Stratford-upon-Avon to host a live Royal Shakespeare Company broadcast marking the anniversary of Shakespeare\u2019s death.After \u201cDoctor Who,\u201d Mr. Tennant starred in the wildly popular British murder drama \u201cBroadchurch\u201d and its much less popular, short-lived American adaptation, \u201cGracepoint.\u201d A third season of \u201cBroadchurch\u201d is finally to be filmed this summer.He has also somehow found the time to revisit the character who continues to define his career, recording a series of \u201cDoctor Who\u201d audio dramas scheduled for broadcast in May.\u201cIt was surprisingly easy to slip back into that time,\u201d he said. \u201cIt could have felt more awkward than it did.\u201d\u201cI often say that the first line of the obituary has been written, because \u2018Doctor Who\u2019 has such a reach,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s so loved and noticed, it\u2019s part of the cultural furniture. To be associated with that show, it\u2019ll be hard to do anything that reduces the impact of that. Which I\u2019m fine with, by the way.\u201dAdvertisement"}

The movie is perfectly appropriate for children, too, but whether the kiddies of 2016 will get Pee-wee, the man-child character played by Paul Reubens, the way an earlier generation did is hard to gauge. A digital-era 6-year-old might well slip off with a more typical 21st-century diversion, while Mom and Dad revel in the kitschy loopiness that they loved as children or younger adults.It\u2019s a fortunate encounter, both for Pee-wee and for viewers: The two pair charmingly. Mr. Manganiello (\u201cTrue Blood\u201d) is a big star, but Pee-wee, whose sheltered existence has been confined almost exclusively to the tiny town of Fairville, doesn\u2019t recognize him, which only endears him to Mr. Manganiello more.\u201cThat\u2019s what I like about you, Pee-wee,\u201d he says, straight-faced. \u201cYou\u2019re normal.\u201dHe invites Pee-wee to his birthday party in New York, and that sets Pee-wee off on an eventful cross-country journey. He encounters a farmer with many marriage-age daughters, a dodgy guy who lives in a cave, an Amish community and more. The cast is a mix of recognizable stars and the less well known. Three female bank robbers (Jessica Pohly, Stephanie Beatriz and Alia Shawkat) make the biggest impression. Will they or any of the other obstacles keep Pee-wee from reaching New York? Will friendship prove to be the balm that soothes all disappointments? There\u2019s never much doubt.Advertisement"}

Nobody has to grow up, especially middle-aged men, who are free to do practically nothing all day except talk about women as if they are chattel.\u201cI haven\u2019t gotten to know her well enough to know what it is that I need to pretend to have in common with her,\u201d Dennis laments to Chip in Episode 2.Yeah, it\u2019s one giant wink, and the characters \u2014 especially Chip, a serial dissembler \u2014 are self-parodies.

{"Headline": "\u2018House of Cards\u2019 Season 4, Episode 7: Rock Star Candidate", "Date": "2016-03-08", "News": "Supported byHouse of CardsWe\u2019ve heard Will Conway\u2019s name a few times and images of the Republican presidential candidate have flashed by in TV commercials over the course of the season. But in this episode, the New York governor (Joel Kinnaman) and his family finally come into full view.This chapter is a study in the contrasts between two candidates, a look at how they function politically and how they live. On almost every metric, President Frank Underwood seemingly falls short of Conway, who is young (at roughly 39, he meets the age requirement for a presidential candidate, but just barely), savvy when it comes to social media, and a happily married family man. In short, as one of the president\u2019s advisers puts it, he\u2019s a rock star.Conway and Frank even start their days in what feel like different universes. Conway enjoys spirited \u201cgood morning\u201d sex in the bathroom with his beautiful, British wife, while Frank stands alone in front of a bathroom vanity filled with medications as his wife peeks in from a cautious distance. After the quickie with his spouse, Conway goofs around with one of his adorable moppet children; meanwhile, a subdued Frank and Claire discuss the importance of staying focused on their political agenda instead of worrying about their personal relationship. \u201cFind your steel, Claire,\u201d he tells her, foreshadowing the steel she\u2019ll later hold in her hand while advocating for tougher gun-control measures.This is the Season 4 episode when most people will be tempted to see the Underwoods as stand-ins for Bill and Hillary Clinton, assuming they haven\u2019t already. Unlike the Conways, Frank and Claire appear to derive their earthly pleasures from coaching each other toward professional success. In a pair of deftly edited sequences we first see Frank advising Claire about how to hone her message during a meeting with the head of the National Rifle Association, then, later, Claire helping Frank perfect his approach to an important conversation about who should be his running mate. Everything they lack in romantic passion, they make up for in their strategic synchronicity, a quality that, true or not, many have always imagined is core to the Clintons\u2019 relationship as well. (Notably, as the episode progresses, Claire and Frank inch closer to each other in terms of physical proximity until, by the end, they\u2019re in the same bedroom, albeit not the same bed.)The notion of tapping into Americans\u2019 personal information is a hot-button issue and \u201cHouse of Cards\u201d uses it to further accentuate the differences between the candidates. While Conway seeks to gain intel about voters\u2019 preferences using technology that takes advantage of willingly shared information, Frank wants to just take it by way of a federal court ruling that allows for widespread domestic surveillance, justified by airstrikes against ICO, the \u201cHouse of Cards\u201d version of ISIS. It\u2019s the stuff of Edward Snowden\u2019s most extreme nightmares, and Frank has the good judgment to abort both the military mission and his plan. Still, one wonders if he\u2019ll find another way to tap, wire or otherwise, into the minds of voters and in the process, perhaps find out that Tom Hammerschmidt is still investigating Lucas Goodwin\u2019s claims about him.There\u2019s another important quality that Conway and Frank don\u2019t share and that\u2019s ruthlessness. As Claire notes, the Underwoods are willing to go farther than anyone, including the Conways, to get what they want. If there was any thought that, post-surgery, Frank might soften, this episode puts an end to that notion. His overdramatic, fourth-wall-breaking monologues, easily the most irritating of the \u201cHouse of Cards\u201d signature stylistic flourishes, are back in full force. And his insistence, with Claire\u2019s agreement, that \u201cwe are going to destroy\u201d the Conways suggests things are going to get very ugly in the remainder of the season.While watching that video of the 2012 New Year\u2019s Eve party, both the president and first lady realize they have something to hold over their rival\u2019s head. What it is, exactly, remains unclear. Which is maddening; these two talk to each other the way some people \u201cvaguebook\u201d on Facebook.But surely that\u2019s intentional on the part of the writers. As the first Netflix original series and one whose success relies, in part, on its binge-worthiness, \u201cHouse of Cards\u201d knows there\u2019s as much value in keeping things mysterious as there is in all that Pollyhop metadata.Advertisement"}

In short time, an imagined bromance was born, with many envisioning buddy comedies, Netflix specials and more imaginative connections.It wasn\u2019t just the men.

{"Headline": "\u2018House of Cards\u2019 Season 4, Episode 5: The Ghosts of Frank\u2019s Past", "Date": "2016-03-07", "News": "Supported byHouse of CardsThis episode of \u201cHouse of Cards\u201d opens with a slow pan into an M.R.I. machine, one where perpendicular red laser lines make President Frank Underwood appear to be caught in the cross hairs. While Frank clings to life in what may be the only hospital in America where fluorescent lights have been replaced with a moody blue glow, the information Lucas Goodwin was so desperate to share has become public knowledge. Lucas\u2019s suicide note has been seized as evidence, and to get ahead of a potential leak, Claire Underwood acknowledges and debunks the \u201coutrageous\u201d claims it makes about the president, including that he murdered both Congressman Peter Russo and the Slugline reporter Zoe Barnes. In more ways than one, this episode evokes thoughts of Metro stations.In fact, it evokes a whole host of ghosts of \u201cHouse of Cards\u201d past, including Augustus Underwood, an ancestor of the president who was a Confederate soldier and who figures prominently in Frank\u2019s hospital hallucinations; Tom Hammerschmidt, the former Herald editor who may be rethinking his conclusion that Lucas\u2019s allegations about Frank were baseless; Nathan Green, the F.B.I. deputy director who earned his position by entrapping Lucas; and of course, Raymond Tusk, the billionaire businessman whose heated adversarial relationship with Frank sucked up nearly all the oxygen in Season 2. Netflix identifies each installment in \u201cHouse of Cards\u201d as a chapter, implying that every season is part of a longer, still-unfolding novel. In this episode, it actually feels that way, as though everything that\u2019s happened in the previous seasons may finally lead to some payoff.This particular chapter is quintessential \u201cHouse of Cards\u201d in that it\u2019s both frustrating and a binge-watch trigger. As someone who remains incensed by Frank\u2019s merciless treatment of the best character on the show, Peter Russo, the fact that his murder has re-entered the conversation makes me eager to rip through more episodes to find out how that long-festering story line gets resolved. But the show is also up to a lot of its typical tricks, like introducing elaborately conceived schemes without clearly explaining them.Take the return of Raymond Tusk, a character whose mere presence induces back-channeling and Xander Feng flashbacks. Claire persuades Remy to recruit Raymond to work with the White House on resolving the oil crisis. She does this by having Leann \u2014 who suddenly appears in unexpected places more often than Beetlejuice \u2014 show Remy those incriminating photos of him and Jackie, photos we know were taken three episodes ago, which suggests that Claire had this scheme in her back pocket long before Frank was shot. When Remy and Raymond sit down with the first lady and acting President Blythe, Remy says the big plan is to \u201cpropose a partnership between American and Chinese energy companies,\u201d but those are the only details offered.Remy\u2019s proposal is obviously an idea that came from Claire, much the same way that everything Donald says in his conversation with President Petrov comes from Claire\u2019s texts. She is driving the car, but what she\u2019s driving toward is still shrouded in mystery, and the reasons for bringing Raymond into the fold are murky, too. It seems as if she\u2019s trying to create the most hostile work environment possible for Frank to return to, if he returns. But surely there is more to it than that. The way that so many of the conversations in this show hint at what they\u2019re about without actually saying it \u2014 \u201cThis needs to seem like your idea, not mine,\u201d Claire tells Remy, without elaborating on what that idea is \u2014 swells to maddening levels in this episode.Claire is more blunt in her conversations with Donald Blythe. It\u2019s astonishing how she can turn on the fake waterworks for her husband, the ailing president, yet candidly tell Donald, the acting one, that she feels \u201cnothing\u201d about the possibility that Frank might die. It seems as if she is actually being honest about that, but surely it\u2019s a calculated honesty: the more she confides in Donald, the more likely he is to trust her judgment. The only person who vocally doesn\u2019t trust her judgment is Doug Stamper.Doug\u2019s also occupied with other things, though, like offering to donate part of his alcohol-addled liver to Frank and nearly suffocating Seth with an empty water glass to make sure he knows that additional breaches of loyalty won\u2019t be tolerated. Doug confirms that Seth leaked that photo of Frank with a man dressed as a Confederate soldier, but Seth is able to escape getting fired by raising flags about Heather Dunbar\u2019s pre-assassination-attempt conversation with Lucas. Because of Seth, Attorney General Martha Wilson is able to keep her job by sharing what she knows about the contact between Lucas and Heather, sending the feds straight to Dunbar campaign headquarters. That part of \u201cHouse of Cards\u201d feels at least somewhat authentic to politics, where keeping one\u2019s job is the concern that trumps all others.The big mystery right now is whether Frank will get to keep his job. Unless he gets a full liver transplant, the doctor says he will die, and those hallucinatory encounters with his Confederate-soldier ancestor certainly have a \u201clife-flashing-before-the-eyes\u201d quality. Like so much in this episode, they also emphasize that his past is catching up with him.In the very last scene, Frank\u2019s eyes roll back in his head and he appears to flatline right after he sees himself on that Civil War battlefield in Spotsylvania with bullets whizzing by his head. It\u2019s almost as if he knows that, outside the walls of that hospital room, a lot of people, including his own wife, have a target on his back.Advertisement"}

Jerrod (Mr. Carmichael), a young man in Charlotte, N.C., finds himself caught between his liberal girlfriend, Maxine (Amber Stevens West), and his old-fashioned parents, the blue-collar Joe and the deeply religious Cynthia (David Alan Grier and Loretta Devine). An issue will arise \u2014 it will be pretty clear what, as the episode titles are along the lines of \u201cPrayer\u201d and \u201cGender\u201d \u2014 and we\u2019re off.Where \u201cblack-ish\u201d has a more contemporary look, shooting single-camera and using more locations, \u201cThe Carmichael Show\u201d is unapologetically old-school, shot multiple-camera on sets. (Joe and Cynthia\u2019s living room even recalls Edith and Archie Bunker\u2019s.)The staging determines the show\u2019s style. It\u2019s more playlike and hermetic; big events largely happen offstage, and the characters recount and debate them in the home and apartment sets. The \u201caction\u201d is almost all verbal.This is a more theatrical style of sitcom, and the show benefits from the brassy stage duet of Mr. Grier and Ms. Devine. Mr. Carmichael, in the grand tradition of stand-ups-turned-actors, can deliver a bone-dry punch line, but needs a seasoned cast around him.The new season kicks off with \u201cEverybody Cheats,\u201d a moral-dilemma story \u2014 Cynthia sees a friend\u2019s husband with another woman \u2014 that unfolds into an argument about ethics, double standards and power. Cynthia worries about hurting her friend, Maxine argues that a good friend has to tell, and Jerrod cynically argues that successful men cheat, and the world accepts it: \u201cHillary Clinton\u2019s running for president, and we think she\u2019s weak because she should have left,\u201d he says. \u201cBut if Bill Clinton walked through that door, we\u2019d all go, \u2018Oh my God, it\u2019s Bill Clinton!\u2019\u201dThe second new episode, \u201cFallen Heroes,\u201d is about Bill Cosby, and it is on fire. Jerrod surprises Maxine with tickets to Mr. Cosby\u2019s stand-up show, which she rejects because of the dozens of accusations of sexual assault against him. \u201cThe ironic part,\u201d Maxine says, \u201cis you would have to knock me unconscious to get me to go see Bill Cosby.\u201dThe episode doesn\u2019t much debate whether Mr. Cosby is guilty. Instead, it turns on the audience: Can you separate love of the art from knowledge of the man?Airing on Mr. Cosby\u2019s old network, this episode feels like a leader\u2019s statue being pulled down in a public square. Even when the family laughs warmly at a rerun of \u201cThe Cosby Show,\u201d Mr. Carmichael caustically deflates the moment: \u201cDamn shame what he did to those women, though.\u201dThat gaspworthy kicker is the essence of \u201cThe Carmichael Show,\u201d which is less interested in persuading its audience than denying them easy refuge. This sitcom is trying to say a lot right off the bat, and it sometimes knocks up against the cardboard edges of its characters. But it\u2019s on its way to becoming one of TV\u2019s finer discomfort zones.Advertisement"}

Of all the films to be handcuffed over, \u201cFreddy Got Fingered\u201d is arguably among the most awkward.\u201cIt is just kind of ridiculous all around,\u201d he said. \u201cI think the fact that the movie was \u2018Freddy Got Fingered\u2019 just makes it funnier for some reason. I don\u2019t know why.\u201d\u201cArresting people for these petty issues\u201d clogs up the criminal courts, Mr. Dixon said. Such cases should be decriminalized and handled like traffic tickets in civil court, he said.Mr. Meyers was ordered to appear in court on April 27 to answer the charge of \u201cfailure to return rental property,\u201d a misdemeanor. His lawyer, Adam Seifer, said Mr. Meyers\u2019s worst-case scenario would be probation and a fine.But the charge would be tough to prove, Mr. Seifer added. The video store, J&J\u2019s Video in Salisbury, has closed, and the tape is missing. Further, the state must show that Mr. Meyers intended to steal the tape, and there is no evidence of that, Mr. Seifer said.Mr. Meyers said he rewatched \u201cFreddy Got Fingered\u201d on Wednesday. About 1:30 a.m., his phone rang. On the other end was a voice re-enacting one of the most famous scenes from the movie, when Freddy ties sausages to his fingers and chants, \u201cDaddy, would you like some sausage.\u201d\u201cI instantly knew who it was,\u201c Mr. Meyers said. \u201cI almost died.\u201dMr. Green, who is on a comedy tour in Australia, told Mr. Meyers he would help with any fees related to the case.Susan Beachy contributed research.Advertisement"}

There is no such thing as the Friendship Plot, because while friendship, like marriage, is at least presumably a voluntary estate, it has no official consummation, no church- or state-sanctioned vows. It would seem, then, that the literary form most suited to its pick-up-where-we-left-off, drop-me-when-you-couple-up-and-have-kids ebb and flow might be the story cycle, or serial tale \u2014 just ask Quixote and Sancho, or Huck and Tom, or the four dudes of \u201cThe Three Musketeers.\u201dWhich explains why friendship is also so fitting a subject for the contemporary novel: The relationship between two people who might see each other only occasionally, yet who\u2019ve shared determinative experiences and maybe even incriminating intimacies \u2014 could there be any affinity more situational or contextual, more .\u2008.\u2008. postmodern?Dana Spiotta has now spent four novels proposing and revising her own definitions of friendship. \u201cLightning Field\u201d (2001) centered on the rivalrous affection between an ambitious restaurateur and her friend/employee; \u201cEat the Document\u201d (2006) on the bond between fugitive \u00adVietnam-era radicals; \u201cStone Arabia\u201d (2011) concerned filial friendship, specifically that between a single-mother sister and the brother who relies on her to be the sole audience for his music and visual art. Now comes \u201cInnocents and Others,\u201d a brilliant, riddling clip-montage of the friendship between two very different filmmakers.Meadow Mori and Carrie Wexler grow up together in Los Angeles, Meadow rich and Carrie middle-class, which in Hollywood registers as poor. They go east together to study film at N.Y.U. and begin to drift apart. Carrie becomes a prominent director of mainstream women\u2019s comedies (\u201cGirl School,\u201d \u201cWACs,\u201d \u201cWe Are the Ones Our Parents Warned Us About,\u201d \u201cA Baby!\u201d), while Meadow sweats out documentaries, festival-circuit darlings devoted to exorcising the traumas of people who\u2019ve abused their power. \u201cKent State: Recovered\u201d probes whether the F.B.I. provoked National Guardsmen into shooting students; \u201cPlay Truman\u201d intercuts excerpts from Truman\u2019s diary, in which the president grappled with the A-bomb, with footage from Japanese home movies of the 1940s; \u201cChildren of the Disappeared\u201d collects interviews with perpetrators of the Argentine junta\u2019s Dirty War.Then there\u2019s \u201cInward Operator\u201d \u2014 a documentary that drifts into the novel like an overheard conversation. Its subject is an overweight telemarketer from Syracuse named Amy who sometimes refers to herself as Nicole and sometimes as Jelly; she has a blind boyfriend named Oz (as in the Great), a Rolodex of the phone numbers of peripheral Hollywood types filched from a friend who cleans their homes and, most saliently, a telephone addiction. Jelly, already an expert on the varieties of male vanity, takes to studying Variety and ringing up sundry screenwriters and set- and costume-designers, apologizing for misdialing them, but then claiming mutual acquaintance. The prank nature of her importuning is softened by the ego-stroke, and soon Jelly becomes their muse, their long-distance telephonamorata:\u201cJelly had a different purpose in listening to anything or anyone. It had something to do with submission, and it had something to do with sympathy. She would lie back and cut off all distraction. The phone was built for this. It had no visual component, no tactile component, no person with hopeful or embarrassed face to read, no scent wafting, no acid collection in the mouth. Just vibrations, long and short waves, and to clutch at them with your own thoughts was just wrong. A distinct resistance to potential. A lack of love, really. Because what is love, if not listening, as uninflected \u2014 as uncontained \u2014 as possible.\u201dThis listening lark acquires a more emotionally consequential tone once Jelly connects with Jack, a divorced father and film composer who enjoys performing his latest cues for her, handset balanced by the keyboard. After myriad sessions of a purely vocal courtship (no \u201ctexted\u201d photos \u2014 this is the 1990s), Jack says the L-word and buys her a first-class ticket to Los Angeles. Jelly, however, has lied to him about nearly everything \u2014 not least her appearance \u2014 so she stands him up and hangs up her receiver: She\u2019ll never talk to another movie man again.The Jelly-Jack reel and the \u00adMeadow-Carrie reel finally synch up when \u201cInward Operator\u201d premieres. Jelly, predictably, is appalled and declares herself used, but what can\u2019t be predicted is how the intensity of her reaction conditions her director\u2019s. Spiotta bleeds this situation for all of its nuance, raising provocative questions about art and commerce and the ethics of creation. By staging the misery of strangers, is Meadow guilty of betrayal? Might she, even, be guilty of self-betrayal \u2014 her catfishing of Jelly\u2019s catfishing ultimately shallower and more exploitative than the blockbuster bait of Carrie\u2019s slapstick?Spiotta\u2019s dramatization of the \u00adMeadow-Carrie dyad is masterly, with lines (in third-person authorial voiceover, and in first person in the voices of both Meadow and Carrie) that seem delivered \u2014 improvised \u2014 by women who\u2019ve known each other and even the reader forever: deeply encoded, privately referential and pregnant with pander, indulgence and resentment:\u201cWas it fair or good or right to count on \u2014 even consider \u2014 an assumption of memory? But isn\u2019t that what all film counted on, a kind of shared memory of everything we have seen in the movies?\u201dSuch is the subtlety of Spiotta\u2019s prose, and the diversity of its presentation (the book includes biographical essays, video transcripts, diary entries, online chats), that the reader can never be sure which, if any, meaning is intended as primary. Are we meant to discern a deconstructive critique, or merely a mockery of chick lit, in Spiotta\u2019s portrayal of two smart female artists trying to honor their pasts while inventing their futures, all without judging each other to death? Or are we reading a philosophical novel, one that enacts the immemorial debate between art as entertainment (Carrie\u2019s filmography) and art for art\u2019s sake (Meadow\u2019s)? For that matter, is all the discussion about the disparities between the women\u2019s genres just a proxy for the literary antagonism between the novel and the memoir? Is Carrie\u2019s willingness to churn out lowbrow lounge-around-in-your-sweatsuit Netflix fodder supposed to be understood as \u00adsocioeconomically inevitable, and therefore forgivable, given its rewards in fame and residuals? Or is Meadow\u2019s willingness to sacrifice mainstream success in favor of recording the (ostensible) facts of human suffering and earning art-house respect supposed to be read as a moral choice, and not as a venal act of appropriation and narcissism? Spiotta\u2019s precision pacing keeps all of these questions and more in the frame, and keeps them fundamentally unanswerable by linking them to such real-life obsessions as sex, attractiveness, childbearing, child-rearing and money.Ironically, the product of all this \u00adsingle-author sleight-of-hand reads like a shockingly smooth collaboration, as if Meadow and Carrie \u2014 who, with their opposing aesthetic approaches, could never have completed a film together \u2014 have somehow joined forces in a novel, the only art form capacious enough yet interior enough to contain them. \u201cInnocents and Others\u201d is a combo-deal of a novel that mixes the silliness of a popcorn romp with the intellectual seriousness of a one-camera talking-head commentary. Highbrow and lowbrow have cohabitated before, of course, but rarely with this ease or this empathy. Spiotta \u2014 like Didion, DeLillo, Nicholson Baker and Bret Easton Ellis \u2014 understands that the interaction between her art form and the popular isn\u2019t an agony but an amity: a peopled life.INNOCENTS AND OTHERSBy Dana Spiotta279 pp. Scribner. $25.Joshua Cohen\u2019s most recent novel, \u201cBook of Numbers,\u201d was published last year.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "At SXSW, a Woman Who Had a Stroke Turns Director", "Date": "2016-03-17", "News": "Supported byAUSTIN, Tex. \u2014 Having a stroke of any kind is not uncommon, but few patients turn on their iPhones and start recording their experience seven days after waking up from an induced coma. Lotje Sodderland did.\u201cMy Beautiful Broken Brain,\u201d a documentary that had its debut here at SXSW last weekend and will be showing on Netflix starting Friday, takes viewers through Ms. Sodderland\u2019s recovery from a brain hemorrhage four years ago when she was 34. Her language impaired, she found herself living in a surreal reality straight out of a David Lynch movie. The paradox is, Ms. Sodderland is a loyal Lynch fan.As she sees the world through her left eye as it was, the right, however, seems like another dimension. The colors are bright and swirling; the audio is amplified and sometimes distorted.Ms. Sodderland and Sophie Robinson directed and produced this 83-minute documentary, which functions as a visual metaphor of Ms. Sodderland\u2019s altered, often bizarre perception.Throughout the film, Ms. Sodderland records imaginary chats with Mr. Lynch in the form of video messages. Eventually, she sends him one. And in an unexpected subplot, the two connect, form a bond, and, after the film was completed, Mr. Lynch, the \u201cTwin Peaks\u201d creator, becomes executive producer.In an interview Ms. Sodderland spoke about her dual role as subject and director. Here are edited excerpts from that conversation.What made you start recording when you were in the hospital?I wasn\u2019t thinking of making a film. I was just trying to understand, basically. I was just recording everything because it was something to do. Things were really difficult and it was a way to remember. I was so afraid of forgetting.What was your role in the editing process?We shot for a year, and then we didn\u2019t get the money together to do the editing until about a year later.So when I went in, I was in shock. I was like, I cannot believe what I\u2019ve been through. And I just thought, I\u2019m not sure I can do this editing because it\u2019s very, very intense.It\u2019s almost like confrontational therapy. But then I thought if I remove myself, disembody myself from the story, and say this is a film about a woman and look at it as a separate entity to myself, I will be able to to do it.So I did get quite heavily involved. And of course I really wanted ownership over the story. If I saw something in the edit, I was like, no, that\u2019s not what it was like.In the edit, you can really form an attachment to the narrative, especially because of the problem with communication, having lost the ability to speak and tell my own story. By that time, having regained some of that ability, I was really keen to tell the story myself, so it was really collaborative.Was that in itself empowering?Absolutely. The making of the film was the regaining of the storytelling faculty. Telling stories, being able to communicate is such a central element of being a human being. Being able to think and express yourself in a linear way is important, so when you lose that ability, you lose your sense of self. The making of the film really is the expression of the regaining of that fundamental human ability.What role did film play in your life before the stroke and now, during your recovery? Before, it was more like a means to an end. I earned a living as a producer. So it wasn\u2019t as creative. It was more a highly cognitive, multitasking kind of job. I always wanted to make documentaries, but ended up producing other people\u2019s docs, which was fine.But now, I actually make my own films, as a result of what happened. So because I can\u2019t do those things anymore \u2014 I still can\u2019t read I\u2019m forced to look at things differently. I look at my abilities and limitations and assess what I can do and how I can function as a professional.Also, the world looks so different. It\u2019s really intense because of the damage to my cerebral cortex. It was like the perfect solution. So now I\u2019m much more creatively active.What about your experience connected you to David Lynch\u2019s films?I started liking David Lynch\u2019s work when I was a teenager and I watched \u201cTwin Peaks.\u201d I was one of those people who got really into it. And like many people, I started following his work. It has this kind of magical, ethereal, weird kind of addictive quality. So when I had the stroke, I just kept thinking it felt like a Lynchian kind of world, where nothing really made sense. The enormity of the weirdness made me think, if only David Lynch were here, he\u2019d know what I\u2019m talking about.Advertisement"}

Sometimes life imitates art. And sometimes, life imitates art before that art has even shown up on Netflix.On \u201cHouse of Cards,\u201d an old photo of Frank\u2019s father shaking hands with a hooded Klansman gets plastered on a billboard on Primary Day in South Carolina. It becomes a massive, damning media story, so the president responds by condemning what the Klan stands for, in a black church, while also telling the truth: that his Daddy did press flesh with a Klansman, but only because he desperately needed money to save the family farm and a white supremacist happened to be only pathway to a loan. The story, while seemingly true, is still cockamamie. Frank loses the endorsement of Rep. Doris Jones \u2014 Cicely Tyson\u2019s delivery of the line \u201cWhen we stop getting beaten and shot, you\u2019ll have my good will, Mr. President\u201d is breathtaking \u2014 and loses the primary in his home state.Sit with that for a minute. I have to think everyone involved in the series was champing at the bit as the Trump story unfolded.Aside from that, though, after two strong episodes, the series falls victim to its fatal flaw: pushing story lines into such absurd places that it\u2019s hard to get particularly invested.For starters, why would Frank keep a copy of that incriminating photograph for all these years, even if it is locked away inside a safe-deposit box? Perhaps anticipating that the audience would wonder about that, Frank addresses the issue, telling Claire, \u201cIt\u2019s the one time I was proud of my father. Because this man, in this moment, is doing what it takes to survive.\u201d This moment speaks to Frank\u2019s unconscious bias or, if you\u2019re being less generous, to the fact that maybe he really is kind of racist after all.Still, no matter how proud that photo might make him, Frank is such a savvy politician that it defies believability to think he would not have had it destroyed. It\u2019s also disappointing that Claire\u2019s reason for playing the Klan card is to make Frank so vulnerable that he\u2019ll agree to make her his running mate. I find it much more enjoyable to watch Claire actively working against Frank than to see her putting on a happy public face for personal gain. We\u2019ve seen her do that, in different contexts, for the past three seasons. I was ready to see her do something entirely new. Maybe she still will.But what bothers me most about her running mate bid \u2014 as well as her House bid and her brief stint as United Nations ambassador \u2014 is the way it implies that being first lady is not an actual job. And it is an actual job, one that involves a lot of work and responsibilities that extend beyond just choosing colors for the White House Easter Egg Roll.The writers of \u201cHouse of Cards\u201d have positioned Claire\u2019s interest in more \u201cdemanding\u201d posts as reflective of her ambition, in order to show that said ambition is equal to any man\u2019s. That\u2019s great. But there\u2019s something a bit anti-feminist in how dismissive the show has been toward the job of first lady, which Claire has completely failed to fulfill. There\u2019s a reason Hillary Clinton waited to pursue her own individual political career until after Bill\u2019s two terms were over: because you can\u2019t do both at once!There\u2019s one more silly bit in this episode \u2014 Lucas Goodwin\u2019s attempt to tip off Heather Dunbar about the fact that Frank is a stone-cold murderer. Two episodes ago, Lucas seemed terrified that Frank might learn his whereabouts. Now he\u2019s so determined to expose him that he\u2019s willing to throw caution and, per his dalliance with his colleague at the car detailing shop, his integrity, to the wind so he can disguise himself and finally get #JusticeforZoeBarnes. Maybe that can be explained away by the fact that Lucas, as Heather suggests, really does have some mental health issues. But there\u2019s no good explanation for why Heather suddenly changes her tune about Lucas, and suggests she may be willing to use his intel to get a leg up in the race.It doesn\u2019t make sense. It\u2019s preposterous. It\u2019s \u201cHouse of Cards.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Moneyball for Book Publishers: A Detailed Look at How We Read", "Date": "2016-03-14", "News": "Supported byAndrew Rhomberg wants to be the Billy Beane of the book world.Mr. Beane used analytics to transform baseball, famously recounted in \u201cMoneyball,\u201d a book by Michael Lewis. Now Mr. Rhomberg wants to use data about people\u2019s reading habits to radically reshape how publishers acquire, edit and market books.While e-books retailers like Amazon, Apple and Barnes & Noble can collect troves of data on their customers\u2019 reading behavior, publishers and writers are still in the dark about what actually happens when readers pick up a book. Do most people devour it in a single sitting, or do half of readers give up after Chapter 2? Are women over 50 more likely to finish the book than young men? Which passages do they highlight, and which do they skip?Mr. Rhomberg\u2019s company is offering publishers the tantalizing prospect of peering over readers\u2019 shoulders. Jellybooks tracks reading behavior the same way Netflix knows what shows you binge-watch and Spotify knows what songs you skip.Here is how it works: the company gives free e-books to a group of readers, often before publication. Rather than asking readers to write a review, it tells them to click on a link embedded in the e-book that will upload all the information that the device has recorded. The information shows Jellybooks when people read and for how long, how far they get in a book and how quickly they read, among other details. It resembles how Amazon and Apple, by looking at data stored in e-reading devices and apps, can see how often books are opened and how far into a book readers get.Jellybooks has run tests on nearly 200 books for seven publishers, one major American publisher, three British publishers and three German houses. Most of the publishers did not want to be identified, to avoid alarming their authors. The company typically gathers reading data from groups of 200 to 600 readers.Mr. Rhomberg recently gave a workshop at Digital Book World, a publishing conference in New York, and some of his findings confirmed the worst fears of publishers and authors.On average, fewer than half of the books tested were finished by a majority of readers. Most readers typically give up on a book in the early chapters. Women tend to quit after 50 to 100 pages, men after 30 to 50. Only 5 percent of the books Jellybooks tested were completed by more than 75 percent of readers. Sixty percent of books fell into a range where 25 percent to 50 percent of test readers finished them. Business books have surprisingly low completion rates.How Will Publishers Use the Data?For the most part, the publishers who are working with Jellybooks are not using the data to radically reshape books to make them more enticing, though they might do that eventually. But some are using the findings to shape their marketing plans. For example, one European publisher reduced its marketing budget for a book it had paid a lot of money to acquire after learning that 90 percent of readers gave up after only five chapters. A German publisher decided to increase advertising and marketing on a debut crime novel after data showed that nearly 70 percent of readers finished it.Publishers might also use the data to learn what type of reader a book appeals to, and market it accordingly. One of the novels that Jellybooks tested was written for teenagers but proved surprisingly popular with adults.Why This Is Scary for AuthorsAuthors are understandably nervous about how new insights into reading behavior might shape publishers\u2019 editorial decisions. Suppose you are writing a crime series, and readers gave up halfway through the latest installment. Publishers might not want to buy the next one. Or what if readers skip around in your nonfiction book, a common way to read nonfiction? An editor might want to cut the chapters people are skipping, potentially erasing useful context.And, of course, people who sign up for a free e-book service might not represent the kinds of readers who would seek and pay for a crime novel, or a nonfiction book on a subject that interests them. The sample sizes are relatively small. So the reader data might not represent the reactions of a general audience.Why This Might Be Troubling for ReadersJellybooks users consent to having their data tracked in exchange for free books, and must click on a link to send that data to Jellybooks. \u201cIt\u2019s absolutely critical to have the user in control, or we face a backlash,\u201d Mr. Rhomberg said at the conference.But as the book industry gets more sophisticated about how to measure reading behavior and the practice becomes more widespread, real privacy concerns could emerge. Some big academic publishers already track how students read their e-books, and some e-book subscription services have developed the capacity to measure reader engagement. Regular e-book readers might not realize that digital retailers are recording and storing the data. A few years ago, California instituted the \u201creader privacy act,\u201d which made it harder for law enforcement agencies to collect information on consumers\u2019 digital reading records from e-book retailers. But most other states have not taken such steps.But Having Companies Reading Over Your Shoulder Is Probably InevitableAnalytics are transforming every corner of the media world. Digital publishing cannot be far behind in measuring consumer behavior. As Mr. Rhomberg put it bluntly at Digital Book World, sales figures are not enough to gauge a book\u2019s success. \u201cAsk yourself,\u201d he said to the audience. \u201cAre you in the business of selling paper?\u201dAdvertisement"}

For $5 a month, the Fullscreen channel will offer 800 hours of advertising-free programming, including new scripted and unscripted series and episodes of throwback television shows like \u201cDawson\u2019s Creek\u201d and \u201cSaved by the Bell.\u201dThe service, which will be available worldwide and have a user interface designed for viewers to interact with one another in real time, will debut on April 26. It will focus on what is sometimes called the \u201csocial-first generation,\u201d or people 13 to 30 years old who spend significant time on social networks like Snapchat and Instagram.\u201cThere are a lot of broad-based SVOD services,\u201d Mr. Chernin said by telephone, referring to streaming video on demand, \u201cbut none that target this audience \u2014 it\u2019s one of the great white spaces out there.\u201dAlthough Mr. Chernin\u2019s company already operates several niche streaming services, including the anime-focused Crunchyroll, Fullscreen is more akin to the cable television networks of the past: MTV for the social media age.Referencing his extensive experience in traditional television \u2014 he helped build the Fox network in the late 1980s and introduce the Fox News Channel in the 1990s \u2014 Mr. Chernin added: \u201cI certainly see this as a better opportunity than creating the fourth broadcast network or yet another cable channel. People thought we were out of our minds.\u201dMr. Chernin, whose company, the Chernin Group, has been behind films like \u201cDawn of the Planet of the Apes\u201d and \u201cSpy,\u201d said he believed that the \u201cliveliness\u201d of Fullscreen\u2019s programming, which will be updated daily, and its \u201cextremely rich\u201d user interface, would make the service stand out from the pack. \u201cIt needs to feel like a destination, and it will,\u201d he said. Mr. Chernin declined to say how much money the long-in-the-works service cost to create.The participation of AT&T also gives Fullscreen a formidable lift. The communications giant will support the service with a major marketing campaign, including promotion of Fullscreen to its mobile and broadband customers. \u201cWe look at this as a fundamental and crucial building block as we transition to a premier mobile entertainment company,\u201d said David Christopher, AT&T\u2019s chief marketing officer.\u201cThese are creators who have already used the social web to develop an audience, which is now eager to see them do more,\u201d said George Strompolos, Fullscreen\u2019s chief executive.The arrival of Fullscreen\u2019s subscription offering reflects the way that this corner of digital media is trying to mature into more meaningful businesses.\u201cWith this step,\u201d Mr. Strompolos said, \u201cFullscreen is becoming a true brand.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "How Aerial Surveillance Has Changed Policing \u2014 and Crime \u2014 in Los Angeles", "Date": "2016-03-23", "News": "FeatureInside the city\u2019s pioneering air-support division.Supported byOn the first of several flights I would take with the division over the course of the last three years, our helicopter lifted off into the haze of a July afternoon. The true bulk of the structure below us finally revealed itself. The building\u2019s landing deck alone seemed nearly the size of an aircraft carrier\u2019s, and from this new, elevated perspective, the headquarters indeed resembled a landlocked warship in the heart of the city; a half-dozen other helicopters were waiting there on the tarmac. The division began with a single helicopter in 1956, and it now has 19 in all, augmented by a King Air fixed-wing plane. The aircrews operate in a state of constant readiness, with at least two helicopters in flight at any given time for 21 hours of every day. A ground crew is suited up and on call for the remaining three, between 5 a.m. and 8 a.m. On weekends, considered peak hours, the number of airborne helicopters goes up to three, although in a crisis the division might send as many as four or five \u201cships\u201d up at once.The police had allowed me to fly with them so that I could see the world from their perspective. Through its aerial patrols, the division has uniquely unfettered access to a fundamentally different experience of Los Angeles, one in which the city must constantly be reinterpreted from above, in real time, with the intention of locating, tracking and interrupting criminal activity. This also means that the police are not only thinking about Los Angeles as it currently exists. Their job is to anticipate things that have yet to occur \u2014 not just where criminals are, but where and when they might arrive next. They patrol time as well as space. In this sense, although it has been in continual operation for the past 60 years, the division has much to tell us about policing the cities of the future.Soon after we were airborne, a call came in for helicopter support, and we diverted north, flying nearly to the mountains that separate Los Angeles from the deserts beyond. A woman had reportedly barricaded herself inside a house with a loaded 9-millimeter handgun. Why she had done this was not at all clear \u2014 and it would remain unexplained to us \u2014 but the police needed to set up a perimeter. They needed someone looking down from above.A standard two-person helicopter crew consists of a pilot and a tactical flight officer, or T.F.O. The pilot steers, but the course is set by the T.F.O., who monitors as many as six simultaneous radio frequencies, including emergency calls from the ground, as well as chatter from other police helicopters and even passenger aircraft landing at Los Angeles International Airport. The constant buzz of layered voices, police codes and call signs was indecipherable to me, but the T.F.O. can decide in an instant if a given call is worth responding to. The pilot can change speed and direction significantly, accelerating up to 170 miles an hour, turning so sharply that the crew will sometimes arrive above a crime scene flying sideways, their bodies parallel to the ground. If none of the calls are worth answering, however, the crew might wander. Some T.F.O.s have a working knowledge of Los Angeles arcana to match that of the most veteran Hollywood tour guide, from the address of Charlie Chaplin\u2019s old mansion to the location of the house used for exterior shots in \u201cThe Brady Bunch.\u201dMy T.F.O. that day was Ren\u00e9e Muro, now 49, a 14-year veteran of the air-support division who had a \u201cGot Altitude?\u201d sticker on the back of her flight helmet. As we circled the location, she set about identifying, assessing and describing the streets, including a quick scan of nearby properties where, if the barricaded woman were to flee, she would most likely end up. For 45 minutes, Muro suggested placements for officers such that they could prevent any possible escape route, naming specific corners and clarifying locations, even occasionally directing police officers to neighbors who were milling about so they could warn them to head back inside.This seemed like a particularly difficult case, however, because the street grid here was \u201cout of sync,\u201d Muro explained, with the rest of the city: The normally orderly numbering system didn\u2019t apply, perhaps because the neighborhood was punctuated by strange L-shaped streets and cul-de-sacs. This presented a unique narrative challenge for her in relaying which bend in a particular street she wanted a patrol car to head toward.Muro persevered, flying in an endless gyre over parking lots, freeway on-ramps and a confused tangle of empty streets, and I watched as a growing armada of patrol cars circled below. She patiently arranged them like chess pieces, forming a tactical geometry that locked down the entire neighborhood. It was real-time urban planning, as implemented by the police. Before we could learn the fate of the barricaded woman, however, we had moved on.Crime shapes cities \u2014 even Paris, the \u201cCity of Light,\u201d takes its nickname, according to one story, from streetlights first instituted as part of a 17th-century police operation \u2014 but the reverse is also true. Cities get the types of crime their design calls for. This logic extends even down to their bedrock: Tunnel jobs are almost unimaginable in granite-based Manhattan, for example, but the soft sedimentary rocks of Los Angeles \u2014 a former seabed \u2014 make it more susceptible to subterranean crime. Infrastructure also plays a major role in permitting or preventing entire classes of criminal activity. The construction of the city\u2019s freeway system in the 1960s helped to instigate a later spike in bank-crime activity by offering easy getaways from financial institutions constructed at the confluence of on-ramps and offramps. This is a convenient location for busy commuters \u2014 but also for prospective bandits, who can pull off the freeway, rob a bank and get back on the freeway practically before the police have been alerted. The maneuver became so common in the 1990s that the Los Angeles police have a name for it: a \u201cstop-and-rob.\u201dThe built environment may inadvertently catalyze new forms of illegal activity, but this also means that the Los Angeles Police Department is constantly responding to criminal innovation with new forms of police work, often before the rest of the world even knows they might be necessary. With its campaign of ubiquitous aerial surveillance, Los Angeles is a kind of real-time R.&D. site for the world\u2019s sprawling megacities, as they, too, try to manage the extralegal consequences of their newfound expansion.After my first flight, Cole Burdette, the chief tactical flight officer, who supervises the training of all the other T.F.O.s, walked me through a quick tour of the headquarters, a dense warren of small corridors and stairways. Our final destination was a classroomlike space lined with whiteboards, where we sat down to talk about crime and the city. With his olive-green flight suit and a military-style haircut, Burdette, 50, could have passed for an Air Force officer. He was observant and detailed-oriented; he would frequently restart entire paragraphs of explanation until he arrived at the correct narrative sequence, and only then would he move on to his next point or answer. Those answers were also astonishingly precise in their geographic reference points. He would bring up exact intersections and even business addresses somewhere out there in the greater maze of Los Angeles, never once relying on a map. Each location would then serve a specific role in Burdette\u2019s ensuing narrative \u2014 sometimes even five or 10 minutes later \u2014 as he tried to make clear why a certain crime or event had unfolded in one way and not another.Los Angeles is a fundamentally different kind of place from New York or Chicago, he explained, with their skyscrapers and deep, canyonlike streets. Those dense clusters of high-rises and towers make thorough aerial patrols nearly impossible, not to mention potentially dangerous. In L.A., by contrast, you simply cannot see the whole city if you rely solely on ground patrols. Limiting yourself to roads is not going to work. The aerial perspective is crucial: You have to think in a distinctly volumetric way about how neighborhoods are actually linked and what the most efficient routes might be between them. After all, this is how criminals think, Burdette said, and this is how they pioneer new ways to escape from you.Even the region\u2019s flight paths have come to influence how criminals use the city. The heavily restricted airspace around Los Angeles International Airport, Burdette pointed out, has transformed the surrounding area into a well-known hiding spot for criminals trying to flee by car. Los Angeles police helicopters cannot always approach the airport because of air-traffic-control safety concerns. Indeed, all those planes, with their otherwise-invisible approach patterns across the Southern California sky, have come to exert a kind of sculptural effect on local crimes across the city: Their lines of flight limit the effectiveness of police helicopter patrols and thus alter the preferred getaway routes.Over several more flights, each with a different combination of pilot and tactical flight officer, I was able to see this array of technical devices firsthand. Each helicopter, for example, contains a unit that picks up signals from LoJack tracking systems, which are used commercially as a tool for recovering stolen vehicles. During a slow spell one night, we drifted above a stretch of the 101 Freeway linking the streets of Hollywood with the San Fernando Valley, looking for stolen cars in transit. The T.F.O. intently watched the craft\u2019s dashboard display, fishing for signals in the darkness. (To his apparent disappointment, we found none.)Later, we tracked a possible stolen sedan, one not equipped with LoJack, using the next best technological assist: the helicopter\u2019s spotlight, a blinding, 50-million-candlepower inferno justifiably known as the Nightsun. It has the effect of a colossal stage-lighting rig, implying high drama with its focused glow. \u201cHe\u2019s going into the buildings!\u201d the T.F.O. exclaimed. This meant the car was heading downtown, where the city\u2019s dense core of skyscrapers would prevent us from following it. The driver wasn\u2019t nearly as savvy as the pilot and T.F.O. thought, however. He soon exited the freeway \u2014 to drive straight home, we saw, followed by two squad cars and six motorcycle units that we had been directing all along. The driver was arrested in the street. After we flew away, we learned from radio chatter that it was simply a D.U.I.On another flight, I was shown the FLIR, or forward-looking infrared camera. To demonstrate how it operated, my T.F.O. that night instructed his pilot to head for the beaches of Santa Monica. Almost at once, the FLIR monitor mounted in the cockpit lit up with the strangely beautiful thermal flare of human life: white-glowing forms walking along the beach or lying on dark blankets next to one another. We flew quite low to the water now as the T.F.O. explained some basics of infrared visualization, and I watched as apparently sleeping forms, white-hot, came into sharp focus, curled up beneath lifeguard structures. There was nowhere to hide, I saw; you could be concealed behind the trunk of a tree, yet an eerie aura would still surround you, shining like a halo. Looking out the helicopter window, I saw nothing but blackness, silky and absolute, up and down the beach in both directions. But when I peered back at the monitor, lights were moving everywhere, like fireflies.Those who want to stay hidden from FLIRs are developing countermeasures, of course. Back on the ground, I asked Burdette about some of their preferred techniques. \u201cPeople are definitely catching on,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019ll rub mud all over themselves, like that movie \u2018Predator,\u2019 or they\u2019ll wrap themselves up in pool covers to mask their heat signature.\u201dI laughed. \u201cDoes that work?\u201dI was expecting him to laugh along with me, but after a slight hesitation, he said: \u201cIt does work \u2014 except a little bit of light starts to shine out of each end. Once they\u2019ve been in there for a while, the temperature builds up, like it starts to cook a little. That\u2019s how we find them.\u201dDavis is right, of course, that aerial command is an instrument of control, and a potentially sinister one at that. But he was wrong about the degree to which the Los Angeles police have been able to mold the landscape. In reality, those police-branded rooftop numbers are all but nonexistent, at least for now; when I asked Burdette what he would change if he could redesign the city from the perspective of a tactical flight officer, he mentioned exactly that idea: painting large identifying numbers on the roofs of building complexes like schools and hospitals. If those sorts of facilities could be numbered in a clockwise direction, starting with the entry building, he explained, directing officers to a structure deep within the sprawl would be far easier. Thus far, however, such an ambitious project has been beyond the police department\u2019s institutional reach. Throughout the history of aerial surveillance in Los Angeles, the urban landscape has largely been an inheritance, beyond the control of any single authority; the air-support division\u2019s real ingenuity has been in how it responds to a world that it did not, in fact, design.Precisely as a way of making up for the absence of rooftop numbering, for instance, the air-support division has deployed something Burdette called \u201cthe rules of four.\u201d As guidelines, they fall somewhere between a rule of thumb and an algorithm, and they allow for nearly instantaneous yet accurate aerial navigation. \u201cThe way the parcels work in the city of Los Angeles,\u201d he began, \u201cis that Main Street and First Street are the hub of the city.\u201d The street numbers radiate outward \u2014 by quadrant, east, west, north, south \u2014 with blocks advancing by hundreds (the 3800 block below 38th Street) and building numbers advancing by fours (3804, 3808, 3812, etc.). The rest is arithmetic.\u201cIf it\u2019s the fourth house south of the corner on the west side of the street,\u201d Burdette explained, \u201cthen the address is going to be an odd number. The rules of four mean that I can do four times four \u2014 it\u2019s the fourth house, times four \u2014 which is 16. But, because the numbers on that side of the street are odd, we know we\u2019re going to be looking at either 15 or 17. So, if the address is south of 38th Street and it\u2019s the fourth house on the west side of the street, then it\u2019s going to be 3815 or 3817. It is going to be that address.\u201dWith the rules of four, an otherwise intimidating and uncontrollable knot of streets takes on newfound clarity. It is no coincidence that the Los Angeles Police Department built its main headquarters at the center of it all, at the intersection of First and Main. It placed the department at the numerological heart of the metropolis, the zero point from which everything else emanates.As Thomas More proposed, a well-ordered metropolis is a fundamental prerequisite for any visionary act of urban governance. The air-support division has simply extended that observation into its understanding of the existing order, in this case of the city\u2019s numbered houses and streets. But if the promise of aerial policing is to make the city more legible \u2014 to help officers read events more clearly \u2014 the obvious temptation is to somehow turn the page, to anticipate future events as well.And here we confront a final dimension \u2014 time \u2014 and another police technique, called predictive policing. Pioneered by the U.C.L.A. anthropologist Jeffrey Brantingham, predictive policing relies upon an interpretive combination of machine-learning algorithms and deep pools of police data to estimate where certain types of crime, like car thefts or burglaries, are most likely to happen next. Brantingham has compared the technique to a Netflix recommendation algorithm, in that it makes suggestions about the future based on what has occurred in the recent past. Predictive policing does not try to predict specific events, but it can help the police identify surprisingly precise areas of high crime and then direct officers to those areas, casting what they hope will be a pre-emptive shadow.With predictive policing, cops will no longer be describing and reacting to the landscape but writing it, in real time \u2014 and with a far greater impact on individual neighborhoods than the simple arrangement of police cars on a stakeout, or even numbers on a roof. In their quest to establish an all-seeing utopian gaze looking down upon the rooftops of an unsuspecting metropolis, the police may have stumbled upon their most powerful, and perhaps most worrying, means of reshaping the city \u2014 one that comes not from seeing, but from being seen.Geoff Manaugh is the writer of BldgBlog, a blog about architecture, and the author of the forthcoming book \u201cA Burglar\u2019s Guide to the City,\u201d from which this article is adapted.Advertisement"}

A scene in the new season\u2019s third episode in which Daredevil (Charlie Cox) has to escape a building down a long stairwell, fighting at every step \u2014 and carrying a gun that he refuses to fire \u2014 is a balletic exercise in brutality and claustrophobia.The Kingpin\u2019s overscaled rage and narcissism gave the story energy, and the contrast with Daredevil\u2019s problematic idealism was fertile ground for comic-book melodrama. In the new season, the dynamic is different and less interesting \u2014 Daredevil and the Punisher are both vigilantes, with different methods and different levels of concern for collateral damage. This leads to long, windy exchanges about heroism and truth that leave you fidgeting, waiting for the next fight to break out.Most of the time, you don\u2019t have to wait long, though given the Punisher\u2019s preferences, a higher percentage of the action this season involves gunfire rather than fists and batons.

Gentrification was an issue in Season 1, but the current season moves back into timeless comic-book territory, with the Punisher taking on Irish, Latino and biker gangs straight out of central casting.Mr. Cox and Elden Hanson, as Foggy, do earnestness well and put across the sometimes dopey dialogue better than you\u2019d have a right to expect. There\u2019s not, however, a lot of wit or shading to their performances \u2014 the writing can be blamed, but they could be doing more to amplify it, to make the show more fun.

Fighting for a client or leaning in to Matt with barely suppressed longing, she transmutes a comic-book tale into real, trembling life.Advertisement"}

But the result was a talky, pokey narrative that wasn\u2019t brought to life by its action set pieces, no matter how well they were done.There were so many shades of gray that it was hard to tell who to root for, which may be admirable in some dramas but is problematic in a comic-book adaptation, even when the source material was written by Frank Miller, the master of the ambivalent antihero. The Punisher, Elektra, even Vincent D\u2019Onofrio\u2019s Kingpin, were all, like Daredevil himself, torn between nobility and savagery, vigilantism and the rule of law. They were good one moment, bad the next. It got exhausting.The neither-here-nor-there quality of the characters ate away at the generally good performances by Jon Bernthal as the Punisher and Elodie Yung as Elektra. (Mr. D\u2019Onofrio, so menacing and tragic in Season 1, was less effective this time around; we\u2019d seen his act, and it hadn\u2019t changed.) Ms. Yung admirably served a major subplot involving whether Daredevil-Matt Murdock would go for the bad girl (Elektra) or the good girl (Karen Page). Predictably, the writers found a way for Matt to have it both ways.(Other characters descended into pure stereotype, particularly those involving Asians, who appeared as ninjas, patriarchal businessmen, dragon ladies and prostitutes.)Charlie Cox, meanwhile, continued to give a performance of all-American blandness as the supposedly conflicted, borderline brutal Daredevil, which is part of the reason the show\u2019s generally excellent battle scenes don\u2019t generate the emotion they should \u2014 we don\u2019t care about the characters enough. There was one exception, though. Playing Stick, the blind, potty-mouthed sensei of both Daredevil and Elektra, Scott Glenn was a glorious, profane disruption in an otherwise button-down show. A veteran film actor making a late-career move into series \u2014 he also had a recurring role in HBO\u2019s \u201cLeftovers\u201d \u2014 Mr. Glenn, in a secondary role, provided the swagger that \u201cDaredevil\u201d fatally lacks.What did everyone else think of this season of \u201cDaredevil?\u201d Feel free to fight your way into the comments.Advertisement"}

The darkness was thick, and Cora noted it, though she also noted some developments in her latest Ramona Quimby read and how to make a more realistic frog-croak with your throat. But then we stopped walking and looked up.\u201cIt feels like space is falling on top of us,\u201d Cora blurted out. She was right, in an abstract, divide-by-zero kind of way. The stars, too, looked worrisomely low. We beheld them, in part because there was nothing else to behold. Except for those weird outcrops, barrenness lay in every direction.As with many of her species, Cora\u2019s life overflowed with the opposite of barrenness: that 21st-century saturation of play dates, art projects, bike rides, Netflix. Compared with history\u2019s more boring childhoods, hers lacks for nothing but nothingness itself, and that\u2019s what I wanted to show her.One thinks of Edmund Burke at such times.The 18th-century writer\u2019s formulation about the sublime versus the beautiful had been formative for me, dividing the aesthetic world into the tidily pleasing and the compellingly terrifying \u2014 think cheerful daisy versus boundless and stormy sea. The dark awe of the sublime is the stuff of your most memorably destabilizing travel experiences, I\u2019d argue. But it\u2019s also the stuff you kiss goodbye with parenthood. Children exist in the realm of the beautiful, and you swap dark awe for a nice beach with non-pokey rocks.But then one day you sense an opening. I\u2019d conceived our ascetic desert romp not out of some joyless parental imperiousness, but because in California\u2019s great nothingness I saw a path into the sublime. Cora and I stood in the hot night air holding hands, being small.\u201cWhat do you think about all this?\u201d I asked. Rookie parenting move. No open questions. But to my surprise she answered: \u201cIt makes you feel like going inside a house and cuddling up.\u201dSeemed like as good a definition of the sublime as any. We walked back to our tent and I read Lemony Snicket to her longer than usual.In the light of day, Cora and I discovered a robust and lively high-desert scene. We ate breakfast at a thronged health food place, and loaded up on fruit at a buzzing farmers\u2019 market. And then we drove south, into nothingness, because vegan scrambled eggs and browsing fruit are not sublime.There was parched earth and there were smudgy clouds. Occasionally civilization crept in \u2014 a military recruitment billboard, some low industrial building \u2014 but it only underscored how dwarfed civilization was amid all this absence.As wastelands go, the Salton Sea area contains multitudes. We drove south to Salvation Mountain, one man\u2019s remote, paint-drenched monument to God in the Colorado Desert. For Cora, a kitchen table artist, a homemade hill draped in ecstatic color was apparently mind-blowing. She kept climbing into nooks and crannies saying, \u201cOh my God.\u201dIt wasn\u2019t much farther to Slab City, the longtime squat community occupying a former Marine barracks. I don\u2019t know how Edmund Burke would classify the place, but the absence of electricity, running water and sewers \u2014 it\u2019s some kind of profound. We chatted with a father and son building a shade structure out of pallets, and picked up a hitchhiker on a hot, rutted road. She had a high voice and had lived at Slab for 10 years. I asked how she ended up here in the first place. \u201cGot dropped off,\u201d she said.Cora and I found a secluded campsite near the Salton Sea. More tent setup, more time stunned under the stars. When the sublime is vaguely terrifying, it occurred to me, part of the terror is the capriciousness of the universe. There\u2019s caprice in the formation of a fluky inland sea, giving rise to all kinds of lives and livelihoods and art projects. It\u2019s caprice, too, when it all dries up and goes away.Cora and I broke camp on Day 3 and climbed back into the hot car, nearing peak ripeness. We beat a path north to Morongo Valley, past a wild mustang feed store and a dig-your-own cactus place. We were winging it by now.We\u2019d pull over here for a hike, there to neurotically restock our water supply. At one point we caught a Wild West gunfight in Pioneertown, a kitschy exception to the trip\u2019s general restraint. I guess you could argue that the fart joke at the end was sublime.Like any responsible parent, I saw Cora\u2019s first visit to these parts as a real educational opportunity, and before we left sought a shallow body of knowledge with which to project pretend wisdom. I emailed Diana K. Davis, a University of California, Davis, history professor who\u2019s written about conceptions of the desert. \u201cWestern thought,\u201d she wrote to me, has largely \u201cconceived of deserts as abnormal, exotic, and frightening to the point of terror in many cases.\u201d But this thinking has been driven by ignorance about ecology, indigenous populations and so forth, she added.Was our wonderment a kind of environmental Orientalism? I wondered now. I decided that hanging out with an actual local might help ground us a bit. On a lark I reached out to a friend of a friend with a place nearby, who invited us over.Scott Pinkmountain and his wife live far down a dusty road, amid elaborate cactus and cartoonish boulders. He\u2019s a mellow guy with a bushy mustache and cut-off corduroys. When they first moved from the Bay Area a few years ago, he said, it was so quiet as to be disorienting. For weeks he thought their fridge was on the fritz. Turned out that\u2019s just what a fridge sounds like when there\u2019s no other sound for miles.It can be unsettling out here, Scott said: the aloneness, the sheer scale of the landscape. Of course that\u2019s also the draw, and the feeling can be soothing. At dusk he sometimes comes outside with a glass of wine, just to look at the boulders.We climbed up some of those boulders, scuffing our feet to warn rattlers.\u201cIn a lot of ways what brings a person out here is absence \u2014 of people, of civilization, everything,\u201d Scott said.We talked about that word, Cora noting that her teacher writes down whoever\u2019s absent each day at school.\u201cIt\u2019s the same out here, except everyone is absent,\u201d Scott said.The next morning, we ventured back into Joshua Tree. It was hot, but a gray sky had muted the park\u2019s colors \u2014 pale greens and browns. Cora and I had one last item on our agenda before returning to civilization. Near an area called Porcupine Wash we pulled over and dashed out among the shrubs and smoke trees.The thing about screaming as loud as you can is, it\u2019s sort of deep \u2014 the thrill of testing your full caliber, the jarring feeling of nobody responding. Cora let loose atop a spine of granite facing a wide expanse of desert floor.I won\u2019t soon forget the complicated look that crossed my daughter\u2019s face as she nearly ruptured my eardrums. It was delight, yes, but also the uncertainty that accompanies total liberation. Later, when she climbed back into the car, I could see in her eyes she was still up on those rocks.Advertisement"}

Ghibli\u2019s twilight raises the question of who is to step into the breach \u2014 to be the next Miyazaki or Takahata? Interviews with a pair of Americans versed in anime provided names that might belong on that list. But they also suggested that the question itself might be misplaced.\u201cIt\u2019s a way of producing films that I think isn\u2019t done elsewhere in Japan,\u201d he said. \u201cMore attention could be lavished on these projects. Particular directors could see their visions through.\u201dJustin Leach, an independent producer and animator who has worked in the American and Japanese industries, echoed the idea that Ghibli might be an impossible act to follow. \u201cA lot of people who enjoyed Ghibli\u2019s movies didn\u2019t necessarily enjoy the other types of Japanese animation,\u201d he said. \u201cThey kind of carved out their own niche. I\u2019m really not quite sure if we will see another Ghibli.\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s definitely established himself among many of the people that have enjoyed Ghibli\u2019s films as sort of the central successor to that legacy,\u201d Mr. Leach said. \u201cWhen I saw \u2018The Girl Who Leapt Through Time,\u2019 I remember thinking, this guy has something special that kind of grabs you and pulls you in.\u201dBoth also mentioned Makoto Shinkai, best known for the dreamy, bittersweet love story \u201c5 Centimeters per Second\u201d (2007) and, like Mr. Hosoda, sometimes referred to as Mr. Miyazaki\u2019s heir apparent.\u201cSome of his images, of like a subway car passing, the details are so photorealistic and gorgeous,\u201d Mr. Beckman said. \u201cHis skies are amazing. There\u2019s a certain patience that allows life to come through.\u201dMr. Beckman included Keiichi Hara, who has worked extensively in television anime (\u201cDoraemon,\u201d \u201cCrayon Shin-Chan\u201d) and directed the well-received features \u201cColourful\u201d (2010) and \u201cMiss Hokusai\u201d (2015).Mr. Beckman and Mr. Leach agreed that the future of Japanese animation \u2014 and creator-driven animation in general \u2014 lies outside Japan. Ghibli\u2019s next film, \u201cThe Red Turtle,\u201d a French co-production with a Dutch director, is a case in point. \u201cWhat needs to happen to evolve to the next step is to develop these collaborations with people from different countries that find a way to reach a global audience,\u201d Mr. Leach said.\u201cThere\u2019s generally speaking a globalization of animation that I think works in our favor,\u201d Mr. Beckman said. At his children\u2019s film festival, running until March 20, eight of the animated features are European, and four are from Asia, including \u201cThe Boy and the Beast.\u201dMr. Hosoda, in an interview at the Toronto International Film Festival last fall, wouldn\u2019t take the bait when asked about the post-Ghibli world.

Its most recent episode had just under six million viewers \u2014 fewer than many of its neighbors on CBS. On the other hand, the first season of \u201cThe Flash\u201d was the CW\u2019s highest-rated show in 2014, averaging close to four million viewers. The episode may bring new viewers to each show.\u201cArrow\u201d introduced Barry Allen, the crime scene investigator who would become Flash, in its second season, and he soon graduated to his own series. Flash opened up the Arrow universe to the exploration of superpowers, time travel, alternate realities and parallel worlds. Supergirl\u2019s Earth has Superman and some other heroes, but no Flash or Green Arrow.For those keeping score at home, the DC film universe, where Batman and Superman just battled it out, is separate from the DC TV universe, which connects the CW\u2019s \u201cArrow,\u201d \u201cThe Flash\u201d and \u201cLegends of Tomorrow\u201d to \u201cConstantine\u201d (which ran for one season on NBC), \u201cSupergirl\u201d (on CBS) and \u201cVixen\u201d (an animated series on the CW\u2019s streaming platform). \u201cGotham,\u201d on Fox, which chronicles the formative years of Bruce Wayne and some of his future adversaries, is its own world.In contrast, Marvel\u2019s network TV shows (\u201cAgents of S.H.I.E.L.D.\u201d and \u201cAgent Carter\u201d) and its Netflix series (\u201cDaredevil,\u201d \u201cJessica Jones\u201d and the coming \u201cLuke Cage\u201d) are part of the world presented in the films from Marvel Studios, which this spring will include Captain America fighting Iron Man in \u201cCaptain America: Civil War.\u201dComic book fans are intimately familiar with this type of minutia, but will keeping track of who\u2019s who on what Earth be too challenging for viewers? \u201cOnly if we make it complicated,\u201d said Geoff Johns, the chief creative officer at DC Entertainment. He is a fan of the multiverse concept. \u201cThe possibilities are endless,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are no rules.\u201d But he knows it is a balancing act. \u201cMythology is amazing, but the character and story have to come before that.

Mr. Hazen has been baking with it ever since. \u201cWe won\u2019t eat anything else,\u201d said his wife, Lorri.Jocelyn Knepler of Bowling Green, Ky., was given her sourdough starter by a friend in Midland, Tex., in 1973. \u201cShe got it from a woman in Kermit, Tex., who got it from a woman in Golden, Colo., who started it in 1948,\u201d she said.Ms. Knepler and her starter have since moved together from Texas to Alaska, to Britain, to China and to Kentucky, where she is retired. Her daughter uses the same starter to feed her boys. \u201cIt\u2019s a family tradition,\u201d she said.A sourdough starter comes into your life the way a turtle might: as a pet you maybe didn\u2019t know you wanted until someone hands it to you or you find yourself holding the terrarium after an impulse purchase you couldn\u2019t explain if you tried. You get it or you make it or you buy it, and now you have a sourdough starter. It needs to be fed. It asks to be used.There are holes in our lives. They are filled for us by circumstance, or we fill them ourselves.Sourdough starter is simply flour and water left to ferment, a medium that supports the wild yeast and lactobacilli that surround us all. Fed with more flour, and more water, a sourdough eventually achieves a kind of symbiosis that helps dough rise, without the use of cultivated yeast. That it delivers a pungent, slightly sour and deeply alluring taste to all that you cook with it is a happy side effect. Taste is not, strictly speaking, the point of sourdough.Mr. Pollan can sometimes sound bossy. \u201cSourdough is the proper way to make bread,\u201d he said in one segment.It is certainly a simple way to make bread, at least once you have a starter up and going, though the process takes time, because the wild yeast in a sourdough starter is less vigorous than its commercial counterparts. Make bread with a sourdough starter, and the dough rises slowly as the starter ferments and changes, and as it reacts to all manner of factors, like flour type, air temperature, humidity and altitude.A baker can react to those factors with science or conviction. Erika Szymanski, an American doctoral student at the University of Otago, in New Zealand, has a master\u2019s degree in microbiology and uses her sourdough regularly, for pancakes, skillet breads and rye loaves alike. But she is hardly doctrinaire about its care.\u201cSourdough is alive, and so are we,\u201d she said. \u201cThe whole deal, I think, has to be about figuring out a relationship that works for both parties. And if it\u2019s unconventional, whose business is it to replace love with fear and claim that you\u2019re doing it wrong?\u201dStart at the top, then. See if you can\u2019t get some starter from someone. Anyone who has one will be glad to part with a cup or so, because to maintain its balance and size, you need to use or discard part of the starter each time you feed it.Once you have an active starter, which is to say one that is light and bubbly, with a pleasant yeasty-boozy aroma, a fork appears in the road. Obsessives and frequent bakers keep their starters out on their countertops, using the stuff daily, feeding it daily. Some people name their starters: William Butler Yeast, Herman, Sarah, Sky Pilot, Ms. Tippity, Eleanor, Roxanne.The rest of us keep sourdough starters in the refrigerator, which slows their metabolism, allowing us to use them, and feed them, less frequently. (We do not name our livestock.)\u201cUltimately,\u201d Mr. Fromartz said, a sourdough starter \u201cadapts to your kitchen, feeding regime and feedstock, which will favor certain yeast and bacteria over time.\u201dBenjamin Seigle, a home baker in Chicago, certainly is. \u201cI take a glob of it,\u201d he said of his starter, \u201cand throw it in the dough,\u201d then he allows it to ferment for a day before baking.

{"Headline": "Marketers Take Second Look at Over-50 Consumers", "Date": "2016-03-04", "News": "Supported bySpecial SectionBrent Bouchez opened Agency Five0 six years ago in New York as an advertising firm specializing in marketing to baby boomers, on the assumption that companies would need to tune their messages differently as the last of the boomers headed into their 50s.But the firm has only just landed its first boomer-targeted marketing effort \u201cwith real spending behind it,\u201d Mr. Bouchez said. Two years ago, he started another agency, Bouchez Page, to capture a wider range of business.\u201cWhat held us back was the very idea of 50,\u201d he said. \u201cWe heard \u2018I can\u2019t go to my boss and say I\u2019m going to an agency that targets 50-plus.\u2019 \u201dMr. Bouchez and other specialists in marketing to baby boomers, the more than 75 million Americans born roughly from 1946 through 1964, said companies recognized the economic value of the group but were hesitant to shift marketing budgets away from the 83 million millennials, those born from 1982 to 2000, who remain the holy grail of advertisers.A result is what marketers call a transitional phase in which millennials and boomers will be increasingly targeted in messages that try to bridge the groups.\u201cCompanies want to reach boomers, but they want to do it with their general advertising message, usually a message created by and for a millennial target,\u201d Mr. Bouchez said. \u201cNo mainstream brand has spent money on a targeted creative campaign for boomers.\u201dThus far, if the aging consumer is the primary target, the pharmaceutical and retirement-related financial sectors are doing the marketing.Consequently, boomers say they feel underserved by marketing.\u201cWe did a survey of boomer perceptions of marketing directed at them, and over 80 percent said they feel advertisers are making mistakes, either with the wrong message or the wrong offer,\u201d said Dave Austin, managing director of Influent50, a marketing agency created by AARP last year to help companies with branding for its members.\u201cWe\u2019re tired of the idea that if you put a Rolling Stones song on a commercial, you\u2019ll reach the over-50s,\u201d he said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t work that way.\u201dSome ads that try to take a more age-inclusive approach have hit the target, marketers said, particularly the fashion industry\u2019s campaigns that include women older than 50, a big change from its well-known obsession with youth.Two examples are Gap\u2019s \u201cDress Normal\u201d campaign, with Anjelica Huston and various other celebrities of different ages, and L\u2019Or\u00e9al\u2019s Paris line, which features women of different ages, including Helen Mirren and Blake Lively.Peter Hubbell, founder of BoomAgers, a New York-based advertising agency and marketing consultancy focused on the aging consumer, said boomers would \u201crespect those brands that represent them faithfully while appealing to their values and ambitions at this stage of their lives.\u201dBrands for whom boomers are obvious targets are also trying to focus on what people over 50 see as the best years of their lives.As part of its recent \u201cMade to Move\u201d campaign about Osteo Bi-Flex, its joint health supplement, NBTY of Ronkonkoma, N.Y., portrayed a 50-something woman doing yoga beside her daughter.After easily rotating her shoulder with a vertical arm stretch, she whispers to the male instructor that her daughter is single, prompting protest from the daughter. \u201cIt also supports wonderfully high levels of humiliation in her daughter,\u201d says the voice-over.While the ad is not without its detractors \u2014 some specialists in marketing to people over 50 said it reinforced the clich\u00e9 that older people say embarrassingly inappropriate things \u2014 it is meant to reflect boomer values, even if it is at the expense of the daughter\u2019s feelings.\u201cThe ad demonstrates that we really know who boomers are and how our product can help them maintain their active lifestyle,\u201d said Andre Branch, the company\u2019s chief marketing officer. \u201cThe humor is there, but it\u2019s not contrived. It\u2019s about the feeling of empowerment, being who they want to be.\u201dThe superior buying power of the boomers compared with the millennials is clearly one factor forcing marketers to recalibrate their messages.According to a four-year-old Nielsen-BoomAger study, by 2017 nearly 50 percent of the United States adult population will be 50 and older and will control 70 percent of the country\u2019s disposable income. Moreover, that group stands to inherit $15 trillion in the next 20 years.In contrast, 75 percent of millennials can afford to buy only what they need, not what they want, according to a 2015 study by BoomAger and the Natural Marketing Institute. In addition, 45 percent of them are not employed and 23 percent have college debt.\u201cMany millennials will not enter their prime earning and spending years until 2020, and most not until 2030,\u201d Mr. Hubbell said. \u201cSobering news if you put all your eggs in this basket.\u201dMedia consumption habits are also working toward increased marketing spending to reach boomers. According to Brian Nguyen, communications strategy director at Droga5, a New York-based advertising agency, use of mobile, tablet, video and social sharing is evening out between the groups.In addition, streaming services like Netflix and Amazon are developing content targeted to boomers.\u201cAs media touch points increase and buying power remains strong, marketers will have more and more compelling reasons to boomerang back to boomers,\u201d Mr. Nguyen said.He predicted that in the next two to three years marketers would work increasingly to blend strategies that address millennials and boomers.\u201cHere at Droga5, we\u2019ve already begun to take a more age-agnostic approach,\u201d he said, \u201cby building campaigns on truths and insights rather than arbitrary assumptions based on generational stereotypes.\u201dAdvertisement"}
