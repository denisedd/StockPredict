{"Headline": "After North Korea Flooding, Relief Agencies Help Tens of Thousands", "Date": "2016-09-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySEOUL, South Korea \u2014 International relief agencies said on Wednesday that they had begun delivering food and other assistance to tens of thousands of North Koreans who lost homes in some of the worst flooding to hit the country in years.North Korea reported hundreds of people dead or missing but has not publicly appealed for outside help, instead relying on internal mobilization for relief efforts in the flooded provinces, near its northern border with China. The areas are among the poorest in North Korea.Although some outside aid agencies have withdrawn from the country in recent years, a handful are still allowed to operate there.The United Nations World Food Program said that it had delivered emergency food assistance, including fortified biscuits and beans, to more than 140,000 people.\u201cW.F.P. is concerned about the continued vulnerability of these people as the extremely cold winter is approaching, and major food losses are expected,\u201d the program said. \u201cPeople are in urgent need of shelter, access to clean water and health services, as well as food and nutrition assistance.\u201dTyphoon Lionrock unleashed torrential rains in North Korea in late August, which in turn set off floods.In some villages, \u201cthere was barely a building left unscathed,\u201d said Chris Staines, an official from the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies, who recently returned from a trip to North Korea to assess the damage. \u201cThe floods came through with such force \u2014 they destroyed everything in their path.\u201dThe federation said it was providing tarpaulins, tents and tools to make emergency shelters, as well as water purification tablets and personal hygiene items.North Korea has confirmed to international aid agencies that 133 people have been killed and an additional 395 remain missing. More than 35,500 houses and 8,700 schools and other buildings were damaged, as well as almost 40,000 acres of arable land, they said.On Wednesday, Central TV, the state-run broadcaster, said that the latest floods were among the worst in decades and left 68,900 people without shelter. It also reported extensive damage to bridges, roads and rail lines. It reported what it described as a detailed, coordinated nationwide effort by various state agencies to help the victims under instructions from the country\u2019s leader, Kim Jong-un.The number of people affected is likely to increase, as some of the flooded villages have not yet been reached, the World Food Program said.Darlene Tymo, the program\u2019s relief coordinator for North Korea, said that the floods came just before the harvest period, when the crops were still in the ground.The World Food Program said it supplied emergency food by diverting fortified food stocks from local factories that it has been running to feed children and pregnant and nursing mothers. It said it required $1.2 million to replenish the stocks for the children and women. Over all, it said it needed $21 million until next August to help people in North Korea, where it said more than 70 percent of the population suffer food shortages.Despite recent efforts to plant trees, many of the hills in North Korea, a mountainous country, remain bare after decades of cutting trees for firewood and making room for terraced farm patches. That makes North Korea particularly vulnerable to frequent floods and droughts.A series of floods and droughts led to a famine in the mid- and late 1990s, leading the isolated country to issue a rare appeal for international help. By some estimates, more than a million people died.The North\u2019s food situation has improved in recent years. But international aid groups have called each year for donations to help feed the poor. Countries like South Korea have become increasingly reluctant to provide the generous aid they used to give, accusing the North of squandering its resources on its nuclear weapons program.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Investors Stick With Assets That Mimic Hedge Funds", "Date": "2016-09-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMutual funds that mimic hedge fund strategies \u2014 the so-called liquid alternatives sector \u2014 were among the hottest investments just a few years ago. Despite lagging returns and setbacks at several noteworthy funds, retail investors until recently have stuck with them even as they have pulled billions of dollars out of other funds.There may be early warning signs that that is about to change.The current market leader is a trend-following financial futures fund called the AQR Managed Futures Strategy Fund, which has ridden the downturn in oil prices and interest rates to a recent peak of $14.3 billion of assets.Its sponsor, Clifford Asness\u2019s quantitative investment firm AQR Capital Management in Greenwich, Conn., has become the biggest manager of liquid alts, with $25.7 billion in nine different funds. But like others in the sector, AQR has not been able to shake off lackluster performance. Returns for its managed futures fund of just 2 percent in 2015 and negative 1.8 percent in 2016 have fallen short of its average annual return of 9.5 percent in 2013 and 2014.AQR says the fund, which also holds stock and currency futures, acts as a diversifying \u201cshock absorber,\u201d offering protection during market declines.The once-torrid growth of liquid alts, which quadrupled to $180 billion of investor assets from 2008 to mid-2014, petered out over the last two years. Assets remain steady at a current $175 billion, according to Morningstar, a research firm in Chicago that tracks mutual funds. That is remarkable considering the large outflows from the sector\u2019s former juggernaut, the Marketfield Fund, which shrank from a 2014 peak of $21.5 billion to a current $1 billion partly because of ill-timed bets on commodities and China stocks.In the last five months, however, investors have pulled $5.1 billion from liquid alts. They still have not fled to the same degree they have abandoned active mutual funds generally. In the two years ended in June, $410.5 billion had been pulled from active managers, or 4.2 percent of average assets for the period, as their performance often trailed the market. In their place, investors have stampeded into lower-fee \u201cpassive\u201d index funds, which aim to match returns for major stock and bond indexes.Jason Kephart, an alternative investments analyst at Morningstar, said interest in liquid alts had plateaued because, \u201cpainting with a broad brush, performance has really been underwhelming, and the fees are probably still too high.\u201dDoug Black, founder of Aronson SpringReef, which reviews the performance of financial advisers, said in the last two years investors had poured $25 billion into managed futures and multi-alternative strategies, essentially funds of hedge funds.That interest may be largely because brokers and financial advisers have been selling liquid-alt funds to investors as an alternative to risky and richly priced stocks and bonds, Mr. Black said. \u201cNobody is calling their broker and saying \u2018I would like a multi-alternatives fund or a managed futures fund.\u2019\u201dThe funds are more expensive than plain vanilla mutual funds; fees for liquid-alt funds average more than 1.3 percent annually, compared with 0.77 for all active managers, according to Morningstar.The liquid-alts sector took off after the financial crisis of 2008, when investors intensified their search for funds that could protect them from the full force of a severe stock market decline. Hedge funds are limited to investors who have enough net worth or income to weather an investment loss and who agree to restrictions on taking their money out of the funds. Liquid-alt funds were created to copy the strategies that popular hedge funds followed, but in a mutual fund structure that made investing in them available to the mass market and easily redeemable.But early standout funds like Marketfield fell into a familiar pattern. They initially posted a few years of outsize returns that drew investor dollars and fat fees for their sponsors and followed that with disappointing returns that prompted investors to flee.Joel Greenblatt of Gotham Asset Management claimed in his 2005 book \u201cThe Little Book That Beats the Market\u201d to have a \u201cmagic formula\u201d that beat the market \u2014 on paper \u2014 by an average 10 percentage points annually from 1988 to 2004.Beginning in August 2012, Gotham rolled out nine funds using methodology similar in some respects to the magic formula. While they used similar valuation yardsticks, they picked far more stocks than the 30 chosen using the magic formula. They also bet on a price decline by selling stocks short.With varying degrees of market exposure and above-average fees of 2 percent annually, the Gotham funds pulled in $6.5 billion by February 2015.The Gotham Absolute Return fund beat the market in its first four months, even though it had a net market exposure of only 60 percent \u2014 meaning it bought stocks worth 120 percent of its assets and sold short stocks worth 60 percent of assets. It pulled in $3.7 billion at its peak.But in 2015, the fund faltered, losing 10.2 percent while the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index gained 1.4 percent. It also trails its target market exposure this year. As a result, investors have withdrawn their money, shrinking the fund to just $1 billion. Gotham\u2019s total mutual fund assets have shrunk by more than half to $2.9 billion.Gotham Enhanced Return fund, which Morningstar considers a conventional fund, has a 100 percent market exposure of 170 percent long and 70 percent short. It, too, beat the market in its first two years, 2013 and 2014, attracting $1.6 billion of investor assets. But it trailed the market by more than 12 percentage points in 2015 and its assets have since fallen below $1 billion. As of now, it has trailed the market for the fund\u2019s entire three-year life \u2014 something Mr. Greenblatt\u2019s book said had only a 5 percent or less chance of happening with the magic formula.Gotham\u2019s own reports have blamed the results on the short portfolios, without elaborating. They also noted that the funds compared more favorably with an index of hedge funds, which have also faltered lately. Mr. Greenblatt declined to comment.Some liquid-alts officials acknowledge the pattern. \u201cIt\u2019s a challenge for all of us to overcome the boom-bust, hero-goat profile,\u201d said David Jilek, chief investment strategist at Gateway Investment Advisers, manager of the Gateway Fund, the second-largest liquid-alts fund at $8.2 billion.The track record of the third-largest liquid-alts fund, the $8.1 billion John Hancock Global Absolute Return Strategies Fund, has also lagged, with average annual returns in its first three years 2012-14 of 5.6 percent falling to just 1.7 percent in 2015 and negative 4.8 percent so far this year. It, too, has had recent outflows.Fidelity Investments pulled client assets in March from a multimanager fund run by the Blackstone Group as value dropped 6.6 percent in three months. Fidelity officials declined to comment.Fidelity seeded the fund with $1 billion in 2013 and had a one-year exclusive on it. Fidelity still uses liquid alts to diversify 3 to 4 percent of assets for some wealthy advisory clients.Blackstone started a similar fund of its own in mid-2014, tracking the strategies of 19 different hedge fund managers including D. E. Shaw and Cerberus. Although the $4.7 billion fund also suffered a 5.6 percent drop in value last winter before rebounding, it kept pulling in new money in the second quarter, but had outflows in recent months.Liquid-alts managers remain optimistic. David Kabiller, co-founder of AQR, said his firm aimed to offer alternatives to individuals through financial advisers that can diversify returns on stock and bond portfolios, much as they do for pensions and university endowments.Advertisement"}

Despite decades under communist rule, there\u2019s magic to the intimate city: It\u2019s the sort of place where you can stroll past jelly-bean-colored Baroque churches, over a bridge flanked by dragons \u2014 Ljubljana\u2019s mascot \u2014 onto winding cobblestone lanes filled with local farmers selling peonies the size of lap dogs and creaky inns serving bear meat.But in the past few years, an influx of chefs, artists and musicians has reinvigorated the once-sleepy city. The draws: a relaxed pace, Art Nouveau architecture, rich layers of history and cuisine (Roman, Austro-Hungarian, French, Mediterranean), an unapologetic focus on good living and a fiercely held creative edge. Twenty-five years after independence from Yugoslavia, you can find that radical spirit in places like Metelkova Mesto, an arts and music complex in a former military barracks, or in an abandoned power station repurposed as a weekend rave venue. Jelisaveta Duricic, an embroidery artist associated with the popular Universal Studio of Street Arts, still likens the city to \u201ca fairy tale\u201d \u2014 albeit now one illustrated by Banksy.Hotel CuboBuilt in 1932 as a private residence, this statuesque Art Deco building had many lives \u2014 as a ballet school, a magazine headquarters, a government office \u2014 before its 2011 reincarnation as a hotel.

{"Headline": "\u2018Trust Your Gut\u2019 Might Actually Be Profitable Advice on Wall Street, Study Says", "Date": "2016-09-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhat attributes make for a successful trader? Is it comprehensive knowledge of an industry? The ability to read the markets? Luck?Or might it be something subtler and seemingly unrelated \u2014 namely, an awareness of one\u2019s own heartbeat?The team, which included professors from universities in Britain and Australia, was investigating a theory developed by John Coates, a former trader who until recently was a researcher at Cambridge University.Mr. Coates set out to try to identify whether \u201cgut feelings\u201d were merely the stuff of myth, or something real and measurable.\u201cI always knew when I was trading on Wall Street that there was something extra to making it,\u201d said Mr. Coates, who traded fixed-income derivatives at Goldman Sachs and then Deutsche Bank in the late 1990s. \u201cThere were times when something just felt right.\u201dMr. Coates moved on from Wall Street to become a researcher and author. In a previous study, he demonstrated that traders demonstrated physiological signs of stress during market volatility, even when they did not rationally believe they were at risk of losing much money.And in his 2013 book, \u201cThe Hour Between Dog and Wolf: How Risk Taking Transforms Us, Body and Mind,\u201d Mr. Coates relates how George Soros, the hedge fund billionaire, relied on so-called animal instincts. When Mr. Soros was actively managing his fund, he would suffer from backaches, and said that he \u201cused the onset of acute pain as a signal that there was something wrong in my portfolio.\u201dBuilding off that work, Mr. Coates wondered whether traders who were more sensitive to their own bodies might perform better at their jobs.To investigate his hypothesis, Mr. Coates and his colleagues worked with 18 traders at a hedge fund in London in 2012. The subjects, all men, were high-frequency traders, buying and selling bond futures and other products.Using heart rate monitoring equipment, Mr. Coates and his colleagues assessed the traders\u2019 ability to silently count their own heartbeats without touching their chest or any pulse point. A control group of 48 men who were not traders was also tested for their ability to monitor their heart rates.Over all, the hedge fund employees were substantially more accurate than the control group, suggesting that on balance, the high-frequency traders were more attuned to their own bodies than the general public.The hedge fund, which was not identified, gave Mr. Coates and his colleagues access to the traders\u2019 employment history, including their profits and losses, and tenure in the industry.And among the traders, more accurate heartbeat awareness was correlated with profitability. That is, the better a trader was at sensing his own heart rate, the more successful he was at high-frequency trading.What is more, the longer an employee of the hedge fund had been working as a trader, the more accurate he was at counting his heart rate.\u201cWhat we\u2019re realizing more and more is that these things are doggone complicated,\u201d said Bruce S. McEwen, a Rockefeller University professor studying how stress affects the brain, who was not involved in the research. \u201cThere is no simple explanation of them, but we have to be aware of the phenomenology. Coates and colleagues are making people aware of possible factors that are ones other than those we normally think about.\u201dIn the paper, Mr. Coates and his colleagues suggest that acute awareness of heart rate might somehow contribute to traders\u2019 profitability.\u201cTraders in the financial world often speak of the importance of gut feelings for choosing profitable trades,\u201d the authors wrote. \u201cBy this they mean that subtle physiological changes in their bodies provide cues helping them rapidly select from a range of possible trades the one that just \u2018feels right.\u2019 Our findings suggest that the gut feelings informing this decision are more than the mythical entities of financial lore \u2014 they are real physiological signals, valuable ones at that.\u201dYet the researchers stop short of establishing any direct causal link between heart rate awareness and trader profitability. \u201cOur study, being field work, could not establish causation,\u201d they wrote.For example, it might be the case that working in a high-stress job like trading somehow makes people more sensitive to their heart rates. Mr. Coates and his colleagues also found that people with lower body mass index and lower heart rate variability had better heart rate awareness.\u201cThey are trying to suggest a link, but then they acknowledge that we don\u2019t really understand cause and effect,\u201d Professor McEwen said. \u201cIt\u2019s a delicate balance.\u201dIn an interview, Mr. Coates acknowledged that the results did not prove any direct correlation. \u201cIt\u2019s a starting point for more controlled science,\u201d he said.Yet he remained intrigued by the possibility that when traders and other employees in high-stress professions were able to listen to their bodies, they made better decisions. He said that in addition to the pulse, other signals from the body such as muscle tension, colon distention, stomach distention and immune reactions might be picking up on things that the rational mind was missing.\u201cThere\u2019s a part of our brain that sends the signals to our body, and it\u2019s really smart,\u201d Mr. Coates said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t succumb to the mistakes of behavioral finance.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Agrium and Potash Corp. to Merge, Creating Fertilizer Giant", "Date": "2016-09-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAs chemical and agricultural products producers face pressure to grow, two of the world\u2019s largest crop fertilizer makers have agreed to combine in the latest farming industry deal.But fertilizer prices have recently come under pressure because of supply gluts and newer competitors, and demand has also softened. The deal enables the companies to cut $500 million of their combined costs annually over the next few years to help them withstand some of the new market dynamics.\u201cThe beauty about this transaction though is the $500 million of annual operating synergies that are in our control,\u201d Charles V. Magro, president and chief executive of Agrium, said in a conference call with analysts on Monday. \u201cWe don\u2019t need the market to improve to drive shareholder value.\u201dShareholders seemed a bit more skeptical. After the deal closes, Potash shareholders will own 52 percent of the new company, while Agrium\u2019s investors will own 48 percent. The stocks of both companies declined on Monday, with Agrium about 3 percent lower, and Potash slipping more than 1.5 percent. One possibility for the declines: The deal does not have a premium.The combination would help Potash, which produces half the potash in North America, reduce its exposure to volatile prices for the potassium product. Agrium has a big presence among farm-retail chains, enabling it to produce more stable earnings than wholesale fertilizer, according to a Sept. 1 report by Fitch Ratings after word of preliminary talks between the two companies came out. A combination \u201cwill improve market reach and allow the company to optimize its product margins,\u201d Monica Bonar, a senior director at Fitch, said in the report.Some farm groups have raised concerns about the effect of a merger of Agrium and Potash on fertilizer prices. Yet there has been little public outcry since the two companies said on Aug. 30 that they were in talks.The heads of the two companies brushed aside criticism. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be a benefit for the farming community\u201d because the new company will be more competitive, Mr. Magro said in the conference call.The deal will require regulatory and competition reviews in Canada as well as by American regulators.In Canada, the Liberal government of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has not raised any concerns about the merger, at least publicly.Philip Proulx, a spokesman for Navdeep Bains, Canada\u2019s minister of Innovation, Science and Economic Development, said that the government anticipates that the Competition Bureau will review the merger. But he noted that his department, which describes itself as a law enforcement agency, \u201cconducts merger reviews independently of the government.\u201d If its review leads to concerns which the two companies are unwilling to resolve, the Competition Bureau could challenge the merger through the Competition Tribunal, a specialized court.After a request by the province of Saskatchewan, which founded Potash in 1975 and sold it to the private sector it in 1989, the Conservative federal government at the time effectively killed the deal using foreign investment review laws.Reflecting the decline in fortune of the potash industry, the $36 billion value of the merged companies is well below the $39 billion BHP proposed to pay for Potash alone.Potash said the average price for its commodity during the second quarter of this year was $154 a metric ton. At the height of the battle with BHP, prices reached as high as $900.The name of the combined Agrium and Potash Corporation, which will have about 20,000 employees, is to be determined before the deal closes. The companies expect to generate cost savings from combining their distribution and retail operations, production and back-office capabilities.The companies also said they were committed to Canpotex, a cartel for controlling potash prices. It is jointly owned by Agrium and Potash, as well as a Mosaic Company subsidiary.Mr. Magro will become chief executive of the combined company, while Jochen Tilk, the president and chief executive of Potash, will become its executive chairman. The new company\u2019s board will have an equal number of directors from each company.Potash had a $14.3 billion market valuation as of Friday\u2019s close, while Agrium\u2019s was $13.2 billion. Under terms of the deal, Potash shareholders will receive 0.400 common shares of the new company for each of their shares, while Agrium shareholders will receive 2.230 common shares of the new company.After the close of the deal, the company will seek a dividend similar to Agrium\u2019s, adjusted for the new number of shares. The dividend would be subject to market conditions and board approval. Its legally registered head office will be in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, where Potash is based, with corporate offices in Calgary as well.The deal, which has been approved by the boards of both companies, is expected to close in mid-2017, depending on approvals by regulators, the Canadian court and shareholders.Agrium\u2019s financial advisers in the deal included Barclays and CIBC Capital Markets, while Bank of America Merrill Lynch and RBC Capital Markets advised the Potash Corporation. Agrium\u2019s legal advisers were Blake, Cassels & Graydon; Norton Rose Fulbright, Canada; Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison; and Latham & Watkins. Stikeman Elliott and Jones Day provided legal counsel to the Potash Corporation. Morgan Stanley advised both Agrium and the Potash Corporation.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A New Debate Over Pricing the Risks of Climate Change", "Date": "2016-09-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySome companies, including Exxon Mobil, say the economics of climate change are too hard to predict for them to give investors hard numbers about the business impact of global warming.Federal regulators may disagree and are considering requiring Exxon to do just that for the value of its oil reserves.Now a long-shot legislative effort by a Florida congressman to prevent such a move by the federal government has become an unexpected flash point in the battle over disclosing climate-related risks \u2014 with potentially hundreds of billions of dollars in the balance.But at a time when many Republicans dispute the very notion of climate change, the Posey measure has focused the debate over whether it is reasonable \u2014 or even possible \u2014 to expect companies to put a price tag on the environmental impact of climate change.Donald J. Trump, the Republican presidential candidate, has called climate change \u201ca hoax\u201d and promises to slash environmental regulations to bolster economic growth.The issue is not limited to Exxon and oil companies. The Posey amendment would allow real estate companies to stay mum on the risks posed to waterfront properties by rising seas, for example, and let food companies leave the impact of future water shortages unaddressed.But some companies, including Exxon, contend that the economics of climate change are unpredictable and that global growth will continue to create demand for resources, making it even more difficult to come up with hard numbers.Representative Posey is among those who say the federal government has no business forcing businesses to try. He accuses the financial regulator, the Securities and Exchange Commission, of pursuing a political agenda by pressing companies to quantify climate risks.\u201cThese politically motivated and mandated disclosures are not about protecting investors, they are about shaming companies, or at least attempting to shame companies, into adopting their agenda,\u201d he said in July.George Cecala, a spokesman for Mr. Posey, did not respond to requests for further comment.\u201cHow could anybody tell the S.E.C. to ignore the climate?\u201d Ms. Lubber of Ceres said.The issue has been for investors, corporate executives and environmental leaders gathered in New York this week for Climate Week, an annual showcase tied to the opening of the United Nations General Assembly.Already, a shift in the global energy landscape, brought on partly by a surge in drilling in United States oil and gas shale fields, has brought about a slump in fuel prices, calling into question the viability of future oil projects in far-flung places like the Arctic and deepwater oceans.And scientists estimate that as much as three-quarters of the world\u2019s coal, oil and gas reserves must remain in the ground if the world has a shot at keeping carbon emissions under levels set by the Paris climate accord \u2014 unless there is a technological breakthrough in capturing carbon and keeping it out of the atmosphere.Exxon and its American oil industry peers have been reluctant to estimate the risks to their balance sheets. That contrasts with oil companies in Europe, which have been writing down the value of their assets over the last two years as oil prices plummeted.Energy experts say that is largely because international financial reporting standards require more detailed reporting on asset valuations than the standards in the United States. Last year, Statoil, the Norwegian oil giant, wrote down the value of its North American shale and oil sands assets by $4 billion. Royal Dutch Shell reported a write-down of more than $8 billion.\u201cThe rules are different, the relationships between the companies and governments are different, and Europe has clearer carbon policies,\u201d said Michael Webber, associate director of the Energy Institute at the University of Texas at Austin.Exxon Mobil, which has accumulated assets over decades, has long argued that its executives take a long view that includes periods of both low and high commodity prices that swing as a matter of normal course.In its filings to the S.E.C., Exxon Mobil has reported that it has stress-tested its major assets and expects that future cash flow could sustain even its most economically challenged oil and gas fields. The company has conceded that a future write-down of assets is possible if its projections change.Still, most oil companies, including Exxon Mobil, predict that oil and natural gas prices will recover over the next few years and that demand for those fossil fuels will continue to increase along with growing populations and middle classes in emerging markets.The companies also say that projections are difficult without knowing what future climate-change regulations will entail, or how new technologies might help curtail greenhouse gas emissions.\u201cThis is like being blindfolded, shooting in the dark at a moving target,\u201d said Fadel Gheit, a senior energy analyst at Oppenheimer & Company.The one certainty is that the United States oil industry is already under severe financial pressure.Last year, American petroleum producers wrote down $177 billion in assets, according to a recent report by IHS Energy. Exxon Mobil is in far better financial condition than most other companies in the industry. But this year the company, stretched by debt, lost its top-rung AAA credit rating.\u201cBanks are lending to fossil fuel projects, and ports and railroads are being built to handle coal, and that\u2019s not viable,\u201d Mr. Campanale said. \u201cWe\u2019re talking about a highly disruptive transition, and companies aren\u2019t properly disclosing what that transition will look like.\u201dThe board estimates that there are significant climate risks for most companies it tracks, which represent $27.5 trillion, or 93 percent, of United States stocks as measured by market value.Jean Rogers, chief executive of the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board, says more companies should acknowledge the threat.\u201cClimate risk is the most ubiquitous risk out there,\u201d Ms. Rogers said. \u201cThere\u2019s no excuse anymore. We know what the risks are, industry by industry.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Twitter\u2019s Steep Premium: The Cost of Employee Stock Grants", "Date": "2016-09-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAnd those grants of restricted stock units or options, which would have to be covered to some degree by any buyer, simply add to the purchase price of any deal.Factoring in the payouts would have pushed Twitter well into the red for the year.By way of comparison, the company reported $2.2 billion in revenue for 2015 \u2014 meaning that it paid out 31 cents in stock-based compensation for every dollar of sales it collected.Twitter\u2019s stock-based compensation has been high since the company went public: Such payouts totaled nearly $632 million in 2014 and $600 million in 2013. So notable has been its practice that the company was called out as one of the most aggressive users of equity grants by Mark Mahaney, a veteran stock analyst with RBC Capital Markets.By comparison, LinkedIn paid out 17 percent of its revenue in stock-based grants last year, or about $510 million. Salesforce.com, which along with Google has expressed interest in buying Twitter, paid out 8 percent of sales in such packages, or $593.6 million, over the same time period.Tech companies that do not factor stock-based compensation into their preferred earnings metrics, such as Twitter, argue that such payouts are not cash and do not reflect the underlying health of core businesses.(Not all tech companies urge investors and analysts to ignore stock-based compensation. Facebook and Amazon are among those that factor in those grants as a real expense.)But a new owner would need to compensate its newest employees by either paying cash or doling out yet more equity. Ignoring those grants, particularly ones made to the most desirable employees like top engineers, is simply impossible for a buyer.Those costs have apparently not diminished the interest of some potential buyers. Shares of Twitter were up about 1 percent after Bloomberg reported that Walt Disney was working with a financial adviser to weigh a possible bid.Still, questions remain about whether Twitter is already valued too richly \u2014 its market capitalization as of Monday afternoon was more than $16 billion. The equity compensation costs just make the company even more expensive.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Yale Endowment Earned 3.4% in a Year When Many Peers Lost", "Date": "2016-09-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAt a time when many university endowments have been reporting lackluster or even negative returns, Yale has turned in a winning year.The university said on Friday that its endowment earned 3.4 percent for the fiscal year ended June 30, putting its value at $25.4 billion.The Yale endowment, under the leadership of David Swensen, has long been a top performer. Its latest showing is particularly striking since the average among endowments that have reported so far is a loss of 2.7 percent, according to Cambridge Associates, which manages over $9 billion for foundations and endowments.Endowments are crucial for university budgets. In fiscal 2017, Yale\u2019s endowment is expected to contribute $1.2 billion, or about 34 percent of the university\u2019s budget. The endowment has felt increasing pressure as distributions to the operating budget have nearly doubled over the last decade.Under Mr. Swensen, who has led the endowment since 1985, the average annual return over the last 10 years was 8.1 percent, surpassing the average of 5.1 percent for college and university endowments.Mr. Swensen pioneered an investment model that included a broader array of assets than had typically been used at universities, adding categories like private equity and natural resources to the mix rather than investing exclusively in stocks and bonds.Despite current skepticism about hedge fund performance, Yale has maintained its diversified approach. But since the financial collapse in 2008 \u2014 which caused a steep decline in the endowment\u2019s value and made it difficult to meet university budget needs \u2014 it has decided to keep half of its investments in liquid assets.Mr. Swensen has also relied solely on outside managers rather than creating an internal management team at Yale. That model is now widely followed by many schools with large endowments. Harvard has long been the exception, although it recently decided to give a significant portion of its endowment to outside firms.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Concern Over Deutsche Bank\u2019s Health Shakes Markets", "Date": "2016-09-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byStock markets were rattled on Thursday after reports emerged that some clients of Deutsche Bank, the struggling German lender, were reducing their exposure.Its shares in the United States tumbled 6.7 percent for the day, after falling as much as 9 percent, in unusually heavy trading. The afternoon slide helped pull down financial stocks and the broader market.For the year, shares of Deutsche Bank are down 53 percent, battered by worries that it has too little cash relative to its 1.8 trillion euro ($2.02 trillion) balance sheet, which has a larger share of complex, hard-to-sell securities than its peers.But Barry Bausano, who oversees Deutsche Bank\u2019s hedge fund relationships, noted that the firm\u2019s prime brokerage business has about 800 hedge fund clients, a number that fluctuates week to week. Mr. Bausano also pointed out that the environment for hedge funds has been challenging recently, as they struggle with poor performance and redemption pressures.\u201cWe have ebbs and flows in this business every week,\u201d he said.Many Deutsche Bank clients, in fact, say that they have no problems with using the bank to buy and sell liquid securities like stocks.They say they are comfortable using Deutsche Bank for such trades because they are certain the German government would never let it fail.For providing all manner of lending and trading services to hedge funds and other investors, Deutsche Bank is one of the elite practitioners on the street, with large trading hubs in London and New York.In the parlance of traders, the bank is called \u201ca flow monster,\u201d meaning it makes its money by capturing a piece of the trillions of dollars of bonds and stocks that are the lifeblood of today\u2019s global financial system.But this status is only as good as the trust that hedge funds and institutional investors have in the bank to make good on trades and to be a sound steward for assets that are parked there.Making matters worse for Deutsche Bank is that short-term rates tied to the Libor, or the London interbank offered rate \u2014 the benchmark financial institutions use when they borrow money \u2014 have been edging up as a result of concerns over rising interest rates and a dearth of ready cash in the markets.Higher rates and worries about the bank\u2019s financial health can be enough for some clients to take their business elsewhere.\u201cWhy would you keep collateral with Deutsche Bank right now?\u201d said Raoul Pal, an independent research provider who has been an outspoken critic of the bank for several years. \u201cIf you are a hedge fund right now, you start pulling lines and go somewhere else.\u201dBecause of its size, analysts do not expect Deutsche Bank to fail, as Lehman Brothers did in September 2008, and in the process close the door on billions of dollars that investment funds had in the bank.But given the political opposition in Germany to any form of help for banks in distress, especially before important elections next fall, the situation would have to deteriorate significantly to prompt state intervention.Part of what stiffens resistance to a bailout is that Deutsche Bank has, since 2009, tapped markets for 13 billion euros in cash, while paying out 19 billion euros in bonuses, according to data compiled by Autonomous Research.\u201cIt is all about confidence now,\u201d said Julian Brigden, an independent market analyst at Macro Intelligence 2 Partners, an independent research company that caters to hedge funds and is based in Vail, Colo. \u201cIf a client has some derivatives at Deutsche Bank, he starts to think \u2014 will I get paid?

CBOE has long been viewed as an acquisition target, and the deal for Bats, which generates revenue from more competitive products, may make CBOE less attractive to another suitor, said Andrew Bond, an analyst with RBC Capital Markets.Bats is trading about 5 percent below CBOE\u2019s purchase price, indicating that the market sees the possibility of a competing bid for CBOE before the deal closes, he said. The transaction calls for a $110 million breakup fee payable by either side.The companies indicated in a conference call on Monday that Bats had not been for sale and was not running an auction to sell itself. CBOE, however, was looking for a partner that could expand its scope, and in signing a deal with Bats, it is aiming for more diversification into equities, exchange-traded products and foreign exchange.Within five years after closing the deal, CBOE also expects to generate cost savings of about $65 million by using just one trading platform and streamlining expenses, such as technology.The deal requires shareholder approval from both companies and regulatory clearance. Although it is expected to add to CBOE\u2019s adjusted earnings per share the first full year after closing, it also requires that the company take on quite a bit of debt. CBOE received a commitment letter from Bank of America Merrill Lynch to provide $1.65 billion to help finance the deal.After the deal closes \u2014 expected for the first half of next year \u2014 Edward T. Tilly, CBOE\u2019s chief executive, will retain that role for the combined company. Chris Concannon, Bats\u2019s chief executive, will become president and chief operating officer. The combined company will have 14 directors, including 11 of the 14 members from CBOE\u2019s board, and three from Bats\u2019s board.The headquarters will be located in Chicago, with business offices in Kansas City, Kan., where Bats is based, and other areas like New York, London, San Francisco, Singapore and Quito, Ecuador.Bank of America and Broadhaven Capital Partners served as financial advisers to CBOE, while Barclays was the lead adviser to Bats, along with UBS.

{"Headline": "The Bull Is Still Running. So Why Are Investors Tiptoeing?", "Date": "2016-09-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFundamentallyWall Street seems unable to make up its mind about risk-taking.The market declined sharply on Friday, yet all three major domestic stock indexes are still near their highs. Shares of speculative small companies have been outpacing stable blue-chip stocks lately. And volatile emerging-market equities have shot up more than 16 percent so far this year.Many market strategists expect stocks to resume their long move upward but say caution, rather than greed-induced euphoria, is appropriate at this stage of the seven-year-old bull market.\u201cI would not describe this as a \u2018risk on\u2019 type of environment,\u201d said Matt Kadnar, a member of the asset allocation team at the investment management firm GMO. \u201cI would describe it as cautious, and at the margins, slightly hopeful.\u201dTerri Spath, chief investment officer at Sierra Investment Management, agrees. For one thing, she said, \u201cin addition to the risk-on rally in small stocks and emerging markets, there\u2019s also been a rally in \u2018risk off\u2019 assets lately.\u201d Long-term government bonds, for example, have returned double digits since the end of 2015, as have some of the most defensive sectors of the market that aren\u2019t economically sensitive, such as utilities.In fact, the outperformance of small stocks and emerging-market shares could be explained just as much by a desire to be cautious as aggressive.Take small-company stocks.Small-capitalization stocks are known for outperforming the broad market in the early-to-mid stages of an economic expansion \u2014 typically when growth expectations really begin to heat up \u2014 but not in the seventh year of a recovery.Small-company American stocks also have another characteristic, one that explains their popularity right now: \u201cThey are one of the purest ways to invest in the U.S. relative to the rest of the world,\u201d said Lewis J. Altfest, a New York financial planner.Small domestic companies tend to be far less reliant on foreign sales than large multinational corporations. Small stocks \u201care likely to have 80 to 85 percent domestic exposure,\u201d said Christopher S. Beck, chief investment officer for the small-cap and midcap value equity team at Delaware Investments. \u201cMidcap stocks are usually around 65 to 70 percent domestic. And large stocks are right around 50 percent.\u201dWhy is this important?Despite the underwhelming rate of economic growth domestically, the economy is still growing significantly faster in the United States than in other parts of the developed world. Gross domestic product in the United States, for example, is expected to grow 2.4 percent next year, according to I.H.S. Global Insight. By comparison, the economy in the eurozone is projected to advance just 1.2 percent in 2017, while Japan\u2019s G.D.P. is forecast to rise 0.7 percent.So a bet on the United States economy could be interpreted as a way to try to play it safe.Moreover, Mr. Beck said, \u201cWhen we came into this year, people were expecting anywhere from two to four interest rate hikes.\u201d That hasn\u2019t happened so far, and it has worked out well for small-company stocks.One reason is that rising rates in the United States typically prompt demand for the dollar as global investors seek higher yields. A strengthening dollar is often bad for American corporate profits, because it makes goods produced in the United States more expensive for foreign buyers.Mr. Beck said investors may have added to their stake in small stocks \u2014 while reducing their exposure to large multinationals \u2014 as a hedge against a potential rise in the dollar earlier in the year. But when the Fed decided against raising rates even as the economy showed modest signs of improvement, investors felt comfortable leaving that bet in place, he said.The Fed\u2019s decision to hold off on rate increases so far this year also helps explain the jump in emerging market equities.Central banks around the world have been lowering rates this year, \u201cincentivizing investors to seek out risky assets,\u201d said Brian D. Singer, head of the dynamic allocation strategies at the asset manager William Blair. The Fed\u2019s delay in raising rates has helped this cause.But Mr. Singer describes the rally in emerging market equities this year as a \u201creluctant, not euphoric, embrace of risk.\u201dHe noted that one reason emerging market stocks had done so well was that \u201cinvestors have run out of places to go.\u201d In their favor, volatile emerging-market shares have already been beaten up for several years and trade at relatively cheap valuations compared with American or other developed-market foreign equities.The question is, how will these assets react if the Fed begins to lift rates sometime this year?Investors may have gotten a hint on Friday, when the markets sold off after a few comments from Fed officials were interpreted as a sign that rates could rise soon. Small stocks sank 2.8 percent, versus a drop of 2.1 percent for the Dow Jones industrial average.Widespread expectations that the Fed will finally start to move could shift investor psychology, said Jason Brady, chief executive at Thornburg Investment Management.By keeping short-term rates near zero, the Fed has been suppressing overall market volatility while making assets like emerging-market stocks more desirable. If the market is convinced that the Fed might soon raise rates, it could hurt riskier asset classes that have been benefiting from the relative calm in the broad market, Mr. Brady said.\u201cPerhaps things won\u2019t evolve the same way as they did in December through January,\u201d he said. He was referring to the Fed\u2019s 0.25 percentage point increase in the benchmark Fed funds rate last December, which precipitated a 12 percent loss for small stocks from mid-December to late January and a 13 percent drop for emerging-market shares. The markets have since recovered, and investors may have forgotten the pain of those declines.\u201cI suspect,\u201d Mr. Brady said, \u201cthat at the least, we will continue to learn the lesson that the Fed funds rate matters a lot.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Fed Official Says She Favors \u2018Prudence\u2019 in Raising Interest Rates", "Date": "2016-09-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Lael Brainard, a Federal Reserve governor and a leading proponent of the Fed\u2019s efforts to stimulate the economy, said in a speech on Monday that she still favored \u201cprudence\u201d in raising interest rates despite recent signs of economic progress.The remarks reinforce expectations that the Fed will not raise its benchmark interest rate when its policy-making committee meets on Sept. 20 and 21, and investors celebrated accordingly. Stocks rose and interest rates fell, reversing much of the market movement on Friday, when investors worried the Fed might move toward a rate increase.The Fed also faced new pressure from Donald J. Trump, the Republican presidential nominee, who said on Monday on CNBC that the Fed\u2019s chairwoman, Janet L. Yellen, was keeping rates low \u201cbecause she\u2019s obviously political and doing what Obama wants her to do.\u201dMs. Yellen \u201cshould be ashamed of herself,\u201d he added.Mr. Trump\u2019s criticism of Ms. Yellen and the Fed breaks with the general practice of presidents and presidential candidates in recent decades to refrain from criticizing the Fed\u2019s conduct of monetary policy. Hillary Clinton, the Democratic presidential nominee, castigated Mr. Trump last week for similar remarks.\u201cWords have consequences,\u201d Mrs. Clinton told reporters. \u201cWords move markets. Words can be misinterpreted. Words can have effects on people\u2019s 401(k)\u2019s, their pension funds, their stock portfolios.\u201d\u201cHe should not be adding the Fed onto his long list of institutions and individuals that he is maligning,\u201d she added.Fed officials insist they will not consider the political consequences of increasing rates. They may, however, hesitate to act before the November election out of concern for the economic consequences of political turbulence, the same way they hesitated before Britain\u2019s referendum in June on its membership in the European Union.Ms. Brainard said recent economic data raised some questions about the strength of growth, and there was certainly no sign of resurgent inflation. \u201cIn the presence of uncertainty and the absence of accelerating inflationary pressures, it would be unwise for policy to foreclose on the possibility of making further gains in the labor market,\u201d she told the Chicago Council on Global Affairs.She added that the context in which the Fed operates had also changed. A global decline in market interest rates means that the force of the Fed\u2019s stimulus campaign has been reduced even without a rate increase. Moreover, she noted that the weakness of the global economy continued to weigh on the United States, contributing to an environment of persistently low growth and low inflation.Finally, she said that she remained more concerned about moving too quickly than waiting too long. The Fed has few tools to ward off fresh weakness in the economy, while it can easily respond to an inflationary resurgence.\u201cThis asymmetry in risk management in today\u2019s new normal counsels prudence in the removal of policy accommodation,\u201d Ms. Brainard said. \u201cI believe that this approach has served us well.\u201dDaniel Tarullo, another Fed governor, said in a CNBC interview on Friday that he too favored patience. Mr. Tarullo described himself as a member of the \u201c\u2018show-me\u2019 camp\u201d that wants to see evidence of stronger inflation before raising rates. So far, he said, there is not enough. \u201cFrom my personal perspective, I think we have an opportunity to continue to get employment gains,\u201d Mr. Tarullo said.Other officials argue that inflation always follows stronger growth; if the Fed waits for the inevitable increase, they warn, the Fed may need to raise rates more sharply, causing a recession.Mr. Tarullo said in the interview, however, that officials who took this view should still have hesitations about the outlook for growth. He described the recent economic data as a mixed bag.Esther George, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City \u2014 and, like Mr. Rosengren, one of the 10 Fed officials with a policy vote this year \u2014 has expressed concern that low rates are encouraging excessive speculation, birthing future financial crises.Fed officials still could coalesce around a late-year rate increase, as they did last year. After September, the Fed has two more meetings on the calendar, in November and December.Asked what it would take to win her vote, Ms. Brainard said she would like to see more inflation. She also noted recent weakness in some economic measures like corporate profits and investment.\u201cIt would be important, I think, to see some of those spending indicators starting to really move in a more positive direction going into the third and fourth quarter,\u201d Ms. Brainard said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Cost of Keeping Companies in the United States", "Date": "2016-09-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorsWe need to put aside the politicized allegations that inversions are a way for corporations to cheat the rest of America. This sort of language confuses the issue and obscures a central fact: All of these corporations are owned by shareholders who should, in theory, reap the benefits of a lower corporate tax bill.Unfortunately, in our zeal to keep companies in the United States, we have created policies where inversions benefit some shareholders at the expense of others. Perversely, the inversion rules are more likely to punish American investors and long-term investors to the benefit of senior executives, recent investors and tax-exempt investors, including those overseas.Overall, taxable shareholders lost 1 percent to 3 percent on the value of their shares. This may sound small, but it amounts to around $6 billion in extra taxes for the shareholders. So while inversions reduce the corporate taxes collected by the Treasury, the extra taxes paid by shareholders offset that loss by about 40 percent.Fifteen percent to 20 percent of shareholders in the deals we studied were made worse off from inversion. The anti-inversions tax rules are especially bad for long-term investors who have higher capital gains because they have seen their shares appreciate significantly over the years. For example, investors who bought Pfizer five years ago have had their shares appreciate by 80 percent; investors who bought 25 years ago have seen their shares grow by six times (adjusted for splits).For older Americans who plan to bequeath shares to spouses or heirs, an inversion is especially costly. These individuals end up paying capital gains taxes upon inversion that they would otherwise avoid through a bequest.(The tax cost of an inversion also explains why companies with founders who hold large ownership stakes, like Facebook, would never consider inverting: such a maneuver would require Mark Zuckerberg to cut a $14 billion check to the government to cover the capital gains tax on his shares.)But tax-exempt investors enjoy a nice return from inversion of 4 percent to 7 percent. These include investors in millions of retirement accounts, pensions and endowments across the country, who do not pay taxes when an inversion occurs. Even tax-deferred investors, such as most 401(k) and traditional I.R.A. accounts, are exempt from capital gains taxes.Foreign shareholders also benefit, as the I.R.S.\u2019s special tax rules don\u2019t apply in other countries.There\u2019s a third group that benefits: corporate executives. We found that the chief executive\u2019s wealth increases 3 percent to 4 percent, despite the personal tax consequences of inversion. This is in part because stock options, unlike shares, are not subject to capital gains tax at inversion. In 2004 the government added a tax on pay for executives of inverting companies but the companies began reimbursing their executives for this expense, passing the cost along to shareholders.There are several steps the United States can take to discourage inversions. A lower corporate tax rate and the removal of taxes on foreign earnings would certainly reduce the incentives for companies to leave. If we coupled a lower corporate rate with a reduction in the deductions companies now have, we could maintain the current level of tax revenue while at the same time simplifying the tax code and remaining competitive.First, though, we should abandon the policies that have punished long-term and older taxable American shareholders, while other investors \u2014 foreign, tax-exempt and corporate insiders \u2014 benefit. And the rules have failed in their primary mission of discouraging corporate inversions: Companies worth over half a trillion dollars announced their intention to invert since 2014. In short, we have the worst of policy effects: unintended consequences and no intended ones.Brent Glover is an assistant professor of finance at Carnegie Mellon University.

{"Headline": "Volkswagen Shareholders Seek $9.2 Billion Over Diesel Scandal", "Date": "2016-09-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA German court has been flooded with new lawsuits against Volkswagen from investors who say they lost billions as the value of the carmaker\u2019s shares plunged after its diesel emissions scandal.The surge could add to the company\u2019s financial woes as it deals with the fallout from the revelation a year ago that it had cheated on emission tests.The volume of the new claims, the court said, was equivalent to about half the number of cases it processes in an average year. The suits were filed in Germany because that is where the primary listing is for Volkswagen\u2019s stock.Volkswagen admitted that 11 million of its vehicles were equipped with software that was used to cheat on emissions tests. This is how the technology works and what it now means for vehicle owners.The development, which came after the court decided in August to allow investors to submit collective claims against Volkswagen, could foreshadow legal bottlenecks. But because German law contains no provision for class-action litigation, a common tactic in the United States, the court will use a system similar to a \u201cbellwether trial.\u201dRather than rule on each suit individually, the court plans select one plaintiff as a model out of the 1,400 suits filed. It expects to do so by the end of the year and to apply its eventual judgment to all the other cases.The rush of filings this week was intended to ensure that Volkswagen could not challenge the claimants\u2019 right to sue by citing a one-year statute of limitations for material claims under German securities law, said Marc Schiefer, a German lawyer representing institutional and individual shareholders whose claims against the carmaker exceed \u20ac5 billion.But he noted that German law was changed last year to allow claimants to sue for three years after the facts of a case become known. That means additional investor suits could be filed against Volkswagen in Germany until 2018.Among the shareholders suing Volkswagen in Braunschweig are hundreds of individuals, as well as private and public pension funds in Germany and the United States.Volkswagen car owners in Europe are also seeking payouts. But unlike the solution proposed to shareholders, the main recourse available to consumers has been to band together with a handful of lawyers and online collection agencies to obtain compensation.Such efforts, which are not related to the investor lawsuits, have so far only managed to recruit a small fraction of the 8.5 million owners in Europe of tainted Volkswagen diesel vehicles.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Deutsche Bank Troubles Raise Fear of Global Shock", "Date": "2016-09-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLONDON \u2014 Germany\u2019s largest bank appears in danger, sending stock markets worldwide on a wild ride. Yet the biggest source of worry is less about its finances than a vast tangle of unknowns \u2014 not least, whether Europe can muster the will to mount a rescue in the event of an emergency.In short, fears that Europe lacks the cohesion to avoid a financial crisis may be enhancing the threat of one.The immediate source of alarm is the health of Deutsche Bank, whose vast and sprawling operations are entangled with the fates of investment houses from Tokyo to London to New York.Deutsche is staring at a multibillion-dollar fine from the Justice Department for its enthusiastic participation in Wall Street\u2019s festival of toxic mortgage products in the years leading up to financial crisis of 2008. Given Deutsche\u2019s myriad other troubles \u2014 a role in the manipulation of a financial benchmark, claims of trades that violated Russian sanctions and a generalized sense of confusion about its mission \u2014 the American pursuit of a stiff penalty comes at an inopportune time.It heightens the sense that Deutsche \u2014 whose shares have lost more than half their value this year \u2014 needs to secure additional investment, lest it leave itself vulnerable to some new crisis.The biggest worries center on what happens if Deutsche falls apart to the point that it threatens the globe with a financial shock \u2014 and whether new rules and buffers put in place since the last crisis will keep the pain from spreading.Regulations that took effect this year in the European Union standardize how member countries are supposed to handle the potential implosion of a large financial institution. Banks, too, have put aside more money to deal with potential losses.Deutsche could pose the first test of the new arrangement. Recent challenges have underscored concerns about the limits of solidarity in Europe.From the chaos of the sovereign debt crisis to the acrimony over an influx of refugees, European authorities have proved something less than an exemplar of coordinated government action. The European Union has become a focus of populist anger, further constraining options. And Germany has opposed bailouts for lenders in other lands, making a Deutsche rescue politically radioactive.All of which adds to worries that Deutsche amounts to a fire burning, one that might yet become an inferno, while the fire department is consumed with existential arguments over its purpose. If the alarm sounds, no one can be sure what, if anything, will happen.In the worst case \u2014 now highly unlikely \u2014 the bank could collapse, inciting a scramble to pull money from markets around the globe. Institutions that trade with Deutsche would feel an urge to collect their cash immediately. Given the scale of the bank\u2019s balance sheet \u2014 1.8 trillion euros, or more than $2 trillion \u2014 that inclination is likely to spread to every crevice of finance. Economies would grind to a halt. Jobs and fortunes would disappear.Despite murmurings in pundit quarters that this sort of situation may be unfolding, provoking comparisons with the catastrophic bankruptcy of the American investment banking giant Lehman Brothers eight years ago, most economists dismiss such talk as overwrought and overblown.Deutsche is sitting on cash reserves worth \u20ac240 billion, or about $269 billion. It has sold bonds that can be converted to equity should the need arise. The Justice Department\u2019s proposed fine of $14 billion is viewed as the opening of a negotiation that could cost Deutsche a fraction of that amount \u2014 thinking that sent the stock surging on Friday.Not least, Deutsche Bank is a classic example of the species of financial animal known as Too Big To Fail.\u201cWe saw what happened with Lehman,\u201d said Nicola Borri, a finance professor at LUISS, a university in Rome. \u201cIt\u2019s impossible that the authorities would let something like that happen again. It has ties with all the banks in the world. It is highly leveraged. A disorderly default would be very, very difficult for the entire financial system.\u201dOn both sides of the Atlantic, the financial crisis prompted the construction of new regulatory authorities and requirements that banks set aside more funds in reserve against troubles.\u201cThe system is much more robust and resilient because of the buffers,\u201d said Nicolas V\u00e9ron, a senior fellow at Bruegel, a research institution in Brussels. \u201cThere are pockets of fragility, but broadly speaking, the system is better prepared.\u201dBut the markets do not appear to fully buy that the defenses are secure.Deutsche is heavily involved in the trading of derivatives, the exotic financial instruments that were at the center of the 2008 crisis. Derivatives can be so mind-bendingly complex that no one fully grasps who owes what to whom until someone big enough to rattle markets suddenly cannot pay.Then, fear takes over, and investors dump holdings indiscriminately. This lowers the value of even solid assets on bank balance sheets, giving rise to further cause for concern.Because Deutsche has been dominated by its investment banking operations \u2014 meaning it is not sitting on a large pile of plain deposits as a cushion \u2014 it is especially vulnerable to such volatility.Fear, in other words, is not just a symptom of trouble but also a cause.A collapse may be exceedingly unlikely. Yet the beginning would probably feel something like recent days.Friday morning, Deutsche\u2019s chief executive officer, John Cryan, released a letter to his staff offering assurances that the bank boasted \u201cstrong fundamentals.\u201d The stock recovered slightly on those comments, but the sense remained that the need for reassurance attested to concerns.The biggest form of insurance against panic is confidence that larger players \u2014 in this case, European authorities \u2014 stand at the ready to mount a rescue, should one be required.But confidence is not something Europe has proved terribly skilled at instilling. Its abilities to marshal a bailout are dubious. New rules introduced to discourage reckless investments by large financial institutions bar taxpayer-financed bailouts.Germany has been adamant that these strictures be applied, rebuffing a recent attempt by the Italian prime minister, Matteo Renzi, to secure an exemption allowing him to inject taxpayer money into the Italian banking system. The optics of Germany seeking a way around the rules for its largest lender would be especially problematic.More broadly, Germany has been the most fervent voice that reckless economic pursuits should be punished, no matter the human toll.As Athens has negotiated with European authorities and the International Monetary Fund for a series of bailouts, Germany has demanded deep cuts to Greek public spending, sharply cutting pension payments to retirees. The Greek government used much of the bailout money to pay back debts to German banks.Against this backdrop, a German bailout of its largest bank would reinvigorate accusations that it uses the European Union as a cover to pursue its own national interests.This dynamic has force in the markets, presenting another factor that investors must absorb as the evaluate they risks of holding Deutsche\u2019s debts and shares.\u201cThe fact that we don\u2019t know the reaction of the authorities is a factor of uncertainty,\u201d said Mr. Veron of Bruegel.Here is a feedback loop that amplifies the risks. The likelihood that Deutsche needs a rescue appears small, yet the possibility that a rescue could be forged seems close to nil. That tightens the pressure on Deutsche.And yet Deutsche\u2019s stature may provide the decisive form of insurance. In event of emergency, the authorities might have to act, whatever the politics.\u201cDeutsche Bank is so big and so systemically important that the rules will be bent,\u201d Mr. Borri said. \u201cIf I were an investor, I would assume that the rules would be bent.\u201dFollow Peter S.

Stocks may lose 10 to 12 percent of their value if he wins the November election, and there may be a broader economic downturn.These conclusions arise from close analysis of financial markets during Monday\u2019s presidential debate, which provides a fascinating case study of the complex interconnections between American politics and economics. The market\u2019s judgment stands in sharp opposition to Donald J. Trump\u2019s claims that his presidency would be good for business.Decoding these market signals is no easy task because it is difficult to disentangle correlation from causation. Ideally we would observe stock prices in parallel universes with identical economic conditions, with a single exception: In one, Mr. Trump has a good shot at becoming president, while in the other, his chances are low.During the debate, the overnight futures markets rallied, raising the value of broad stock market gauges like the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index by two-thirds to three-quarters of a percentage point. This was a consequential move, and because it was driven by the reduced chance of a Trump presidency, it reveals that the market believes that stocks would be worth more if he were to lose the election. Four pieces of evidence support this interpretation.First, the rally played out in virtual lock step with Mr. Trump\u2019s debate performance. When Mrs. Clinton pummeled him over his tax returns, stocks rose. And this pattern of stocks rising in response to Mr. Trump\u2019s miscues continued through the evening.Second, the rally occurred between 9 and 11 p.m. on a Monday, typically a fairly tranquil time and, in this case, a stretch in which there was no other important economic or financial news. This suggests that the rally was not driven by other factors. Lisa Brown, principal at Gorgon Capital Research, said, \u201cThe only thing going on that would move markets in this time frame would be the debate.\u201dThird, the rise in stock prices was unusually large for that particular time period \u2014 larger than during the same window on all but one of the 200 previous Mondays. It appears to be a statistically significant move, not one caused by mere chance.All told, it appears that Mr. Trump\u2019s apparently declining political fortunes drove stocks higher. This implies that the market expects better times if Mrs. Clinton becomes president. If Mr. Trump stages a comeback in the next debates, expect stocks to fall sharply.How much better would the market perform under a President Clinton than a President Trump?Consider the rise in stock futures. At first blush, an increase of less than 1 percent doesn\u2019t sound like much. But it points to something much bigger. After all, if a relatively small decline in the likelihood of a Trump presidency led to a modest stock rally, then a larger decline in Mr. Trump\u2019s electoral fortunes would most likely lead to a larger market reaction. A surprise win for Mr. Trump would probably set off a substantial market correction.Putting the pieces together (multiplying that 16 by the percentage point rise in the S.&P. 500 value), this suggests that the market expects stock prices to be 10 to 12 percent lower if Mr. Trump wins than they will be if he loses.This is a big difference.What does it all mean? When economists conduct \u201cevent studies\u201d like this, they typically do so in the hope that movements in stock prices reflect the informed bets of traders trying to assess the future profitability of the businesses they\u2019re buying or selling. If that\u2019s right, then Wall Street is telling us that if Mr. Trump is elected, it expects the profitability of America\u2019s largest businesses to be about 10 to 12 percent lower on average in the future.This is all the more remarkable because it occurs despite Mr. Trump\u2019s having promised an enormous profit-raising corporate tax cut. Either the markets don\u2019t believe he\u2019ll deliver on these tax cuts, or they believe that the rest of his economic program will do enough harm to more than offset the benefits of lower taxes.Assessing what this means for the broader economy requires a bit of guesswork. It all depends on the extent to which Wall Street\u2019s worries are also worries for Main Street.If the Trump stock discount reflects expectations of lower earnings and if the rest of the economy performs like publicly traded companies, the math suggests that overall national income would fall substantially, perhaps by as much as 10 to 12 percent over coming decades. If only big publicly traded companies were to suffer, the decline would be less; if the rest of the economy were more vulnerable, there would be a greater decline.Some of the market\u2019s aversion to Mr. Trump probably reflects the assessment that the world would simply be riskier under him. Traders are so unsure of what the future would hold that they\u2019re reluctant to invest in stocks without a huge discount.Typically, we found that no candidate moved the market by more than a couple of percentage points. Moreover, it was somewhat more common for the stock market to rise slightly on the election of a Republican than of a Democrat.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "At BlackRock, a Wall Street Rock Star\u2019s $5 Trillion Comeback", "Date": "2016-09-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLOS ANGELES \u2014 Laurence D. Fink, the leader and founder of BlackRock, the world\u2019s largest asset manager, had come home.A Bruin to the bone \u2014 class of 1974 \u2014 he had a story to tell the 5,000 giddy graduates packed into the cavernous basketball arena at the University of California, Los Angeles. Once upon a time he was a rock star on Wall Street. He had big hair and flashed turquoise jewelry, and making money had never seemed so easy.Until it wasn\u2019t.\u201cI screwed up,\u201d Mr. Fink declared, recalling the $100 million he blew thanks to failed mortgage trades in 1986. \u201cAnd it was bad.\u201dFor the graduating millennials, the morality tale resonated not least because it came from a U.C.L.A. grad who had ascended, fallen from and again scaled Wall Street\u2019s treacherous peaks. But it was his description of why he stumbled that truly explained his evolution from down-on-his-luck bond trader to master of a firm that has its eye on a sum about equal to the $16 trillion United States economy.\u201cI had become complacent \u2014 too sure of what I thought I knew,\u201d Mr. Fink said. \u201cI believed I had figured out the market. But I was wrong because while I wasn\u2019t watching, the world had changed.\u201dOver the last decade, no other financial firm has gone further in challenging the classic Wall Street moneymaking model for investment banks and traditional mutual fund companies: Hire \u2014 and handsomely pay \u2014 hotshots to make big bets with other people\u2019s money.The future of finance, Mr. Fink has argued, lies with rules-based, data-driven investment styles such as exchange-traded funds, which track a variety of stock and bond indexes or adhere to a set of financial rules. The idea is that such an approach eliminates at least some of the potential for human error, while lowering costs.It is this notion of using technology to root out investment risks that lies at the heart of BlackRock\u2019s investing strategy. Putting this into practice is the firm\u2019s risk-mitigation platform, Aladdin, which enjoys a ubiquity within the firm \u2014 it tracks everything from bond trades to head count \u2014 that evokes HAL 9000, the sentient computer in the movie \u201c2001: A Space Odyssey.\u201d Some employees even use Aladdin as a verb, as in, \u201cHas the new portfolio manager been Aladdinized yet?\u201dBut in today\u2019s world of violent price swings and cash-starved markets, those with near infinite buying power \u2014 central banks, sovereign wealth funds and the largest money manager in the land \u2014 have become the new arbiters of flow. \u201cWe have never seen a paradigm shift like this,\u201d said Anthony J. Perrotta Jr., an analyst with the Tabb Group, which analyzes the structure of financial markets. \u201cIt is not about the flow of securities anymore, it is about the flow of information and indications of interest.\u201dBlackRock\u2019s strategy was forged, and ultimately empowered, by two market calamities over the last three decades. The first, of course, was Mr. Fink\u2019s experience at First Boston in 1986, when he bet big on mortgages without assessing how the securities would trade in a period of extreme stress.But BlackRock became the behemoth it is today only after the events of 2008. That is when a souped-up, toxic variety of the securitized mortgages that Mr. Fink helped design years earlier at First Boston imploded \u2014 setting off a chain of bank failures and the deepest global economic downturn since the Great Depression. Chastened investment banks were forced to exit these businesses under pressure from regulators.And in stepped BlackRock. Its assets under management swelled as investors \u2014 starved for higher returns \u2014 piled into the company\u2019s E.T.F.s, which tracked the highflying markets.\u201cThe balance of power is now with firms like BlackRock because they have the \u2018bid,\u2019\u201d said Mr. Perrotta of Tabb, using Wall Street argot to describe the buying power of large asset managers.The power shift was on display this spring, when Mr. Fink took the stage at an investor conference alongside John Cryan, recently charged with reviving the sagging fortunes of Deutsche Bank, one of the global investment firms that was minting money before the markets collapsed in 2008. While the event was billed as a cozy exchange of ideas between two Wall Street heavy-hitters, it played out instead as a series of slightly peevish questions posed by Mr. Cryan to Mr. Fink.\u201cYou are effectively becoming the supplier of liquidity of last resort \u2014 beyond the central banks,\u201d Mr. Cryan said to Mr. Fink.The assertion bordered on the impudent \u2014 suggesting that BlackRock and its $5 trillion stash of assets had become the new guarantor of stability because of its ability to buy and sell stocks and bonds in times of duress. Investment banks, which previously aspired to this duty, have been complaining for years that the financial system has become riskier because BlackRock and similar firms cannot perform such a market-making function.But to say as much to Mr. Fink directly \u2014 and in a room full of investors, no less \u2014 was highly unusual. Mr. Fink was clearly irritated by the query. \u201cWell that is not our role \u2014 we won\u2019t play that role,\u201d he replied stiffly.It was not the most convincing of replies.Over the last 10 years, Mr. Fink has transformed BlackRock from a bond shop catering to pension funds and insurance companies into an asset-gathering machine that uses advanced technology to reimagine how investors buy, sell and assess the risks of a wide variety of securities. Via its $1 trillion-plus in exchange-traded funds, BlackRock has been instrumental in creating newly liquid markets in high-yield and corporate bonds \u2014 a direct attack on the business model of banks like Deutsche Bank.And through its big data-mining risk platform, Aladdin, or Asset Liability and Debt and Derivatives Investment Network, BlackRock says it has developed the market\u2019s most highly evolved framework for stress-testing how securities will respond to certain situations \u2014 such as a sudden rise in interest rates or what happens in the event of a political surprise, like Donald J. Trump being elected president.Staffed by 2,300 of BlackRock\u2019s 13,000 employees, Aladdin promises to help firms trade, analyze and keep a compliant eye on the assets they manage. In an era of severe regulatory scrutiny, the service has become quite popular. Seventy-five firms \u2014 including Deutsche Bank\u2019s asset management unit and Freddie Mac \u2014 managing a total of $10 trillion, now use it.Mr. Fink maintains a grueling schedule, mixing regular bicoastal trips in the United States with frequent client jaunts to China and the Middle East. \u201cThis job requires an enormous commitment,\u201d he said. \u201cThe pace is relentless. There will be a day when I wake up one day and say I just can\u2019t do it anymore.\u201dThat day remains well in the future, he says. Still, with BlackRock\u2019s growth in size and sway, the issue of who, if anyone, from within the firm is qualified to succeed Mr. Fink has become an existential question for the company\u2019s board of directors.The problem is typical when replacing a founder: Mr. Fink has increased assets to $5 trillion from zero, and the imprint of his domineering personality has become so profound that virtually anyone will suffer to some degree in comparison, considering his track record.After all, in 1983, he structured one of the first collateral mortgage obligations, and along with Lewis Ranieri at Salomon Brothers made it possible for large investors to enter the market for mortgages. A quarter of a century later, Mr. Fink recognized that the time was right for E.T.F.s and \u2014 in the depths of the financial crisis \u2014 bought Barclays\u2019s iShares business, a deal analysts consider one of the shrewdest in recent Wall Street memory.And beyond a soaring stock price, there are few better ways for a financial chief to command the respect of his peers than to slip through the grasp of regulators. So when Mr. Fink and his high-powered lobbyists in Washington were able to make the case, after the 2008 financial crisis, that major fund companies like BlackRock posed no risks to the markets because of their size, it only added to his aura.That, more or less, is what Mr. Fink told Dexter Senft, his computer expert at First Boston in 1982. \u201cWe are bringing the computer onto the trading floor, Dexter,\u201d Mr. Fink recalls saying at the time. \u201cIf we can do this, it will change our business forever.\u201dNot only would Mr. Fink and his bond wizards be able to sell billions of dollars of new securities, giving birth to today\u2019s market for asset backed mortgages, they could also analyze how these securities would trade in certain situations.The immense losses at First Boston in 1986 taught a lesson that eventually shaped BlackRock. Mr. Fink realized that his clients on the \u201cbuy side\u201d (the fund managers, insurance companies and pension funds shopping for investments) had become dependent on the ability of the \u201csell side\u201d (the Wall Street investment banks) to analyze mortgages. That was because few buy-side clients had invested in computers and technology to the level First Boston had.Most money management firms highlight their investment returns first, and risk controls second. BlackRock has taken a reverse approach: It believes that risk analysis, such as gauging how a security will trade if interest rates go up or down, improves investment results.That is where Aladdin comes in. Aladdin is a network of code, trades, chat, algorithms and predictive models that on any given day can highlight vulnerabilities and opportunities connected to the $15 trillion the firm tracks \u2014 $10 trillion of which belongs to outside firms that pay BlackRock a fee to have access to the platform.Aladdin fills the monitors of most BlackRock employees. One portfolio manager even went so far as to hang a nearly cinema-size screen on his office wall in order to get the full Aladdin experience. And at the company\u2019s investor day in June, Mr. Fink and other top executives mentioned Aladdin 82 times \u2014 more than any other business line \u2014 even though the platform represents just 5 percent of the $11.3 billion in revenues BlackRock took in last year.From Mr. Fink\u2019s early days on Wall Street, his ambition has been stoked by a sense that he has not been receiving the proper credit for his achievements. At First Boston, even though he was among the earliest to popularize trading in mortgage securities, his peers including Mr. Ranieri and others drew more public attention as innovators and moneymakers.As a successful, albeit mostly anonymous, bond manager at BlackRock in the 1990s and 2000s, he saw acclaim, pay and influence go to the chief executives of Goldman Sachs, Merrill Lynch and Morgan Stanley. That began changing only in 2009, when he bought Barclays\u2019s E.T.F. business. Last year he was among a small circle of Wall Street executives to attend the state dinner at the White House for the Chinese president, Xi Jinping.A part of Mr. Fink \u2014 a fervent Democrat today \u2014 believes he would make a pretty good Treasury secretary, say people who have discussed politics with him. Although he recently persuaded Cheryl Mills, one of Hillary Clinton\u2019s closest advisers, to join the board of BlackRock, the view is fairly strongly held that if Mrs. Clinton becomes president, there is little chance that she will tap a Wall Street insider for the Treasury job.With BlackRock\u2019s stock having more than doubled since 2011, far outpacing the likes of Goldman and JPMorgan and trading close to its record high, it seems that the market has come around to Mr. Fink\u2019s financial worldview: that a low cost, systematic style of investing will, over time, grow faster than the costlier \u201cactive investing\u201d model in which individuals, not algorithms, make stock, bond and asset allocation decisions.And the numbers in that regard are arresting. Through July, E.T.F.s and traditional index funds made up 30 percent of total mutual fund assets, according to the Investment Company Institute, a ratio that has doubled in just under 10 years.Of course, with close to $1.5 trillion in actively managed funds, Mr. Fink is not ready to write off a segment of the industry that even after years of outflows clocks in at $11 trillion. And he underlines the importance of being able to offer the best of both active and passive investing styles to BlackRock clients.But inside the firm and out, there is little doubt that he is betting the ranch on E.T.F.s and similarly themed investments choices. These include so-called factor strategies, in which a bet is made on a certain investment outcome \u2014 like value stocks outpacing growth stocks, or a basket of low-volatility equities beating the broader indexes.In San Francisco, a team of equity investors deploys data analysis to study the language that a chief executive uses during an earnings call. Does he seem unusually bearish this quarter, compared with last? If so, maybe the stock is a sell.\u201cWe have more information than anyone,\u201d Mr. Fink said.Some analysts, in fact, argue that BlackRock should be valued as a technology company, as opposed to an asset manager.Mark Wiedman, 45, a BlackRock executive who is on the short list to succeed Mr. Fink, believes that bond E.T.F.s, in particular, are creating a liquid market where a new generation of bond investors can freely buy and sell.For years, he and Mr. Fink have been pitching insurance companies and pension funds to stop buying individual bonds (from the likes of Deutsche Bank) and instead choose a BlackRock bond E.T.F. Now it\u2019s happening.\u201cI think of E.T.F.s as technology,\u201d Mr. Wiedman said, as he leaned back in a swivel chair in his office. \u201cIt is a product that bundles up a bunch of securities, puts them on a screen and makes them easier to trade.\u201dLike many top executives here, Mr. Wiedman can get a bit manic when discussing the subject: Midway through an interview, he felt the need to somewhat violently undo his tie and cast it aside.Regulators are less enthusiastic. Global watchdogs like the Bank for International Settlements and the International Monetary Fund have described these bountiful flows into and out of BlackRock bond E.T.F.s as a liquidity illusion. Which means, according to Ken Monaghan, an investor in high-yielding corporate bonds, that easy-to-trade E.T.F.s have lured \u201ctourist\u201d investors \u2014 people seduced by the rich yields, but who may not be able to stomach a sustained market reversal.And if they all leave at once, watch out.\u201cE.T.F.s do not create liquidity,\u201d said Mr. Monaghan, of the global fund manager Amundi Smith Breeden. \u201cThese new investors are not permanent.\u201dAside from Mr. Wiedman of BlackRock, the short list to succeed Mr. Fink includes Robert S. Kapito, 59, a founding partner and current president of the firm who is seen as the top choice if a handover occurs sooner rather than later. Other candidates are Rob Goldstein, the 42-year-old chief operating officer and driving force behind Aladdin\u2019s growth; Mark McCombe, 50, a former HSBC executive who looks after the firm\u2019s big clients; Rich Kushel, 50, who oversees multi-asset investment strategies for clients; and Gary Shedlin, 52, the chief financial officer. There is also Mark Wiseman, a new hire who joined the firm this month to oversee its equity business.It is a long list, and purposely so. For Mr. Fink, recommending a successor to his board is probably the weightiest decision he will make as BlackRock chief. He has taken pains to not tip his hand. \u201cI want to make sure that the day after I leave, the firm is better off without me,\u201d he said.This spring, Mr. Fink called together more than 100 of the firm\u2019s most senior executives for two days of meetings in Barcelona, Spain. BlackRock was approaching its 30th anniversary and Mr. Fink was in a nostalgic mood. Yet there was an edge to his remarks.Yes, BlackRock was thriving because of its focus on low-risk, low-cost funds and the all-seeing wonders of Aladdin. But now was not the time to coast.Nor was this a time to sit fat and happy on a big pile of assets and let the fees roll in, an indirect slap at actively managed giants such as Franklin Templeton and Pimco, where assets under management have recently been declining.Never before, he said, had the fund management industry been so competitive and changing. \u201cIf you think you know everything about our business, you are kidding yourself,\u201d he said. \u201cThe biggest question we have to answer is: \u2018Are we developing the right leaders?\u2019\u201dAnd then, looking out over the striving BlackRock executives gathered before him, he put it to them directly. \u201cAre you,\u201d he asked, \u201cprepared to be one of those leaders?\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Big Deals Like Bayer\u2019s Often Fail to Deliver High Performance", "Date": "2016-09-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFair GamePlenty of people have reason to celebrate the $56 billion bid by Bayer AG, the German pharmaceuticals giant, for Monsanto, the United States agribusiness company.History suggests, however, that one group should be wary of the transaction: Bayer\u2019s stockholders. Their company, which is paying cash for Monsanto but also taking on $10 billion in debt, could very well underperform its peers in the coming years.\u201cDespite the often-heard claim of M&A synergies,\u201d the report said, \u201cacquirers lag industry peers on a variety of fundamental metrics for an extended period following an acquisition. Profit margins, earnings growth and return on capital all decline relative to peers, while interest expense rises, as debt soars, and other \u2018special charges\u2019 increase.\u201dThis view was not among the talking points from the Bayer executives who contended \u2014 as their counterparts in previous deals also did \u2014 that their shareholders would benefit mightily from the transaction. In announcing the Monsanto deal, they said it was expected to increase the combined companies\u2019 earnings in the first year after closing. The executives also said they foresaw double-digit profit growth at the combined company in the third full year, driven in part by purported synergies of $1.5 billion over that period.Time will tell, of course, whether these expectations become a reality. But the S&P Global analysis of deals going back 15 years indicates otherwise.In their study, the analysts included United States companies in the Russell 3000 stock index that had done at least one deal from 2001 to 2013. To eliminate inconsequential acquisitions, the researchers included only those transactions that were at least 5 percent of the acquiring company\u2019s market capitalization or enterprise value.A total of 9,000 transactions made the cut. Returns on the acquirers\u2019 stocks were calculated through April 2016 and were compared with the performance of the Russell 3000 index over the period. The researchers also studied the performance of acquirers before and after they had made a purchase.\u201cIn general M&A deals underperform either their index or their peers over an extended period,\u201d Mr. Tortoriello, a quantitative analyst at S&P Global, said in an interview. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean there aren\u2019t some deals that do very, very well, but over all they underperform.\u201dHow much? From 2001 to last April, the study found, a $1,000 investment in the Russell 3000 index would have grown to $2,956. The same investment in an index of Russell 3000 companies that made acquisitions of the type examined by the researchers would have turned into a paltry $1,671.Although the study reported on a three-year period following an acquisition, Mr. Tortoriello said over five years the outcomes were the same.Timing, he speculated, is one reason for the poor performance. \u201cMergers and acquisitions really heat up at the top of the market when business prospects going forward aren\u2019t as good,\u201d he said. \u201cThen it cools down when the market falls, just when you\u2019d want to be buying stocks and companies.\u201dIndeed, as the broad market indexes have pushed higher in recent years, mergers have increased. Last year was a record for buyouts, with $2.2 trillion worth occurring in the United States. This year is doing nearly as well: As of July 31, over $800 billion in deals had been struck, and that was before the Bayer-Monsanto acquisition.Fueling many of these deals are rock-bottom interest rates and softening corporate earnings. Many acquirers pick up companies to help keep their profits aloft.But precious few executives seeking to juice their earnings via acquisitions will get what they wished for. The average acquisition, the S&P Global study concluded, \u201ctends to be dilutive to earnings growth over an extended period.\u201dOther performance metrics \u2014 returns on both equity and invested capital \u2014 also declined as acquirers compared with their industry peers. This is partly a result of increased interest expense and other charges. And when looking at return on invested capital, many postmerger companies struggled under the weight of their increased debt loads.Fully aware that some acquisitions generate better returns than others, the S&P Global analysts set out to determine the characteristics of truly awful deals.\u201cIt\u2019s easier to handicap bad acquisitions because there are so many of them,\u201d Mr. Tortoriello said. \u201cWe found firms that have the highest levels of growth in assets and share issuance prior to an acquisition tend to underperform afterward. That indicates these companies are growing too fast; the acquisition strategy is part of their overextended growth pathway.\u201dAnother aspect of failing deals: Those using stock as buyout currency underperform those deploying cash, as Bayer is doing with Monsanto. And the larger the stock acquisition, the more likely it is to underperform significantly, the study found. Acquirers using the highest percentage of stock underperform industry peers by 3.3 percent one year after the deal is done and by 8.1 percent after three years.\u201cCompanies tend to make stock acquisitions when their shares are high and when business conditions are doing very well,\u201d Mr. Tortoriello said. \u201cSo that\u2019s probably closer to an inflection point in the market and economy and isn\u2019t good for the prosperity of the acquisition.\u201dFinally, the study found that acquirers with the highest one-year spending on buyouts underperformed their peers by 2 percent in the first year after closing and by 9.3 percent after three years. This reinforced the analysts\u2019 conclusion that companies with heavy deal making in their blood should either be avoided by investors or seen as candidates for short sales or negative bets.Assuming that Bayer\u2019s purchase of Monsanto goes through, it won\u2019t be clear for a while whether its management promises will come to pass. A Bayer spokesman, Christopher Loder, declined to comment further on the merger or on the study\u2019s findings. But Bayer\u2019s use of cash over stock suggests a better chance of success; so does the fact that the company has not been a serial big-ticket deal maker in recent years.Still, when it comes to buyouts, the track record of most companies is poor. Shareholders of acquisitive companies \u2014 including Bayer\u2019s \u2014 should be aware of all the risks executives don\u2019t like to talk about.Twitter: @gmorgensonAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "No Sailors Needed: Robot Sailboats Scour the Oceans for Data", "Date": "2016-09-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byALAMEDA, Calif. \u2014 Two robotic sailboats trace lawn-mower-style paths across the violent surface of the Bering Sea, off the coast of Alaska. The boats are counting fish \u2014 pollock, to be specific \u2014 with a fancy version of the fish finder sonar you\u2019d find on a bass fishing boat.About 2,500 miles away, Richard Jenkins, a mechanical engineer and part-time daredevil, is tracking the robot sailboats on a large projection screen in an old hangar that used to be part of the Alameda Naval Air Station. Now the hangar is the command center of a little company called Saildrone.At least 20 companies are chasing the possibly quixotic dream of a self-driving car in Silicon Valley. But self-sailing boats are already a real business.While they are counting fish, Saildrone\u2019s boats are also monitoring the seals that feed on the fish by tracking transponders that scientists have attached to the heads of the seals.\u201cWe can tell them what size fish they are eating and why they are going there,\u201d said Mr. Jenkins, who is the chief executive and a co-founder of the company.Last summer, working with scientists and engineers from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the boats skimmed along the edge of the retreating Arctic ice cap, giving scientists a detailed account of temperature, salinity and ecosystem information that would have been difficult and expensive to obtain in person.The Saildrone autonomous sailboats look a little like shrunken America\u2019s Cup racing yachts \u2014 small trimarans with hard, carbon-fiber sails.The Saildrone\u2019s carbon fiber sail acts like an aircraft wing. When air passes over it, thrust is created. The sail is stabilized by a counterweight that is placed in front of it and a tab trailing behind it that can automatically make small corrections to make sure it maintains an efficient angle to the wind. Underneath the boat are both a rudder to aid in steering and a keel, which will right the boat if it is knocked over.The big difference, of course, is that there are no sailors on board. The boats are controlled through communications satellites from the operations center here as they collect oceanographic data and monitor fish stocks and the environment.One day, they may be used for weather prediction, oil and gas industry ocean operations, or even to police illegal fishing.Mr. Jenkins has a much grander vision. He believes the missing piece of the puzzle to definitively comprehend the consequences of global warming is scientific data. He envisions a fleet of thousands or even tens of thousands of his 23-foot sailboats creating a web of sensors across the world\u2019s oceans.Vast amounts of data collected by his robots could reveal with greater detail the extent and rate at which global warming might become an existential threat to humanity and whether it is happening in decades rather than centuries.That is, if someone is willing to pay for all that. The boats are not sold \u2014 the scientists, commercial fisherman and weather predictors pay a $2,500-a-day fee per boat for the data they produce.Saildrone got its start with $2.5 million in grants from Eric Schmidt, Google\u2019s executive chairman, and his wife, Wendy Schmidt. And Mr. Jenkins\u2019s company recently received $14 million in financing from three socially minded venture capital firms: Social Capital, Lux and Capricorn.\u201cMy interest in Saildrone is very practical,\u201d said Chamath Palihapitiya, a former Facebook executive who is the founder of Social Capital. \u201cLet\u2019s stop arguing about what is happening, and let\u2019s measure. Once you have data and it\u2019s statistically significant and valid, then we can get to the next step, which is to find what the structural reforms are that need to happen.\u201dEach boat is packed with an armory of scientific sensors that beam data back to the control center.\u201cIt\u2019s not so much taking the earth\u2019s temperature as it is its pulse,\u201d said Mr. Jenkins, a 39-year-old, tousle-haired mechanical engineer who was trained at Imperial College London.He has found willing clients in ocean scientists and engineers who previously had limited ways to collect highly specific and accurate data about the ocean surface.\u201cRichard had a great boat but no scientific sensors on it, and we had sensors but no boat,\u201d said Christian Meinig, the director of engineering at the NOAA Pacific Marine Environmental Laboratory. The scientists at the laboratory have already begun to use the boats to enhance their study of the El Ni\u00f1o warm-water pattern in the Pacific Ocean.The breakthrough for the robots was a sailboat design that Mr. Jenkins originally began pursuing when he set out to capture the world land-sailing speed record in 1999. He succeeded in 2009 in a \u201cland yacht\u201d called Greenbird that reached a speed of 126.2 m.p.h. on a dry lake bed in Southern California.To reach such a high speed and remain stable, Mr. Jenkins replaced the traditional sailboat sail with a rigid vertical carbon-fiber wing coupled with a unique stabilizer trailing behind the wing that would automatically adjust the wing faster than a human sailor could respond by pulling ropes.He has repurposed the wing to sail at slower speeds and to autonomously travel anywhere in the world. Last year, in an experiment, one of the Saildrone boats made its way from Alameda to the Equator in 42 days, collecting a wealth of ocean surface data along the way. A scientific research vessel with a large human crew would be faster, but it would cost about $80,000 a day.That researchers can move the autonomous boats \u2014 unlike the static ocean buoys that are now typically used \u2014 is significant, because it allows scientists to alter collection patterns in response to ocean conditions and interesting discoveries.\u201cA self-correcting model is really a superpowerful way of doing things,\u201d said Christopher Sabine, an oceanographer who is director of Pacific Marine Environmental Laboratory. \u201cFor climate modeling we need to know what\u2019s going on year-round, and to be perfectly frank, we don\u2019t like to go out into the middle of winter.\u201dSaildrone is not the only autonomous vehicle on the sea. Liquid Robotics, based in Sunnyvale, Calif., makes a boat called Wave Glider, which uses wave rather than wind action to move at more than two knots and carry up to 100 pounds of instruments.The Saildrone payload is more than twice as large, and the boat is potentially twice as fast. The sensor suite is made up of more than a dozen instruments that capture wind speeds, radiation, still and video imagery, temperature, ocean chemistry, and other data.Mr. Jenkins\u2019s contention is that a fleet of robot sensors spread across an ocean like the Pacific will make a huge difference in both weather and climate prediction. For example, a better understanding of a weather phenomenon like El Ni\u00f1o could make a difference worth hundreds of millions of dollars.\u201cThey completely failed to see the last one coming,\u201d he said, noting that climate scientists acknowledge they don\u2019t have the spatial resolution to make accurate predictions. \u201cThey have a pressing need for more data.\u201dAn article on Monday about drone sailboats that gather research data misidentified the variety of fish being counted off the coast of Alaska by boats deployed by a company called Saildrone. The drones are counting pollock, not haddock.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How to Raise Trillions for Green Investments", "Date": "2016-09-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorAs a point of comparison, global gross domestic product in 2015 was $73 trillion. But there is no question that the world needs to ramp up its transition to a low-carbon, environmentally sustainable and resilient economy, and to do so rapidly. The question is, how do we pay for it, given the limited availability of government funding, particularly in developing countries?The answer: private financing. The good news is that there is a global abundance of private capital. To unlock these riches, governments must create conditions that encourage private investment in clean technologies and sustainable development. With smart, well-designed and coordinated policies, financing models and instruments like bonds and incentive programs, countries have the potential to solve some of the planet\u2019s most pressing environmental challenges while still maintaining economic growth.The challenge now is to build on these successes and ensure that green finance mechanisms are widely adopted so that capital markets can allocate financing to low-carbon sectors of the economy that have the potential to generate growth and jobs.For this to happen, countries will need to adopt policies that reduce the price of low-carbon investments to make them more attractive for private investors. These policies include environmental regulations to stimulate clean, sustainable development; incentives and subsidies for clean energy investments; and the pricing of carbon emissions, which can be done in a variety of ways, including emissions trading and taxes. We also need to eliminate subsidies that encourage the use and extraction of carbon-based energy like coal and oil. Such policies will take strong political will, especially as economic growth is slowing.China also has announced plans to create a nationwide carbon market in 2017 that is on track to become the largest in the world. Pilot exchanges already allow Chinese pollution emitters in several cities to trade carbon credits, earned by reducing emissions, to other companies that have been less successful in reducing their carbon discharges. In this way, China is trying to turn an environmental liability into an economic asset. If these exchanges work, they will be powerful examples for the rest of the developing world.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Evangelicals Ignore G.O.P. by Embracing Syrian Refugees", "Date": "2016-09-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTo Mr. Stocks, such questions belonged in the realm of politics \u2014 and he had not come that evening for political reasons. Rather, he said, he had come as a follower of Christ. \u201cMy job is to serve these people,\u201d he said, \u201cbecause they need to be served.\u201dBut politics and faith have always had the potential to conflict in the questions about resettling Syrian refugees in the United States.And at a time when conservative politicians, many with ties to Christian religious groups, have aggressively sought to keep the Syrian newcomers out of their states, it is conservative people of faith who, in many cases, are serving as their indispensable support system.Here in Marietta, the English lesson began around the donated kitchen table of Anwar and Daleen, two of the 10,000 Syrian refugees who have arrived in the United States in the past year only to grapple with that political reality, one as confusing as any new language.Anwar and Daleen are Syrian Muslims who fled the bombings of their hometown, Tafas, in November 2012. They first crossed into Jordan, and, eventually, to this suburban sanctuary, where they settled in May in an apartment with their two children; a third child was born in August.Here, thousands of miles from civil war, they were still so fearful of reprisals against family members in Syria that they declined to be identified by their full names.But the political issues, they said, they knew only from television. Their closest interactions with Americans have been largely with the members of Johnson Ferry Church, like Mr. Stocks. It was members of the church, most of whom are Republicans, who outfitted their tiny apartment and showed them how to navigate America\u2019s cavernous grocery stores.They also steered Anwar through the health care system as he prepares for heart surgery.\u201cI have been here for four months,\u201d Anwar said, \u201cand I have seen nothing except goodness.\u201dOf the politicians, he said he was not afraid: \u201cI fear only God.\u201d\u201cWe\u2019re not just leaving them on the side of the road, but we also care for this country and the people of this nation,\u201d Mr. Graham said. \u201cWe have to put America first.\u201dWhere Syrian refugees have settled in the United States.Politicians, even those generally closely tied to religious conservatives, were often just being politicians, he said.\u201cIt\u2019s not unusual that we have politicians timid in the face of fear,\u201d Mr. Moore said. \u201cBut the task of the church is a different one. The church is called to see the image of God in all people and to minister Christ\u2019s presence to all people. That\u2019s what churches are doing.\u201dOfficials at the nongovernment organizations that resettle refugees say members of the Mormon Church have been particularly helpful in resettling Syrian refugees in states like Utah, Texas and Arizona. Mormons historically tend to favor Republicans, but some polls in the spring showed Hillary Clinton, the Democratic presidential nominee, tied with Mr. Trump in heavily Mormon Utah, a state Democrats have not won since 1964.In Marietta, Mr. Stocks has made some strides in the three months he has been teaching Anwar and Daleen, even though he has little experience as a teacher. (Mr. Stocks is a project manager in construction.) On Wednesday, with his guidance, the couple wrote out the months of the year in English, recited their birthdays and responded to simple questions about their children. A yellow sticky note on the wall said \u201cwall.\u201d One on a door said \u201cdoor.\u201dAnwar was asked what he wanted to do after recovering from his heart surgery. \u201cWork,\u201d he said \u2014 any kind of work.\u201cThese are the most hospitable and loving people you\u2019ll ever meet, which is why it\u2019s frustrating to see the different things on the news that all these people are terrorists,\u201d Mr. Stocks said. \u201cThey don\u2019t know these people personally.\u201dBut Pastor Wright said that Jesus commanded his disciples, in the Book of Matthew, to \u201cmake disciples of all nations.\u201dHe also said that there were worldly reasons to help. \u201cThink of it from a strictly practical standpoint,\u201d he said. \u201cWould it be better for these people to see Americans reaching out with love, and showing them all of the blessings Americans can have? Or do we turn our backs on them, and make them more sympathetic to Islamic terrorism?\u201dRichard Fausset reported from Marietta, and Alan Blinder from Atlanta.Advertisement"}

She was Craig Claiborne\u2019s go-to expert on Jewish cooking in the late 1950s and early 1960s. Her husband, Judah Nadich, was the rabbi of the Park Avenue Synagogue in Manhattan, where Mr. Levin, 38, grew up in what he calls a \u201cconservadox\u201d family.\u201cMy grandmother had a strong influence on me from childhood,\u201d said Mr. Levin, who spent many after-school dates cooking with her. \u201cI still use one of her aprons and some of her favorite pastry tools.\u201dFor the holiday, which starts on Oct. 2, he omits her cloves, allspice and raisins, and adds an apple cider compote to the batter, which moistens the cake and gives it a caramelized apple flavor. On a recent afternoon, he pulled out a cast-aluminum Bundt pan that his grandmother bought at Zabar\u2019s, one he still uses for the cakes she taught him.For the second day of Rosh Hashana, Mrs. Nadich made double-crusted stone fruit and apple pies, her grandson recalled. He also makes fruit pies, but for his plum tart, he uses a sabl\u00e9 butter crust flavored with vanilla bean; a filling made simply of almonds or pistachios, sugar, egg and a bit of flour; and a topping of sliced plums.While preparing the dessert, he demonstrated a few tricks. \u201cWhen you are creaming confectioners\u2019 sugar with the butter,\u201d he said, \u201cthe texture becomes so smooth that there is no coarseness in the crust as there sometimes is using regular sugar.\u201dBecause he puts sugar in the crust and covers it with a sweetened textured almond filling, he does not douse the plums with sugar (though he does sprinkle turbinado sugar on top for added crunch). \u201cThis almond cream has a delicious flavor all of its own, so it accents the plums,\u201d he said. \u201cNot only does it absorb the juice and all the loveliness of the fruit, but it adds flavor to it in the baking process.\u201dMr. Levin prefers using butter in his desserts, but he believes coconut oil is good in a pie crust (in this case, he recommends solid coconut oil); grapeseed oil can be used to cook down fruit; and olive oil is a good substitute in a cake to make it pareve (neither meat nor milk).What would his grandmother think of his modern takes on her baking rituals? \u201cThey might seem strange to her, but she\u2019d love them,\u201d he said.cookingcookingAdvertisement"}

Holds Interest Rate at Zero", "Date": "2016-09-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe European Central Bank\u2019s policy-setting committee faces concerns over economic growth in the region, uncertainty over the impact of \u201cBrexit\u201d and questions over whether its own efforts are having the desired impact.The central bank lowered its forecasts for economic growth for next year and 2018, and it slightly reduced its estimates for inflation in both years. It warned that expansion could slow more and said that it would maintain a program to pump more cash into the financial system to bolster the eurozone economy.\u201cWe see that our monetary policy is effective,\u201d Mario Draghi, the bank\u2019s president, said. \u201cInterest rates have to be low today to be high tomorrow.\u201dEconomists say the bank is moving slowly because with interest rates already at record lows, traditional monetary policy is at its limits.Mr. Draghi and his colleagues have already unleashed an arsenal of unconventional tools, including:\u25a0 Negative deposit rates, which effectively require banks to pay to store cash in the central bank\u2019s vaults, giving them an added incentive to lend it out instead.\u25a0 Quantitative easing, where the central bank buys 80 billion euros, or about $90 billion, of government and corporate bonds each month in an effort to reduce market interest rates to stimulate the economy.\u25a0 Flooding banks with cheap money to encourage them to lend to individuals and businesses.Though the central bank has fallen short of its target of pushing inflation to just under 2 percent \u2014 it has been hovering at 0.2 percent for the last two months \u2014 the bank argues that its policies have averted deflation and encouraged economic growth. Its policies have also helped weaken the euro, which indirectly benefits the economy \u2014 a weaker currency typically encourages inflation and makes eurozone exports look cheaper compared with those from rival countries.\u201cThe jury is still out on whether this is effective,\u201d said Carsten Brzeski, an economist with ING-DiBa in Frankfurt. \u201cThe E.C.B. likes to say that if they hadn\u2019t done it, the world would look much worse. I believe that\u2019s true, but it\u2019s something we can\u2019t really prove.\u201dIf more measures are needed, the central bank could move further into unconventional territory by buying stocks as well as bonds. And it could also provide \u201chelicopter money\u201d \u2014 giving cash directly to households to increase spending. But Mr. Draghi will probably need time to prepare public opinion for any such moves, and he said that neither measure was discussed at Thursday\u2019s meeting.\u201cThe economic recovery in the euro area is expected to be dampened by still-subdued foreign demand, partly related to the uncertainties following the U.K. referendum outcome.\u201dMuch remains unclear about the terms of Britain\u2019s departure from the European Union. Among the possible repercussions:\u25a0 Trade with Britain could be affected, depending on the terms of the final deal between London and Brussels. The fall in the value of the pound could also make British exports more competitive, while making Continental European products more expensive in Britain.\u25a0 Companies, including ones in London\u2019s prized financial services industry, could desert Britain for the Continent to ensure continued access to the eurozone market.For the moment, the central bank has not taken any direct measures to address concerns stemming from \u201cBrexit.\u201dBritain has started the clock on leaving the European Union, and will be out of the bloc by March 2019. Here is how \u201cBrexit\u201d has affected business so far.\u201cIn order to reap the full benefits from our monetary policy measures, other policy areas must contribute much more decisively, both at the national and at the European level.\u201dThe unemployment rate across the eurozone stands above 10 percent. Household spending is restricted. Demand across the region is weak. And the advice from several officials, including Mr. Draghi, has been clear: Governments must spend more.The central bank\u2019s policies can create the conditions for more growth and investment, Mr. Brzeski said, \u201cbut they simply can\u2019t force people or companies to invest. That\u2019s why the discussion is gradually moving toward\u201d what role \u201cgovernments should play.\u201dThat may seem to be an unexceptional view, but it is a major departure from the consensus in a bloc dominated by Germany, which has long pushed for balanced budgets. In a sign that times may be changing, even Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble, the German finance minister, recently suggested the possibility of tax cuts after elections in autumn 2017.Advertisement"}

The issuers are really going after each other with lucrative deals.\u201dCash isn\u2019t as exciting as a fantasy vacation, but for most people, it is the most lucrative choice.\u201cWe haven\u2019t worked through all the details yet,\u201d said Michael Saccucci, the director of statistics for Consumer Reports, who tinkered for several years with an internal tool before releasing it to the public in June. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to make it more consistent, and one of my goals for future versions is to add a two-card optimization.\u201dSo, 10 months in, has he stuck with his cash card resolution?\u201cThat bonus was too big to ignore,\u201d Mr. McQuay said. \u201cI don\u2019t think it fits my long-term spending, but I think I\u2019ll spend enough to justify the card for the first year.\u201dThere is a reason so many cards focus their rewards structure on travel. It\u2019s aspirational \u2014 who doesn\u2019t like to daydream about jetting off to the tropics? \u2014 and it\u2019s cost-effective. Airline miles and similar benefits can be bought in bulk by card issuers for a fraction of their cash value.But delving into the fine print of actually redeeming all those miles and points is a quick buzz-kill, which means that many accumulate and languish, unused.The way to stretch the dollar value of your points and miles the farthest, though, is by jumping through the hoops and redeeming them for airline travel and hotel stays. For customers with a preferred airline or hotel chain, that brand\u2019s credit card is still typically the best deal, but travelers who bounce around are fueling a growing market for flexible cards with transferable perks.Dedicated points ninjas tend to juggle multiple cards to squeeze out the maximum bonus on each. Mr. Saccucci of Consumer Reports said his analysis found that average card holders could increase the yield of their rewards programs by about 30 percent by strategically using two different cards.The app is still a beta version, with some flaws, but Jonathan Hayes, the company\u2019s founder, sees a big future in helping customers treat rewards points like the currency they have become.\u201cWhen you buy stocks, you have a broker,\u201d Mr. Hayes said. \u201cPeople have a lot of points stored up in various programs, but they don\u2019t know how to get real value out of them. There\u2019s no system set up for this sector of personal finance. That\u2019s the role we hope to fill.\u201dBut if you decide to stop using an older card, it often pays off to keep it open. The age of your accounts factors into your credit score and closing older accounts takes a toll, especially if it reduces the total amount of untapped credit you have available.\u201cI don\u2019t think they\u2019ve figured out yet how to help people understand all of those options and benefits,\u201d said Mr. Goldman of Bankrate. \u201cIt\u2019s a more nuanced thing to market, but we\u2019re going to keep seeing more of them, because there\u2019s an upper limit on rewards and cash.\u201dAn earlier version of this article included an outdated reference to a rewards card offered through Fidelity Investments.

{"Headline": "Deutsche Bank Is the Darling of the Short-Sellers", "Date": "2016-09-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIn a market full of crowded trades, few have become as fashionable as the bet that Deutsche Bank\u2019s stock price will keep on falling.Hedge funds, large and small, are shorting the stock. Long-term institutional investors are dumping their positions. And Wall Street\u2019s secretive but influential community of independent research providers has been proclaiming for months that Germany\u2019s largest bank does not have enough cash to survive.Even Tidjane Thiam, the chief executive of Credit Suisse, which itself has been the target of hedge funds, said at a conference on Wednesday that Europe\u2019s banks were \u201cnot really investable.\u201dThis echo chamber of doom \u2014 fed in recent days by a cycle of reports in Germany that the government might step in, only to be followed by denials by Berlin \u2014 brings to mind some of the fears over Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers before those institutions suddenly lost the trust of investors and clients alike in the dark days leading up to the 2008 financial crisis.With 1.8 trillion euros in assets and 220 billion euros of cash on hand, Deutsche Bank, strictly by the numbers, would seem to be in no danger of failing \u2014 a point that the bank\u2019s chief executive, John Cryan, has been making repeatedly.Still, for a large financial institution like Deutsche Bank, which relies on volatile short-term loans to fund a risky portfolio of derivatives, securitized mortgages and other hard-to-sell assets, market confidence can be fickle \u2014 there one moment, gone the next.\u201cThis trade is getting a lot more popular \u2014 no doubt about it,\u201d said Brad H. Lamensdorf, who runs the Ranger Equity Bear E.T.F., an exchange-traded fund that tracks a portfolio of stocks that Mr. Lamensdorf believes are going to sink fast.\u201cDeutsche Bank is a massive hedge fund with lackadaisical compliance and a lot of leverage. I think it\u2019s going to five bucks.\u201dIn the United States, Deutsche Bank\u2019s shares closed at $12.30, down from $26.21 a year ago, and it is the top holding in Mr. Lamensdorf\u2019s $220 million fund.According to Thomson Reuters data, investors have borrowed 39 million shares of Deutsche Bank shares to bet against it \u2014 or about 2.8 percent of the total shares outstanding. This so-called short interest in the bank is close to a one-year high and represents around $480 million.Traders say they believe that George Soros, known for his successful bet against the British pound in 1992, has the most money at stake in wagering that Deutsche Bank\u2019s shares will continue to drop. A representative for Mr. Soros declined to comment.But there are a long line of others who expect the worst for Deutsche Bank and they have not been shy in publicizing their views.\u201cThe most respected financial country in the world has a No. 1 bank that people are saying is insolvent,\u201d said Lee Robinson, a well-known hedge fund executive who recently set up his own firm, Altana Wealth, which has offices in Monaco and London.Mr. Pal spoke with two other hedge fund executives: Edward Misrahi of Ronit Capital, who said he thought Deutsche Bank was going to be nationalized, and Bernd Ondruch of Astellon Capital, who was of the view that Deutsche\u2019s balance sheet was too big and not to be trusted.Mr. Pal is one of a growing number of refugees from large investment banks who have gone out on their own, charging premium sums to provide trading ideas to investors looking for an edge in a marketplace where information and insight has become commoditized.Because they are independent, they can make the types of bold predictions \u2014 like shorting Deutsche Bank \u2014 that they could not at their previous employers. And because this niche has become more competitive in recent years, as the exodus of bankers and traders from large banks continues, the pressure on these analysts to make brassy market calls has grown.All of which feeds into a cycle of gloom through which each nugget of bad news is amplified and broadcast via social media, trader chatter and other means.Deutsche Bank grew to its current size after a troupe of traders and bankers from Merrill Lynch \u2014 including Anshu Jain, the bank\u2019s former leader \u2014 came on board in the 1990s. In a short time, the bank was transformed from a sleepy German lender into a sophisticated financial operator with the ability to package, promote and trade the most complex securities in the marketplace.This appetite for risk is why the bank faces the prospect of a huge fine \u2014 the United States Justice Department is seeking a $14 billion penalty as its opening position in negotiations \u2014 over its role in the mortgage mess.It is worth noting, too, that while the bank remains under attack by hedge funds, it continues to provide a sales and trading function that remains popular with this very type of investor.Among the services provided is a short market-intelligence note that comes out early in the morning London time and has become a first read for a large number of hedge funds.Most investors appear to be still willing to do business with Deutsche Bank, even though some may be shorting the stock. That is because the view is quite firmly held that even in the worst case, Deutsche Bank will not fail to make good on its responsibility as a trading counterparty.There are exceptions, though. One major investor, who conducts billions of dollars worth of financial transactions with a select group of investment banks that includes Deutsche Bank (because of the size of its balance sheet and the skill of its traders), has decided to step back for the moment.This investor, who asked not to be identified so as not to jeopardize his relationship with the bank, said that if given a choice between Deutsche Bank and a competing institution, he would not pick Deutsche Bank right now.The bank is counting on its clients to weather the turmoil. \u201cOur trading clients are amongst the world\u2019s most sophisticated investors,\u201d said Renee Calabro, a bank spokeswoman. \u201cWe are confident that the vast majority of them have a full understanding of our strong financial position, the current macro-economic environment, the litigation process in the U.S. and the progress we are making with our strategy.\u201dClemens Fuest, president of the Ifo Institute, an economic research group based in Munich, commented, \u201cIt\u2019s kind of scary. In principle, this is a fairly solid bank, but due to rumors the bank is getting in trouble. This can get dangerous \u2014 and create a liquidity situation.\u201dBecause of an editing error, an article on Thursday about a rise in bets against the stock of Deutsche Bank paraphrased incorrectly from a statement by Renee Calabro, a Deutsche Bank spokeswoman. She was referring to the bank\u2019s clients, not its investors, in her remarks about weathering the current turmoil.Advertisement"}

Borrow the rest, split among the family.Let\u2019s break them down in order, for a family who has its sights on a state university and doesn\u2019t qualify for any grants or scholarships that they would not have to repay.Harsh? He doesn\u2019t think so. \u201cI don\u2019t judge what people choose to spend money on,\u201d he said. \u201cBut most people with kids going to college wish they could go back and change what they spent, because a lot of it was on things that didn\u2019t have any value in the long run.\u201dThen, parent borrowing. Mr. McKinley notes that we\u2019re at a rare economic moment where three things are happening at once: Home values are rising nicely in many parts of the country, interest rates are low and lenders are a bit looser than they were in the recent past. For people with children in college now, that means that borrowing money against your home may be a good way to come up with your $25,000 chunk.Mr. McKinley is bearish on the future of student loans and expects them to become generally less available over time. So he suggested a more aggressive way for the parents of younger children to pay for a quarter of college: Draw on home equity now while you can, put the money in certificates of deposit and treat your (often tax-deductible) interest payments on the loan like an insurance policy, where you\u2019re paying a \u201cpremium\u201d just to be sure you\u2019ll have access to the capital. After all, as we saw in 2009, banks that are loose now with home equity loans can change their minds in a heartbeat.The McKinley plan is linear. Your financial life probably won\u2019t be, pockmarked as most of our lives are with unpaid parental leave or illness or unemployment or inopportune stock market declines or a bunch of these things all at once. But the plan is also flexible. You could borrow a bit more or save a bit more or consider a gap year between high school and college to put away additional funds.The family is leaning hard toward the cheaper option. \u201cIf you\u2019re the kind of kid who can get into the more expensive school, then you\u2019ll usually have the talent and moxie to succeed even without their education,\u201d Mr. McKinley said.There is also the bizarre unpredictability of the process. The rack rates are high, and while many people get discounts based on need or merit, you have no way of knowing which, if any, you might qualify for many years from now. You\u2019ll probably get the answers some spring day in the future and then have a few weeks, at most, to make what may be among the biggest and most consequential financial decisions of your life.So good luck with that. But don\u2019t let the absurdity of what the system has become paralyze you into doing nothing. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to come up with a quarter of a million dollars for your kid,\u201d Mr. McKinley said. \u201cDo what you can now, and just keep building off of it.\u201dAdvertisement"}

The potential combined company would be Europe\u2019s largest operator of stock markets by far.\u201cTherefore, we have opened an in-depth investigation to assess the proposed merger.\u201dThe inquiry would look at a variety of areas within the European financial markets, including the clearing of trades; the markets for derivatives and short-term repurchasing agreements known as repos; and other areas of financial market infrastructure.The European Commission noted that the planned merger would combine two of the three markets for German stocks.To address competition concerns, the London Stock Exchange Group said on Wednesday that it intended to explore a potential sale of LCH S.A., the French operating arm of the LCH.Clearnet Group, its majority-owned clearing business.The European Commission expects to conclude its investigation and issue a decision by Feb. 13.Ahead of the shareholder votes this summer, both exchanges spent much of their time trying to reassure investors about the deal in light of the outcome of the British referendum, which could greatly change Britain\u2019s relationship with the rest of Europe.They have said that an exit by Britain would not change the deal but that it could \u201cwell affect the volume or nature\u201d of business carried out by the combined company.Advertisement"}

Mr. Obama said protecting it was a vital step to counteract increasingly grave trends taking hold as the planet warms.\u201cDangerous changes in our climate caused mainly by human activity; dead zones in our ocean caused mainly by pollution that we create here on land; unsustainable fishing practices; unprotected marine areas in which rare species and entire ecosystems are at risk \u2014 all those things are happening now,\u201d Mr. Obama said.While the fishing industry strenuously opposed the proposal for the monument, Brad Sewell, who oversees work on fisheries and Atlantic Coast issues at the Natural Resources Defense Council, called the designation \u201can incredible victory\u201d in the fight against climate change.\u201cIt is this spectacular ocean wilderness that has plummeting canyons deeper than the Grand Canyon, undersea mountains taller than anything east of the Rockies, and sublimely beautiful deep-sea corals that blossom out of the depths and are as ancient as the redwoods,\u201d he said, adding that the president had increased by 20 times the amount of protected ocean habitat off the continental United States.The move will immediately ban oil and gas exploration and drilling as well as most commercial fishing within the monument\u2019s boundaries, giving fishermen 60 days to cease their operations there. But in a nod to local industry concerns, the preserve is smaller than one proposed last month by Connecticut\u2019s congressional delegation. And Mr. Obama will allow lobster and red crab fisheries to continue operating there for seven years.Still, the president\u2019s designation was likely to draw opposition from Republicans who have criticized his use of executive power to shield public space and argued that the moves harm local businesses. New England\u2019s seafood industry voiced its objections as it is already contending with declining fish stocks, warming waters and increasingly strict regulations.\u201cPresident Obama recognizes the critical need to permanently protect marine resources from current and future threats, most notably the effects of climate change and ocean acidification,\u201d said Michael Conathan, the director of ocean policy at the Center for American Progress. \u201cHis action to protect this wonderland of endangered whales, seabirds, fish and corals will be lauded by future generations.\u201dOn Thursday, Mr. Obama said his trip to Midway, where he snorkeled amid purple and orange coral and near endangered Hawaiian monk seals, had confirmed his belief that it was possible to slow the harmful effects of the planet\u2019s warming.\u201cIt reminded us that nature\u2019s actually resilient, if we take care to just stop actively destroying it,\u201d he said.Jess Bidgood contributed reporting from Portsmouth, N.H.Advertisement"}

Trump, is not entirely prepared for the presidency but argue that he would \u2014 of course! \u2014 surround himself with admirable advisers, I have one name for you: Sid Miller.Mr. Miller, at 61, is weathered, blue-eyed and beefy, a classic backslapping good ole West Texas boy. He favors a wide-brimmed, white-as-snow cowboy hat and pointed boots. A former Baptist, he is today an elder in the Cowboy Church of Erath County. The United States Calf Roping Association named him a world champion in 2004. You get the idea.The right-leaning Mr. Miller spent 12 years in the Texas House of Representatives. After losing his seat in 2012, he rose, phoenix-like, to be elected agriculture commissioner in 2014. The work of hard-rock musician Ted Nugent as his campaign treasurer certainly helped.Despite the obvious contrasts, the West Texas rodeo star and the New York real estate magnate may have more in common than you\u2019d think.You can\u2019t say he didn\u2019t share the largess with his staff. A newly elected commissioner, Mr. Miller didn\u2019t post all job openings among his staff and filled several positions with friends and campaign team members. And he gave out more in bonuses in his first nine months in office \u2014 $413,700 to 144 employees \u2014 than his predecessor had in more than two years. One person Mr. Miller hired, at $180,000 a year, has a conviction for abuse of campaign funds.Mr. Miller\u2019s own financial affairs have drawn scrutiny. The Dallas Morning News reported that he invested $97,000 of campaign contributions in stocks; then he used the proceeds to pay himself back for loans he\u2019d made to his campaign fund \u2014 without recording these transfers in his final campaign finance reports.In 2015, Mr. Miller used campaign funds to travel to Mississippi for a rodeo. In another case that year, Mr. Miller took a taxpayer-funded trip that he said was to visit lawmakers in Oklahoma, but was also to visit a practitioner known as Dr. Mike for an injection known as the \u201cJesus shot\u201d that supposedly takes away pain for life.Mr. Miller and Mr. Trump also share an aversion to \u201cpolitical correctness.\u201d\u201cIf one more person says \u2018Happy Holidays\u2019 to me I just might slap them,\u201d he wrote on Facebook last December. \u201cEither tell me \u2018Merry Christmas\u2019 or just don\u2019t say anything.\u201dAs agriculture commissioner, he created the \u201ccupcake amnesty\u201d to defend parents\u2019 right to send their kids to school with sugary confections. He also welcomed deep fryers and soft drinks back to Texas schools, where they had been banned for a decade because of soaring obesity rates.\u201cWe\u2019ve been raising big, strapping, healthy young kids here in Texas nearly 200 years,\u201d Mr. Miller declared. \u201cAnd we don\u2019t need Washington, D.C., telling us how to do it.\u201dMr. Miller was also the author of a Texas House bill requiring women to have a sonogram 24 hours before an abortion and to listen to the fetal heartbeat, accompanied by a doctor\u2019s narration: an approach that some people, like Mr. Trump, might welcome as a \u201cpunishment\u201d for women seeking abortions.And like Mr. Trump, Mr. Miller believes that Muslims belong anywhere but here. One of his Facebook posts suggested we make peace with the Muslim world as we did with Japan \u2014 by using the atomic bomb. In another post, Mr. Miller likened Syrian refugees to rattlesnakes.This is not a guy who is going to raise a stink about building a wall on the southern border \u2014 he\u2019s more likely to lasso illegal crossers with his own rope.

{"Headline": "Hedge Fund and Cybersecurity Firm Team Up to Short-Sell Device Maker", "Date": "2016-09-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe cybersecurity firm behind a short-seller\u2019s campaign against St. Jude Medical, a major manufacturer of pacemakers, has a curious operating history.The firm, MedSec, says it has been around 18 months. But it was incorporated in the United States in Delaware just last month. Justine Bone, its chief executive, came on board two months ago.And MedSec\u2019s headquarters shares the same address as a virtual office in Miami that provides space to a number of companies.The start-up is at the center of an unusual story line that brings together a Wall Street short-seller and the mysterious world of computer hacking.Three weeks ago, Carson Block, an investor known for betting against, or shorting, companies\u2019 stocks, announced that he and MedSec had uncovered \u201ctroubling cybersecurity flaws\u201d in St. Jude\u2019s pacemakers. Those flaws, he claimed, made them vulnerable to hackers and posed a potential health hazard. The situations put forward by Mr. Block were more akin to an international spy thriller than his usual forensic examination of a company\u2019s accounting.Mr. Block went public about three months after he received a call from Robert Bryan, a former hedge fund manager who helped raise money for MedSec, asking him to breakfast. Mr. Bryan proposed that MedSec and Mr. Block\u2019s Muddy Waters hedge fund join forces to expose a potential security vulnerability that Mr. Bryan said MedSec had discovered in St. Jude\u2019s pacemakers.The firms agreed to share in the windfall of any decline in St. Jude\u2019s stock.\u201cI have a very jaundiced view of how companies treat cybersecurity,\u201d Mr. Block said in an interview on Thursday. \u201cThis is why this issue spoke to me so much.\u201dShort-sellers stake bets against stocks and profit when the share price falls. They often find themselves taking the heat for protesting loudly about the company they have waged a financial bet against. St. Jude has itself accused Muddy Waters, which manages about $100 million, of publishing a misleading report for its own financial gain. The company\u2019s share price fell about 5 percent on Aug. 25 after Muddy Waters released MedSec\u2019s research.Muddy Waters\u2019 partnership with MedSec is unorthodox. The cybersecurity firm counts Mr. Bryan, a former Goldman Sachs analyst, as one of its directors. Mr. Block and Mr. Bryan first met when Mr. Bryan was running a now-defunct hedge fund in New York called Metaval Capital.MedSec has portrayed itself as a company that researches vulnerabilities in medical devices as a public service and considers itself among a group of hackers that engage in bounty hunting for bugs in networks and software programs. But unlike many of these hackers, who typically confront the company with their findings and seek compensation, MedSec chose not to go to the company.Ms. Bone, MedSec\u2019s chief, said in an interview with Bloomberg Television on Aug. 25, that MedSec did not go to St. Jude with its findings because they were \u201cworried that they would sweep this under the rug.\u201dMedSec says that St. Jude\u2019s pacemakers and defibrillators have security flaws including a lack of encryption and an opening that allows unauthorized devices to intercept communication between the implanted device and its home monitor.But St. Jude has said the findings are in error. On Wednesday, the company filed a lawsuit in Federal District Court in Minnesota accusing MedSec and Mr. Block of making false statements and conspiring to manipulate its shares.In the lawsuit, St. Jude noted that a group of researchers at the University of Michigan had reproduced MedSec\u2019s experiment and \u201ccame to strikingly different conclusions\u201d and said the problems uncovered were overblown.St. Jude, like many medical device manufacturers, has had a history of problems with some of its products \u2014 some with deadly results. In 2012, the company had to make changes to some of its heart defibrillators because of problems with wires that protruded from their casings that had led to a number of deaths.The recent questions about the security of St. Jude\u2019s pacemakers comes as the company is being acquired by Abbott Laboratories in a stock and cash deal valued at $25 billion. Abbott has said it plans to continue pursuing the deal, which was announced on April 28, shortly before Mr. Block met with Mr. Bryan to discuss teaming up.Mr. Block, in an interview, said the timing of the meeting was a coincidence and that MedSec had broadly looked at whether other pacemaker manufacturers were vulnerable to similar attacks and found problems only at St. Jude.\u201cI don\u2019t think you can conclude that they came together to short St. Jude,\u201d Mr. Block said of MedSec.In an emailed response, Mr. Bryan described himself as a minority investor in MedSec and said the company \u201craised seed capital far before contacting Carson.\u201d He added that \u201cit\u2019s implausible that we\u2019d develop an entire study a year ago on the hope a short-seller would take the case and not speak to any of them.\u201dHe said the company was incorporated in St. Kitts and Nevis, a Caribbean nation, last year and incorporated in Delaware so it could \u201creceive compensation\u201d from Mr. Block\u2019s fund. Mr. Bryan said the firm has a long-term \u201csublease and physical office space\u201d and \u201crecently we signed up a few clients including a hospital in Texas.\u201d He declined to disclose any names.A number of hedge funds, which had placed bets on the likelihood of the Abbott deal closing, lost money when shares of St. Jude fell last month, erasing more than $1 billion in market value. Some of them, as well as other investors in St. Judge, have discussed filing a lawsuit against Muddy Waters and MedSec, and brought in lawyers at a prominent Wall Street law firm as counsel, according to people briefed on the discussions.MedSec\u2019s board and staff is an unusual mix, including a former congressman, university professors and people from the world of hacking. Mr. Block has arranged for his public relations firm to handle media for MedSec.A doctor who is on the company\u2019s board and issued a letter vouching for the firm\u2019s results also has an equity stake in MedSec.The firm sought to add some gravitas to its ranks with the hiring of Ms. Bone, who previously held top network security jobs at Bloomberg and Dow Jones. A former ballet dancer in New Zealand, Ms. Bone also is the former chief executive of Immunity, a company that specializes in cybersecurity threat assessment, and she has been a featured speaker at major hacker community conferences.MedSec and Muddy Waters have given varying accounts of the urgency of their discovery. In her television interview, Ms. Bone said the company saw \u201cno evidence of an immediate threat.\u201dIn their report, however, MedSec and Muddy Waters quote Hemal Nayak, a cardio-electrophysiologist at the University of Chicago Medicine, who recommended that his patients unplug their St. Jude devices and said he would not implant any new pacemakers until the security problems were addressed.Dr. Nayak, who could not be reached for comment, also serves as a medical adviser and board member at MedSec and has an equity stake in the firm. He has acknowledged not being an \u201cexpert in cybersecurity\u201d but said he \u201cwitnessed, firsthand, the experiments MedSec has conducted.\u201d Dr. Nayak was given an equity interest in the firm \u201cprior to MedSec reaching its conclusions,\u201d according to a footnote in the research report.A spokeswoman for the University of Chicago Medicine said: \u201cThe work Dr. Nayak conducted with MedSec/Muddy Waters was done on his own time and not in his capacity as a faculty member or physician at the University of Chicago Medical Center.\u201dThe same day that Mr. Block and MedSec went public with their findings, they sent a copy of the research to the federal Food and Drug Administration.Angela Stark, a spokeswoman for the F.D.A., said in an emailed statement the agency \u201cis aware of the allegations and concerns raised in MedSec\u2019s public report\u201d and is investigating them.She added that the agency said patients with St. Jude pacemakers should continue to use them.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Monsanto Whistle-Blower: $22 Million Richer, but Not Satisfied", "Date": "2016-09-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFair GameWinning isn\u2019t everything.So says the man who recently received $22 million after bringing to light multiyear accounting violations at Monsanto, the agribusiness and chemicals giant. Even though his is the second-largest award issued by the Securities and Exchange Commission under its five-year-old program to encourage whistle-blowers to come forward (after a $30 million award in September 2014), it feels, he told me, like something of a hollow victory.\u201cThe company got fined and some money changed hands, but that\u2019s not the answer,\u201d the whistle-blower said in a telephone interview. \u201cManagement not being held accountable, that still bothers me. I went into this to get that fixed, and that didn\u2019t get fixed.\u201dThe $22 million award generated a flurry of interest in the Monsanto case and in the S.E.C.\u2019s program. But the whistle-blower, who remains anonymous because he is unsure about his future career path and does not want his involvement in the case to damage it, has not told his story publicly until now.People who try to flag wrongdoing in the workplace endure immense hardships and are often harmed in the process. In spite of safeguards, many are identified, driven from their jobs and branded as troublemakers in their industries. This makes it difficult for them to find new jobs.Happily, none of this happened to the truth teller in the Monsanto matter, who held a financial job at the company. Still, the process was anything but easy, he said, causing friction with co-workers.\u201cNobody else feels what you feel internally, so you have a hard time understanding why people don\u2019t see it as you do,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s the only way you can go through this: It\u2019s got to be something from deep within that drives you.\u201dA Monsanto spokeswoman said it would be inappropriate to comment on the award.The S.E.C. concluded that the company had improperly accounted for millions of dollars of incentive rebates offered to distributors of its Roundup herbicide. In its settlement with Monsanto, the S.E.C. said the problematic accounting began in 2009 and continued through 2011.The trouble started, the S.E.C. said, when the economy was in a tailspin and Monsanto\u2019s customers were flocking to less expensive generic versions of Roundup. Recognizing that sales of the product were coming in well below what the company had forecast to investors, Monsanto decided to change its accounting policies on customer rebates, the whistle-blower said. Monsanto essentially shifted the costs of the rebates into fiscal 2010 while keeping the sales associated with the rebates in 2009.Although the S.E.C. did not accuse the Monsanto employees of intending to violate the law, it said in its settlement order that \u201cas a result of the improper accounting, Monsanto met consensus earnings-per-share analyst estimates for fiscal year 2009.\u201d Meeting such estimates is crucial: When companies report results that are below expectations, their stocks often plummet.In 2010, the company again shifted some rebate costs into the next year. The actions inflated Monsanto\u2019s reported profit by $31 million over the two years, according to regulatory filings.In the enforcement action, the S.E.C. named three midlevel employees involved in the improper activities. They paid a total of $135,000 in penalties. One had retired from Monsanto, the S.E.C. said, but the other two still work at the company. Both are accountants and were barred from appearing before the S.E.C. as accountants for one to two years.It was frustrating, the whistle-blower said, that the S.E.C. took no action against others at Monsanto who, he said, knew about the improprieties.\u201cIt\u2019s really difficult when your company is doing something you know is wrong but you\u2019ve got everybody around you saying it\u2019s perfectly fine,\u201d the former employee recalled. \u201cThe Monsanto culture is very tightknit. Everybody has stock options and everyone is financially at risk. So they go with the flow.\u201dIn agreeing to the settlement, Monsanto said it was committed to \u201coperating its business with the utmost integrity and transparency and in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations.\u201dThe S.E.C. also declined to act against Deloitte, Monsanto\u2019s auditor. This puzzles Mr. Meissner, the whistle-blower\u2019s lawyer, knowing what he does about the facts of the matter.\u201cBringing cases against auditors would put a stop to a good deal of accounting fraud,\u201d Mr. Meissner told me. In accounting cases like this one, \u201cthere should also be an action against the outside audit or an explanation of why there isn\u2019t one,\u201d he added.Deloitte declined to comment.As is its custom, the S.E.C. would not say why it had not pursued an enforcement case against Deloitte.But the agency has increased the number of cases it has brought against auditors in recent years. In fiscal 2015, the S.E.C. brought 76 cases against individuals and companies. In 2013, it brought 37.The S.E.C. employees who worked with the whistle-blower on the Monsanto matter made his job easier, he said, and were very familiar with the accounting issues. They were also advocates within the agency for the former employee, his lawyer said.Still, it was the whistle-blower who took the risks, Mr. Meissner said. \u201cHere you have someone who tries to do the right things internally, gets stymied and does what you\u2019re supposed to do \u2014 reach out to the authorities,\u201d he said. \u201cHe flew to Washington many times to assist them on his own expense without any guarantee of anything.\u201dWhat is the whistle-blower doing now, with the case over and the bounty in hand?\u201cHe left Monsanto during the course of the investigation and went to work for another company in a similar position,\u201d Mr. Meissner said. \u201cHe is very happy there.\u201dHe said he plans to continue working.Twitter: @gmorgensonAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Morning Agenda: Dodd-Frank Tussles, Sham Accounts at Wells Fargo, and a Curious Short", "Date": "2016-09-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe Dodd-Frank Act must be a real drag for private equity. After years of scant federal oversight, the sector was suddenly lumped with a new set of regulatory exams and reporting obligations.If it passes, private equity firms will still have to put up with federal exams, but their reporting obligations will be loosened.The bill comes soon after several enforcement actions against private equity firms by the Securities and Exchange Commission. This, critics say, raises the question: Why would you undo restrictions on the industry just as the S.E.C. is identifying problems with it?Wells Fargo has long presented itself as a bank that cares more about long-term relationships than making a quick buck.It took a hit when it emerged that employees secretly issued credit cards and set up sham accounts. The fraudulent banking practices cost the bank $185 million in fines.Regulators concede that the financial harm to consumers was not huge. But what does it say about the culture of the bank?Employees were rewarded financially for opening new accounts and said they felt extreme pressure to open as many accounts as possible.Maybe it\u2019s time to examine these incentives a little more closely.Imagine a pacemaker being hacked.This was the disturbing vision raised by Carson Block, an investor known for betting against companies\u2019 stocks. His hedge fund, Muddy Waters, was in a rather unorthodox partnership with MedSec, a company that engages in bounty hunting for bugs and considers its research on vulnerabilities in medical devices a public service.The pair announced last month that they had uncovered \u201ctroubling cybersecurity flaws\u201d in pacemakers made by St. Jude Medical.
