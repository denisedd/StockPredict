{"Headline": "California Today: Haves and Have-Nots in the Golden State", "Date": "2016-09-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCalifornia TodayGood morning.Welcome to California Today, a morning update on the stories that matter to Californians (and anyone else interested in the state).It\u2019s official: California leads the pack in a very troubling category: desperate poverty.Poverty in America is complex. Earning $25,000 a year in Mississippi is different from the same rough income in California. There are things like state and local taxes to consider, along with vastly different housing costs, child and health care and commuting expenses. There are different benefits, too, like nutrition assistance or child support payments.The Census Bureau tries to smooth out some of these differences with what it calls a measure of \u201csupplemental poverty,\u201d which adds many of those other costs and benefits to the standard poverty rate.Only the District of Columbia, with 22 percent of its population in poverty under the adjusted figures, ranks higher than California. That is a relatively small place, with 147,000 people in this hard strait.The California population in \u201csupplemental poverty\u201d is close to eight million people. The census adjustment from standard poverty numbers increased our count by 5.6 percentage points, or 2.2 million people.California, of course, is a populous and varied state, but rents are sky high in the most dense areas, and taxes are usually high relative to other places. These costs have much to do with this sorry result.If you came to much of the Bay Area or Los Angeles and bought a house, there is a good chance you became a millionaire, at least on paper, simply by paying your mortgage bill.The very poorest Californians, by comparison, are in the agricultural areas, not cheek by jowl with the opulent.But there are still plenty of places where the contrast is closely stark: In 2014, the Census Bureau put per capita income in Palo Alto at $75,257, while adjacent East Palo Alto was at $18,527. And that\u2019s not adjusting for the area\u2019s sky-high housing costs.In Los Angeles, the per capita income of Beverly Hills was $81,788, while Bell City came in at $12,031. They are 20 miles, and several worlds, apart.Tens of thousands of volunteers turned up on Saturday for the annual California Coastal Cleanup Day.And just as they do every year, cigarette butts topped the list of most common trash items found along beaches, waterways and lake shores, the event\u2019s leaders said.The primary source of the discarded cigarettes traces back not to beachgoers, but rather urban smokers, people in, say, Riverside, who flick a butt to the curb, where it is swept into storm drains, out to the ocean and up on to the shore.Part of the solution lies in making sure that smokers understand where used cigarettes end up when they are discarded in a gutter or out a car window, environmentalists say.An awareness campaign created by the coastal commission this year used posters with images of cigarette butts on a beach alongside phrases like \u201cFlicked along Highway 5\u201d or \u201cFlicked along L Street.\u201d\u201cMost people have understood for some time the damage cigarettes can do to human health,\u201d Eben Schwartz, the coastal commission\u2019s marine debris program manager, said in a statement. \u201cWhat we are trying to shed more light on is the incredible harm they cause in our environment as well.\u201dCalifornia Today is edited by Julie Bloom, who grew up in Los Angeles and attended U.C.

{"Headline": "In Backing Autonomous Cars, U.S. Tells Automakers to Figure It Out", "Date": "2016-09-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe Obama administration\u2019s approach to hands-free driving is remarkably hands-off.The one firm requirement: Make sure those cars are safe. Otherwise, federal officials have warned, the government will exercise its right under current regulations to pull them off the road.The policy is designed to \u201ccreate a path for a fully autonomous driver with different designs than what we have on the road today,\u201d Mark Rosekind, head of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, said at Washington news conference on Tuesday. \u201cIf you look at the policy, it provides that path.\u201dAutomakers on Tuesday welcomed the hands-off approach.\u201cYou can\u2019t get locked into one technology or approach, and it doesn\u2019t seem like they are doing that here,\u201d said Brad Stertz, director of government affairs at Audi of America, the German automaker\u2019s United States arm. \u201cThey want to have the flexibility to allow the technology to evolve and evolve in the safest way.\u201dDavid Strickland, a former administrator of the federal safety agency who is now general counsel for the Self-Driving Coalition for Safer Streets, a group that includes Ford Motor, Google and Uber, said the administration\u2019s policy set a framework that should allow manufacturers to \u201cpull this technology together in an expeditious way.\u201dDespite their multitude of sensors and processors, autonomous cars have a lot of trouble with some everyday aspects of driving.The guidelines, which stop short of formal regulations, have been more than a year in the making.All along the question of safety has hovered over the discussion, particularly as automakers and technology companies have put more test vehicles onto public roads. Google, for example, has logged roughly two million miles of testing with its driverless cars. Uber recently began using a test fleet of autonomous cars for its ride-hailing service in Pittsburgh.More intense scrutiny came this summer after the disclosure that Joshua Brown was killed in Florida when his Tesla Motors car, with its Autopilot system engaged, crashed into a tractor-trailer at highway speed.The Autopilot system, which uses cameras and radar to scan the roadway and can steer Tesla vehicles with little help from the driver, failed to recognize the truck and data showed that neither it nor Mr. Brown hit the brakes before the impact. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration is investigating the crash to determine if any safety flaws exist in the Autopilot mode.The accident put a spotlight on semiautonomous systems that can take over many of the driving duties but require human drivers to remain alert and ready to take control at a moment\u2019s notice. As soon as this week, Tesla is expected to download new software onto its vehicles that will include improvements to Autopilot.And yet, several parts of the 116-page policy, address safety issues highlighted by the Tesla crash.Semiautonomous driving systems, the policy says, must take into account the fact that distracted or inattentive drivers may fail to retake control, and the systems could be considered \u201can unreasonable risk to safety and subject to recall.\u201dAfter Joshua Brown, 40, of Canton, Ohio, was killed driving a Tesla Model S in the first fatality involving a self-driving car, questions have arisen about the safety of the car\u2019s technology.Mike Ramsey, a research director at Gartner Group who focuses on auto technology, said the Transportation Department probably did not add such statements because of the Tesla accident. But the language \u201cclearly affects\u201d the company, he said.\u201cOther companies are rolling out Autopilot-like systems, so it\u2019s not just Tesla they\u2019re talking about,\u201d he said.Tesla says Autopilot is not meant to be a fully autonomous driving system, although YouTube videos have shown some owners driving with no hands on the steering wheel and performing other stunts while the system is active. Tesla cars warn drivers to keep their hands on the wheel and eyes on the road while using Autopilot. The company has said the new version will be even stricter in that regard.Tesla said on Tuesday that it was not ready to comment on the new federal guidelines.Whether the guidelines will become formal policy is uncertain. Automakers and any other interested parties have 60 days to comment to the Transportation Department, a period that will not end until after the presidential election on Nov. 8. A new administration could modify, rework or scrap the guidelines.But the policy received strong backing from auto safety advocates, who pointed out that more than 34,000 people died in auto-related accidents in 2015.\u201cAutonomous technology and especially driverless cars can absolutely be game-changers,\u201d Colleen Sheehy-Church, the national president of Mothers Against Drunk Driving, said on Tuesday. \u201cAutonomous vehicles could potentially stop most traffic deaths in our country.\u201dThe push for autonomous vehicles is also supported by those who see self-driving cars as a new means of transportation for the disabled, the elderly and others who are unable to drive.Eric A.

{"Headline": "Samsung to Recall 2.5 Million Galaxy Note 7s Over Battery Fires", "Date": "2016-09-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHONG KONG \u2014 A ubiquitous source of power in most modern technology, lithium-ion batteries keep cellphones, laptops, electric cars and airplanes running. They are also the source of many problems, with some overheating, catching fire and even exploding.In a potentially damaging episode, Samsung, the world\u2019s biggest maker of smartphones, announced on Friday that it would recall its Galaxy Note 7 model after discovering a flaw in the battery cell that could result in fires. The company will replace 2.5 million phones sent to stores and consumers, in one of the industry\u2019s largest recalls.The recall puts Samsung, which has been trying to match the success of the Apple iPhone, in a precarious position.The smartphone industry is grappling with slowing demand and intense competition. Samsung was regaining swagger with its high-end phone models, like the Note 7, in which the screens appear to spill off the side.But the battery fires threaten to undermine Samsung\u2019s efforts, giving an edge to Apple. The recall comes just days before Apple is expected to unveil the latest version of its iPhone.The ultimate scale of the damage to Samsung\u2019s reputation and finances will depend on how quickly the company deals with the issues and how costly they turn out to be. Along with the expense of fixing the phones, Samsung could face lost sales if consumers grow wary of its products.Samsung said it expected that manufacturing replacement phones would take two weeks. Consumers who have already bought the phones will receive replacements before new phones go on sale, the company said. Samsung did not indicate the cost of the recall.\u201cIf you look at previous instances in tech history where there have been recalls, as long as it doesn\u2019t drag on to the point that the company becomes the butt of a joke, then it should be minor,\u201d said Bryan Ma, an analyst at IDC, a technology research firm.\u201cIf it becomes like a Pinto, where you don\u2019t want to buy it because it explodes, that would be a bad situation,\u201d he said, referring to the 1971 Ford car that became famous for erupting in flames after rear-end collisions. \u201cBut I think they\u2019ll get past it.\u201dSamsung said that, so far, 35 battery episodes involving the Note 7 had been registered. Reports of the problem first started to emerge online, as consumers posted photographs and videos of the charred remains of phones they said had burst into flames, usually while being recharged.Samsung said it thought the problem came from a \u201cminute flaw\u201d in the production of the batteries. Samsung would not name the supplier involved.The recall covers 10 countries where the phones have been sold. Samsung said the recall would not affect China, since the models sold there used a battery from a different supplier.\u201cWe acknowledge the inconvenience this may cause in the market, but this is to ensure that Samsung continues to deliver the highest-quality products to our customers,\u201d the company said in a statement. \u201cWe are working closely with our partners to ensure the replacement experience is as convenient and efficient as possible.\u201dThe recall is a major blow to Samsung, which had just started to regain its competitive footing. The company faces pressures across its product line, with Apple on the high end and new Chinese brands on the lower end.Samsung was gaining traction with the latest Galaxy phones. The phones\u2019 smooth, tapered edges, which make them more comfortable to hold, have been a hit with consumers.In the second quarter, Samsung\u2019s global smartphone sales rose 5.5 percent from a year earlier while Apple\u2019s fell 15 percent, giving Samsung 22.4 percent of the market compared to Apple\u2019s 11.8 percent, according to IDC. While some of that growth came from Samsung\u2019s lower-end phones, IDC said that a significant part had also come from new demand for its higher-end phones, which contributed a disproportionate amount of profit.Samsung had high expectations for the latest Galaxy phone, which was released last month, to help continue the momentum.The Note 7 is 5.7 inches from corner to corner, making it a large phone sometimes referred to as a phablet \u2014 a combination of phone and tablet. It sells in the United States for about $900 to $1,000 without subsidies from a wireless carrier.The phones were released just ahead of Apple\u2019s traditional release time in autumn, before the important holiday shopping season. Apple is set to show off its latest iPhone on Sept. 7. With the new iPhone, Apple is expected to make major upgrades to both the hardware and software, as it generally does every two years.\u201cYou have to applaud Samsung for moving quickly,\u201d said Ben Wood, mobile analyst at CCS Insight in Berlin. \u201cBut they can\u2019t afford to miss the run up to the holiday season, so they have to fix this problem fast.\u201dLightweight and powerful, lithium-ion batteries are the go-to for technology, since they don\u2019t take up much room and can quickly recharge repeatedly without wearing out. But they are also far from perfect.The batteries, which include volatile and flammable chemical compounds, can become unstable if overheated or punctured. If that happens, the battery can burst into flames or explode.More recently, battery problems have cropped up with increasing frequency among lower-end devices. In America, airline companies began banning hoverboards from flights after it became apparent that some of the products would occasionally burst into flames. There have also been increased reports of e-cigarette batteries spontaneously detonating.Analysts, in part, attribute the issues to the low standards and few regulations in the global electronics supply chain that sprawls across China. As smaller Chinese companies have jumped at opportunities to make their own devices, some have cut corners, leading to a number of problems, including the occasionally combusting battery.For Samsung, the recall strikes at the heart of what has long been considered its greatest strength: its management of the supply chain.Samsung owns the facilities that produce many of the components in its smartphones \u2014 including screens, chips and batteries. The system allows it to keep closer tabs on production.Yet much like Apple, Samsung also manages a large network of suppliers.That means it must coordinate the production of a high number of parts that come from factories in disparate places run on tight margins. It must also double-check the quality of each product, which can be exceptionally challenging given that production processes are complex and factories are sometimes known to sacrifice quality for profit.\u201cWhat\u2019s surprising is this comes from Samsung, who have such prowess and competence in manufacturing and supply chain,\u201d Mr. Ma of IDC said. \u201cYou would think this wouldn\u2019t happen to a company like that, but somehow it slipped through.\u201dPaul Mozur reported from Hong Kong and Su-Hyun Lee from Seoul, South Korea.

{"Headline": "Elon Musk Says Pending Tesla Updates Could Have Prevented Fatal Crash", "Date": "2016-09-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTesla Motors is readying improvements to its Autopilot technology that might have prevented an accident in May that took the life of an Ohio man, Tesla\u2019s chief executive said on Sunday. The man was killed when his Model S car driving in Autopilot crashed into a tractor-trailer.The improvements, to be released in the next week or two, include changes that require drivers to refrain from taking their hands off the steering wheel for long periods and more precise use of radar to recognize potential obstacles in the road.In a conference call with reporters, the head of Tesla, Elon Musk, said he believed the upgrades would have prevented the accident on May 7.\u201cThese things cannot be said with absolute certainty, but we believe it is very likely that, yes, it would have,\u201d he said. The new version of Autopilot, with its improved radar, \u201cwould see a large metal object across the road\u201d and be able to determine that the object is not an overpass or overhead road sign that poses no threat, he said. \u201cImpact probability would be assessed as high and it would probably brake.\u201dOne major change is that improved radar becomes Autopilot\u2019s main system for scanning the road. Once the update is made, Autopilot will use images from cameras to supplement the radar system. The current system uses cameras as its primary source of images, and relies on radar to help confirm what the cameras see.Tesla has come under scrutiny since the crash, which took the life of Joshua Brown, 40, an entrepreneur. He was traveling at 74 miles an hour on a highway near Williston, Fla., and the car\u2019s Autopilot system failed to recognize a white truck crossing its path against a bright sky. Data from the car showed that neither Mr. Brown nor the Autopilot system activated the brakes before impact.Tesla has previously suggested that the accident resulted from the driver\u2019s failure to remain in control of the vehicle. Autopilot warns drivers to keep their hands on the steering wheel and their eyes on the road while the system is engaged.After Joshua Brown, 40, of Canton, Ohio, was killed driving a Tesla Model S in the first fatality involving a self-driving car, questions have arisen about the safety of the car\u2019s technology.Mr. Musk added that Tesla had explained the coming improvements to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, which is investigating the crash to determine if it resulted from any safety defect in Autopilot.\u201cThey appear pretty happy with these changes,\u201d he said. \u201cThe reaction was quite positive, but I don\u2019t really want to speak for them.\u201dMr. Musk also suggested that the improvements could negate the possibility of the safety agency\u2019s calling for a recall. \u201cThe word \u2018recall\u2019 does not make sense because this will be an over-the-air update,\u201d Mr. Musk said, and owners will not be required to bring their cars to Tesla for the upgrade.The upgraded version of Autopilot, known as Version 8, will give drivers more frequent warnings to put their hands on the steering wheel at moderate and higher speeds. If a driver is warned three times within an hour to put his hands on the wheel, the Autosteer feature will not resume unless the driver stops the car, shuts off the engine and then restarts it.In stop-and-go traffic, at speeds under 8 miles an hour, drivers can still keep their hands off the wheel almost indefinitely, Mr. Musk said. At speeds up to 45 miles an hour, they will be warned after a few minutes, and more frequently if the road turns or curves, or if there are other cars on the road ahead, he said.Other refinements enable the system\u2019s radar to identify objects and obstacles more precisely, including by bouncing radar waves under a car in front of a Tesla vehicle, enabling Autopilot to detect obstacles that may not be visible to drivers.\u201cI think it will be a dramatic improvement in the safety of vehicles,\u201d Mr. Musk said. He added, however, that technology advances are unlikely to eliminate road accidents completely.\u201cPerfect safety is really an impossible goal,\u201d he said. \u201cThere won\u2019t ever be zero fatalities. There won\u2019t ever be zero injuries.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Your Car\u2019s New Software Is Ready. Update Now?", "Date": "2016-09-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWheelsTIRED of your vehicle and its aging, limited features? Don\u2019t trade it in just yet. Download new software instead.In some cases, that is already possible. And over the next few years, as the already extensive software on modern cars becomes even more feature-rich and upgradeable, manufacturers mean to step up the effort. They plan to offer many types of improvements or repairs through downloads that are beamed directly to the car via satellite, Wi-Fi or cellular signal, without the vehicle\u2019s having to be brought into the shop.Eventually, your car will be serviceable like a giant smartphone, with new features added periodically while you sleep.A leading proponent of the approach is Tesla, the maker of electric luxury cars, which has been sending updates to its cars\u2019 operating systems since 2012. The company is expected to announce an updated operating system next week. The chief executive, Elon Musk, has said via Twitter that the update will include improvements to the company\u2019s Autopilot automated driving system.But Tesla is by no means alone in the download department. General Motors has been offering services and upgrades via the cellular-delivered OnStar entertainment and roadside-assistance system since 2009. G.M.\u2019s Acadia sport utility vehicle can now receive new apps for its entertainment system over the air.Other manufacturers, including BMW, Mercedes-Benz and Volvo, send wireless uploads to update various in-vehicle apps, including maps and entertainment offerings like Spotify and Pandora.The number of vehicles on United States roads that can accept infotainment software upgrades will increase to 34 million in 2022 from one million now, the consulting firm IHS Markit predicts.\u201cThe advantages for automakers of doing over-the-air updates are too great to ignore,\u201d said Egil Juliussen, automotive analyst for IHS Markit. \u201cThey can keep their functionality up-to-date and get rid of bugs.\u201dTesla\u2019s upgrades have included an updated digital instrument panel, a revised touch screen, faster acceleration, activation of Autopilot and the ability for the vehicle to enter and exit a garage without anyone being in the car.\u201cSoftware updates to my Tesla are like Christmas,\u201d said Ankur Pansari of San Francisco. \u201cWhen I get them, I have a new toy to play with.\u201dAnd the automaker can save money. With cars and trucks increasingly reliant on complex computer code to operate, manufacturers can cut costs if they can correct or improve a vehicle\u2019s functions without having to get the car into a dealership.In November 2013, Tesla issued a software update to electronically raise the ground clearance of the Model S after a vehicle\u2019s battery pack caught fire when it ran over an object. A subsequent update gave the driver the ability to change the clearance at will.\u201cSoftware updates are extremely important to me,\u201d said another Tesla owner, Scott Wolf, a software engineer in Naples, Fla. \u201cKnowing there are new features and they can fix the car without having to bring it in \u2014 that\u2019s very impressive for an owner.\u201dFord, which previously provided software updates to its Sync infotainment system using a USB memory stick, will soon send software uploads to deliver Apple CarPlay and Android Auto functionality to its 2016 models equipped with its Sync 3 infotainment system. CarPlay and Auto replicate certain iPhone and Android smartphone features on the vehicle\u2019s display.Ford delivers the updated software via Wi-Fi, installing it when the vehicle is restarted. The company will eventually switch to making updates via satellite.Sending uploads will enable Ford to reduce the number of versions of its software. Instead of creating baked-in variants for each country, for example, Ford will be able to upload interfaces in different languages.\u201cWe absolutely believe in the promise of software updates,\u201d said Don Butler, Ford\u2019s executive director of connected vehicles.Manufacturers are also looking at software downloads as a new source of revenue, turning on features remotely if the owner pays a fee. It would be similar to the way most new cars come with the hardware for SiriusXM satellite radio but require owners to pay a subscription fee.Tesla has already incorporated fees-for-features into its business model. While late-model Tesla vehicles are equipped with cameras and sensors to enable semiautonomous driving, this feature \u2014 Autopilot \u2014 requires a $3,000 to $3,500 software download to make it work.Owners of the Tesla S60 are also able to increase their vehicle\u2019s range by about 40 miles if they pay Tesla $9,000 to activate the feature through a software download.Other automakers see similar opportunities. \u201cThere are potential situations where one could buy a Ford with a base configuration, and then we could deliver an update for an \u00e0 la carte fee, or on a subscription basis,\u201d said Mr. Butler of Ford.Jason Hughes, a Tesla Model S owner and computer programmer in Hickory, N.C., did not like the speed restrictions and the need to keep his hands on the wheel that Tesla requires when Autopilot is used on the streets.Hacking into the software, Mr. Hughes removed those safeguards. Tesla declined to comment on whether such activity would void an owner\u2019s warranty. But Mr. Hughes runs the risk of having the restrictions restored when the next update is beamed down.A direct communications link between an automaker and its vehicles means the company has the capability not only to upgrade software but to monitor vehicle systems as well. Location, driving style and serviceability can all be tracked.Since May, G.M. has offered its optional Smart Driver technology to the three million customers who own vehicles with 4G wireless capability. The system tracks and analyzes driving characteristics, suggesting ways to improve fuel economy and reduce wear and tear. The company will also suggest that drivers with strong scores seek insurance discounts.Remote software updates will become particularly crucial as vehicles become more capable of driving themselves.\u201cSoftware upgrades will be almost mandatory once we move up to higher forms of autonomous driving,\u201d said Richard Wallace, a director at the Center for Automotive Research. \u201cThe artificial intelligence underpinning self-driving will require constant upgrading to deal with novel situations.\u201dIn the future, vehicle manufacturers might even refuse to assume liability for an autonomous vehicle that causes a crash but whose owner did not bother to accept an upgrade, said Lars Reger, the chief technology officer at NXP Semiconductors, a supplier to the automotive industry.For all the issues and opportunities posed by the upgradeable car, one business consideration might seem crucial for automakers: Will the ability to continually improve features and performance make the idea of buying a new car less enticing?Here, too, the smartphone analogy could prove apt, carmakers say.\u201cUltimately, satisfied customers will want an ongoing relationship with us,\u201d said Mr. Butler of Ford. \u201cAs with an iPhone, at some point the hardware will no longer be upgradeable. It\u2019s part of the world we live in.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Can Tesla\u2019s Autopilot Be Trusted? Not Always", "Date": "2016-09-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byReviewLOS ANGELES \u2014 Driving a Tesla Model S with Autopilot technology can be frightening and exhilarating.Exhilarating, because when you are behind the wheel of a vehicle that can steer itself and will brake and accelerate when necessary, it\u2019s easy to glimpse the future of transport, when fully autonomous driving becomes the norm.But Autopilot also gave me trepidation, as I wondered if the vehicle would indeed make that curve, or slow in time to avoid hitting the car that had come to a sudden stop in front of me. Fortunately, it succeeded, most of the time. And when there seemed room for doubt, I was able to apply my own human intervention.The issue of \u201chandoff\u201d \u2014 whether a person can safely resume control quickly enough \u2014 has been a topic that Tesla\u2019s critics have seized upon. In my Autopilot test drives, I have been too nervous to be lulled into complacency. And in least one case, it was a good thing I was paying attention.Mine have been only test drives, in a car lent by the company. Last month I tried the original version of Autopilot. This week I used the updated version that Tesla has begun uploading to vehicle owners as part of a software upgrade.My wife found \u201cfreaky\u201d \u2013 in a good way \u2013 the \u201csummon\u201d feature on Autopilot old and new, which enables the car to enter and leave the garage without a person in the vehicle. My grandchildren, who were along for the Autopilot test drives, screamed in delight when I took my hands off the wheel as the car steered itself on winding city streets and curving freeways.With Autopilot engaged in the stop-and-go traffic endemic to Los Angeles (mostly stop, much less go), driving became much less strenuous. Gone is the constant braking and accelerating, as the car stays in lane and, with its active cruise control, slows and speeds up to keep you creeping along.When I drove with Autopilot last month, the older version gave me periodic reminders \u2014 a small pop-up visual warning on the display screen and an audible chime \u2014 to put my hands back on the wheel. But once I did, the warning disappeared, and I could once again remove my hands until the next warning a few minutes later.This feature is where the new Autopilot may be most discernibly different. The company has said it made the warnings more emphatic in an effort to avoid the sort of fatal crash that occurred in May.In that accident, a Tesla operating in Autopilot mode on a Florida highway plowed full speed into a tractor-trailer that had turned in front of it. Evidently, neither the driver nor the automated system recognized the hazard. The new version is meant to force the driver to pay attention \u2014 or at least keep hands on the wheel.The updated Autopilot, at freeway speed, will visually and then audibly warn you to place your hands on the wheel, if it senses they are off. If you need to be reminded with three audible warnings within an hour, the Autopilot system disengages and remains that way until the car is next restarted.The visual warning has been enhanced, too. Besides the pop-up alert on the screen, the entire perimeter of the instrument panel pulses a warning in white light.When you are puttering along at a few miles per hour in heavy traffic, though, the warnings, by design, do not come on at all.The other big Autopilot change is potentially more significant in terms of technology. To help the car sense things like a tractor-trailer on a Florida highway, Tesla says it has made Autopilot less reliant on the vehicle\u2019s cameras, putting more of the onus on the radar system.Something more sophisticated than my test drives would be required to gauge the effectiveness of that change. But whether because of the new radar emphasis, or for other reasons, I did find that the automatic braking and steering seemed more precise and less abrupt with the updated Autopilot. Before, the car seemed to slow long after I would have started to brake; now, it seems more suitably cautious.Yet, both before and after the upgrade I found anomalies in the Autopilot operation.Several times, as I drove in the freeway fast lane with Autopilot engaged, the Tesla began to veer toward the center divider. That happened even though the lane markings, which are supposed to guide the system, were clearly visible. In each case, I steered the car back toward the center of the lane, automatically disengaging Autopilot.At other times, I found that the vehicle made more minor steering corrections to stay in lane than I would have done if I were in control. If the lane stripes were slightly out of alignment, the car moved to the left or right to follow them, apparently not sensing that they would straighten out 10 or 20 yards ahead.Tesla says Autopilot is designed primarily to work on limited-access roads such as expressways. But the system also works on standard city streets, with or without center dividers, as long as lane markings are visible.On city streets, Tesla intends the system to be used in bumper-to-bumper traffic. Autopilot does improve that type of driving, as the car can control speed and frequent braking better than a bored, irritated human.But on in-town streets when traffic is flowing, I found Autopilot to be much more erratic. On a road that curved about 90 degrees, I twice found the car heading straight for the curb. Tesla told me that\u2019s because Autopilot was not designed to steer into such tight curves. And after the road straightened, the Tesla decided it should veer into the left turn lanes that opened up at the intersection, even though I wanted to go straight.On a straight section of road that slightly widened at one point, the Tesla headed for a parked car. Autopilot did not disengage, but the forward sensors sounded an audible warning indicating that I would need to manually hit the brakes. Good thing I was paying attention.It is clear to me that Autopilot is no substitute for an engaged driver. That, Tesla says, is the point it has made all along, no matter how dare-devilish its most adventuresome car owners might be. And with the new version of Autopilot, Tesla has integrated that message more fully into the system.But if a driver needs to stay engaged, with one\u2019s hands on the wheel and eyes on the road while using Autopilot, what is the purpose of the technology?Autopilot clearly helps in stop-and-go traffic, significantly reducing driver fatigue. And maybe, as Tesla contends, Autopilot can help a responsible driver avoid accidents.But in normal, full-speed traffic conditions, if the driver must be ready to retake control at any time, Autopilot would not seem to have much utility, especially on shorter drives when fatigue or boredom are less likely.Autopilot is an awe-inspiring demonstration technology, pointing the way to a full autonomous driving future. But drivers who think they now own a self-driving vehicle are sadly, and perhaps dangerously, mistaken.Advertisement"}

The first few chapters of \u201cA Truck Full of Money: One Man\u2019s Quest to Recover From Great Success\u201d have the sound of a glossy business-magazine hagiography \u2014 so much so that readers may wonder why the book isn\u2019t blushing.Decency? Generosity? Why, this man has them in spades. He\u2019d need a whole wall of shelving to fit all that decency and generosity. And brains! Well, for those he\u2019d need to sprout a second head.But it\u2019s a mistake for Mr. Kidder to strike such a gushing tone as he introduces us to this man. There\u2019s been far too much slobbering over barons of the new economy in the last 15 years for readers to understand that this narrative may be slightly different.If Mr. Kidder was hoping for an airport business-book best seller, I don\u2019t think this is it.There is, however, an element of Mr. English\u2019s story that\u2019s quite striking, one that makes \u201cA Truck Full of Money\u201d feel very much like a Tracy Kidder book.In his 20s, Mr. English was told he had bipolar disorder. For a long time, he kept his diagnosis a secret. But today, he is wonderfully open and courageous about it.Many of Mr. Kidder\u2019s subjects are coiled with enough energy to launch a missile, of course, but Mr. English has a psychiatric diagnosis to go with it. The questions Mr. Kidder raises \u2014 Are Mr. English\u2019s manic spells responsible for his entrepreneurial boldness? Or does he succeed in spite of them? \u2014 are well worth probing, and Mr. Kidder\u2019s portrayal of living with manic depression is as nuanced and intimate as a reader might ever expect to get. On a good day, Mr. English\u2019s mind is gaily swarming with bumblebees. On a bad one, though, he\u2019s \u201cGulliver imprisoned by the tiny Lilliputians, laid out on his back, tied to the ground with a web of tiny ropes.\u201dMany of the features of Mr. English\u2019s biography fit a familiar pattern. He was a low-achieving student with a high-watt intelligence. He discovered computer programming in middle school and was instantly smitten; today, he thinks fluently in layers of code \u2014 \u201ceach hanging from the one above, like a Calder mobile\u201d \u2014 and his brain is a regular popcorn maker of ideas. (Though some kernels never open: Among the domain names Mr. English purchased years ago was Snapcab, which predated Uber by five years. He never did a thing with it.)But the high-amplitude sine curve of manic depression has also complicated Mr. English\u2019s life in all kinds of unforeseen ways.When he\u2019s \u201con fire\u201d (his term), he grows irritable with the slow dial-up connection of other people\u2019s brains. He exaggerates. He slurs his words. His ideas range from extremely creative to flat-out wackadoo. (One, which he partly fulfilled, was to create Blade, a business incubator by day and psychedelic disco by night. The disco part didn\u2019t quite take off.) And he spends his money on the darnedest things: He once bid $500,000 on an abandoned lighthouse in Boston Harbor and instantly regretted it. Someone, thank heavens, bid more.But one of the more admirable aspects of Mr. English\u2019s character is his attitude toward money. He grew up without it, in a family of nine in South Boston. His modest roots could have made him jealously guard his millions with his life. But he quickly realized that giving them away \u2014 to the homeless in his native city, to the sick and dispossessed in Haiti \u2014 was a great form of therapy, which he\u2019s self-aware enough to admit: \u201cI knew that one way to get rid of any depression was to do something for somebody else.\u201dOver the years, Mr. English has tried a Lazy Susan of medications to subdue his highs and avert his lows. Many left him feeling listless and without affect.

When sunshine fades or the wind dies down, so does the power they generate.A total reliance on renewable energy will require a major expansion of the utility\u2019s capacity to store energy for use at other times. To get there, officials said they are looking at least in part to the promise of batteries.For the moment, however, battery systems remain too costly to help integrate renewables on a large scale, government agencies say. To get around that problem, Los Angeles is counting on time.Just as solar panels have leapt in efficiency and plummeted in price, so goes the hope for batteries.\u201cWe\u2019re seeing the technology get better and get less expensive with each passing year,\u201d said Mr. Bonin, the council member. \u201cSo we want to be able to sort of look forward and plan for what we think is coming.\u201dSan Francisco, hills and all, is a cyclist\u2019s city.On Monday, the editors of Bicycling magazine gave a shout-out to city leaders for making it a safer place to ride, ranking it the country\u2019s No. 2 \u201cbike city.\u201dChicago took the top spot, a triumph credited to Mayor Rahm Emanuel\u2019s effort there to add 100 miles of bike lanes.This year, San Francisco moved up five places since the last survey in 2014.The magazine said the city had added miles of bike lanes, installed 800 new bicycle racks and experienced a surge in ridership.Other California cities were well represented down the rankings, with Oakland coming in at 21, Los Angeles 24, San Jose 26, Long Beach 28, Sacramento 37 and Thousand Oaks 49.California Today is edited by Julie Bloom, who grew up in Los Angeles and attended U.C.

It\u2019s obviously terrible for everyone whose information has been breached, and it also comes at a terrible time for Yahoo, which is in the process of selling most of its assets to Verizon. What happens to that sale, now, seems in question; this sort of disclosure could affect aspects of the deal, including the price. After all, although Yahoo has long been in decline, the company still has a loyal user base that has stuck with it for email and other web services. To the extent that those people are scared away by this breach, Verizon may well want to reconsider.What do you think? Are the endless Yahoo acquisition talks going to get even more endless now?But it\u2019s unclear how that might affect the price of the deal, or if Verizon will walk away from Yahoo. Hackings now happen all the time and to almost every corporate entity. So Verizon couldn\u2019t very well build in an escape clause on a deal for an industrywide problem, though it may have some leverage to chip away at price or some other deal conditions.All I know is that a horde of lawyers and investment bankers must be getting well paid right now to figure it all out.I suspect that like me, you\u2019ve noticed a huge change in Silicon Valley recently. From Uber to Tesla to Google to Apple, much of the industry has become obsessed with cars. Where we used to talk about smartphones and apps, we now talk about electric engines, location mapping and ride sharing.I\u2019m personally gratified to see this happening; cars are expensive, inefficient and environmentally problematic, exactly the sort of big challenge that techies want to fix. But I\u2019ve also heard grumbling both inside and outside the Valley that companies here are biting off more than they can chew in attacking the auto industry. Do you agree?Did I really just say that? Eyeroll.Finally, let\u2019s talk about my favorite pastime, Twitter. Several big things happened with the slow-growing 140-character social network. First, the 140 characters got a bit looser. As of this week, when you add images, links or other multimedia elements to your tweet, they won\u2019t count against the character limit. In other words, tweets got just a bit longer.These deals are something of a strategy shift for the company. It\u2019s looking to become a kind of TV network, the place you\u2019ll turn to first when you want to watch something. I think this is a great idea. Livestreaming sports, awards shows and other news events can be a hassle today \u2014 you\u2019ve got to find a link, usually log in with your cable-company account, and then you\u2019re often presented with some slow, blurry stream that makes you tear your hair out. Twitter, thankfully, is trying to solve this. It could be pretty handy.But it also seems a little bit of an odd game plan to save the company, right?But for now at least, I don\u2019t see it. The 13-year-olds are into Snapchat, Instagram, Pinterest, even Musical.ly. Twitter? Not on their radar screen.Maybe Twitter needs to try something else, like making money off how brands use it for customer service. That sounds incredibly enterprise-y, but those boring businesses are often more predictable and profitable.Google isn\u2019t surprising. We\u2019ve heard rumors for years that the search company, which has perennially failed at building social apps, is interested in the microblogging network. But an acquisition by Salesforce is a stranger idea. I don\u2019t immediately get how it would work, and there\u2019s a very high chance that a business-focused cloud company could ruin the freewheeling network. But if Salesforce thinks of some out-of-the-box way to use Twitter as a customer service and lead-generation network, that could be lucrative.Anyway, thanks for joining me! I hope you spend the weekend bracing for Mike\u2019s return. That\u2019s what I\u2019ll be doing.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Apple Kicks the Tires at McLaren", "Date": "2016-09-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBreakingviewsMcLaren\u2019s cars travel fast, but rumors about Apple acquisitions can flash by, too.Apple approached McLaren, which is based in Britain, about an investment or purchase, according to The Financial Times. The $610 billion Apple, though, has made few acquisitions, even to help it pioneer smartphones. While McLaren is a high-tech supercar and Formula One business, it is still hard to see it taking Apple\u2019s vehicular ambitions far.Apple executives might enjoy such a bauble. The design guru Jony Ive has a penchant for Aston Martins and Bentleys. Eddy Cue, head of software and services, sits on Ferrari\u2019s board. But Apple\u2019s typical market is far bigger than the rarefied one for $1 million automobiles. And the technology of designing racecars does not trickle down very fast \u2014 BMW retains an aura of tech leadership and refinement despite dropping its Formula One team years ago.Over the last year Apple, based in Cupertino, Calif., has, according to reports, sniffed around the electric-car maker Tesla Motors, the entertainment giant Time Warner, the video-streaming site Netflix, the music service Tidal, the camera maker GoPro and the software producer Adobe. The spread of technology, Apple\u2019s lack of hit new products and its giant cash hoard \u2014 more than $230 billion \u2014 explain why both outsiders and some insiders might fancy and even start exploring all kinds of options.Perhaps the promise and challenges of autonomous electric cars will force Apple to change its habits. Even the dedicated carmaker Tesla, for example, used a Lotus-produced chassis and body for its first model. But the simpler explanation probably applies. Fancy can run free when a company has so much cash. A McLaren deal is probably already no more than a dot disappearing over the horizon.Advertisement"}

And Mr. Moonves has the chops to fix struggling cable networks like MTV and the movie studio Paramount Pictures.The trouble is keeping both sets of shareholders happy. If CBS bought Viacom at a price 25 percent above the market value of its shares, a Reuters Breakingviews analysis in June showed that the $3.5 billion present value of synergies estimated at $500 million a year, less tax, would fail to cover the premium. Looked at another way, the return on investment would not leave any buffer over the companies\u2019 cost of capital.War has spread across the empire of Sumner Redstone, one of the entertainment industry\u2019s most tenacious titans. At stake are the fortunes of his family and confidants, as well as the fate of Viacom and CBS.Viacom\u2019s recent weakness has shifted the math slightly in CBS\u2019s favor since then, but the numbers still do not make a strong case. National Amusements might instead promote a merger with no premium \u2013 after all, its interests make the price of any deal something close to a zero-sum game. But Viacom\u2019s owners would probably balk at that.There may be middle ground. For example, an all-stock purchase of Viacom by CBS at a 10 percent premium could work, with Viacom shareholders owning 40 percent of the combined company and sharing in the upside of any magic that Mr. Moonves can unleash. Such a balancing act would involve potential conflicts of interest for the Redstones, though, and the risk that shareholders of one company \u2014 or both \u2014 would feel badly treated.Elon Musk, the entrepreneur with big investments in both Tesla Motors and SolarCity, is struggling with similar potential conflicts in his efforts to merge them into a sustainable-energy combo.

{"Headline": "Self-Driving Cars Gain Powerful Ally: The Government", "Date": "2016-09-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Federal auto safety regulators on Monday made it official: They are betting the nation\u2019s highways will be safer with more cars driven by machines and not people.In long-awaited guidelines for the booming industry of automated vehicles, the Obama administration promised strong safety oversight, but sent a clear signal to automakers that the door was wide open for driverless cars.\u201cWe envision in the future, you can take your hands off the wheel, and your commute becomes restful or productive instead of frustrating and exhausting,\u201d said Jeffrey Zients, director of the National Economic Council, adding that highly automated vehicles \u201cwill save time, money and lives.\u201dThe statements were the most aggressive signal yet by federal regulators that they see automated car technology as a win for auto safety. Yet having officially endorsed the fast-evolving technology, regulators must now balance the commercial interests of companies including Tesla, Google and Uber with concerns over public safety, especially in light of recent crashes involving semiautonomous cars.The policies unveiled on Monday were designed to walk that line. In a joint appearance, Mr. Zients and Anthony Foxx, secretary of the United States Department of Transportation, released the first guidelines, which outlined safety expectations and encouraged uniform rules for the nascent technology. The instructions signaled to motorists that automated vehicles would not be a Wild West where companies can try anything without oversight, but were also vague enough that automakers and technology companies would not fear overregulation.The new guidelines on Monday, which stopped short of official regulations, targeted four main areas. The Department of Transportation announced a 15-point safety standard for the design and development of autonomous vehicles; called for states to come up with uniform policies applying to driverless cars; clarified how current regulations can be applied to driverless cars; and opened the door for new regulations on the technology.The 15-point safety assessment covers a range of issues, including how driverless cars should react if their technology fails, what measures to put in place to preserve passenger privacy, and how occupants will be protected in crashes. The points also include how automakers should approach the digital security of driverless vehicles, and how a car can communicate with passengers and other road users.The agency also urged driverless-car manufacturers to show how their technology is validated and how they would share data collected by the vehicles. The Department of Transportation also said it would assert its authority to recall semiautonomous and fully autonomous vehicles that it found to be unsafe.But the guidelines weren\u2019t nearly as specific as the safety requirements imposed on standard human-driven vehicles today.\u201cWe left some areas intentionally vague because we wanted to outline the areas that need to be addressed and leave the rest to innovators,\u201d said Bryan Thomas, a spokesman for the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.Tesla plans as soon as this week to download new software to its cars. The company\u2019s chief executive, Elon Musk, has said the new software would include improvements to Autopilot that could have avoided the fatal accident in May.Despite their multitude of sensors and processors, autonomous cars have a lot of trouble with some everyday aspects of driving.The federal government\u2019s embrace of driverless technology has accelerated since 2013. That year, the Obama administration waded cautiously into driverless car safety for the first time by issuing some definitions for the technology and pledging more safety research. By early this year, the president had wholeheartedly taken to the technology, proposing about $4 billion in the federal budget for driverless car research and development over 10 years.Karl Brauer, senior editor at Kelley Blue Book, an auto research and valuation company, said the new guidelines struck a balance between ensuring safety as automakers develop self-driving cars and making sure the introduction of lifesaving technology is not delayed unnecessarily.\u201cWe are in this weird transition,\u201d Mr. Brauer said. \u201cIt\u2019s a tough balance for the regulators. You want to get this technology out, but you don\u2019t want to move too quickly.\u201dCurrently, driverless cars face a patchwork of state regulations. In the last three years, about a dozen states have introduced laws that specifically address testing of driverless vehicles. Most laws require a licensed driver to be in the car.Mr. Foxx said states would continue to regulate the licensing of drivers and insurance. But he affirmed the agency\u2019s oversight of the software technology used in driverless cars.After Joshua Brown, 40, of Canton, Ohio, was killed driving a Tesla Model S in the first fatality involving a self-driving car, questions have arisen about the safety of the car\u2019s technology.\u201cWhat we are trying to do is avoid a patchwork of state laws,\u201d Mr. Foxx said.Google, Uber and Lyft, through a trade association in which they are members, also hailed the guidelines. \u201cState and local governments also have complementary responsibilities and should work with the federal government to achieve and maintain our status as world leaders in innovation,\u201d said David Strickland, general counsel for the trade group, Self-Driving Coalition for Safer Streets.Consumer advocates said they were encouraged that the government\u2019s efforts would advance safety laws and pressure companies that have operated largely in secret. But the groups also said the guidelines might result in weaker state laws.\u201cWhat I fear is that there are some really good state regulations that might get tamped down or pre-empted,\u201d said John Simpson, a director at Consumer Watchdog, a nonprofit group that has pushed for greater federal enforcement of the industry.Over all, the government\u2019s endorsement will speed up the rollout of autonomous cars, experts said, potentially within the next five years.\u201cIt helps companies by providing some cover. If a car crashes, courts may look to these guidelines to help us determine what was reasonable and not,\u201d said Bryant Walker Smith, a professor at the University of South Carolina.Large automakers in particular have made big strides in the technological development of driverless cars but have been wary of introducing those features too quickly without the backing of federal regulators.\u201cBig companies love certainty and targets that they need to aim for,\u201d said Brad Templeton, a consultant and publisher of Robocars.com.Neal E.

What is a lithium-ion battery?What are they used in?Chances are you encounter these on a daily basis. They are in smartphones, laptops, electric cars, airplanes and even e-cigarettes. Of course, the ones in airplanes and cars are much larger than those used in phones.What is the problem with lithium-ion batteries?To ensure that the lithium-ion particles can move easily between electrodes, volatile and flammable chemical compounds are pressurized inside battery cells. The problem is that when a battery is charged and recharged, it generates heat. If that heat is not controlled properly, it can cause the compounds inside the battery to burst into flames or even explode. Those compounds can become similarly unstable if something punctures the battery cell.Samsung said it thought the problem came from a \u201cminute flaw\u201d in the production of the batteries. One theory was that a part inside the battery was coiled incorrectly, causing more stress.What does the recall cover?Samsung says it will replace phones in 10 countries where the device is sold and that it will take about two weeks to manufacture the replacements.What other products have had issues with the batteries?If the batteries are problematic, why do companies continue to use them?Battery technology has been slow to advance, largely because the products must pass rigorous safety testing. Lithium ion has proved to be low-cost and easily reproducible. And over all, they are pretty safe.

In that accident, there was no sign that the driver or Autopilot had applied the brakes before the car collided at high speed with a tractor-trailer that had turned in front of it.Despite their multitude of sensors and processors, autonomous cars have a lot of trouble with some everyday aspects of driving.Although Tesla learned of the Florida accident a few weeks after it happened, it did not publicly disclose it until late June, when the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration announced it was investigating the crash.News of the Chinese crash will renew questions about when the company should disclose information about accidents in cars equipped with Autopilot and what information should be shared.\u201cBecause of the damage caused by the collision, the car was physically incapable of transmitting log data to our servers, and we therefore have no way of knowing whether or not Autopilot was engaged at the time of the crash,\u201d a Tesla spokeswoman, Alexis Georgeson, said in the company\u2019s statement. \u201cWe have tried repeatedly to work with our customer to investigate the cause of the crash, but he has not provided us with any additional information that would allow us to do so,\u201d she said of the car\u2019s owner, Mr. Gao\u2019s father.She said Tesla was saddened to learn of the death of Mr. Gao. \u201cWe take any incident with our vehicles very seriously and immediately reached out to our customer when we learned of the crash,\u201d she said.Tesla and Autopilot have been under scrutiny since the disclosure of the May fatality. That crash killed Joshua Brown, 40, whose 2015 Model S was traveling 74 miles per hour when it collided with a tractor-trailer that had turned left and was crossing a highway near Williston, Fla. Autopilot\u2019s radar and cameras failed to recognize the white truck against a bright sky.The changes include refinements in Autopilot\u2019s radar that improve its ability to spot and identify obstacles down the road and additional warnings to force drivers to keep their hands on the steering wheel and eyes on the road while the system is active.Tesla has said Autopilot is not meant to take over completely for a human driver. When Autopilot is turned on, drivers are given audio and text warnings to remain alert and engaged while using it.The video of the January accident indicates the type of unexpected problem that can crop up at highway speeds. Critics of Autopilot say a driver can be lulled into complacency, leaving too little time to take back control of the vehicle.Mr. Gao was traveling in the left lane of a three-lane highway with another car ahead of him. When the car ahead moved into the center lane, it revealed the orange truck, which was straddling the road\u2019s left shoulder. Mr. Gao\u2019s car never slowed before plowing into the truck.Police investigators concluded that Mr. Gao was responsible for the accident, CCTV reported. But in July his family sued the dealer who had sold the Tesla.The driver\u2019s father, Gao Jubin, told CCTV he thought his son had been relying on Autopilot to drive the car and so was not watching the road when the crash took place.The lawsuit was filed \u201cto let the public know that self-driving technology has some defects,\u201d the family\u2019s lawyer said in the report. \u201cWe are hoping Tesla, when marketing its products, will be more cautious. Don\u2019t just use self-driving as a selling point for young people.\u201dCao Li contributed research from Beijing.Advertisement"}

Apple still very much has a hold on the Chinese consumer, but many may well wait another year to see what Apple does for the 10th anniversary of the iPhone, when there may be more of a wow factor.That said, a part of me thinks the new wireless headphones could be a hit in China. More so than a new iPhone, they broadcast that a user is willing to drop a solid chunk of change to keep up on tech trends. That formula has worked well for Apple in the past in China, though it would have helped if they made the AirPods in gold and rose gold options.What else is going on in Chinese transportation business that you think Americans should know about?I do also think we could see some political issues crop up as the technology is more widely used. The Chinese government will want to give its local companies a leg up and it has also been uncomfortable letting foreign companies collect data within China and beam it elsewhere, so it could be we see some roadblocks go up to foreign autonomous driving technology down the line.So, what do you think? How bad is this for Samsung?There was an editorial in the Korean newspaper, the Chosun Ilbo, faulting Samsung for the technological mistakes that led to this issue. Certainly that matters, but it seems a bit beside the point. With the supply chain as complex as it is, mistakes will occasionally happen. The thing that Samsung can control, and should do better at, is communicating with its customers.So anyway \u2026 have a good flight back!Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Tesla Upgrades Autopilot in Cars on the Road", "Date": "2016-09-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTesla Motors, always ahead of the automotive curve, is conducting a remarkable technological feat.Starting this week and continuing in the coming days, the company is using the cellular network to beam new software to update the Autopilot driver-assistance system on approximately 70,000 of its cars. Tesla\u2019s ability to communicate with its vehicles to download major enhancements and fixes, much as Apple updates iPhones, is beyond the capability of other automakers.But then, no other automaker has an on-the-road system as experimental as Autopilot, or perhaps the need to make midcourse corrections to such a fundamental feature of its vehicles.The company has described the Autopilot update as intended to avoid the sort of errors that contributed to a Tesla owner\u2019s fatal crash in May on a Florida highway. The most evident change might be visual and audible reminders that drivers should keep their hands on the steering wheel.It is an implicit scale-back of the company\u2019s original promotion of Autopilot, introduced last October, as essentially a self-driving car system. At the time, Elon Musk, Tesla\u2019s chief executive, said Autopilot was \u201cprobably better than a person right now.\u201dBut the company also acknowledged then that Autopilot was also only a beta system \u2014 a technical term for an experimental version. As such, the update now underway is a tacit acknowledgment that the self-driving-car experiment Tesla has been conducting on the public highways is still very much a work in progress.\u201cThey\u2019re able to take a risk and put a system out that they admit wasn\u2019t fully baked,\u201d said Mike Ramsey, a research director at the Gartner Group. \u201cBut they have this ability to improve it. It\u2019s much more of a software mind-set. You get it out there and then you do software patches to fix the bugs.\u201dThe approach, Mr. Ramsey added, comes with some risk. \u201cYou have live human beings in there,\u2019\u2019 he said, \u2018\u2018so you can debate whether that\u2019s the best way to do it.\u201dTesla declined to comment for this article.The policy guidelines do raise concerns about semiautonomous systems that \u2014 like Autopilot \u2014 are designed to perform many of the driving duties but still require human drivers to stay alert and be ready to take control at a moment\u2019s notice. Otherwise, the technology could be considered \u201can unreasonable risk to safety and subject to recall.\u201dAnthony Foxx, secretary of transportation, said at a news conference this week that the new guidelines were not aimed at Tesla. But the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration is still investigating the Florida accident.The question now is how just how new and improved Autopilot actually is \u2014 and whether a software download is sufficient to address what Tesla\u2019s many critics say are the inherent shortcomings of the autonomous driving system.One of those perceived drawbacks is Autopilot\u2019s assumption that an attentive driver can and will take over control of the car in the event of an emergency. Researchers at other companies at work on self-driving cars \u2014 including Ford Motor and Google \u2014 have concluded that this so-called handoff can never happen quickly enough to be fully safe.After Joshua Brown, 40, of Canton, Ohio, was killed driving a Tesla Model S in the first fatality involving a self-driving car, questions have arisen about the safety of the car\u2019s technology.The new Tesla software, called Version 8.0, also makes a significant change to the way Autopilot scans the road and recognizes objects. The previous version depended heavily on the forward-looking camera to sense surroundings. In the fatal Florida collision, the camera did not see a white tractor-trailer against a bright sky.The new version of Autopilot relies more heavily on the car\u2019s radar to identify other vehicles and potential obstacles, and to decide when to steer to avoid a problem or apply the brakes.The elevation of radar might seem a modest difference. But it runs counter to the widely held view that radar, while highly accurate in measuring distance, is less precise in determining the shape and size of objects.\u201cI\u2019m not completely sure how Tesla is able to recognize and classify objects\u201d with radar, said Jeremy Carlson, a senior automotive analyst at the forecaster IHS Markit. \u201cI think it\u2019s clear there are changes in the new software in the radar sensor that are doing something in a very different way.\u201dOther automakers argue that cameras are better at recognizing and classifying objects.\u201cRadar is good at telling the distance to an object but not very good at recognizing what it is,\u201d said Hideki Hada, general manager of Toyota Motor\u2019s integrated vehicle systems group in Ann Arbor, Mich. \u201cCameras can tell what an object is, but it\u2019s not so good at telling the distance. So you need both.\u201dDespite their multitude of sensors and processors, autonomous cars have a lot of trouble with some everyday aspects of driving.Companies at work on fully self-driving cars contend that conventional cameras and radar are not sufficient to enable a vehicle to sense and respond to its surroundings. They plan to incorporate an additional technology: a laser-powered type of radar called lidar.Tesla argues that its current technology is adequate for Autopilot\u2019s purposes. But in a Sept. 11 conference call announcing the upgrade, Mr. Musk acknowledged the challenge of using radar to identify objects.The world, he said, looks \u201cweird\u201d in radar. Metal objects, because they strongly reflect radar waves, can appear larger than they are. Wood and plastic can appear \u201cas transparent as glass.\u201d Radar sensors tend to give \u201cfalse positives\u201d \u2014 instances when they think the car should brake when it actually doesn\u2019t need to.The new Autopilot software has algorithms to adjust for radar\u2019s distortions, according to Mr. Musk. And if the radar sees a large, dense, metal object \u2014 like a truck \u2014 the radar sensor can slow or brake the car, even if the camera system can\u2019t identify the object, he said.Mr. Musk predicted that the new Autopilot system was \u201creally going to be beyond what people expect\u201d and would make the Tesla Model S sedan and the Model X sport utility vehicle \u201cby far\u201d the safest cars on the road.Mr. Ramsey, the research director at Gartner, noted that Tesla was able to release Autopilot last year without having committed to a crucial engineering question \u2014 Is the radar or the camera the primary sensor? \u2014 knowing the company could modify and improve it later.\u201cThey can take a risk like that,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s what makes them truly distinct from other automakers.\u201dWhether public experiments are the best approach to highway safety is another matter. \u201cI\u2019m sure they are very confident the cars are safe,\u201d Mr. Ramsey said, \u201cbut they are kind of doing trial and error.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "How Tesla and Apple Could Be Good for Each Other", "Date": "2016-09-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBreakingviewsGreat partnerships are often forged when each party enjoys a surplus of something the other needs, and there\u2019s little conflict in their ambitions. By that logic, two of Silicon Valley\u2019s best-known firms, Apple and Tesla Motors, really need each other right now. An investment in Tesla by Apple in return for some of the carmaker\u2019s innovation dust might be just the ticket.Timothy D. Cook, Apple\u2019s chief executive, is revamping the company\u2019s approach to self-driving cars and its broader role in the future of transportation. He just fired some of the company\u2019s autonomous car team, according to The New York Times.At Tesla, the founder, Elon Musk, needs billions of dollars of capital as he ramps up the company toward its target of making 500,000 vehicles a year by 2018. He could also use an injection of corporate credibility as his proposed deal to buy his solar-panel venture SolarCity, also publicly traded, appears to be running into unanticipated headwinds.The idea of Apple acquiring Tesla in its entirety isn\u2019t new. It surfaced even before Mr. Cook poached some of Mr. Musk\u2019s engineers a year ago. That move prompted Mr. Musk to tell a German newspaper: \u201cIf you don\u2019t make it at Tesla, you go work at Apple.\u201d But it might not require a full purchase to address the strategic challenges of the two companies \u2014 which, arguably, are each becoming most prominent in areas where the other could fairly easily help.Mr. Musk\u2019s hurdles are the most obvious. The entrepreneur who runs the $30-odd billion Tesla is struggling to persuade investors of the merits of his plan for Tesla to acquire SolarCity. The deal, worth $2.6 billion when announced in early August, is supposed to create a \u201cvertically integrated sustainable energy company.\u201d Last week the deal was publicly panned by James S. Chanos, a prominent hedge fund manager. By the math of the all-share deal, its market-implied chances of success have been falling, too. Shares of SolarCity closed on Monday nearly 25 percent below Tesla\u2019s offer price.The acquisition and the potential conflicts it throws up are a distraction for Mr. Musk from Tesla\u2019s carmaking ambitions, not to mention from the task of proving the safety of the company\u2019s Autopilot feature after a fatal crash in May. Even if investors decide to back him in buying SolarCity, any slippage in either company\u2019s plan could hurt its ability to hit up investors for additional funding. Both need regular cash injections \u2014 over $2 billion each last year \u2014 to fund operating and capital investment outflows.Apple could easily address Tesla\u2019s capital problem by buying, say, a 20 percent stake. While dilutive to existing owners \u2014 including Mr. Musk, who owns about 21 percent \u2014 that would bring in nearly $8 billion at $215 a share, just under a 5 percent premium to Monday\u2019s market closing price.For Apple, with more than $230 billion of idle cash, the investment would be close to a rounding error. Its shareholders would probably rejoice at converting a sliver of money in the bank for a placeholder in an emerging leader in self-driving cars. Unlike a full purchase, buying a minority stake will not dilute Apple\u2019s profitability, either. The company has projected gross margins of around 38 percent in its next fiscal quarter.Now, what could Tesla do for Apple? With a market capitalization north of $600 billion, Mr. Cook\u2019s business is doing fine at the moment. Shares of the company have gained some 5 percent since the iPhone 7 was unveiled earlier this month. Pre-orders for the new handset have been robust despite reviews that largely called it an incremental advance on its predecessor. Features like wireless earbuds are novel, but hardly game-changing.Many analysts, investors and observers want Apple to develop more new products. Its last big product introduction, of watches, was a relative dud. Since the devices went on sale in April 2015, Apple\u2019s shares have fallen 8 percent, and investors fret that the company has been running short of new ideas. At the same time, shares of Alphabet, Google\u2019s parent, have rallied by nearly 50 percent.One area in which Alphabet appears to be further ahead is self-driving vehicles. Apple doesn\u2019t talk publicly about its plans in the car business, but earlier this month it fired dozens of staff members and closed parts of its so-called Titan project, focused on autonomous cars.Ideas are something Mr. Musk has in abundance. In addition to running Tesla and creating SolarCity, he\u2019s trying to make a going concern of space travel and freight through Space Exploration Technologies, or SpaceX. In his spare time, he also hatched the Hyperloop, an idea to use air pressure to speed human beings through tubes at extraordinary speeds.In that respect, he resembles Steven P. Jobs. Even when Apple was in its relative infancy in 1986, its co-founder bankrolled the creation of Pixar, the animation studio. For two decades, that side project put him in conflict with some of the media companies whose content would become a key attraction for iPhone users. In 2006, a year before introducing the handset that changed the world, Mr. Jobs sold Pixar to Disney for $7.4 billion in stock; Disney put him on its board.With competition no longer an issue, Mr. Jobs became a consigliere to Disney\u2019s boss, Robert A. Iger, who told Fortune after the Apple founder died: \u201cWe would stand in front of a whiteboard and talk about ideas. And every once in a while he\u2019d come to me thinking the sky\u2019s falling apart and that our business was screwed. And I\u2019d say, \u2018Tell me how.\u2019\u201dThat sort of relationship would probably be hard to develop between a chief executive and a subordinate \u2014 one argument against Apple swallowing Tesla whole. But as a collaboration, with shared goals and running businesses that work together rather than competing for talent and customers, a functional Cook-Musk partnership might serve both companies\u2019 shareholders.As part of the deal, Apple could fold its wobbly car operations into a joint venture with Tesla, add a couple of directors to Tesla\u2019s board \u2014 helping to handle deals with the likes of SolarCity \u2014 and bring Mr. Musk onto its own. Of course, the two executives would have to be capable of playing nice. Mr. Musk might have to walk back his crack last year that Apple was the \u201cTesla graveyard.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Lawyers Burnish Tesla\u2019s Deal for SolarCity", "Date": "2016-09-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDeal ProfessorThe lawyers have grabbed control of the merger between Tesla Motors and SolarCity. They are blanketing the deal with legal process to try to smooth over the conflict of interest stemming from Elon Musk\u2019s ownership interest in both companies. But will it be enough?The background to the transaction is probably the most important, and certainly will be the most scrutinized, part of the document. In this case, three new disclosures were quickly seized upon, none of which were actually the most important disclosure in the document.The first was that Mr. Musk had discussions in February 2016 with the chief executive of SolarCity about an acquisition. These discussions were not disclosed in a subsequent $1.4 billion stock offering in May before the acquisition offer was made public.The failure to disclose this information led some to ruminate that Tesla had violated federal securities laws and its requirement that all material information be disclosed when stock is sold. Tesla\u2019s stock dropped about 15 percent after the offer, showing a necessary element for a securities fraud claim for nondisclosure, namely a large stock price drop.In this case, although this was a big transaction, the probability of it happening was highly uncertain at that time, with only one discussion having occurred. Tesla\u2019s lawyers sought to highlight this fact by noting in the filing that \u201cthis discussion never progressed beyond a high-level, conceptual stage, and no proposal was made at such time\u201d \u2014 an important caveat.The second disclosure was that Lazard had made a $400 million mistake in its valuation of SolarCity. Oops. The adviser had become aware that SolarCity\u2019s indebtness was double-counted in its spreadsheets, undervaluing the company in its calculation by $400 million. That is a big number by any measure, even in a $2.6 billion deal.Luckily for Tesla and SolarCity, the error was caught before this filing. The way to fix this error is to add on more process, to make sure that it counts for nothing in the final calculus.And so the lawyers worked to clean it up, adding new board signoffs. Lazard redid its analysis, raising the company\u2019s valuation by $400 million, but still came in the range of a fair price. That\u2019s not so hard because SolarCity is a bit of a moving target in terms of valuation and its value is highly dependent on future events.Lazard found a value that ranged from $18.97 a share to more than $40 a share in its original, flawed analysis (the error moved the range up by $3 to $4 a share). With a range that wide, no wonder Lazard could find fairness.The boards of both companies ratified the changes, still finding the deal fair. And if shareholders approve the deal, SolarCity will argue that under Delaware law, the issue will resolve itself because of a recent decision that shareholders waive their right to bring lawsuits around mergers when there is disclosure before the shareholder vote and a takeover is approved. The plaintiffs\u2019 lawyers are not buying this, and one suit has already been filed in Delaware over this issue.But still \u2014 is this a problem for shareholders? Perhaps the price would have been higher if SolarCity had this information. But on the other hand, this valuation analysis was not likely to have been used in negotiations but for an after-the-fact justification of a price given in a fairness opinion. Given the wide range of values, it is doubtful that Lazard\u2019s analysis had much of a role in the actual price negotiation. And it highlights how meaningless valuation can sometime be, particularly with technology companies.The third piece of information everyone focused on in this filing was the enormous amount of cash both companies were burning. Tesla disclosed that $422 million would soon be due to debt holders, which may require a new equity issuance. SolarCity is burning cash and is down to $146 million. This is important, but it is probably not materially new to anyone. It is common knowledge that these companies burn cash and need more.The most important disclosure was missed \u2014 that the sale of SolarCity was scripted to textbook precision by the company\u2019s lawyers at Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom. The lawyers arranged the formation of a special committee that met on an almost daily basis since the approach by Tesla. I counted 25 meetings of the special committee in the six weeks between the announcement of Tesla\u2019s proposal and the deal.Not only did the SolarCity lawyers focus the decision-making on the special committee, they even negotiated for bells and whistles. Tesla proposed that there be no \u201cgo-shop\u201d period, a time for the target to solicit competing bids. SolarCity opposed this and successfully negotiated a go-shop provision, as well as a lower termination fee if a competing bid were accepted. And Mr. Musk signed a voting agreement, to boot.Reading this section, it\u2019s hard not to ask yourself one question: Who else was really going to bid? You can even imagine Tesla arguing against the go-shop provision, knowing that it would be nice to give up its stance so that the record could show heavier bargaining. But that is mere speculation.On the Tesla side, things were not so neat. No special committee was formed, and instead, Mr. Musk and Antonio J. Gracias, who served on the boards of both companies, were simply excluded from crucial parts of meetings. The reason given was their expertise. That is true. But one could also see how Mr. Musk might be a bit headstrong about being excluded.To be sure, Tesla\u2019s lawyers at Wachtell Lipton Rosen & Katz were careful to disclose in this document that any price discussion took place outside of Mr. Musk\u2019s presence. And there was vigorous negotiation of the deal price \u2014 at least on paper. For example, at one point the filing states that \u201cMr. Elon Musk then left the meeting, and the Tesla Board (with Messrs. Elon Musk and Antonio Gracias recusing themselves) discussed the negotiating strategy to be employed to obtain the acquisition price for SolarCity common stock most favorable to Tesla and its stockholders.\u201d And so on. The Tesla lawyers also tried to highly script the process through multiple meetings.It all seems like a pretty Japanese gift. The packaging is nice, but what is inside? The inside, of course, seems to be a deal where there is no other buyer and where Mr. Musk stands heavily on both sides of the deal, appearing to bail out a flailing solar company in which he happens to own a 21.9 percent stake. Or perhaps this is a deal where, once again, some just do not understand Mr. Musk\u2019s genius.Either way, the lawyers have done their best \u2014 kudos to them, I suppose. The document should be required reading for merger and acquisitions disclosure scripting.Now it\u2019s up to Tesla\u2019s shareholders, because in spite of the pretty process, SolarCity does not have anywhere else to go.An earlier version of this column referred incorrectly to Lazard\u2019s role in a miscalculated valuation of SolarCity. The adviser used figures of indebtedness that had been double-counted in SolarCity\u2019s spreadsheets. It was not responsible for the double-counting.Advertisement"}

This is a question I considered often while reading \u201cThe Last Days of Night,\u201d a novel by Graham Moore, the Oscar-winning screenwriter of \u201cThe Imitation Game\u201d and author of the 2010 novel \u201cThe Sherlockian.\u201d His new book is a thriller built around the so-called electricity wars fought over a century ago between the rival inventors Thomas Edison and George Westinghouse. Specifically, it explores Edison\u2019s attempts to drive Westinghouse (and his superior A/C current) out of business. Our way into the tale is the real-life lawyer Paul Cravath, a prodigy in his mid-20s hired by Westinghouse to defend his growing empire from Edison\u2019s attack.Cravath arrives as an underdog on the very first page. Hurrying to a meeting with Edison, he witnesses the horrific electrocution of a workman hanging power lines. Electricity, we are told, is a mixed blessing. Encountering the great inventor, Cravath is intimidated by Edison, who appears here as a \u00adsingle-minded bully: \u201c\u2009\u2018If you think you can stop me,\u2019 Edison said softly, \u2018go ahead and try. But you\u2019ll have to do it in the dark.\u2019\u2009\u201dAlong the way, Cravath meets a high-\u00adsociety chanteuse named Agnes Huntington (also a real person), who falls quickly into the role of his co-conspirator. Also on the scene are two other giants of the time, Nikola Tesla and J.P. Morgan, who play important, if very different, roles in the multifronted battle. The novel\u2019s action takes place against a backdrop rich with period detail. The late 1800s was a time when magical thinking was being replaced by wonder at the technological possibilities of the future, and Moore\u2019s satisfying romp draws on this shift as it builds to an unexpected (if you don\u2019t know the history) conclusion.The novel ends with an eight-page note from the author laying out in great detail exactly which parts of the novel happened as described and which did not. Out of necessity, the time frame has been compressed, the chronology of real events fudged and some incidents invented from whole cloth. None of this is surprising. \u201cThe Last Days of Night\u201d is, after all, a work of fiction. And yet knowing that the truth has been embroidered doesn\u2019t precisely explain the lack of \u201ctruthiness\u201d (to quote Stephen Colbert) I felt while reading Moore\u2019s book.I would argue that \u201cplot\u201d (which I define as the nature and order of events leading up to a story\u2019s conclusion) is a device invented by storytellers. The actions that people take, combined with the things that happen to them, are rarely as clean and clear in a novel or a movie as the ones we experience in real life. Thrillers and mysteries are often reverse engineered from their exciting conclusions as the author goes back in time, piece by piece, to lay in the twists and turns that will, when played forward, deliver the most spellbinding reading experience and build, seemingly without effort, to an unexpected finale.But the twists and turns of real life \u00adaren\u2019t always so neatly resolved; our lives are subject to a barrage of random forces. And so, in writing about historical events, authors tend to streamline, to throw out the pieces that don\u2019t add up, introducing new elements to enhance the narrative while clarifying the motivations of the players. In other words, everyone is made to row in the same direction.Paul Auster depicted the situation facing the writer in \u201cThe Invention of Solitude\u201d: \u201cA young man rents an apartment in Paris and then discovers that his father had hid out in this same room during the war. If these two events were to be considered separately, there would be little to say about either one of them. The rhyme they create when looked at together alters the reality of each. .\u2008.\u2008. But there is more to it than just rhyme. The grammar of existence includes all figures of language itself: simile, metaphor, metonymy, synecdoche \u2014 so that each thing encountered in the world is actually many things.\u201dIf I had one complaint about Moore\u2019s book \u2014 which works wonderfully as an entertainment \u2014 it\u2019s that it lacks this sense of the arbitrary and the sublime, the feeling that life is stranger and more unfathomable. \u201cThe Last Days of Night\u201d is a novel primarily concerned with a linear series of relevant events, and it has shaped those events to have a singular meaning. As a result, the reader is unable to suspend a feeling of disbelief as Moore\u2019s plucky underdogs scrap their way through various twists and setbacks while struggling toward their endgame. As it charges forward, the novel leaves no dot unconnected. And this makes its true story feel false.Noah Hawley, a screenwriter and producer, is also the author of five novels, most recently \u201cBefore the Fall.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "What It Feels Like to Ride in a Self-Driving Uber", "Date": "2016-09-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPITTSBURGH \u2014 I\u2019m parked on a patch of gravel outside the old Heinz ketchup bottling factory here early on a Monday morning, and I\u2019m frustrated. My Uber self-driving car will not start driving itself.The engineer in the passenger seat next to me, an Uber employee for all of three weeks who asked if I wanted to take a turn behind the wheel, chimes in to say I should turn the car off and start it again, as if rebooting a computer.In this case, my \u201ccomputer\u201d is a modified Ford Fusion hybrid sedan code-named Boron 6, an atomic element often found in magnets, laundry detergent and nuclear reactors. Uber has outfitted it with more than 20 cameras, seven lasers, a spinning 360-degree laser-based detection system and 1,400 other aftermarket parts that render millions of bits of data about the environment in real time as I drive through it. If the car works as advertised, someday neither I nor anybody else will sit in the driver\u2019s seat of a car again.During my ride, most of which I spent as a passenger in Boron 6\u2019s back seat, my safety engineer proved his worth. At various moments, he had to take over the wheel and turn through intersections where locals are known to speed. When a truck driver backed out into the road illegally, he put his foot on the brake, immediately taking control of the car.If the safety engineer felt unsafe, he could at any time smack down a big red button in the center console \u2014 suspiciously similar to a seat ejector switch from a James Bond film \u2014 to disengage from self-driving mode. To turn the self-driving feature back on, he need only press a sleek steel button next to an embossed nameplate stamped on the console.If I felt unsafe as a passenger, I could also request that the driver take over the vehicle, or press a button on a screen facing the back seat that would end the ride. I also monitored the infrared environment the car had rendered from the screen, a 3-D world updating in real time, and took a selfie from a camera built into the console. After the ride, Uber texts to passengers an animated GIF of the 3-D modeled route taken, along with the selfie.But for most of the ride, I felt safe. In self-driving mode, turns and stops were near seamless, and I often had to check in with my driver to see whether he or the computer was steering the car. I did grow a bit nervous a few times when watching how close the computer drove us to cars parked on the right side of a street. Though, admittedly, that could have been my mind playing tricks on me by being more vigilant than usual about my surroundings.Raffi Krikorian, engineering director of Uber\u2019s Advanced Technologies Center, located in the city\u2019s industrial Strip District, put it this way: \u201cPittsburgh is the double-black diamond of driving.\u201dThe challenge expressed in Mr. Krikorian\u2019s ski analogy is one that Uber has taken to heart. From the company\u2019s point of view, the self-driving vehicle operates more safely than any human driver.My driverless Uber stopped far behind cars in front of us at intersections. It stayed exactly at the speed limit \u2014 25 miles per hour where we drove \u2014 even when there was no traffic around. At one stoplight, the car waited for the green signal before turning right. The human drivers behind us were not pleased.As my ride in Boron 6 wound down \u2014 in total, I traveled roughly 20 miles in the vehicle \u2014 it was hard not to feel like a celebrity, or perhaps more like a Martian. Other motorists gawked, and a boy on a Razor scooter gaped at me from a corner, waving to his mother to come look.But how they will get rich from it remains unclear. Much of Uber\u2019s success has been based on the premise that people could share their idle cars with the public by driving during their spare time. A self-driving car obviates the need for human drivers, a clear source of tension among Uber drivers today. Company executives said self-driving cars would be only one part of Uber\u2019s business in the future, with a mix of drivers and autonomous vehicles.All of these companies face an uncertain regulatory environment for driverless vehicles that could impede the rollouts of the cars across the country.There will be delays and bugs, such as the one I encountered my first time behind the wheel when the self-driving car didn\u2019t drive itself. That\u2019s the whole point of the pilot test. The wealth of sensors and recording equipment will see what happens \u2014 warts and all \u2014 \u201cso we can learn more about what makes drivers and riders comfortable and safe,\u201d said Emily Duff Bartel, a product manager at the Advanced Technologies Center.For me, it took about 10 minutes of troubleshooting to work through the glitches, but Boron 6 eventually turned on and started driving itself. That is, after a little bit of human intervention.Because of an editing error, an earlier version of this article misstated when the Chinese government television news channel reported that a driver of a Tesla with autonomous features had been killed in a crash.

{"Headline": "A Lesson of Tesla Crashes? Computer Vision Can\u2019t Do It All Yet", "Date": "2016-09-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byJitendra Malik, a researcher in computer vision for three decades, doesn\u2019t own a Tesla, but he has advice for people who do.\u201cKnowing what I know about computer vision, I wouldn\u2019t take my hands off the steering wheel,\u201d he said.The Tesla accident in May, researchers say, was not a failure of computer vision. But it underscored the limitations of the science in applications like driverless cars despite remarkable progress in recent years, fueled by digital data, computer firepower and software inspired by the human brain.Researchers are training computers to recognize actions and behaviors.Today, computerized sight can quickly and accurately recognize millions of individual faces, identify the makes and models of thousands of cars, and distinguish cats and dogs of every breed in a way no human being could.Yet the recent advances, while impressive, have been mainly in image recognition. The next frontier, researchers agree, is general visual knowledge \u2014 the development of algorithms that can understand not just objects, but also actions and behaviors.Computing intelligence often seems to mimic human intelligence, so computer science understandably invites analogy. In computer vision, researchers offer two analogies to describe the promising paths ahead: a child and the brain.The model borrowed from childhood, many researchers say, involves developing algorithms that learn as a child does, with some supervision but mostly on its own, without relying on vast amounts of hand-labeled training data, which is the current approach. \u201cIt\u2019s early days,\u201d Dr. Malik said, \u201cbut it\u2019s how we get to the next level.\u201dIn computing, the brain has served mainly as an inspirational metaphor rather than an actual road map. Airplanes don\u2019t flap their wings, artificial intelligence experts often say. Machines do it differently than biological systems.If successful, the outcome could be a breakthrough in computer vision and machine learning in general, Dr. Poggio said. \u201cTo do that,\u201d he added, \u201cyou need neuroscience not just as an inspiration, but as a strong light.\u201dThe big gains in computer vision owe much to all the web\u2019s raw material: countless millions of online photos used to train the software algorithms to identify images. But collecting and tagging that training data have been a formidable undertaking.ImageNet, a collaborative effort led by researchers at Stanford and Princeton, is one of the most ambitious projects. Initially, nearly one billion images were downloaded. Those were sorted, labeled and winnowed to more than 14 million images in 22,000 categories. The database, for example, includes more than 62,000 images of cats.Vast image databases like ImageNet have been employed to train software that uses neuron-like nodes, known as neural networks. The concept of computing neural networks stretches back more than three decades, but has become a powerful tool only in recent years. \u201cThe available data and computational capability finally caught up to these ideas of the past,\u201d said Trevor Darrell, a computer vision expert at the University of California, Berkeley.Just how far neural networks can advance computer vision is uncertain. They emulate the brain only in general terms \u2014 the software nodes receive digital input and send output to other nodes. Layers upon layers of these nodes make up so-called convolutional neural networks, which, with sufficient training data, have become better and better at identifying images.Or take a fluid scene like a dinner party. A person carrying a platter will serve food. A woman raising a fork will stab the lettuce on her plate and put it in her mouth. A water glass teetering on the edge of the table is about to fall, spilling its contents. Predicting what happens next and understanding the physics of everyday life are inherent in human visual intelligence, but beyond the reach of current deep learning technology.Recognizing situations enriches computer vision, but the ImSitu project still depends on human-labeled data to train its machine learning algorithms. \u201cAnd we\u2019re still very, very far from visual intelligence, understanding scenes and actions the way humans do,\u201d Dr. Farhadi said.\u201cWe\u2019re not there yet, but the pace of improvement is getting us there,\u201d said Gary Bradski, a computer vision scientist who has worked on self-driving vehicles. \u201cWe don\u2019t have to wait years and years until some semblance of intelligence arrives, before we have self-driving cars that are safer than human drivers and save thousands of lives.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "SpaceX Rocket Explodes at Launchpad in Cape Canaveral", "Date": "2016-09-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA spectacular explosion of a SpaceX rocket on Thursday destroyed a $200 million communications satellite that would have extended Facebook\u2019s reach across Africa, dealing a serious setback to Elon Musk, the billionaire who runs the rocket company.The blast is likely to disrupt NASA\u2019s cargo deliveries to the International Space Station, exposing the risks of the agency\u2019s growing reliance on private companies like SpaceX to carry materials and, soon, astronauts.The explosion, at Cape Canaveral, Fla., intensified questions about whether Mr. Musk is moving too quickly in his headlong investment in some of the biggest and most complex industries, not just space travel but carmakers and electric utilities.\u201cSpaceX is running a punishing schedule,\u201d said Scott Pace, the director of the Space Policy Institute at George Washington University and a former NASA official.\u201cThere is probably some human factor involved here. To what extent was human error part of this? And if so, why? Are you running your people too hard? What are your safety requirements?\u201dDr. Pace said an internal investigation would have to look at the company\u2019s operations as it tried to ramp up the pace of launches.The company\u2019s president, Gwynne Shotwell, said in a statement, \u201cOur No. 1 priority is to safely and reliably return to flight for our customers, and we will carefully investigate and address this issue.\u201cThe Falcon 9 rocket burst into flames in a violent series of blasts starting at 9:07 a.m., spewing plumes of dark smoke around the Cape Canaveral Air Force Station and sending vibrations felt by residents nearby.The rocket had been set to launch on Saturday, carrying a satellite for Spacecom, an Israeli company.From Zip2 to OpenAI, a look at the entrepreneur\u2019s many companies.The explosion was particularly painful news for Facebook\u2019s chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, who is touring Kenya, promoting a program reliant on the satellite, known as Amos-6, with entrepreneurs in the country. He had promised them connectivity.The Falcon 9, developed by SpaceX with NASA financing, has had previous problems. In June 2015, a rocket carrying NASA cargo to the International Space Station fell apart in-flight when a strut holding a helium bottle snapped, setting off a chain of events that destroyed the rocket moments later. This latest episode is likely to push back the timetable NASA had after hiring SpaceX and Boeing to carry astronauts to the space station by the end of next year.NASA said it was too soon to say how the explosion would affect its space station operations, asserting that it remained \u201cconfident\u201d in its commercial partners. \u201cToday\u2019s incident \u2014 while it was not a NASA launch \u2014 is a reminder that spaceflight is an incredible challenge, but our partners learn from each success and setback,\u201d the agency said.SpaceX\u2019s next cargo mission to the space station is scheduled for November.Coincidentally on Thursday, a report released by NASA\u2019s inspector general, Paul K. Martin, said SpaceX and Boeing were likely to face additional delays in their launch schedules anyway.Launches with crews will probably not lift off before the second half of 2018, three years later than planned, the inspector general said.Changes that SpaceX is making to the design of the capsule, to allow landing in water instead of on land, are causing the latest delays, Mr. Martin said. In addition, NASA has been slow in examining safety reviews submitted by the companies, and as a result, late and costly redesigns might be needed, Mr. Martin said.Space industry experts say that Mr. Musk faces risks in balancing SpaceX\u2019s backlog of contracts \u2014 spanning the next few years \u2014 without cutting corners to stay on the company\u2019s busy schedule.SpaceX had hoped for 18 rocket launches this year; so far, eight have occurred. Over all, SpaceX has had 27 successful launches of Falcon 9 rockets.An episode like Thursday\u2019s is rare. Jonathan McDowell of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics in Cambridge, Mass., who tracks rocket history, said the last time such an explosion happened on a Cape Canaveral launchpad, before the ignition of engines for liftoff, was in 1959.SpaceX is rebuilding a separate launchpad, one of the two formerly used for NASA\u2019s space shuttle missions, for the astronaut launches. That launchpad is scheduled to be ready by the end of the year.Business analysts were mixed on the effects of the explosion on Mr. Musk\u2019s other investments at a time when he is under considerable financial pressure with the planned merger of Tesla and SolarCity.Mr. Musk draws vocal admirers and detractors, some of whom are \u201cshort\u201d investors betting that Tesla cannot execute on its business plan.Trip Chowdry, a senior analyst at Global Equities Research who studies Tesla\u2019s performance, described Mr. Musk\u2019s situation as a \u201cdouble-edged sword.\u201d\u201cWhen things work out well, people believe Musk to be a superstar,\u201d Mr. Chowdry said. But when things go wrong like an explosion at a separate company, Tesla investors tend to make more general inferences, too.\u201cWhen all is said and done, does it have any impact on Tesla stock? No,\u201d he said. \u201cBut events at SpaceX do create headline risk for Tesla stockholders.\u201dThe demise of the satellite, called Amos-6, puts a significant damper on Facebook\u2019s Internet.org initiative, a grand plan spearheaded by Mr. Zuckerberg to provide wireless connectivity to nations across the world that do not otherwise have easy internet access.On Thursday, Mr. Zuckerberg struck an upbeat tone in his post about the rocket failure, noting that the company has other strategies in the works to expand internet connectivity across the world. Aquila, the Facebook-built drone, he noted, recently undertook its first successful flight in the desert.Still, the setback will delay Facebook\u2019s ambitious plans and even more ambitious timetable.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Elon Musk\u2019s Solar Vision, Up for a Dicey Vote", "Date": "2016-09-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDeal ProfessorTesla Motors\u2019 proposed acquisition of SolarCity is most likely to come down to whether shareholders support Elon Musk in his vision of creating a solar power juggernaut. Yet the deal also raises broader issues of how and when shareholders should vote to approve acquisitions.Tesla\u2019s offer has been met with jeers on Wall Street. In an age when companies are spinning off businesses left and right to narrow their focus, the merger offer was a jarring counternarrative. Instead of focusing on a singular business, this would be a solar conglomerate.SolarCity is struggling, and it needs hundreds of millions in dollars in cash. Its biggest shareholder is also Mr. Musk, who happens to be Tesla\u2019s chief executive, founder and biggest shareholder. In this light, it was hard not to see this as a bailout by Mr. Musk of his own investment.On the other hand, Mr. Musk has successfully created two different, highly innovative businesses, Tesla and SpaceX, while actually having the idea for SolarCity, which he gave to his cousin, who helped found the business. For Mr. Musk and the shareholders who invested in his vision, this is a no-brainer, creating a one-stop shop for solar power. Not only that, but Mr. Musk seems keen on improving SolarCity\u2019s product. In the conference call after the deal announcement, he repeatedly emphasized making the panels more \u201cattractive\u201d so that they would improve a home\u2019s value.The question now is whether Tesla\u2019s shareholders will continue to buy into Mr. Musk\u2019s vision and vote for the deal.And Mr. Musk will be watching these proceedings from the sidelines: Tesla has said that the vote should be approved by a majority of the shareholders of Tesla other than Mr. Musk and his affiliates.This means that the Tesla shareholders who are rarely heard from will have the most important voice of all on whether the acquisition is approved.Shareholders can be finicky in exercising their franchise. But the Tesla deal shows the importance of having all buyers of significant assets hold a vote.In other countries, a vote for a buyer of significant assets is the norm and is legally required. The reason is simple. Buyers can lose their heads, overpaying in the heat of the moment. A shareholder vote serves as a check on this behavior, ensuring that the buyer pays more attention to market indexes. The downside of this is that the buyer loses nimbleness and is at the mercy of a sometimes fickle market.So who are the non-Musk Tesla shareholders? According to S&P Global Market Intelligence, mutual funds and other institutions own about 63 percent of Tesla\u2019s shares, and retail shareholders hold 15 percent. Mr. Musk has about 21 percent.The institutions will drive the vote, and they will be led by Fidelity, which owns 8.9 percent, Baillie Gifford & Company, with 8.8 percent, and T. Rowe Price, with 7 percent.These are the usual suspects in a shareholder vote. Yet their decision making is often opaque. In years past, the mutual fund industry was heavily dependent on Institutional Shareholder Services and other proxy advisory firms for recommendations on how to vote in mergers and acquisitions.I.S.S. is the big kahuna. Research shows that a negative recommendation on a merger from the advisory firm will shift the vote as much as 20 percent.That\u2019s a big number. But the question of how I.S.S. reaches its decisions has been in the public eye. The adviser issues a report and meets with all sides. Ultimately, I.S.S. will say that it reflects its clients\u2019 wishes and, presumably, canvasses them.In Tesla\u2019s case, I.S.S.\u2019s focus will most likely be on strategic fit, along with the liquidity and solvency risks. In other words, does Tesla have a need for cash in the near term that is more urgent than propping up a solar company for a long-term strategy? Ultimately, since I.S.S. is client-driven, the biggest factor may be whether big investors oppose the deal.In this respect, I.S.S. serves as a consolidator of opinion, funneling and acting as an intermediary.But that model is increasingly fractured. The big mutual funds have significantly expanded their internal teams to analyze merger situations. These funds still rely on I.S.S., but they also have their own independent review. For those who savagely criticize I.S.S. for leading mutual funds in groupthink, I suspect this alternative might not be the best development.Instead of trekking to I.S.S. to make their case, now, for every shareholder vote, companies have to seek out the big mutual funds.And how the mutual funds make their decisions is much less transparent than the proxy advisers\u2019. No fund I know of issues a report explaining and justifying each of its votes. Moreover, the governance teams at these mutual funds deal with thousands, if not tens of thousands, of votes every year. They are not going to spend significant time on many votes, though obviously the Tesla-SolarCity merger will receive a bit more attention than most.That means we are just not sure how these mutual funds will vote. Most funds simply vote \u201cyes\u201d automatically in nearly all situations. They may do so in this case.There are also governance issues, given Mr. Musk\u2019s ownership stakes in the two companies. Some funds may decide to oppose the merger because of what they perceive as conflicts of interest rather than on the merits of the deal itself.Then there are the retail shareholders. Many will not vote \u2014 receiving a proxy ballot in the mail and just throwing it out. But others will vote \u2014 and they will do so based on their own assumptions about Tesla being a hot stock or not. They will be more likely to follow what Jim Cramer and other retail investing figures say.Finally, there is the wild card of hedge fund arbitrageurs. A \u201cno\u201d vote on the Tesla deal will probably result in a pop in the stock price. And that will mean a quick profit. This will draw in those with incentives to vote \u201cno\u201d on the deal to try to grab that profit. How many will pile in? That remains to be seen as this deal wends its way through the process.But if a smart arbitrageur comes in with a theory for ending this deal and fixing the perceived governance deficits, then there is a path to defeat \u2014 one that pushes up Tesla\u2019s stock price. We saw something like this when Paulson & Company became involved with Mylan as it pursued Perrigo. You need a credible party to carry out this strategy.All of this highlights the often arbitrary and mysterious nature of shareholder voting on takeovers. Here is a vote that will determine the course of Mr. Musk\u2019s empire, yet we are in the dark about the deliberations of the shareholders casting their votes.It\u2019s a nice commentary on the pros and cons of today\u2019s shareholder democracy.

We\u2019ve seen him indulge airy suggestions that rifle-bearing Americans might like to shoot Hillary Clinton. We\u2019ve seen him belabor the lie that President Obama was not born in the United States \u2014 until he recanted. For Trump, the low road to the White House is paved with boorishness. But perhaps his son Donald Trump Jr. set the nadir this week when he compared Syrian refugees to a bowl of Skittles.A caption accompanying a photograph of the candy said: \u201cIf I had a bowl of skittles and I told you just three would kill you. Would you take a handful? That\u2019s our Syrian refugee problem.\u201d Trump Jr. tweeted, \u201cThis image says it all.\u201dWhere to begin? With the fact that human beings are not Skittles? With the fact that after more than five years of war 4.8 million Syrians are refugees and 6.1 million are internally displaced and Trump Jr., even with his coddled New York existence, can surely make the calculation that this amounts to almost 2.5 million more human beings than live in the five boroughs?With the fact that you do not flee your home because you have a choice (like choosing between Skittles and M&Ms after a Manhattan dinner party) but because you no longer have one? With the fact that, according to a Cato Institute study of refugees admitted to the United States between 1975 and 2015, the chance of an American being killed in a terrorist attack committed by a refugee is 1 in 3.64 billion? With the fact that Syrians want to work, make a living, put their kids in decent schools, and recover their dignity, just like the rest of us?Or perhaps with the fact that comparing Syrians to Skittles carries echoes of the Nazi propagandist Julius Streicher comparing Jews to mushrooms in a popular children\u2019s book that posited the ticklish dilemma of how to distinguish poisonous toadstools from edible fungus; and has a mother saying to her son Franz:\u201cYes, my child! Just as a single poisonous mushroom can kill a whole family, so a solitary Jew can destroy a whole village, a whole city, even an entire Volk.\u201dWe all know, even the Trumps know, that the door into the United States was closed to desperate European Jews trying to escape the Holocaust.If I may be pardoned for extending an awful analogy, I\u2019d suggest to the Trumps that a better caption would read: \u201cIf I had a bowl of Skittles and I told you just three of them would turn out to be Sergey Brin, Elon Musk and Pierre Omidyar, would you take a handful?\u201dThe co-founder of Google, co-founder of Tesla, and founder of eBay were all immigrants. Steve Jobs\u2019 biological father was a Syrian immigrant. In fact, earlier this year, the National Foundation for American Policy found that 51 percent of the country\u2019s start-up companies valued at over $1 billion had at least one immigrant founder. A study by the Partnership for a New American Economy, a coalition of governors and business leaders, found that in 2013 more than 40 percent of Fortune 500 companies, including seven of the world\u2019s 10 most valuable brands, were started by immigrants or their children.The strength of the United States is its creative churn. In contrast to European states, it is hard-wired to reinvention through immigration. When Trump traffics in fear about immigrants, whether Muslim or Mexican, he guts America of its greatness and turns his back on its singular idea.The American response to the Syrian crisis has been paltry \u2014 almost 12,000 refugees admitted since the war began, or 0.25 percent of the total. Part of the slowness has come from the rigor of the vetting process. But what do the Trumps care? They are concerned with just one message: Muslim equals danger.Let\u2019s see now. Trump\u2019s grandfather, Friedrich Trump, was a German immigrant. He arrived in the United States in October 1885. For decades, the family lied: They said he hailed from Sweden. In his book, \u201cThe Art of the Deal,\u201d Trump says his grandfather \u201ccame here from Sweden as a child.\u201d The family historian, John Walter, explained that Trump\u2019s father, Fred, \u201chad a lot of Jewish tenants and it wasn\u2019t a good thing to be German in those days.\u201dMake up stories: It\u2019s the Trump way. So here was a German-American posing as a Swedish-American opting not to rent to African-Americans.Friedrich Trump, the immigrant, was young. He was penniless. He came not from Sweden but from Bismarck\u2019s recently formed nation state in the middle of a turbulent Europe. A U.S. immigration officer allowed him into the United States in 1885 \u2014 not a decision without risk.But an American decision taken in the spirit the Trumps now trample with cavalier untruth and vile innuendo.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Big Carmakers Merge, Cautiously, Into the Self-Driving Lane", "Date": "2016-09-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWheelsWhen General Motors starts selling a new Cadillac sedan next year, it plans to equip the car with G.M.\u2019s answer to Tesla Motors\u2019 Autopilot.Like Autopilot, G.M.\u2019s SuperCruise feature will be designed to steer a car for long stretches of highway driving, pass other vehicles, brake for traffic, speed up and change lanes \u2014 all with minimal effort by the driver.There is one thing the G.M. system will force drivers to do, though, that Tesla\u2019s system does not: keep their eyes on the road.Unlike Tesla, G.M. has chosen to place a camera, near the rearview mirror, that monitors the driver\u2019s actions.Along with other mainstream automakers cautiously rolling out Autopilot-like capabilities, G.M. is unwilling to assume that human drivers will \u2014 or even can \u2014 be trusted to remain safely engaged in the vehicle\u2019s operation.The big carmakers hope to avoid the criticism that has enveloped Tesla\u2019s Autopilot \u2014 that the driver-assistance technology can lull the person behind the wheel into a mind-wandering sense of false security.\u201cThrough the driver\u2019s eyes, you can detect his or her level of attention,\u201d Mark Reuss, G.M.\u2019s executive vice president for global product development, said in July at an auto technology conference in Detroit.The monitoring system, which analyzes images of the drivers\u2019 eyes and head to tell if they are looking forward, will notice if drivers are drowsy, looking down at their cellphones or have turned to reach into the rear seat.If the driver does not turn back to the road after a few seconds, warning tones and lights go off. If the driver does not respond, SuperCruise can slow or stop the car, Mr. Reuss said.Audi, the German luxury carmaker, plans to add similar driver-monitoring technology next year when an upgraded version of its driver-assistance technology is offered in the 2018 A8 sedan.\u201cThe car will see the driver\u2019s condition and be able to say, \u2018O.K., you\u2019re paying attention and alert,\u2019 and then it can be engaged,\u201d said Brad Stertz, Audi\u2019s director of government affairs.As an added safeguard, the G.M. and Audi systems will work only on divided highways whose curves and exits have been plotted on digital maps, which enables cars to track their precise location on the road and on the three-dimensional surrounding terrain. The systems will also recognize objects like overpasses and road signs.Outside those digitally mapped areas \u2014 on winding country roads, say, or uncharted city streets \u2014 G.M.\u2019s SuperCruise and Audi\u2019s Traffic Jam Pilot will not operate.Such precautions are intended to prevent the kind of accident that has put Tesla and Autopilot under heavy scrutiny in the last few months.In May, the driver of a Tesla Model S was killed when his car collided with a tractor-trailer crossing a state highway in Florida. Autopilot was operating at the time and failed to recognize the white truck against a bright sky. Neither Autopilot nor the 40-year-old driver, Joshua Brown, hit the brakes.The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration is investigating to see if flaws exist in Autopilot, but Tesla has said the accident was at least partly a case of operator error.Even as G.M., Audi and other carmakers seek to adopt some of the capabilities of Autopilot, many experts say the concept has a basic flaw \u2014 the so-called handoff problem. These critics say too many experiments have shown that a person behind the wheel of a car that seems to be driving itself simply cannot respond quickly enough to take over in the instant the unexpected happens and the technology is not equipped to handle it.Despite their multitude of sensors and processors, autonomous cars have a lot of trouble with some everyday aspects of driving.That is why at least one major automaker, Ford Motor, and Google have each said they would skip driver-assistance systems and focus on future, fully self-driving cars that require no human intervention.\u201cIt\u2019s very difficult to have proper driver engagement,\u201d said Raj Nair, Ford\u2019s chief technical officer.Tesla, in contrast, is intent on sticking with the Autopilot approach but improving it.When Tesla introduced Autopilot last fall to much fanfare, the Silicon Valley company appeared to leap ahead of conventional automakers that have decades more experience in developing automobiles.The system and the way Tesla distributed it \u2014 by beaming software updates wirelessly to cars already on the road \u2014 fostered the impression that Silicon Valley, with its charge-ahead mind-set, was reinventing the auto industry for the digital age, while leaving the plodding, old-line carmakers behind.The contrast between Tesla\u2019s approach and the more cautious pace taken by traditional automakers reflects a \u201cclash of philosophies,\u201d said Amin Kashi, director of automated driving assist systems and automated driving at Mentor Graphics, which helps automakers design electronics systems.Mr. Kashi has experience in both worlds. He worked at Ford for 14 years before moving to Silicon Valley, and he has been at Mentor since April.Established automakers take a more conservative view of new technology and tend to have their own engineers refine and test it until it works as intended. The companies also typically hold clinics where they watch customers try new technologies to make sure it is easy to use and to discover how some might misuse it.\u201cSometimes, maybe, they are too careful,\u201d Mr. Kashi said. \u201cThat\u2019s something I didn\u2019t like at\u201d at Ford.Mr. Kashi said he was impressed by how quickly Tesla was able to speed ahead with Autopilot. Still, he said that while the \u201cnegative press\u201d Tesla has received over the Florida accident focused on \u201ccustomer misuse\u201d of Autopilot, it also shows the need to make sure customers understand the technology\u2019s limitations.Tesla warns drivers that Autopilot is not meant to be a fully autonomous system. When Autopilot is activated, the dashboard screen and audio alerts remind drivers to remain engaged and keep their hands on the steering wheel.But many Tesla owners, including Mr. Brown, the driver killed in Florida, have posted videos on YouTube showing it is possible to go several minutes without looking at the road or holding the wheel.Mercedes-Benz has just introduced a semiautomated driver-assist system in the new 2017 E-Class sedan that is similar to Autopilot but forces drivers to have their hands on the wheel more frequently. On an open highway, with few cars on the road, the system, Drive Pilot, might allow hands-free driving for up to a minute, said Bart Herring, general manager of product management at Mercedes-Benz USA. But in traffic, it sets off alarms after only a few seconds.\u201cWe love big leaps, but we don\u2019t make those until they\u2019re ready for prime time,\u201d Mr. Herring said.Audi has even further restrictions. The system it plans to release next year is meant to work only up to 35 miles per hour, to relieve the driver in stop-and-go traffic. Not until the next version, expected by 2020 or 2021, will the Audi system operate at highway speeds.\u201cWe feel it\u2019s important to walk along with customers as they get used to the technology,\u201d Mr. Stertz said.Both the Audi system and G.M.\u2019s SuperCruise also use radar sensors, cameras and lidar \u2014 a kind of radar based on lasers \u2014 to read the road and identify vehicles and pedestrians.Elon Musk, Tesla\u2019s chief executive, has said the company does not think lidar is necessary for a semiautonomous driving system like Autopilot. On Wednesday, he posted a Twitter message promising a software upgrade that would include improvements to Autopilot \u201cprimarily through advanced processing of radar signals.\u2019\u2019Many experts say lidar is better at identifying objects than radar. But it is more costly and does not see as far in front of the car as radar, a Tesla spokeswoman, Alexis Georgeson, said.Other big automakers are following an even more cautious pace than G.M., Audi and Mercedes. Honda and Toyota offer systems with radar, cameras and automatic braking that are intended to mitigate or prevent accidents. And a steering capability keeps their cars from drifting out of their lanes. But Honda and Toyota stop short of letting their cars drive themselves.\u201cWe have to be clear about the technology\u2019s limitations,\u201d said Jim Keller, a chief engineer at Honda R&D Americas. \u201cCustomers will find situations where the system won\u2019t work as they think it will, and there will be consequences.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "G.M. Spots an Airbag Problem and Moves Quickly to Respond", "Date": "2016-09-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byConcerns about automobile airbags lately have focused on ones that deploy too explosively or even spontaneously.This week, General Motors announced a major recall over the opposite problem: airbags that, in rare instances, might not deploy when they are supposed to.The company formally announced the recall on Friday, and said the fix involved a quick software modification that could be done by dealers. Customers do not need to receive a recall notice first to have the upgrade done. G.M. did not say how much the recall could cost.More notable may be how quickly G.M. and the government responded to the problem once the company became aware of it in mid-May.G.M. wasn\u2019t always so quick to remedy potential safety defects. It took a dozen years and at least 124 deaths before the company began to resolve a problem with an ignition switch that could cause cars to switch off while on the road, rendering their airbags inoperable.Eventually, G.M. paid $900 million to settle a federal criminal investigation related to the faulty ignition switches, set aside $575 million for a fund to compensate victims of switch-related crashes, and recalled 2.6 million cars.\u201cI think G.M. learned its lesson from the ignition switch and changed its behavior,\u201d Michelle Krebs, an analyst with the research site Autotrader.com, said on Friday.The sequence of events in the new G.M. recall and the relatively quick resolution is in contrast to the safety administration\u2019s dealings with the electric carmaker Tesla. That company also became aware in May of a fatality involving one of its vehicles; a man was killed when his Tesla Model S crashed while the car\u2019s Autopilot system was engaged.The safety agency is still investigating whether any faults in Autopilot were responsible. Tesla has so far stood by its technology, although an updated version of Autopilot is expected to be part of a software update the company has said will come soon.G.M.\u2019s safety engineers in May learned that one of its vehicles, from the 2014 model year, was involved in a crash in which the airbags failed to deploy. An investigation ensued and by last month, engineers had traced the problem to an electronic motion sensor that, under certain circumstances, can prevent airbags from inflating in a crash.The automaker on Friday said the electronics flaw was related to one fatality and other accidents that resulted in three injuries.How Tesla is responding to the accident involving Autopilot is less clear. Its chief executive, Elon Musk, said recently via Twitter that improvements to Autopilot are coming, but the company has released no details, and has not said whether any modifications will force drivers to remain more focused on the road than the current version suggests.On Friday, a Tesla spokeswoman, Alexis Georgeson, described the coming changes as a \u201cbig update\u201d and said the new Autopilot software would be released \u201cin the coming weeks.\u201dTesla says that even the current version of Autopilot is safe as long as drivers follow instructions and in-car warnings to keep their hands on the steering wheel and their eyes on the road.But the safety administration is looking into whether the fatal Tesla crash involved a safety defect. Ms. Georgeson said Tesla recently delivered a large batch of data that had been requested by the agency.How Tesla and G.M. responded to the separate incidents illustrates a contrast between traditional automakers and their long and sometimes painful histories of dealing with safety defects, and Tesla, the Silicon Valley upstart, with its heavy reliance on new technology and a determination to reinvent the way the car business operates.\u201cThere\u2019s a huge difference between the two companies,\u201d Ms. Krebs said. \u201cTesla hasn\u2019t been hammered by a major safety investigation and been fined. It\u2019s a young company and hasn\u2019t had a lot bad happen.\u201dSpurred by G.M.\u2019s ignition-switch crisis, Mary T. Barra, G.M.\u2019s chief executive, revamped the way the company handles safety complaints, with the goal of preventing them from getting lost in the global automaker\u2019s vast bureaucracy.All employees are now encouraged to report any safety concerns to a group of about 30 engineers located at the G.M. Technical Center in Warren, Mich. Reports can be made anonymously.This system, called Speak Up For Safety, is how the company learned about the 2014 fatality, according to a G.M. report to the safety administration. A G.M. investigator then retrieved data from the vehicle involved and contacted Delphi Automotive, the supplier of the module that detects when a crash is occurring and sets off the airbags.G.M. and Delphi reviewed data from other vehicles suspected of similar airbag problems and determined the module had a fault: Sometimes it would run a diagnostic test of itself, and during the testing period it became incapable of deploying the airbags.By August G.M. and Delphi were testing new software that fixed the problem, and on Aug. 31 safety executives at G.M. made the decision to issue the recall.\u201cThe system worked the way it was supposed to,\u201d Tom Wilkinson, a G.M. spokesman, said on Friday.An article on Saturday about the worldwide recall of 4.3 million General Motors vehicles to correct a software error that could prevent airbags from deploying in an accident misstated, in some editions, the details of a crash of a G.M. vehicle in which airbags failed to deploy. The crash, which G.M. safety engineers learned about in May, involved a 2014 model; the crash did not happen in 2014, and it did not result in a fatality. The article also misstated, in some editions, what G.M. said its airbag recall would cost. The $550 million figure in the article was an estimate of the cost of a separate recall involving Takata airbags; it was not an estimate of the cost of the new airbag recall.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How Did G.M. Create Tesla\u2019s Dream Car First?", "Date": "2016-09-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byState of the ArtRevolutionary technologies always start as impractical and expensive, Mr. Musk explained, so Tesla\u2019s first car would be a two-seat roadster that sold for $110,000. But by plowing profits from that car into research and production capacity, Mr. Musk promised that Tesla would quickly create a series of cheaper cars in higher volumes, all toward an almost mythical aim: creating a long-range electric car that could travel more than 200 miles on a single charge, but that cost less than $40,000 for the privilege.This year, Mr. Musk\u2019s white whale \u2014 a car that will get 238 miles per charge, and will sell for about $30,000 after a federal rebate \u2014 will finally make it to the roads. Mr. Musk\u2019s master plan has gone exactly as he promised, except for one tiny hitch.A first affordable long-range electric car, which I drove last month and which blew my mind, is not a Tesla. I had to fly from Silicon Valley to Detroit to drive it because the vehicle was invented not by a celebrated start-up, but by that hoariest clich\u00e9 of tarnished American manufacturing glory, Chevrolet, which is owned by General Motors.The Bolt is also proof that, in the car industry, size matters \u2014 that even if they may be slow to come around to the latest tech, big automakers can alter the car business even more radically than Tesla has, purely as a function of their bigness.But few industry analysts think Tesla will meet its production goals, and the very fact that there is a waiting list highlights its fundamental hardship. Tesla paved the way for the broad acceptability of electrics, but the Model 3 is, at this point, merely a concept car. G.M.\u2019s Bolt goes on sale this year, and the company will probably be able to make enough to satisfy everyone who wants one.It\u2019s a delicious irony: Cocky billionaire makes grand promises in a blog post. Ten years later, he gets his wish, in the worst way.Before we get to the Bolt\u2019s implications, let me describe the car. Most of the lower-priced fully electric cars on the road today \u2014 vehicles like the Nissan Leaf, the BMW i3 or Volkswagen e-Golf \u2014 are afflicted with a problem that is a nonstarter for many Americans. They get, at most, around 100 miles per charge. That is enough for a lot of people to get to work and back, but not enough to let them feel entirely comfortable about it.At the other end of the spectrum are Tesla\u2019s luxury rides, the Model S and Model X, which each get more than 200 miles per charge, enough to put to rest any range anxiety. But relief comes at a cost. After federal rebates, the S starts at $66,000, and the X starts at $74,000.The Bolt isn\u2019t a luxury car. It\u2019s surprisingly spacious inside (it could easily accommodate two car seats for my children) and has a nicely designed touch-screen infotainment panel. But it looks and largely drives like a generic compact car. What is revolutionary about the Bolt is that it bridges category distinctions \u2014 it brings luxury car electric range at mass-market prices. In fact, it beats the luxuries. In their cheapest configurations, every Tesla gets a lower range than the Bolt.\u201cNormally for electric vehicles we talk about going from point A to point B and back to A,\u201d said Darin Gesse, G.M.\u2019s product manager for the Bolt. \u201cThis car is designed to go from A to B to C to D and back to A, so it has more of a lifestyle focus, and it\u2019s not just a commuter car.\u201dMost of G.M.\u2019s advantages come down to size and operational efficiency. Tesla has had to build a huge factory to produce the Model 3\u2019s batteries at scale. G.M. batteries are being outsourced to the electronics giant LG Chem. Tesla has had to retool a car-making facility in Fremont, Calif., for its own purposes, while G.M. is tapping into its existing production system. At the company\u2019s Orion Assembly plant outside of Detroit, I saw Bolts on the same line as gas-powered Chevy Sonics and Buick Veranos. Robots and workers seamlessly shifted between the Bolt and more traditional cars as if nothing was different.Can Tesla compete with these advantages? Tesla fanboys (they exist) might point out that the Model 3 will have some luxury appointments that the Bolt lacks, including the option to upgrade to Tesla\u2019s semiautonomous driving system, and access to the company\u2019s network of quick-charging stations. Tesla also has brand cachet and exclusivity that elude Chevy. And when its battery factory is running at scale, it should be able to produce batteries at a lower price, bumping up its profitability.Tesla declined to comment for this article, but analysts I spoke to are skeptical of its plans. One question is whether Tesla will hit its production goals. The company made about 50,000 cars in 2015, and it is on track to produce about 82,000 this year, despite some recent setbacks.\u201cIf you don\u2019t have quality right, you start building cars really quickly, and then a defect happens, and you can\u2019t stop yourself from producing hundreds or thousands of defective vehicles,\u201d Mr. Niedermeyer said.\u201cWe have 108 years of manufacturing know-how,\u201d Pam Fletcher, G.M.\u2019s chief electric vehicles engineer, told me. \u201cThis is what we do.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Apple Is Said to Be Talking to Vehicle Technology Companies", "Date": "2016-09-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe tech giant has been talking with McLaren, the automaker known for its Formula One racecars, about an investment in the company, according to two people briefed on the talks who asked to remain anonymous because the discussions were confidential.Apple is also in talks with Lit Motors, a San Francisco start-up that has developed an electric self-balancing motorcycle, about a potential acquisition, according to three people who spoke on the condition of anonymity. Apple has already hired several former Lit Motors engineers.Even as many Silicon Valley companies, including Google, Tesla and Uber, have embarked on electric and driverless car initiatives, Apple has kept quiet. Yet internally, it has pursued a car project, called Project Titan, which has had ups and downs in leadership and direction. The layoffs at the project this month came after the appointment of an Apple veteran, Bob Mansfield, to take over the effort.Inside Apple, employees recently described the company\u2019s efforts to build a car as a project lacking vision and in complete disarray. The recent layoffs, followed by Apple\u2019s pursuit of talent and expertise from outside companies, are part of the company\u2019s effort to \u201creboot\u201d the project, said people with knowledge of the layoffs.Apple declined to comment, as did Lit Motors. Wayne Bruce, a spokesman for McLaren, said in an emailed statement that the company was \u201cnot in discussion with Apple in respect of any potential investment.\u201dBut McLaren did not deny having had conversations with Apple. In a phone call, Mr. Bruce added: \u201cThe nature of our business means we regularly have conversations with all sorts of parties, but those conversations remain confidential. We\u2019re not in a position to confirm or deny any previous conversation.\u201dA partnership with McLaren would allow Apple to tap into the carmaker\u2019s high-end automotive technology, forged by years of building Formula One racecars and selling sports cars topping $1 million.For years, McLaren has been recognized as an innovator in automotive technology. As one example, the company pioneered the use of a single device to control a car\u2019s engine, transmission and electrical systems.McLaren\u2019s sales are steadily growing, but the company\u2019s bet on research took a bite from its profit. In 2015, McLaren, which is backed by private shareholders, sold 1,654 cars, five more than the year before. Its profit slid 64 percent to about $7 million, from $19.4 million in 2014, in part because of increased spending on research.Unlike a more traditional automaker, McLaren does not have a large car production business to protect and could tap Apple\u2019s resources to make its technology available to the masses \u2014 if Apple decides to move forward with building its own automobile.An acquisition of Lit Motors could also help Apple rethink its strategy with building an electric car and bring engineering talent into the company.Mark Scott contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Coming Soon, Economists Hope: Big Spending on Roads, Bridges and Ports", "Date": "2016-09-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOAKLAND, Calif. \u2014 The docks at the Port of Oakland are a tangle of cranes, shipping containers, railroad tracks and snaking lines of trucks waiting to load and unload cargo.Streamlining this kind of traffic is one of the few ideas Donald J. Trump and Hillary Clinton agree on.Mr. Trump, taking a page from liberal economists, said he would fund his plan by borrowing several hundred billion dollars, but has offered no specifics. Mrs. Clinton\u2019s more detailed proposal, by contrast, would be paid for by a business tax overhaul aimed at collecting additional revenue from companies that have parked assets abroad.These are only plans, of course. Either would have to get through Congress and the inevitable acrimony over any proposal to raise taxes or add to the national debt.\u201cThe next administration will be in prime position to deliver on a comprehensive infrastructure plan,\u201d said Tom Jensen, vice president for transportation policy at UPS.Infrastructure spending, unlike many other forms of government outlays, holds the power to give the economy a sustained lift for decades down the line.First comes the addition of jobs \u2014 particularly the kinds of higher-wage blue-collar jobs that have been lost in recent years \u2014 and spending on products like concrete and steel to build new roads and repair worn-out bridges. After that initial jolt, the economy would continue to reap the important but harder-to-measure benefits of fewer delays, faster internet connections and more reliable power.You can see much of that here at one of the nation\u2019s busiest ports, an export hub that sends tons of important California products like Napa Valley wine, Central Valley almonds and Silicon Valley Teslas to China\u2019s growing middle class.In one of the few things they agree on, both Donald J. Trump and Hillary Clinton have said they would spend billions more on America\u2019s aging roads, bridges, hospitals, schools and public transportation systems.Aiming to gain other ports\u2019 market share, Oakland has embarked on a number of projects \u2014 some big, some small \u2014 to add cargo and speed things up. There are new traffic-reducing measures, such as an appointment system for trucks picking up cargo and extended hours at its largest terminal.It is also working on several infrastructure projects: This year, the port applied for a $140 million federal grant to build a bridge over a choked intersection where trucks waste time waiting for trains to pass. A half-mile away sit 14 new rail lines that are part of a new operation where shippers can transfer products from one container to another without leaving the port.Shipping companies often make these transfers at off-site warehouses \u2014 wasting more time and money. The Port of Oakland, which acts as a landlord, is hoping its investment will entice companies to move more cargo to its docks.This would not just give the port more rent. The economy would also gain additional jobs as private sector shippers added their own money to erect buildings near the port\u2019s rail connection, and fill them with machines.The federal government, with its wide latitude to spend on ambitious projects, is in a singular position to make investments no one else will.But the government\u2019s power to act has also set off a robust debate about how much more it should spend on infrastructure and how it should be funded. Spend too little, and the nation\u2019s backbone deteriorates and the cost of future repairs mounts. Spend too much too fast, and the government could crowd out private investment, possibly leading to higher inflation and pushing up interest rates.In a telephone interview, Mr. Summers laid out his case: The federal government can borrow at something like 1 percent interest a year, and through enhanced productivity it would reap something like 3 percent a year in higher tax receipts.\u201cI am as worried about the debt burden on my children\u2019s generation as anybody, but deferring maintenance on the foundation of our economy is a much greater risk to them,\u201d Mr. Summers said.Decades ago, the federal government spent big. The Interstate System of highways spawned new suburbs, and transportation grants helped build rail networks like the Bay Area Rapid Transit System, whose commuter trains hum past the Port of Oakland as they travel to and from San Francisco.Now the United States has more people and a bigger economy. But relative to its gross domestic product, the nation spends only about half as much on infrastructure as it did during the 1950s and \u201960s.The costs are substantial, if hard to see. Neglect the water system, and you may have leaky pipes and larger bills, or even lead contamination. Rough roads equal more flat tires. Substandard internet connections add to the isolation of rural communities.Each day, UPS drivers in northern New Jersey and New York City lose an average of 16 minutes \u2014 often much longer \u2014 to heavy traffic. Six years ago the company started dispatching an additional 61 drivers to make sure everyone hit their stops, and it would need more drivers if traffic got worse.Of course, even if tens of billions of dollars more were set aside for road improvements, that would not on its own guarantee that traffic congestion would ease. Infrastructure may be among the most bipartisan of federal spending areas, but politics in general can be a problem. One of the persistent criticisms from economists is federal lawmakers\u2019 tendency to spread cash across the country instead of focusing on places where the economic payoff would be greatest.An increase in infrastructure spending would still lift the economy, Mr. Winston said, \u201cbut my God, wouldn\u2019t it be so much better if we were more thoughtful about what we do with the money we have?\u201dThis, at least, is where the nation\u2019s D-plus grade turns out to be good news. Economists say infrastructure\u2019s productivity lift is greatest when investment is being raised from low levels. Put another way: The more broken down the nation becomes, the harder it is to find something that does not need to be fixed.\u201cWe\u2019re not talking about bridges to nowhere,\u201d Mr. Summers said. \u201cWe\u2019re talking about bridges that are on the verge of collapsing.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Apple Is Said to Be Rethinking Strategy on Self-Driving Cars", "Date": "2016-09-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Apple is rethinking what it plans to do about self-driving cars, just as other big tech companies appear ready to plow ahead with competing efforts.In a retrenchment of one of its most ambitious initiatives, Apple has shuttered parts of its self-driving car project and laid off dozens of employees, according to three people briefed on the move who were not allowed to speak about it publicly.The job cuts are the latest sign of trouble with Apple\u2019s car initiative. The company has added resources to the project \u2014 code-named Titan \u2014 over the last two years, but it has struggled to make progress. And in July, the company brought in Bob Mansfield, a highly regarded Apple veteran, to take over the effort.Apple is not the only big tech company pursuing autonomous driving technology. Alphabet, the parent company of Google, has tested self-driving cars on the road for years, but its focus has been on designing the underlying software and systems to make that technology work. Tesla has a self-driving feature within its cars that has come under scrutiny in recent months after a fatal accident was connected to its use.Separately, Uber, in a limited test in Pittsburgh next week, plans to start picking up passengers in self-driving cars. Last month, Uber also acquired the start-up Otto for about $700 million, a purchase that brought with it some of the top minds in robotics and autonomous technology.And automakers like Ford, General Motors and Fiat Chrysler have all said they expect to put a number of self-driving vehicles on the road in five years or less.But Apple has stood out from the others mainly \u2014 as is often the case with the company \u2014 for its secrecy. Apple has never acknowledged that it is working on a car, though Timothy D. Cook, Apple\u2019s chief executive, has said the automotive industry is undergoing a drastic change and, earlier this year, he seemed to confirm the existence of the car project at its annual shareholders meeting.\u201cDo you remember when you were a kid, and Christmas Eve, it was so exciting, you weren\u2019t sure what was going to be downstairs?\u201d Mr. Cook said at the meeting. \u201cWell, it\u2019s going to be Christmas Eve for a while.\u201dApple employees were told that the layoffs were part of a \u201creboot\u201d of the car project, the people briefed on it said. An Apple spokesman declined to comment.Electric cars rely not on the internal combustion engine, but on technologies more prevalent in the consumer electronics world: batteries, sensors and software. In addition, self-driving cars could change the traditional notions of public transportation and car ownership.Apple started looking seriously into building an electric car about two years ago. It expanded the project quickly, poaching experts in battery technology and so-called machine vision, as well as veterans from the automobile industry.The team also pulled in staff members from other divisions across Apple, growing to more than 1,000 employees in about 18 months. But as the project grew rapidly, it encountered a number of problems, and people working on it struggled to explain what Apple could bring to a self-driving car that other companies could not, according to the people briefed on the project.Steven Zadesky, a longtime Apple employee initially charged with heading the car effort, left the company for personal reasons this year. His departure opened the door for Mr. Mansfield, who worked closely with Apple\u2019s co-founder, Steve Jobs, but left the company\u2019s executive team in 2013.He had all but retired from Apple except for the occasional visit to the company\u2019s headquarters in Cupertino, Calif. He was coaxed into coming back to oversee the project, which could represent a new market for Apple as sales of its flagship iPhone are slowing.Apple has also made some headway in the space. The company has a number of fully autonomous vehicles in the middle of testing, using limited operating routes in a closed environment, according to people briefed on the company\u2019s plans. Like other companies in the space, that technology is likely a number of years away from seeing mainstream consumer use, they added.Katie Benner and Mike Isaac contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

The advertisements for sustainably grown marijuana on the sides of San Francisco buses. (\u201cThat\u2019s cannabis, the California way.\u201d) The comfort dogs on public transport and the woman who brought her dog to the Easter Sunday service.Blindingly white teeth. The burrito that was so huge it felt as if it would break my wrist. Police officers covered in tattoos.I left the United States when Ronald Reagan was president, so adjusting to life here involves more than just unlearning the metric system and remembering to put the month before the day when writing checks.I spend hours in supermarket aisles. Organic ice cream sandwiches! Vegan shoes! A \u201cBluetooth compatible\u201d electric toothbrush!The America of 2016 is so much more specialized than the one I left in 1988. It almost seems that we have created needs so that we can cater to them.The Bay Area is, of course, the world\u2019s laboratory for new technology. I tend to meet people finding solutions for problems I never knew we had. A woman told me she was developing an algorithm that would determine what kind of books a child might want to read.Everyone keeps offering me credit in America. I drove away from a dealer with a brand-new $30,000 car without handing over a penny. It was so thrilling that I keep repeating this routine. I bought a Vespa. Why not? At 2 percent interest the money seemed almost free. Then I bought shopping carts full of home improvement materials at Home Depot and was told I didn\u2019t have to pay for them for two years.Someone needs to tell Equifax to decline my next credit application. This could end in penury.Of course some of what I\u2019ve encountered has been less alluring. During all my years in Asia I constantly grappled with the perniciousness of poverty. Yet somehow I was unprepared for the scale and severity of homelessness in San Francisco.The juxtaposition of the silent whir of sleek Tesla electric vehicles, with the outbursts of the mentally ill on the sidewalks. Destitution clashing with high technology. Well-dressed tourists sharing the pavement with vaguely human forms inside cardboard boxes.I\u2019m confounded how to explain to my two children why a wealthy society allows its most vulnerable citizens to languish on the streets. My son, when he first encountered a homeless man, asked why no one \u201cwanted to adopt him.\u201dIt seems a terrible statement about my home country that my children will encounter homelessness and mental illness much more vividly in the wealthiest nation in the world than they did in Thailand, where we previously lived.During a trip back to Bangkok I spoke about this paradox with Nopphan Phromsri, the secretary general of the Human Settlement Foundation, an organization that assists the homeless there.Greater Bangkok, a sprawling metropolis with more than 10 million people, has 1,300 homeless people, a survey this year found.San Francisco has less than one-tenth Bangkok\u2019s population but six times as many homeless people. I\u2019m sure you could fill a book with the reasons for this. Ms. Nopphan believes that homelessness is more intractable in rich societies. \u201cIn wealthy countries there are systems for everything,\u201d she said. \u201cYou\u2019re either in the system or out of the system.\u201d There is no in-between in America. In Bangkok, by contrast, rich and poor coexist. There are vast tracts of cheap, makeshift homes and a countryside where people in the cities can return to if they lose their jobs or hit hard times.On most days Asia feels very far away.But a few weeks ago I had an odd flash of connection with my old life, during a visit to Walmart. Something about the cavernous warehouse roof, the grid of fluorescent lighting and the austere, sterile design brought on a sense of familiarity. It struck me that the ordered rows in Walmart didn\u2019t look that dissimilar to the factories in Asia where most of these products came from.I found myself staring at details \u2014 the laces on the construction boots, the hints of glue holding together soccer balls, the knots on the drawstring of a sack holding a portable chair.It was as if there was a symmetry across the Pacific between the producers and the consumers, between the factory and the cash register.Advertisement"}

It is an annual holiday for the programs \u2014 and their fans.Jahsen Wint, a standout linebacker at Erasmus Hall High School in the Flatbush section of Brooklyn, signed his official letter of intent to play football at Ohio State, which won the most recent of its eight national championships in 2014.It was the culmination of years of hard work and sacrifice by Wint, who had moved out of his mother\u2019s home to pursue a scholarship. And it was the beginning of a new journey that will take him even farther from home.In early October, the former Ohio State defensive coordinator Chris Ash had come to an Erasmus Hall practice in Midwood to observe Wint in drills led by his coach to determine whether he could play safety for a major college program. Before then, Wint had few Division I scholarship offers and had orally committed to Temple University.\u201cI didn\u2019t think a school like that would come all the way to Brooklyn, to come see me,\u201d Wint, 18, said. \u201cIt was nerve-racking because the way I performed that day would determine whether I would go here or not \u2014 or get the offer.\u201dDiana Wint, Jahsen\u2019s aunt, cares little about football. But she was the one who signed him up for youth football while he was in elementary school, hoping it would be an outlet for his aggression.When the college recruiting letters started appearing in his mailbox as a sophomore, Jahsen decided to move in with his aunt, as well as her husband and young daughter, at their home in a quiet part of Canarsie. It was a difficult decision that meant leaving his mother and siblings behind in Brownsville, but he knew it would put him in a better environment to focus on preparing for college.It fell to Diana to teach her nephew how to drive. She shrieked from the back seat of her BMW coupe as he peeled out down Avenue J. He giggled at his aunt\u2019s anxiety.When he finally slowed down, she said, \u201cYou\u2019re giving me palpitations.\u201dIn Wint\u2019s bedroom, a friend took the braids out of his hair, a ritual that doubles as something like meditation.\u201cMy time to think,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t even know how to explain it, it\u2019s just soothing.\u201dCanarsie \u2014 out past the end of the L line and far removed from the city life of Manhattan \u2014 is a largely Caribbean neighborhood that can feel like a small town. For Wint and his nearly inseparable group of friends \u2014 Darren Wesley, Mario Ramos and his cousin Kelvin Hendy \u2014 life mostly consisted of bouncing from house to house to play video games, going to the park to play football and basketball, and hanging out at restaurants in the neighborhood.Nearly every day after school, Wint rode the bus from Flatbush to Pacplex, a multipurpose athletic center on the Canarsie waterfront. Throughout high school, he took part in a program, Prototype, intended to train young football players aiming for college scholarships.Once he had committed to the Buckeyes, his workouts changed. He undertook a weight lifting program based on the guidance of the Ohio State staff. He worked with a private trainer to learn the fundamentals of playing safety. And, frequently, he went just to play football with his friends on the indoor soccer field.When he returned home after workouts, dinner often consisted of takeout chicken wings and french fries from a nearby Chinese restaurant. Sometimes there was a microwaved bowl of Jamaican porridge that he kept in a special container.Competition defines Wint\u2019s life, and prom was no different. He and his friends long anticipated the chance to see who could wear the most extravagant tuxedo and ride in the most luxurious car. Wint had already moved to Columbus, Ohio, by the day of the dance but flew home to Brooklyn just to attend \u2014 in a tuxedo with a striking floral print jacket. \u201cI wanted something to attract people,\u201d Wint said. \u201cI wanted to show different emotions.\u201dHe rode with his girlfriend, Sydney Stewart, through the Brooklyn evening in a rented Tesla Model S sedan. \u201cA day to remember,\u201d Wint said.On June 1, a couple of days before Wint left for Ohio, his family and friends held a surprise going-away party at his aunt\u2019s home. There was pizza, a mix of rap and Caribbean music, a sparkling cider toast to his future, and a cake decorated to look like Ohio State\u2019s field. As Wint cut the cake, his mother, Claudette Ramos-McKoy, captured the moment on her phone.Days later, as Wint walked through Ohio State\u2019s enormous indoor practice facility with his family, he said he felt a sense of vindication. \u201cI didn\u2019t waste my time,\u201d he said. \u201cI didn\u2019t leave my mom\u2019s house for no reason.\u201dIn Ohio State\u2019s opener, a 77-10 thrashing of Bowling Green, Wint had played on special teams. But he did not get on the field at all in the second game, against Tulsa \u2014 a game the Buckeyes won, 48-3.\u201cIt\u2019s hard because you come from being the man,\u201d Wint said. \u201cNow you\u2019re back to square one.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "To the Moon, North Korea? Or Does a Rocket Have a Darker Aim?", "Date": "2016-09-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Kim Jong-un is headed to the moon.That, at least, is one of the official North Korean explanations for the testing last week of a rocket engine that, if as powerful as the North claims, would rival the commercial rockets that Jeff Bezos and Elon Musk, of Amazon and Tesla, now use in their aerospace companies to fire payloads into space.Inside the United States\u2019 intelligence agencies, though, there is considerable skepticism that North Korea is truly eager to plant a flag on the lunar landscape. The agencies are exploring another explanation: that Mr. Kim, the North Korean leader, is racing ahead, as the United States is distracted by a bruising presidential election, to develop a way for his growing arsenal of nuclear weapons to reach New York and Washington.The Obama administration has responded to North Korea\u2019s nuclear and missile tests with gradually escalating sanctions, mostly through the United Nations. But on Monday it went a step farther, announcing criminal charges and Treasury Department sanctions against four Chinese individuals and a company that it said engaged in money laundering to help the North\u2019s programs for weapons of mass destruction.The sanctions were against the Dandong Hongxiang Industrial Development Company and its primary owner, Ma Xiaohong, who lives near the North Korean border.Few threats as urgent as the dramatic escalation of North Korea\u2019s nuclear and missile programs are likely to confront Hillary Clinton or Donald J. Trump as president. An engine that delivers 80 tons of thrust would have about three times the power of an advanced North Korean rocket shown in a ground test in April, though it is not possible to verify the North\u2019s claims. By most unclassified estimates, it will take North Korea perhaps five years to marry its missile advances with a weapon small enough and strong enough to survive the stresses of re-entering the atmosphere atop an intercontinental ballistic missile.So far, Mr. Kim\u2019s engineers have never executed a military test flight that could reach beyond the middle of the Pacific, though in a statement on Friday, the North threatened to attack Guam, home of the American B-1 bombers that conducted simulated runs last week over the Korean Peninsula.The Obama administration has not sought sanctions, knowing they would be vetoed by Russia and China, nor has it said much in public about the details of the cooperation on the new rocket engine. There is a long history of sharing missile technology, but no persuasive evidence exists that the Iranians have been involved in the North\u2019s nuclear weapons tests.The moonshot talk may be aspirational, but it is not lunacy. Rocket experts say four of the new North Korean engines, clustered at the base of a space vehicle, would be powerful enough to hurl a no-frills payload to the moon. But the North would have to master many other technologies before even an unmanned vehicle could be landed there.\u201cEven though the U.S. and its allies try to block our space development, our aerospace scientists will conquer space and definitely plant the flag of the D.P.R.K. on the moon,\u201d he said, using the abbreviation for the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea.Whatever the goal, the most important aspect of the new North Korean engine is that its design appears to be indigenous, rather than a knockoff of decades-old Soviet missiles. That suggests a growing domestic ability, which may explain the appeal to Iran, which intelligence officials speculate may be helping to fund the effort.\u201cIt\u2019s like nothing we\u2019ve seen before,\u201d John Schilling, an expert on North Korea\u2019s missile program at 38 North, a blog and think tank of the Johns Hopkins University School of Advanced International Studies, said of the powerful new engine. \u201cIt\u2019s somewhat frightening that they have this capability, but somewhat encouraging that they want to use it for space launching.\u201dHistory shows that any strides in rocketry, no matter what the claimed purpose, can aid both civil and military programs. \u201cThat\u2019s what the United States did,\u201d said David Rothkopf, who has written two histories of the National Security Council. \u201cIt\u2019s what the Russians did. It\u2019s what the Chinese did. Why not the North Koreans?\u201dAmerican officials would not publicly say that the program referred to in the Treasury sanctions was the same one that resulted in last week\u2019s test. But there was no other logical conclusion.The announcement identified \u201cIranian missile technicians\u201d from companies working for Iran\u2019s Ministry of Defense for Armed Forces Logistics. It said that two of them, Seyed Mirahmad Nooshin and Sayyed Medhi Farahi, \u201chave been critical to the development of the 80-ton rocket booster, and both traveled to Pyongyang during contract negotiations.\u201dDr. Schilling said the big new engine seemed more suited to launching satellites and space probes than warheads. The North Korean military is known to prefer missiles small enough to transport on trucks, haul on back roads and hide in tunnels.But the North is also highly aware that its launching failures in past years have become the stuff of ridicule on the internet, making it easy to dismiss the program. It seems to be looking for something that would create at least the impression that it will not take long for it to fly to the moon or strike any part of the United States.\u201cYou cluster four of them together, and that\u2019s a very healthy ICBM,\u201d Jeffrey Lewis, a North Korea specialist at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies in Monterey, Calif., said of the new engine.Of course, moving from a static engine test to a cross-Pacific flight test would take considerable time, and the rocket would be a giant sitting duck for American targeting on the launchpad.One possibility is that the North is trying to replicate elements of the American \u201ctriad\u201d \u2014 the creation of a nuclear arsenal that can be delivered by aircraft, from ground-based silos and from submarines.The North Koreans may be thinking, \u201cWhy not have everything?\u201d Dr. Lewis said.David C. Wright, a senior scientist at the Union of Concerned Scientists, a Cambridge, Mass., group that monitors proliferation, also argued that North Korea\u2019s advance could well end up powering ICBMs from deep silos.He noted that the high power of the new North Korean engine was similar to one that Chinese scientists developed to power that nation\u2019s first long-range missile.\u201cWho knows what North Korea might want to do?\u201d Dr. Wright said. \u201cAt this point, I don\u2019t think we can take an ICBM off the table.\u201dDavid E.

{"Headline": "Ford\u2019s Driverless Car Plan: Embrace Tech and Go Slow", "Date": "2016-09-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDEARBORN, Mich. \u2014 Raj Nair, the development chief leading Ford Motor\u2019s effort to build self-driving cars, concedes that he does not know what caused the fatal May accident in which the driver of a Tesla Model S sedan, operating in Autopilot mode, crashed into a tractor-trailer crossing a roadway in Florida.But Mr. Nair has given considerable thought to the circumstances \u2014 a truck turning left into traffic and a partially automated vehicle traveling at highway speed, leaving little room for miscalculation. He has pictured the car\u2019s camera looking ahead and struggling to make out a white truck against an overcast sky, its forward-looking radar beam possibly shooting under the truck\u2019s trailer.The conclusion he has drawn: The current state of even semiautonomous driving technology isn\u2019t quite ready to take on such a complex traffic situation. That is why Ford, which on Monday demonstrated its own approach to self-driving vehicles, said it was convinced by its decade of research to take a go-slow approach.\u201cWe\u2019ve not been able to do that with cameras and radar,\u201d Mr. Nair said of Autopilot. \u201cNot to the safety level we would be comfortable for introducing that into production.\u201dThe company provided the first public demonstration of the fleet of self-driving cars it is building at its sprawling engineering campus here, about 10 miles west of Detroit. Ford allowed reporters, analysts and other guests to take a ride in some of the 10 white Fusion sedans it has outfitted so far with tens of thousands of dollars\u2019 worth of radar; lidar, a kind of radar based on laser beams; cameras; computer chips and other gear.Mr. Nair on Monday acknowledged that systems like Autopilot that use radar and cameras \u201ccertainly have prevented accidents.\u201dDespite their multitude of sensors and processors, autonomous cars have a lot of trouble with some everyday aspects of driving.But before cars can take over most of the driving for humans, more is needed, in Mr. Nair\u2019s view. That in particular includes lidar and high-definition digital maps that will help automated cars distinguish between overhead signs and an obstacle such as a tractor-trailer. Neither of those technologies are available with Tesla\u2019s system.\u201cWe believe lidar and a high-definition map are required,\u201d Mr. Nair said.During Monday\u2019s demonstrations, while Ford engineers sat in the driver\u2019s seat with hands off the steering wheel and feet off the pedals, the cars piloted themselves over a short, 10-minute loop, stopping when necessary for pedestrians, stop lights and intersections.During this reporter\u2019s demonstration ride, the Fusion came to a stop at a crosswalk. After a group of pedestrians had passed, the car began to edge forward but then hit its brakes again. Well off to the left, perhaps 10 feet from the crosswalk, a straggler was hurrying to catch up to the group. The car\u2019s lidar had spotted the man and the car sensed he was likely to dart into the road \u2014 and he did.\u201cThat\u2019s the benefit of lidar,\u201d said James McBride, a Ford engineer. Since radar looks forward, it might not notice a potential obstacle like a pedestrian entering from the side. But lidar scans across a wide field of vision, and is capable of picking up key details of an object, not just its shape, Mr. McBride said.\u201cLidar can make out the fingers on a pedestrian\u2019s hand,\u201d he said.Google, too, is incorporating lidar into its self-driving cars.The Ford cars used in the demonstration were outfitted with bulky lidar systems mounted on their roofs. Within about a month, though, the company plans to assemble self-driving Fusions with two lidar units that will be slightly larger than hockey pucks.Ford expects its experimental fleet of self-driving cars to grow to 30 by the end of the year, and it expects to have three times that number by the end of 2017.By 2021, the company has vowed to start production of a driverless car, with no steering wheel, and have it in use by a ride-hailing company in an Uber-like service.Advertisement"}
